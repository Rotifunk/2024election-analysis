"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared Wednesday that North Korea is “no longer a nuclear threat” to the United States even though the two sides had yet to forge a concrete disarmament plan and offered incomplete accounts of what they agreed to during this week’s summit meeting in Singapore. Rejoicing in the glow of a historic encounter, Mr. Trump returned to Washington and portrayed his agreement with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as a signal achievement that meant that the outcast state was no longer the United States’ most dangerous problem. But the path to disarmament remained no clearer a day after the meeting. North Korea’s state-controlled news media described a step-by-step process to dismantle its nuclear weapons, with the United States rewarding it at each stage, something Mr. Trump has seemed to reject in the past. Mr. Trump’s team insisted that North Korea had agreed to an intrusive inspection regime even though Pyongyang made no mention of that. The confusion stemmed from a joint statement that was long on lofty language and short on specifics. Signed Tuesday with a flourish by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the statement offered more aspiration than action, clocking in at only 391 words. Mr. Trump was hardly sweating the details, however, convinced that his meeting with Mr. Kim, the first between leaders of their two countries, had transformed the relationship and ended an era of hostility and mutual threats of destruction. “Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,” he wrote on Twitter. “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Was Outfoxed in Singapore” (column, June 13): I usually agree with Nicholas Kristof on almost anything he writes about, but I’m not in full agreement here. The main narrative in most articles in The Times is that President Trump got played, making major concessions with virtually nothing in return. However, that’s not quite true. Even though the agreement that Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un signed lacks specifics on implementation, it does set forth basic principles of what the two nations are aiming for. Yes, Mr. Kim can play this false, as every other North Korean dictator has, but it certainly sets the stage for further discussions on the technical issues. I firmly do not like President Trump and hope he gets impeached, but I’m willing to admit that if he actually pulls this off, it is a worthwhile achievement and should be supported. Don’t forget that Mr. Trump said the United States is not removing any sanctions until there is a verifiable, significant dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. I say stay this course and see what happens. BARRY FISHER, COSTA MESA, CALIF. To the Editor: North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, runs one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world with an iron fist. He recklessly shoots test missiles over Japan and has threatened to destroy the United States with nuclear weapons. He buys luxurious items for himself and his cronies while much of his population is starving. He has imprisoned over 200,000 of his own people in horrific work camps, with many subjected to hard labor, malnourished and tortured. He has brutally killed his own relatives, including his half-brother, to secure power and has harshly treated Americans and other foreigners in captivity — who were often arrested for minor offenses — causing the death of at least one American.

"For several years, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Timothy Draper has sought to break up California, citing its unwieldy size as damaging to the state’s schools, livability and the economy. In November, California residents will get their chance to vote on his latest proposal: to divide the world’s fifth-largest economy into three separate states. Mr. Draper, who made his fortune investing in start-up companies, is proposing that the state of 40 million people be split into three entities with roughly the same populations. Northern California would comprise the upper part of the state, including Silicon Valley and San Francisco; Southern California would include a vast swath of the inland’s verdant farmland, stretching to San Diego; a third state, simply called California, would hug the coastline from Monterey to Los Angeles. If Californians approve the controversial ballot measure, which academics and others say faces many obstacles, it would still need the blessing of the California Legislature and the United States Congress. Politicians, for one, may be wary of splitting up a state that has long voted Democrat. Vikram Amar, a professor and dean of the College of Law at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, said California’s conservative-leaning inland empire (which would be part of the new Southern California) could swing Republican. “That is a risk Democrats in California and Washington, D.C., will be loath to run,” he said. Californians have long debated whether they were better as a whole or in parts. In 1941, a group of secessionists along the border of Northern California and Southern Oregon proposed creating a new state called “Jefferson.” It was called the “Yreka Rebellion” then, and was initially dismissed as a publicity stunt. It gained momentum as rural voters sought autonomy from their urban counterparts, a common refrain among Californians. "
"PARIS — A boat crowded with hundreds of Africans sailing across the Mediterranean after being turned away by Italy this week has exposed anew the shaky fault lines in Europe’s approach to the migrant crisis. On Sunday, Italy’s new far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, ordered the Aquarius, a rescue ship operated by humanitarian groups, to stop 35 nautical miles off the coast of Italy, refusing to let it dock. The ship is now on its way to Spain, which showed up its neighbors by solemnly announcing that it would “respect its international engagements” and accept the boat after Malta, too, refused it, and France stood idly by. Brussels, the seat of the European Union, looked on in relative silence. There was no common policy to receive the Aquarius and no authority to impose one if there were. The imbroglio was “symptomatic of the lack of coordination of a managed migration policy at the European Union level,” said Imogen Sudbery of the International Rescue Committee in Brussels. The Italian refusal to offer safe harbor to a ship loaded with what aid groups described as 629 migrants — including 123 minors, 11 small children and seven pregnant women — was intended to underscore a long-simmering grievance.

"To the Editor: Re “Voters in G.O.P. Punish Criticism of the President” (front page, June 13): So now it is not enough to vote for President Trump’s policies, as Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina has mostly done. He has also dared to criticize the president’s outrageous behavior, and that is no longer permissible. His opponent attacked him for “bashing our captain.” Mr. Trump is now fully unleashed, and the parallels with authoritarian leaders grow apace. The “cult of personality,” in Mr. Sanford’s words, that is dominating the Republican Party is fully formed. I am very scared. JANICE GEWIRTZ

"WASHINGTON — The White House’s guest list last week for President Trump’s first dinner celebrating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan included a who’s who of diplomats from the Middle East. But the event turned out to be more notable for who apparently was not there: representatives from Muslim American groups. The night highlighted a paradox of Mr. Trump’s presidency. While he has sought to ally himself with Middle Eastern leaders, in part by at times softening his hostile tone on Islam, at home Mr. Trump has seemingly made little attempt to repair his fractured relationship with Muslim Americans — even those in his own party. Saba Ahmed, the president of the Republican Muslim Coalition and a Trump supporter, said that at the outset of the presidency, there was a “complete shutdown of engagement” with Muslim Americans. “It was quite a challenge” to work with Mr. Trump’s campaign staff, Ms. Ahmed said. “Even for the Republican Muslims who campaigned for him and helped him.” The reinstatement of the dinner, which has been hosted by three previous presidents, and the departures of some staff members with hard-line views on Islam have left her optimistic that the White House will grant more access to its Muslim supporters. “They have tarnished the image of Islam and Muslims, but I do think he is concerned about American Muslims,” Ms. Ahmed said. “The fact that he’s coming around, that he hosted the dinner, gives me a lot of hope.” "
"Archie Parnell, a Democratic House candidate who lost the support of his party after he admitted to physically abusing his ex-wife in the 1970s, handily won a primary in South Carolina on Tuesday. Mr. Parnell rose to national attention last year when he came within a hair’s breadth of winning a special election to replace Representative Mick Mulvaney in the state’s deep red Fifth District. Mr. Mulvaney left Congress in 2017 to serve as President Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget. On Tuesday, Mr. Parnell won 60 percent of the vote according to The Associated Press, easily beating three lesser known primary opponents with not as much name recognition. He will now mount another campaign against Representative Ralph Norman, the Republican who beat him in the special election last year. [Here are three key takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries.] Mr. Norman’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. In a statement posted to Facebook on Wednesday morning, Mr. Parnell said the result had left him “deeply honored and humbled.” “Tonight, the people sent a clear message to everyone,” he wrote. “You don’t have to be defined by your worst mistake. You don’t have to be cast aside. You are not alone. You can be better. And, together, we can be better.” "
"MEXICO CITY — The subtext was hard to miss. On Wednesday morning, soon after the announcement that the United States, Mexico and Canada had won the vote to be joint hosts of the 2026 World Cup, President Enrique Peña Nieto posted a video on Twitter celebrating the news. Standing in front of the presidential residence, Los Pinos, he pointed out that Mexico would become the first country to host three World Cups. He extolled the virtues of Mexico as a tourist destination, including its beaches, archaeological sites and “hospitable and warm people.” And he zeroed in on a concept that has been evasive of late in the bilateral relationship with the United States. “We’re deeply unified,” he said, of the three host countries. “Congratulations for being hosts together.” He emphasized the word “together” by clenching his fist. Mr. Peña Nieto made no mention of President Trump. But the American president could not have been far from his mind. These have been trying times for the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and the World Cup, a magnificently complicated undertaking, would seem to impose an additional test. "

"A federal judge’s ruling on Tuesday to greenlight the merger between AT&T and Time Warner is a big boost to the competitiveness of the American economy and an even bigger win for consumers and shareholders. The decision was also a total slapdown of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, which sees monopoly bogeymen around every corner. The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge’s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government’s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries. The government’s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don’t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called “horizontal” mergers, in which companies in the same line of business — two airlines, for example — want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders. The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs — such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government’s lawyers argued that consumers’ cable bills would go up if the merger went through. The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of “watching TV” is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don’t even own TVs. They watch “Game of Thrones” on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite “channels” is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department? "
"Ivana Trump was back at the Plaza Hotel on Tuesday, the hotel where she once had a say over everything from the wallpaper to the chandeliers, back when she was married to Donald J. Trump. But that was long ago. Now, she had come to promote a diet that promises followers they can “eat pasta, cookies and lose weight.” It was Ms. Trump who gave Mr. Trump a definite article — she put the “the” in “the Donald” — long before he had a job that came with one, as the president. On Tuesday, as reporters crowded around her at the Plaza, she was asked how often she talks to her ex-husband. “I’m really not going to go into politics,” she said, “but we speak.” But later, when she was asked how she thought he had done at the summit meeting on North Korea, she said, “He did great.” But about that diet. It is the brainchild of Gianluca Mech. He is an Italian businessman perhaps best known for spending $200,000 to recreate, for one night last year, the Brooklyn discothèque where “Saturday Night Fever,” the 1977 homage to the bell-bottoms-and-disco-ball era, was filmed. He is extremely thin, although he said his father was obese. His “Italiano Diet” offers specially formulated low-calorie, low-carbohydrate packaged meals. There are $20 cookies dipped in dark chocolate, $24 crunchy bars with strawberries and raspberries and, for $14, fusilli pasta. Ms. Trump, who once appeared in commercials for Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, said she agreed to talk up the Italiano Diet because “obesity is like a calamity in America,” although she said that she herself did not need to shed pounds.

"WASHINGTON — In the latest sign of the Trump administration’s outreach to religious conservatives ahead of a critical midterm election, Vice President Mike Pence told a large gathering of pastors Wednesday that the White House would continue to fight for evangelical priorities. He appealed for the community’s continued support, even as his appearance led to complaints that a religious event was being used for political gain. “This is a pivotal year in the life of our nation,” Mr. Pence told the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, where nearly 10,000 evangelical pastors gathered in Dallas. “Be assured of this, President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for what we know is right.” Mr. Pence recited a list of Trump administration actions that appealed to the conservative evangelical community, which constitutes one of the president’s biggest blocs of supporters. Among the accomplishments he cited were the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court; advancing anti-abortion priorities across the government; opening an American embassy in Jerusalem; passing tax reform; and freeing Christian hostages from North Korea. “This progress,” Mr. Pence said, “is the result of the support of men and women like so many of you, who supported our president not only in 2016 but every day since.” The Southern Baptist Convention’s annual gathering in June draws thousands of evangelical influencers from across the country, presenting a rich opportunity for the administration to reach one of its most supportive voter bases. More than 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence in 2016, and Southern Baptist churches have more than 15 million members. While the convention has at times had Republican leaders speak, its stated purpose is to focus on evangelism and missionary work. But Mr. Pence mentioned “the president” more than three dozen times in his 30 minute speech. "
"WASHINGTON — They have issued concerned news releases and sent solemn tweets. But when it came time to stand up to President Trump on tariffs this week, Senate Republicans took a pass, casting aside the party’s long-held commitment to free trade for fear of poking the bear. At least that is how Senator Bob Corker interpreted the outcome of the intraparty fight over how to combat Mr. Trump’s protectionist policies. “Gosh, we might poke the bear,” Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is retiring, said with fake outrage as he laced into his colleagues for disavowing their beliefs on trade because they are scared of the president and the prospect of losing power. The decision by Republican leaders this week to block a vote on Mr. Corker’s amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would have required the president to get congressional approval to impose tariffs on national security grounds was something of a watershed. Republican leaders maintained that the measure would have created procedural issues that could jeopardize the underlying defense policy bill. They privately called Mr. Corker’s reaction hyperbolic, and other Republicans said they would continue to make their differences with the president clear. But the amendment’s defeat, without a vote tallied, was a setback for a core Republican principle, and it played out in public on the Senate floor, underscoring just how far most congressional Republicans would go to avoid confronting Mr. Trump ahead of the November midterm elections. The increasingly lonely forces of opposition within the party are coming from those who are leaving politics or those in the chattering classes safely removed from a Republican electorate overwhelmingly aligned with the president. “There’s no question that leadership in general is wary of doing anything that might upset the president,” Mr. Corker said on Wednesday, describing his party’s following of Mr. Trump as “cultish.” "
"WASHINGTON — A former top staff member of the Senate Intelligence Committee pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with reporters, and his defense lawyer accused the Justice Department and President Trump of making inappropriate comments about the case that could poison the jury pool. The former staff member, James A. Wolfe, appeared before a magistrate judge at the federal courthouse blocks from the Senate office building where he used to work. Mr. Wolfe was indicted last week on three counts of lying to F.B.I. agents working on a leak investigation, but has not been charged with unlawfully disclosing classified information. At the hearing, prosecutors told Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson that they had no objections to letting him remain free for now without posting a bond, but asked for several conditions, including restricting his travel. Mr. Wolfe had surrendered his passport after he made an initial appearance this week at a courthouse in Maryland. Mr. Wolfe showed no emotion as he sat in the courtroom, occasionally rising to briefly address Judge Robinson. He left most of the speaking to one of his defense lawyers, Preston Burton, who entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Mr. Burton also sharply criticized government officials — including Mr. Trump — for making statements that he suggested impugned his client’s character by implying that Mr. Wolfe had illegally leaked national security secrets. Two of the three charges against Mr. Wolfe related to allegations that he told reporters nonpublic information that he had learned as a result of his role as a staff member of the Intelligence Committee. But none of the false statement charges accuse Mr. Wolfe of leaking classified information. "
"HOUSTON — It is unusual for the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia to see eye-to-eye, much less try to achieve common energy policy goals, even indirectly. But that is what seems to be happening, and it is taking the edge off the yearlong rise in oil and gasoline prices. Even if those countries have their own reasons for welcoming the surge in production, it is also reducing the influence of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which will meet in Vienna next week to discuss production cuts put in place in early 2017. The cheerleader, if not the ringmaster, in this effort is President Trump, who took to Twitter on Wednesday to criticize OPEC for high crude prices. “Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again,” he wrote in his second such statement since April. “Not good.” Whatever happens at the OPEC meeting, two of the biggest players in the global oil market — Saudi Arabia and Russia — appear to have already calculated that it is in their immediate interest to crank up production, effectively sidelining the Saudis’ fellow cartel members. Between them, the two countries have already each added more than 100,000 barrels a day to global oil supplies. Mr. Trump wants even more crude sloshing around the market to tamp down energy prices ahead of the congressional elections in November, and it looks like he may well get it. "

__________ Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made comments on Wednesday that are likely to go down well with supporters of President Trump’s increasingly belligerent trade policies. At the news conference after the Fed’s two-day meeting, a reporter asked Mr. Powell whether the escalating trade tensions were a risk to the United States economy and whether they might be having an impact on the investment decisions of companies. Mr. Powell said Fed officials had picked up on rising concerns about trade among business executives, and he said there were reports of companies holding off on investments. But Mr. Powell seemed to go out of his way to emphasize that there was no evidence that the trade frictions were weighing on corporate behavior. He said: Of course, Mr. Powell may have gotten carried away when he gave his response. But he said more or less the same thing minutes later. Mr. Powell is probably right that economic data shows no evidence that fears of a trade war are damping activity. But top Fed officials are often more circumspect when discussing threats to the economy, especially those that could soon become real. This Friday, the Trump administration is scheduled to announce a final list of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, and impose them shortly after. China has said it will retaliate. "

"MOSCOW — Back when it sought the right to host the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament, Russia framed its bid as part of a concerted effort to transform its post-Soviet self into a modern, model global citizen. A female Olympic pole vault champion wooed the International Football Association by urging it to “help shape the future of Russia,” while a deputy prime minister said holding the championship would speed his country toward becoming “a completely different nation” whose people “will be brothers and sisters to the whole family of the world.” That was in December 2010. Then Russia proved that it harbored a rather different idea of brotherhood: annexing Crimea, backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, providing the missile battery that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and propping up a bloody dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. Various Kremlin critics abroad died or fell ill under mysterious circumstances, while scores of activists at home were either jailed or their organizations were shuttered. Russia made “gay propaganda” illegal and weaponized social media to meddle in Western elections. In short, when President Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, he abandoned the quest for admission to the global fraternity of dominant states. Instead, he contrived to seize a spot through his own devices. “We are not aspiring to be a globalized nation, that is gone,” said Vladimir Frolov, an independent foreign policy analyst, ‘‘Russia’s foreign policy strategy is to be a cat who walks by himself.” Russia still feels compelled, however, to try repeatedly to prove that it has great-power credibility. It cannot do it militarily — short of flexing its nuclear weapons — nor financially after four years of drifting in economic irons despite a recent buoyancy in oil prices. Major sporting events offer one plausible substitute, including the World Cup, which begins on Thursday. "

"LOS ANGELES — Antonio R. Villaraigosa was the high-riding mayor of this city for eight years. His election as its first Latino chief executive in modern times was an electrifying moment. Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat, has over the years expressed high ambitions for his future: a cabinet secretary in a Hillary Clinton White House. Governor of California. A next-generation leader for Latinos across the nation. But Mr. Villaraigosa saw those ambitions dashed last week in a dispiriting third-place finish in the primary for governor of California, a showing that not only eliminated him from contention for that office — but probably, as he acknowledged in a ruminative interview at his home in the Hollywood Hills on Wednesday, from elected life. He drew just 13 percent of the vote after a campaign calling for California to confront an economic divide that he warned threatened its future. It was a stunningly poor showing given the arc of his career: City Council, State Assembly, Assembly speaker, mayor, chairman of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. And it came even after charter school advocates financed a $23 million independent campaign on his behalf. “My message resonated in areas where people are struggling — it didn’t resonate where people are doing well,” Mr. Villaraigosa said, sitting at a dining room table in his home, near wraparound windows that offered views of the Hollywood sign, downtown Los Angeles, the Pacific Ocean and Griffith Park. “I understand Latinos voted two to one for me. They just didn’t come out in big numbers.” He faced, he said, considerable hurdles, some his own making, from the moment he decided to run to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat. “Look, I’ve been out of office for five years,” he said, after using his phone to adjust the volume of the jazzy music coming from hidden speakers scattered around the sprawling top floor of the house. “I had never run for statewide office before. I had started at a big disadvantage.” "

"MONTREAL — Canadians were still recovering from the verbal daggers President Trump lobbed at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at last weekend’s Group of 7 summit meeting in Quebec when the news came that the newly minted frenemies would join Mexico to jointly host the 2026 World Cup. As it is, Canadians are not exactly known for their international soccer prowess; the men’s soccer team is ranked 79th in the world. And they had been digesting the incongruous image of Mr. Trump courting a North Korean dictator only hours after he had called their famously mild-mannered leader “very dishonest and weak” and a top Trump trade adviser had said “there’s a special place in hell” for Mr. Trudeau. But on Wednesday, a jubilant Mr. Trump, fresh from his meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, appeared to signal, however obliquely, that soccer could unify Canada and its erstwhile best friend. “The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup,” he wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations — a great deal of hard work!” Mr. Trudeau was equally effusive. “It’s going to be a great tournament,” he wrote on Twitter. For Canadians, by nature a forgiving people, the glamour and prestige of being host to the men’s World Cup for the first time appeared to supersede a festering trade dispute, including an acrimonious battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement, a cornerstone of trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which Mr. Trump has threatened to scrap.

"Instead of hosannas greeting President Trump upon his return from Asia, a clash with Congress awaits him: Senators of both parties have just agreed to add language to the annual defense spending bill that would reverse his decision to save the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE. Mr. Trump, riding high off his meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, is sure to fight back. He will most likely claim that he knows what he’s doing, and that internal political dissent will make him look weak at a critical moment, points that his political and media allies will surely echo. But the Senate must hold its ground: Not only does ZTE pose a unique threat to American security, but Mr. Trump’s kid-glove treatment of the company raises questions about possible links between it and Trump family businesses. It would be easy to mistake ZTE for just another player in Mr. Trump’s trade wars, and his decision to let do business again with American suppliers, in exchange for a $1 billion fine, as a tactical concession to China, which requested the deal. So it’s important to keep in mind why the United States put ZTE on a sanctions list in the first place: According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other law enforcement officials, it violated export controls that are meant to keep American technology out of the hands of dangerous regimes, like North Korea and Iran. What’s worse, even after it was caught, ZTE resumed illegal shipments. It tried to conceal that by lying to federal investigators and its own investigators and lawyers. Moreover, the violations were, according to the Justice Department, part of an “elaborate scheme” that was approved by the company’s “the highest levels of management.” The $1 billion payment would be a bargain for ZTE and China: The company had a market capitalization of about $20 billion before the announcement in April of sanctions against it; it would have struggled and possibly even failed if the Department of Commerce had stood by its decision to deny it American components for its cellphones and other products for seven years. Thousands of jobs would have been lost in China. "
"To the Editor: Re “Tubman on $20 Bill? Treasury Won’t Say” (news article, June 6): The Trump Treasury’s refusal to commit to putting Harriet Tubman, a symbol of the continuing fight for civil rights, on the $20 bill is emblematic of the administration’s blatant disrespect for black women. Black women have helped lead almost every major social movement — from civil rights to women’s rights to workers’ rights to L.G.B.T.Q. rights and more — and have gone largely unrecognized for our impact. Replacing Andrew Jackson, a slave owner, with a hero who embodies the raw courage, strength and social ingenuity that happens when black women lead is the least the administration can do to amend its pattern of undermining us. Harriet Tubman, among countless other black female leaders, deserves to have her legacy honored.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and signaled that two additional increases were on the way this year, as officials expressed confidence that the United States economy was strong enough for borrowing costs to rise without choking off economic growth. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, speaking in unusually blunt terms at a news conference on Wednesday, said the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and was approaching a “normal” level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands-on role in encouraging economic activity. The Fed’s optimism about the state of the economy is likely to translate into higher borrowing costs for cars, home mortgages and credit cards over the next year as the central bank raises interest rates more quickly than was anticipated. Wednesday’s rate increase was the second this year and the seventh since the end of the Great Recession and brings the Fed’s benchmark rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. The last time the rate topped 2 percent was in late summer 2008, when the economy was contracting and the Fed was cutting rates toward zero, where they would remain for years after the financial crisis. “The decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape,” Mr. Powell said after the Fed’s two-day policy meeting. “Most people who want to find jobs are finding them.” [During a news conference, Mr. Powell said he wants to “start with a plain English summary of how the economy is doing.” He certainly did that.] "
"WASHINGTON — In the office of Attorney General Jeff Sessions hangs a portrait of his predecessor Edwin Meese III, the Reagan-era conservative. Near the desk of the deputy attorney general is a painting of former Attorney General John Ashcroft, who pressed to expand the Justice Department’s powers after Sept. 11. The department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, chose for his office a portrait of the disgraced Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, who was nearly impeached, forced to resign in 1924 and later tried twice on charges of defrauding the government. Mr. Daugherty’s visage serves as a reminder for Mr. Horowitz: Malfeasance is never far away. Equal parts auditor, investigator and cop, Mr. Horowitz has navigated his role as one of the most powerful arbiters of conflict in Washington — the investigators’ investigator — with a diplomat’s instinct for recognizing fault lines, a prosecutor’s focus on justice and a Washington insider’s knack for amassing allies on Capitol Hill. Now, he has been thrust into the clash of law enforcement and politics that has consumed much of the capital for the past two years. On Thursday, he will issue the highly anticipated findings of his examination of the F.B.I.’s handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. He is expected to castigate the decision making by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey; his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe; and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Another high-profile test looms beyond that. Mr. Horowitz, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has begun a review of aspects of the Russia investigation. His findings could land in 2020 amid the presidential race. In interviews with nearly two dozen friends, former colleagues and political leaders, a portrait emerged of Mr. Horowitz as a principled, savvy investigator. Mr. Horowitz is good-humored and even-tempered, said past co-workers, who ribbed him for his cameos as a prosecutor on “K Street,” HBO’s short-lived 2003 show about lobbyists. He delivered lines like, “You need to have at least a general understanding of the financial flow of funds,” with the élan of a career civil servant. "
"For many years, Republican voters in Virginia’s affluent and highly educated Washington suburbs tended to reward mainstream candidates who could be competitive in the general election. But on Tuesday, it was Fairfax County, the population hub of the region, that delivered victory for Corey Stewart, the flame-throwing Trump acolyte who has won national attention with his paeans to Confederate emblems. Mr. Stewart narrowly defeated Nick Freitas, a state lawmaker, thanks to a decisive win in Fairfax County. And a third candidate who has also made his name as a provocateur, E.W. Jackson, carried 14 percent in the county with the third-highest median income in America. So what is happening in Fairfax? As the county has, like other high-income suburbs around the country, become more Democratic-leaning, the Republican Party has thinned out. The moderate wing of the party has dissipated, leaving a smaller and firmly conservative activist bedrock. And such voters care little about appeals to pragmatism — they are drawn to candidates who echo the president they embrace. Across four states with contested primary elections, Democratic voters embraced the candidates favored — and in some cases handpicked — by party leaders in Washington and the states, spurning insurgents who tried to align themselves with the activist left.

"I
n the spring of 2006, Christopher Aaron started working 12-hour shifts in a windowless room at the Counterterrorism Airborne Analysis Center in Langley, Va. He sat before a wall of flat-screen monitors that beamed live, classified video feeds from drones hovering in distant war zones. On some days, Aaron discovered, little of interest appeared on the screens, either because a blanket of clouds obscured visibility or because what was visible — goats grazing on an Afghan hillside, for instance — was mundane, even serene. Other times, what unspooled before Aaron’s eyes was jarringly intimate: coffins being carried through the streets after drone strikes; a man squatting in a field to defecate after a meal (the excrement generated a heat signature that glowed on infrared); an imam speaking to a group of 15 young boys in the courtyard of his madrasa. If a Hellfire missile killed the target, it occurred to Aaron as he stared at the screen, everything the imam might have told his pupils about America’s war with their faith would be confirmed. The infrared sensors and high-resolution cameras affixed to drones made it possible to pick up such details from an office in Virginia. But as Aaron learned, identifying who was in the cross hairs of a potential drone strike wasn’t always straightforward. The feed on the monitors could be grainy and pixelated, making it easy to mistake a civilian trudging down a road with a walking stick for an insurgent carrying a weapon. The figures on-screen often looked less like people than like faceless gray blobs. How certain could Aaron be of who they were? “On good days, when a host of environmental, human and technological factors came together, we had a strong sense that who we were looking at was the person we were looking for,” Aaron said. “On bad days, we were literally guessing.” Initially, the good days outnumbered the bad ones for Aaron. He wasn’t bothered by the long shifts, the high-pressure decisions or the strangeness of being able to stalk — and potentially kill — targets from thousands of miles away. Although Aaron and his peers spent more time doing surveillance and reconnaissance than coordinating strikes, sometimes they would relay information to a commander about what they saw on-screen, and “60 seconds later, depending on what we would report, you would either see a missile fired or not,” he said. Other times, they would trail targets for months. The first few times he saw a Predator drone unleash its lethal payload — the camera zooming in, the laser locking on, a plume of smoke rising above the scorched terrain where the missile struck — he found it surreal, he told me. But he also found it awe-inspiring. Often, he experienced a surge of adrenaline, as analysts in the room exchanged high-fives. Aaron’s path to the drone program was unusual. He grew up in Lexington, Mass., in a home where red meat and violent video games were banned. His parents were former hippies who marched against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. But Aaron revered his grandfather, a quiet, unflappable man who served in World War II. Aaron also had a taste for exploration and tests of fortitude: hiking and wandering through the woods in Maine, where his family vacationed every summer, and wrestling, a sport whose demand for martial discipline captivated him. Aaron attended the College of William & Mary in Virginia, where he majored in history, with a minor in business. A gifted athlete with an air of independence and adventurousness, he cut a charismatic figure on campus. One summer, he traveled to Alaska alone to work as a deckhand on a fishing boat. During Aaron’s junior year, in 2001, he woke up one morning to a phone call from his father, who told him that the twin towers and the Pentagon had been attacked. Aaron thought instantly of his grandfather, who served for three years as a military police officer on the European front after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He wanted to do something similarly heroic. A year later, after spotting a pamphlet at the William & Mary career-services office for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a national-security agency that specializes in geographical and imagery analysis, he applied for a job there. Aaron began working as an imagery analyst at the N.G.A. in 2005, studying satellite pictures of countries that had no link to the war on terror. Not long after he arrived, an email circulated about a Department of Defense task force that was being created to determine how drones could help defeat Al Qaeda. Aaron answered the call for volunteers and was soon working at the Counterterrorism Airborne Analysis Center. He found it exhilarating to participate directly in a war he saw as his generation’s defining challenge. His pride deepened as it became clear that the task force was having a significant impact and that the use of drones was increasing. "

Stephen Colbert was not particularly impressed by the results of President Trump’s negotiations with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. At the end of the meeting, the two heads of state signed a noncommittal joint statement. Colbert scoffed at how Trump heaped praise on Kim throughout their time in Singapore. Trump had told a reporter that he was impressed by how Kim had stepped into his father’s role as leader of North Korea at just 26. Trevor Noah issued a gentle apology and a note of congratulations. The other hosts also tried to make sense out of the budding camaraderie between Trump and Kim. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “As skimpy as the summit meeting was extravagant.” That’s how one of our White House correspondents described the joint statement that President Trump and Kim Jong-un signed after their talks in Singapore on Tuesday. It calls for the “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula, but provided neither a timeline nor details about how the North would give up its weapons. Read the joint statement here. Mr. Trump made a concession, saying he would suspend joint military exercises on the Korean Peninsula, to the surprise of South Korea and the Pentagon. And “the simple act of talking” makes conflict far less likely, one of our Interpreter columnists notes in his 10 takeaways. • The president played a faux movie trailer for Mr. Kim, showing North Korea’s economic potential — beaches and condos included. We  analyzed the video, and came up with our own (dare we say better?) version. "

On today’s episode: • Nicholas Kristof, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times who writes about human rights and global affairs, and who has repeatedly traveled to North Korea. Background reading: • The summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim yielded a vaguely worded joint statement in which both parties agreed to work toward peace, but offered few details on how they planned to move forward. • In a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Trump announced that the United States would halt joint military exercises with South Korea, a decision that appeared to catch both the Pentagon and South Korean officials off-guard. • The president’s concessions to North Korea may vastly outweigh their returns, Mr. Kristof writes in an Op-Ed. Lawmakers in both parties have noted that it remains unclear what, if anything, has been gained by the U.S. • The encounter between the two leaders was rich in spectacle — and in ambiguity.

"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Every media and telecom giant that’s thinking of buying a rival just got some good news. AT&T won its legal fight to be allowed to buy Time Warner — a huge blow to the Justice Department, which sought to block the deal on the grounds that consumers would suffer. The chances of approval for other media takeovers look much better now. First up will be Comcast. Expect the cable giant to challenge Walt Disney’s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox in the next day or two. (Michael de la Merced has outlined Fox’s antitrust concerns about a potential Comcast bid, which yesterday’s ruling is likely to have allayed.) But who else could be on the hunt for deals? John Malone, who controls both the cable company Charter and content providers like Starz; Verizon; and tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon. Andrew says the verdict is likely to rattle President Trump, a vocal opponent of the Time Warner deal. “Mr. Trump doesn’t like to lose, and that could make his administration more reluctant to police future deals that actually deserve to be blocked,” he writes in his latest column. In a sign of financial sense, the carmaker announced that it would lay off 9 percent of its staff of 37,500. The cuts will mainly hit salaried employees and won’t affect production workers at its plant in Fremont, Calif. (That’s important, given its struggle to build enough Model 3 sedans.) "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump returned to the United States early on Wednesday praising his diplomatic prowess after his meeting with the North Korean leader and declaring, “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat” from Pyongyang. In a series of Twitter posts at dawn, the president projected confidence as Air Force One landed outside Washington. After his summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, in Singapore, Mr. Trump appeared to be taking a victory lap even as critics cautioned that the nuclear threat from North Korea is far from over. But questions remained about whether the United States gave up more than it gained what had been a much-anticipated meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. North Korea state media reported on Wednesday that Mr. Kim won major concessions from the American president, including an agreement by Mr. Trump to a phased, “step-by-step” denuclearization process for the North, rather than the immediate dismantling of its nuclear capability.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The last few decades have been full of huge corporate mergers. In one sector after another — airlines, energy, finance, media, pharmaceuticals and much more — the biggest companies have gotten bigger by buying other companies. And thanks to a court ruling Tuesday, a new round of mergers may be about to begin. Judge Richard Leon ruled that AT&T could buy Time Warner, rejecting the Justice Department’s argument that the deal would reduce competition and hurt consumers. The deal is known as a vertical merger, because it involves two companies in different areas of an industry. (A horizontal merger involves competitors.) Time Warner produces content, like shows for HBO and basketball broadcasts on TNT. AT&T distributes content, through its mobile-phone business and DirectTV. Now that Leon has approved the merger, many analysts think other vertical mergers in technology and media may follow. I was disappointed by Tuesday’s ruling, because I’m deeply concerned about the degree of corporate concentration today. I think it gives big business too much power relative to consumers, workers and the government — and it is a major reason why wage growth has been so weak in recent years, while corporate profits have soared. For a good overview of the larger issues, see this 2016 article from The Economist, as well as Gilad Edelman writing in the Washington Monthly on both the problem and the people trying to solve it. As for the AT&T merger: In The Los Angeles Times, Michael Hiltzik suggests that Comcast’s 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal is a guide to what may happen next. “The historical record bristles with evidence of the bad habits of media distribution companies given the sort of control that will soon be exercised by AT&T and Time Warner,” he writes. The Open Markets Institute, which advocates for a more competitive economy, calls the decision “a big loss for the public.” (The Atlantic has just published a profile of the institute’s Lina Khan.) And Motherboard’s Karl Bode argues that the AT&T merger is especially worrisome because of the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality. “We’re entering a strange new world of less oversight and greater consolidation that’s likely to leave consumers with fewer choices, less competition, and ample opportunity for creatively-bad behavior,” Bode writes. The Times editorial board explains the biggest reason to like Leon’s decision: The Trump administration appeared to oppose the merger in part because of the president’s dislike of CNN, which Time Warner owns. It would set a chilling precedent for Washington to punish media companies over their coverage. The case for Trump. The economist Tyler Cowen has produced some of the most thought-provoking semi-defenses of the Trump presidency, as I’ve written before. On his Marginal Revolution blog, Cowen has a short new piece about the North Korea summit. My colleagues Bret Stephens and Ross Douthat also weigh in on the summit. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration signaled on Wednesday that it will try to block any effort by Congress to interfere with its plan to throw a lifeline to ZTE, the Chinese technology company that the United States government has penalized for violating sanctions. The Department of Commerce brokered a settlement with ZTE this month after Chinese President Xi Jinping asked President Trump to issue a softer penalty that would not put the company out of business. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been working on legislation that would undermine that agreement and impose a stiffer punishment on ZTE. The White House said on Wednesday that the current agreement “will ensure ZTE pays for its violations and gives our government complete oversight of their future activity without undue harm to American suppliers and their workers.” Lawmakers have been working to attach legislation on ZTE to an upcoming National Defense Authorization Act measure that is expected to pass in the Senate. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, suggested that such a move would undermine the authority of the executive branch. “The administration will work with Congress to ensure the final N.D.A.A. conference report respects the separation of powers,” Mr. Gidley said, referencing the act. The company’s shares plunged on Wednesday, losing more than 40 percent of their value in their first day of trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange since the United States government slapped ZTE with crippling penalties two months ago. Nearly $3 billion was shaved from the company’s market capitalization. "
"SINGAPORE — For America’s allies in Asia, the outcome of President Trump’s summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea has been decidedly mixed. On the good side, they no longer have to be on alert for the imminent outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula. But the widely anticipated Trump-Kim meeting on Tuesday left them with new anxieties. Mr. Trump’s concessions to North Korea exacerbated their fears about the United States’ long-term commitment to safeguarding the region. Mr. Trump’s surprise declaration during a news conference after the meeting that he would suspend military drills between the United States and South Korea — and that he hoped eventually to pull some 28,000 American troops off the peninsula — blindsided American allies, including South Korea itself. Even the Pentagon was caught off guard. More broadly, Mr. Trump’s declaration raised questions about whether his outreach to the North actually signaled an American retreat from the region. Since World War II, the United States has been a leader in East Asia, providing security assurances to allies in Japan and South Korea. But even before engaging in talks with North Korea, Mr. Trump had questioned the merits of stationing troops in the region, and made it clear he thought the United States was paying too much to support them. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he expected “major disarmament” in North Korea within two and a half years, representing significant headway in the standoff over the country’s nuclear arsenal before the end of President Trump’s first term in office. The remarks, made during a Wednesday news conference in Seoul, South Korea, came a day after Mr. Trump met with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in the first face-to-face encounter between a sitting American president and a leader of the reclusive nation. Mr. Pompeo said the administration hoped to move quickly, but acknowledged that the denuclearization process would not be immediate. “The president has said, and it’s common knowledge, the work itself takes some amount of time,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We’re prepared to execute this once we’re in position that we can actually get to a place where we can do it.” North Korea has already spun the results of the summit in its favor, claiming it had won major concessions from the United States during its discussions with Mr. Trump. The authoritarian country’s state-controlled news media said that Mr. Trump had promised to eventually lift sanctions against the North and to end joint military drills with South Korea. It also said the United States had agreed to a phased, “step-by-step” denuclearization process for the North, rather than the immediate dismantling of its nuclear capability. "
"TEHRAN — A leading human rights lawyer in Iran, Nasrin Sotoudeh, was arrested on Wednesday by security forces, taken from her home in Tehran to the notorious Evin Prison, her husband said. Mrs. Sotoudeh’s persistent activism has landed her in prison numerous times, and has made her an internationally known symbol of independence in the face of Iran’s restrictive Islamist rule. Most recently, she has been involved in defending women who had been arrested for having taken off their compulsory Islamic head scarves during public protests. The arrest comes as Iran faces increasing economic pressures stemming from President Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from the 2015 agreement that limited Iran’s nuclear program. He reimposed broad sanctions against Iran, putting pressure on European businesses not to do business there. Iranian hard-liners have been empowered since the judiciary, which is dominated by hard-liners, decided last week that it would allow only a pool of 20 preselected lawyers to represent those implicated in political cases. Mrs. Sotoudeh, 55, was not one of them. On Wednesday morning, Mrs. Sotoudeh’s husband, Reza Khandan, an information technology specialist, wrote on his Facebook page that she had been arrested and taken to Evin Prison. His post, written in Persian, quoted something his wife had said: “Once in the interrogation room I told the interrogators that: ‘Of all the things that the government should do for its country, you only know one, and that’s to capture people.’” He confirmed the news in a telephone interview, adding that he did not know why she had been taken. Mrs. Sotoudeh received the European Union’s most prestigious human rights award, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 2012. Her arrest is likely to be seen as a provocation in Europe, where some countries have been trying to salvage the nuclear agreement and maintain business ties with Iran. "
"A judge who sentenced a Texas woman to five years in prison for voting illegally because she was a felon on probation turned down on Monday the woman’s bid for a new trial. “Prison is a lot closer for her today,” Alison Grinter, a lawyer for the woman, Crystal Mason, 43, said on Tuesday, noting that her client would appeal the decision to a higher court. Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County district attorney, declined to comment. Ms. Mason was convicted of illegal voting in a one-day trial held March 28 before Judge Ruben Gonzalez, a state district court judge who sentenced her that day to five years in prison. She has been free on bond pending appeal. [Where do states stand on voting rights for felons? Here’s a breakdown.] Ms. Mason, who was sentenced to 60 months in jail for tax fraud and was released in early 2016, has said that she didn’t know that she wasn’t allowed to vote in that year’s presidential election. She cast a provisional ballot at her local church after being told that her name could not be found on the rolls. The ballot was never counted. “Crystal’s name was purged from the rolls when she went to prison, but Crystal did not know that,” Ms. Grinter said in an interview on Tuesday. Whether felons can vote varies state by state, and has become a contentious issue. More than six million Americans have been stripped of their voting rights because of felony disenfranchisement laws, according to the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization that works on criminal justice reform. Two months ago, a petition was started online to have all charges against Ms. Mason, who is black, thrown out. In the petition her photo is placed next to a photo of Terri Lynn Rote, a white woman who was convicted of voter fraud in Iowa for trying to vote for President Trump twice. Ms. Rote was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $750 fine. The petition has over 38,000 signatures. As she prepared to appeal the rejection of her motion for a new trial, Ms. Mason said she had high hopes. “I showed my kids that no matter what you can get out and get your life in order,” said Ms. Mason. “But sometimes, regardless of whatever your past is, you are still going to be beat up for it.” "
"Being white in America has long been treated, at least by white people, as too familiar to be of much interest. It’s been the default identity, the cultural wallpaper — something described, when described at all, using bland metaphors like milk and vanilla and codes like “cornfed” and “all-American.” Grass is green, the sky is blue and, until very recently, a product described as “nude” or “flesh-colored” probably looked like white people’s skin. How often do white people talk about being white? Not often! So long as we aren’t hanging out with white nationalists, marrying into a family of color or chuckling over jokes about our dancing, we have endless opportunities to avoid thinking much about our own race. We generally prefer to frame identity in ethnic terms instead: Identifying as Italian or Irish or Jewish seems to come with zest, pathos and a chance to take pride in some shared history. Plain undifferentiated whiteness, on the other hand, is a “toggle between nothingness and awfulness,” writes Nell Irvin Painter, an emeritus professor of history at Princeton and author of the 2010 book “The History of White People.” The Trump era, however, has compelled an unprecedented acknowledgment of whiteness as a real and alarming force. In the months leading up to the 2016 election, as Donald Trump rallied his almost entirely white base with calls for banning Muslims and deporting “bad hombres,” Politico asked: “What’s Going On With America’s White People?” The NPR podcast “Code Switch” debuted with an episode called “Can We Talk About Whiteness?” Since handing Trump 58 percent of the white vote, we have been the subject of newspaper and magazine analyses about our race-based resentment, fear of declining status and supposed economic anxiety. The satire “Dear White People” was picked up by Netflix, and the film “Get Out,” which turned self-proclaimed Obama-supporting white people into figures of horror, became the think-piece blockbuster of 2017. Suddenly it is less tenable than ever for white people to write our whiteness out of the story of race in America or define ourselves only in terms of what we are not. Much of the sharpest examination comes, as it always has, from people of color, who have spent centuries acutely aware of how the force of whiteness operates. But these days, white people are also observing one another’s whiteness with unfamiliar intensity. When a white manager at a Philadelphia Starbucks called the police to report two black customers who didn’t order right away after one had asked to use the bathroom, a white customer, Melissa DePino, tweeted video of the ensuing arrests, adding: “All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing.” A few weeks later, a white woman named Michelle Snider confronted and filmed another white woman who called the police on a couple of black men for using a charcoal grill at an Oakland park. The caller’s image became a meme, #BBQBecky, showing up on “Saturday Night Live” and being dropped into stills from “Black Panther,” Barack Obama’s inauguration and a black Last Supper. In each of these cases, as well as a string of others, white people didn’t get the usual benefit of assumed normalcy. They were portrayed, instead, as a distinct subculture with bizarre and threatening habits. “White people” were suddenly identified as the subgroup of Americans most likely to call the police on black people over a barbecue or to complain about whether every single football player stands for the anthem — stereotypes that rang true even to other white people. "
"SINGAPORE — President Trump’s eager embrace of Kim Jong-un of North Korea this week, on the heels of an acrid falling-out with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, raised an obvious, if confounding, question: Why would an American president offend allies and cozy up to adversaries? If there was an answer in Mr. Trump’s tumultuous week on the global stage, it may be that he disregards the traditional preoccupations of American foreign policy — power and values — in favor of a more narrow worldview shaped by his experience as a businessman. “The theme that comes up, over and over, is money,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, a diplomat who advised President Barack Obama on China. Mr. Trump’s bitter clashes with Canada and Europe over trade, as well as his solicitous courtship of North Korea’s brutal dictator, all reflect this mercantile perspective. In his transactional approach to foreign policy, considerations of financial profit or cost — often measured in ways that economists deem simplistic — can outweigh virtually any other consideration. “What that means is that Trump, like a lot of businessmen, doesn’t pay much attention to Canada, or Europe, or Japan,” Mr. Bader said. “Businessmen pay attention to the growth markets: Vietnam, Brazil, India, China.” Or, as was on vivid display in Singapore this week, North Korea. That does not mean Mr. Trump is necessarily interested in North Korea as a trade partner or an investment opportunity for the United States. But his view of the challenges posed by the Korean Peninsula are colored — and perhaps limited — by his background in business. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump wasn’t on the ballot or even stateside for Tuesday’s primary elections in Virginia and South Carolina. But he loomed over both states, just as he has in nearly every nominating contest this year, underscoring how the Republican Party has become the party of Trump and that its politicians cross him at their peril. As Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina found out the hard way, in his surprise primary defeat, having a conservative voting record is less important than demonstrating total loyalty to Mr. Trump, who now enjoys higher approval ratings in his own party than any modern president except George W. Bush following the attacks of Sept. 11. And in Virginia, a far-right candidate, Corey Stewart, won the Republican Senate nomination after waging an incendiary campaign and portraying himself as a disciple of Mr. Trump. The president’s transformation of the G.O.P. — its policies, its tone, even the fate of its candidates — has never been so evident. A party that once championed free trade has now largely turned to protectionism under Mr. Trump. Sermons about inclusivity have been replaced with demagogic attacks on immigrants and black athletes. A trust-but-verify approach to foreign policy has given way to a seat-of-the-pants style in which rogue regimes like North Korea are elevated and democratic allies like Canada are belittled. Mr. Trump’s harsh attacks, including describing the news media as “the country’s biggest enemy” Tuesday, draw muted responses or silence from most Republicans these days. The party’s lawmakers have seen what he can do to their campaigns, having witnessed how Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee saw their standing with conservative voters plummet after they tangled with him. Neither is seeking re-election. While Mr. Trump has been reshaping Republican identity for nearly two years — starting with his 2016 nomination victory and the hard-line tone and platform he laid out at that summer’s Republican convention — he has never had this much opportunity to wield power over the party as he does now, including over immigration legislation and tariffs in Congress. “If you criticize him, you’re siding with the media that hates him and you’re undermining what he’s trying to accomplish,” said former Senator Rick Santorum, explaining why Mr. Trump has consolidated support. “Trump has done a good job in being a conservative president and as much as Democrats looked past what Bill Clinton said and did, Republicans are looking past what this president says and does.” "
"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal fixer, will soon be parting from the lawyers who are representing him in a potentially damaging and wide-ranging federal investigation into his business dealings, according to two people familiar with the case. Prosecutors conducting the inquiry have not yet approached Mr. Cohen to seek his cooperation, according to two people briefed on the case. But as the investigation continues, and with Mr. Cohen’s legal team in flux, the pressure on him to cooperate with the government may well intensify. Mr. Cohen’s current lawyers — a three-man team from the firm of McDermott Will & Emery — are expected to stay with him for at least the rest of the week as they struggle to complete a laborious review of a trove of documents and data files seized from their client in a series of extraordinary early-morning raids two months ago. But after that review is finished, Mr. Cohen will seek new legal counsel, the people familiar with his case said. The dispute between Mr. Cohen and his lawyers involves the payment of his legal bills, part of which are being financed by the Trump family. Mr. Cohen has also had more longstanding concerns about the lawyers: As his case moves forward, possibly toward criminal charges, he has been thinking for some time about hiring a new legal team with stronger relationships with the federal prosecutors’ office in New York that is leading the investigation, according to the people briefed on the matter. Mr. Cohen has been in the cross hairs of investigators for months, but the explosive case burst into public view on April 9 when federal agents armed with search warrants descended on his office, apartment and hotel room, hauling away eight boxes of paperwork, about 30 cellphones, iPads and computers — even the contents of one of his shredders. The materials were seized on the orders of prosecutors in Manhattan who have been trying to determine whether Mr. Cohen broke the law in any of his business projects, including hush-money payments he made to two women who claim they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The Cohen inquiry is separate from the one being run in Washington by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is looking into potential ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. But ever since the raids involving Mr. Cohen took place, Mr. Trump’s lawyers have confronted the specter that the New York-based investigation could persuade Mr. Cohen, who has a wife and two children and faces the prospect of devastating legal fees, to cut a deal and share his intimate knowledge of Mr. Trump with Mr. Mueller’s team. Mr. Cohen, after all, worked for Mr. Trump for years as a lawyer and self-described “fix-it guy,” guarding his boss’s secrets and helping him to navigate some of the most sensitive episodes in his personal and professional life.

"Corey Stewart, the provocative conservative who won Tuesday’s Republican primary to challenge Democratic Senator Tim Kaine in Virginia in November, has spent years courting voters on the rightward fringes of his party, often by playing to anti-immigration sentiment. He has also been accused of supporting white nationalists, an allegation that he has denied yet may cost him support this fall even among other Republicans. One of his primary opponents, Nick Freitas, urged voters in an email last week to “reject Corey Stewart’s dog-whistling of white supremacists, anti-Semites and racists.” This argument is likely to play a major role in the general election, as signaled by the first statement from Mr. Kaine’s campaign after Mr. Stewart secured the nomination on Tuesday night. “A cruder imitation of Donald Trump who stokes white supremacy and brags about being ‘ruthless and vicious,’ Corey Stewart would be an embarrassment for Virginia in the U.S. Senate,” the statement said. Here are the facts of Mr. Stewart’s history with courting the far right. In January 2017, as Mr. Stewart ran for governor, he met with and praised Paul Nehlen, an outspoken anti-Semite who is now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. He called Mr. Nehlen “one of my personal heroes” and said he was “so honored” to have Mr. Nehlen’s endorsement. And in a June 2017 campaign finance filing reported by CNN, he disclosed a $759 payment to Mr. Nehlen, described as a “fund-raising commission.” [Get three key takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries.] Mr. Stewart was also endorsed last year by the white nationalist Jason Kessler, who later organized the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. In February 2017, Mr. Stewart appeared with Mr. Kessler at an event sponsored by Mr. Kessler’s group Unity and Security for America, whose mission statement called for “defending Western civilization, including its history, culture and peoples, while utterly dismantling cultural Marxism.” Mr. Stewart has since distanced himself from both men. He told The Washington Post this month that he had praised Mr. Nehlen “before he went nuts and started spewing a bunch of stupid stuff,” and tweeted on Friday, “Paul Nehlen has lost his marbles and needs serious help.” "
"Between 60 and 90 percent of the world’s fresh water is frozen in the ice sheets of Antarctica, a continent roughly the size of the United States and Mexico combined. If all that ice melted, it would be enough to raise the world’s sea levels by roughly 200 feet. While that won’t happen overnight, Antarctica is indeed melting, and a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature shows that the melting is speeding up. The rate at which Antarctica is losing ice has tripled since 2007, according to the latest available data. The continent is now melting so fast, scientists say, that it will contribute six inches (15 centimeters) to sea-level rise by 2100. That is at the upper end of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated Antarctica alone could contribute to sea level rise this century. “Around Brooklyn you get flooding once a year or so, but if you raise sea level by 15 centimeters then that’s going to happen 20 times a year,” said Andrew Shepherd, a professor of earth observation at the University of Leeds and the lead author of the study. Even under ordinary conditions, Antarctica’s landscape is perpetually changing as icebergs calve, snow falls and ice melts on the surface, forming glacial sinkholes known as moulins. But what concerns scientists is the balance of how much snow and ice accumulates in a given year versus the amount that is lost. "
"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, seeking to unite his fractious conference around a compromise immigration bill, assured Republican lawmakers during a closed-door session on Wednesday that President Trump is backing the effort, though passage of the measure next week remains very much in doubt. Wednesday’s gathering came less than 12 hours after Mr. Ryan’s office announced that the House would consider immigration next week — but not bipartisan bills prompted by a desire to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Instead, lawmakers will consider a hard-line measure that emphasizes border security and the somewhat more moderate compromise measure, yet to be finalized, that still meets Mr. Trump’s standards. Mr. Ryan’s voting plan and the unfinished compromise measure were products of weeks of tense negotiations between Republican conservatives, including hard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus, and a band of rebellious Republican moderates. But in the end, the moderates stumbled before the finish line. They had been gathering signatures for a so-called discharge petition that would have forced Mr. Ryan to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor, but the effort collapsed two signatures short of the number needed. “It’s not my ideal place to be,” said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, one of 23 Republicans who signed the petition. “My ideal option would be a bipartisan bill in the House. But it’s the cards that we were dealt, and I think we’re trying to make good use of these cards.” The compromise bill will be built around four principles — Mr. Trump has called them the “four pillars” — that the president has insisted any immigration bill contain: a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers; beefed-up border security, including $25 billion for the wall the president wants to build on the southwest border; an end to the current diversity visa lottery system, which is aimed at bringing in immigrants from underrepresented nations; and limits on family-based migration, known as chain migration. Mr. Ryan told reporters that the “last thing I want to do is bring a bill out of here that I know the president won’t support.” "
"TEHRAN — After the handshakes, the signature ceremony and the diplomatic pomp of the historic meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea, many Iranians could come to only one conclusion: We should talk, too. Yes, Mr. Trump in May unilaterally pulled the United States out of the nuclear agreement between Iran and a group of world powers. Yes, he has imposed new sanctions against Iran that are scaring away European investors. Yes, Mr. Trump has a long track record of changing his mind. Despite that, some here say that perhaps Iran’s leaders should make a move similar to Mr. Kim’s and propose a meeting. If Mr. Trump can sit down with the leader of such an isolated country, with its gulags, summary executions and stockpile of nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles, why not talk to Iran? Mr. Trump has already said he is willing to authorize direct talks with Iran’s leaders to renegotiate the Iran deal. “We are a country with municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections, our 80-million-strong society is open and dynamic, we share borders” with many countries, said Masoud Daneshmand, a member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. “Iran is a much more advanced and open society, compared with North Korea. So why wouldn’t Iran and America be able to sit down and have direct talks?” One reason is that Iran’s leaders are ideologically opposed to talking to the United States. Like North Korea, Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States. Iranian presidents visiting the United Nations for meetings have been known to duck into a restroom to avoid being seen with an American president. "
"Any ideology operating under the seismic pressures of the actual world will reveal a seam of inconsistency, a line of vulnerability running through it like a stress fracture. Free-market conservatives, for instance, have tried to square their support for big business with their professed fondness for little communities, sometimes by suggesting that the interests of both are one and the same. Eliza Griswold will tell you what happens when they’re not. Scratch that: Eliza Griswold will show you what happens when they’re not. Her sensitive and judicious new book, “Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America,” is neither an outraged sermon delivered from a populist soapbox nor a pinched, professorial lecture. Griswold, a journalist and a poet, paid close attention to a community in southwestern Pennsylvania over the course of seven years to convey its confounding experience with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process that injects water and chemicals deep into the ground in order to shake loose deposits of natural gas. Considering the animus and hardship described in this book, the title sounds almost cruelly ironic, but it comes from the land itself. Amity and Prosperity are the names of two towns in Pennsylvania’s Washington County, where “the history of energy extraction is etched into Appalachian hollows.” The people there are no strangers to industry, including its boons and disasters. Coal, steel and now natural gas: To suggest that the county’s residents have just been bamboozled by greedy industry sounds to them like the bleating of condescending elites and, for a number of locals, simply untrue. Some families have suffered while others have thrived. What Griswold depicts is a community, like the earth, cracked open. Griswold arrived on the scene in 2011, a little more than halfway through the decade of the gas rush, when technological advances made fracking cheaper — economically speaking, that is. The ecological costs have proved to be quite dear. Natural gas may burn more cleanly than oil or coal, but flushing it out requires forcing enormous amounts of water and chemicals into the earth with pressure approaching a shotgun blast. (Oklahoma and Pennsylvania have had fracking-related earthquakes as a result.) Then there’s the grim matter of the waste left over, what one candid extraction employee calls “demon water.” Griswold describes sludge in a waste pond going septic, releasing an unbearable stench “like an infected wound.” “It was the kind of fugitive scent that made Stacey feel paranoid and alone,” Griswold writes of Stacey Haney, a nurse who leased her mineral rights to Range Resources in 2008. Haney thought the money would help her and her two children, whom she was raising on her own after a divorce. Stacey tries to counter the odor with spritzings of Febreze and a steady supply of potpourri. Parts of “Amity and Prosperity” read as intimately as a novel, though its insidious, slow-motion ordeal is all too real. "
"To the Editor: Re “Giuliani Speaks for Trump. Except for When He Doesn’t” (news article, June 8): Regardless of others’ remembrances, I remember Rudy Giuliani as the mayor who cleaned up New York City and reduced crime. I remember a Rudy Giuliani who as mayor saw the city and, in many ways, America through 9/11. Where have you gone, Rudy Giuliani? I do not recognize you today. You have reduced yourself from “America’s mayor” to the “court jester of the Trump monarchy.” Rudy, you are running around the country and the world making outrageous statements that are both untrue and uncivil. You are reducing yourself from leader to laughingstock. Rudy, come back to us. Save your legacy. Separate yourself from Donald Trump and all that he represents. MARK CORAN

"Dear Robert De Niro, Samantha Bee and other Trump haters: I get that you’re angry. I’m angry, too. But anger isn’t a strategy. Sometimes it’s a trap. When you find yourself spewing four-letter words, you’ve fallen into it. You’ve chosen cheap theatrics over the long game, catharsis over cunning. You think you’re raising your fist when you’re really raising a white flag. You’re right that Donald Trump is a dangerous and deeply offensive man, and that restraining and containing him are urgent business. You’re wrong about how to go about doing that, or at least you’re letting your emotions get the better of you. When you answer name-calling with name-calling and tantrums with tantrums, you’re not resisting him. You’re mirroring him. You’re not diminishing him. You’re demeaning yourselves. Many voters don’t hear your arguments or the facts, which are on your side. They just wince at the din. You permit them to see you as you see Trump: deranged. Why would they choose a different path if it goes to another ugly destination? Of course this is broader than De Niro, bigger than Bee and about more than profanity. It’s about maturity, pragmatism and plain old smarts — and the necessity of all three when the stakes are this high. Many Democrats get that. Maybe even most do. In the primaries last week and on Tuesday, Democratic voters by and large chose House candidates whose appeals were tempered and whose profiles make them formidable general-election contenders. They’re the best bets for wooing less fiercely partisan voters and snatching seats currently in Republican hands. "
"MANASSAS, Va. — He once stood proudly before a Confederate flag, declaring it was not a symbol of hatred, but “about our heritage.” After the march of torch-carrying white supremacists in Charlottesville last year, which led to the death of a counterprotester, he criticized “weak Republicans” who “couldn’t apologize fast enough.” As officials around Virginia have grappled with whether to remove Confederate statues, he has compared those politicians to leaders of the Islamic State. Now Corey Stewart, a county official who for years has played to the hard-right fringe, captured the Republican nomination for Senate in Virginia. [Read more about Corey Stewart, Republicans and the fringe right.] He did so in a low-turnout primary on Tuesday when many centrist Republicans apparently stayed home, unhappy with a three-way race among candidates all professing strong loyalty to President Trump and given to fiery culture war pronouncements. Mr. Stewart, the chairman of a county board of supervisors who briefly led Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign in Virginia, received a congratulatory overnight tweet from the president, who called Mr. Stewart’s Democratic opponent, Senator Tim Kaine, “a total stiff.” "
