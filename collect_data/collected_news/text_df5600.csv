"WASHINGTON — For more than a week, the White House has shifted its story about how and when members of the Trump administration learned about the domestic abuse allegations that forced Rob Porter, one of President Trump’s top aides, to resign. On Tuesday, the director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, contradicted the latest White House timeline, disclosing that the bureau informed the White House on three separate occasions about the status of the background check into Mr. Porter. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, later offered a new timeline, blaming career employees in the White House security office for failing to inform senior West Wing aides of the accusations against Mr. Porter. Mr. Porter married Colbie Holderness weeks after the couple graduated from Harvard University and Wellesley College. She later told The Intercept that while on their honeymoon in the Canary Islands, Mr. Porter kicked her during an argument. While on vacation in Florence, Ms. Holderness took a photograph of herself with a black eye, which she said was taken shortly after Mr. Porter punched her. After the photos were published in The Intercept, Mr. Porter said in a statement that the images were misleading. “I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago, and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described,” he said. Mr. Porter and Ms. Holderness divorced. "
"After its charm offensive at the Olympics, North Korea’s delegation has returned home from South Korea, leaving some questions behind. Chief among them: Can the new opening between the two Koreas, begun amid the feel-good spirit of the Winter Games, be nudged and nurtured into serious dialogue over North Korea’s nuclear program? While still a long shot, there’s a somewhat better chance of engagement now owing to two developments since President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Vice President Mike Pence, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and the North Korean delegation, including Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, attended the Olympic opening ceremony. First was Mr. Kim’s surprise decision to dispatch his sister, his most trusted envoy, to carry his personal invitation for Mr. Moon to join him in a summit meeting in the North. Mr. Moon and Ms. Kim met four times during the Olympics, the highest-level contact between the two Koreas in years. Mr. Moon’s visit would be an even rarer event, since the reclusive Mr. Kim has never met another foreign leader. While many officials fear that North Korea’s primary goal is to drive a wedge between South Korea, which has been eager to engage the North, and the United States, which has resisted engagement, close coordination between Washington and Seoul would keep the alliance strong. At the very least, the North-South contacts provide a communications channel for Seoul to directly explain to Pyongyang what it and the United States are doing and saying and why, thus hopefully avoiding any miscalculation that could lead to military confrontations in this fraught period. The other seemingly positive development was Mr. Pence’s telling The Washington Post that the Trump administration was willing to hold preliminary talks with North Korea even as Washington continues to toughen sanctions and apply other pressures. Only days earlier Mr. Pence insisted there would be no talks until the North made concessions, including taking steps to give up its nuclear weapons. "
"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, said on Tuesday that he had paid $130,000 out of his own pocket to a pornographic-film actress who had once claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump. In the most detailed explanation of the 2016 payment made to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, Mr. Cohen, who worked as a counsel to the Trump Organization for more than a decade, said he was not reimbursed by the Trump Organization or the campaign for the payment. “Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” Mr. Cohen said in a statement to The New York Times. “The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.” He declined to answer several follow-up questions, including whether Mr. Trump had been aware that Mr. Cohen made the payment, why he made the payment or whether he had made similar payments to other people over the years. Mr. Cohen has previously said that Mr. Trump has denied an affair with Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. She has said the affair took place soon after Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, gave birth to the couple’s son, Barron. Mr. Cohen’s statement about what he called “a private transaction” was the first time that he had acknowledged a role in the payment, which was first reported in January by The Wall Street Journal.

"WASHINGTON — The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program offers about 46 million low-income Americans both sustenance and economic choice by providing an allowance to buy the fruit, meat, fresh vegetables, soda, ice cream and kind of bread they want to eat. But on Monday, the Trump administration sprung a surprise: Under a proposal in the president’s budget many participants in the program would be given half their benefits in the form of a “Harvest Box” full of food preselected for nutritional value and economic benefit to American farmers. The cache of cheaper peanut butter, canned goods, pasta, cereal, “shelf stable” milk and other products would now be selected by the federal government, not by the people actually eating it. The proposal seemed like a radical overhaul of the country’s core food assistance program — once called food stamps but now commonly known as SNAP. The idea was to shave about $21 billion a year from the federal deficit over the next 10 years. But the reaction was immediate, and largely negative. Democrats claimed the plan shackled the poor while business groups, led by big food retailers, would stand to lose billions of dollars in lost SNAP business. The head of one trade association typically supportive of President Trump’s economic policies accused the administration of reneging on its pledge to cut “red tape and regulations.” In reality, administration officials on Tuesday admitted that the food-box plan — which the president’s budget director Mick Mulvaney compared to the Blue Apron grocery delivery service — had virtually no chance of being implemented anytime soon. Instead, the idea, according to two administration officials who worked on the proposal, was a political gambit by fiscal hawks in the administration aimed at outraging liberals and stirring up members of the president’s own party working on the latest version of the farm bill. The move, they said, was intended to lay down a marker that the administration is serious about pressing for about $85 billion in other cuts to food assistance programs that will be achieved, in part, by imposing strict new work requirements on recipients.

"It’s not often that I’m offended on Ivanka Trump’s behalf, but I now find myself in that exceedingly strange position. And I clearly have some explaining to do. Last week the Winter Olympics got underway in South Korea. The country’s archenemy, North Korea, sent a delegation of athletes, cheerleaders and so-called dignitaries. This was a big development, given that North Korea is a rogue state run by a homicidal fanatic, Kim Jong-un, who gleefully threatens to nuke other countries, with the United States at the top of his list. So a buffet of news stories and a smorgasbord of tweets were obviously warranted. But I saw far too little coverage that gasped at the audacity of the North Koreans’ attempts to pawn themselves off as the good-natured emissaries of a normal place. I saw too much that marveled, almost appreciatively, at their wiles. I saw rapt descriptions of the outfits and expressions worn by Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, the first member of her family to visit South Korea since the Korean War. I saw the phrase “charm offensive.” North Koreans as international coquettes looking for a diplomatic do-over? If you can square that with Otto Warmbier’s moribund condition when he was finally sprung from a North Korean gulag and mailed back, like expired meat, to his devastated parents, then you’re a nimbler moralist than I. Where does Ivanka come in? The response to North Korea’s overtures at the Olympics was epitomized by what quickly became a popular characterization of Kim Yo-jong. South Korean journalists called her “North Korea’s Ivanka.” Straight-faced American journalists repeated it. "
"WASHINGTON — Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee has been reconsidering his decision to retire this year, but Mr. Corker’s hopes for retaining his seat are running into a potentially insurmountable object: President Trump. Just over four months after Mr. Corker, upon declaring he would retire, unleashed a biting series of attacks on Mr. Trump, the president is refusing to bless his friend-turned-foe’s effort to re-enter the Republican primary race. Instead, in a telephone conversation last week, Mr. Trump offered encouragement to Representative Marsha Blackburn, a conservative lawmaker and White House ally who has emerged as the favorite to win the Republican nomination for Mr. Corker’s seat, according to three Republicans familiar with the call. Mr. Trump’s West Wing advisers, their memories still fresh from Mr. Corker’s jibes, are urging the president to resist entreaties from the senator and a handful of his colleagues who worry that the seat could slip from Republican hands in November. They are showing Mr. Trump polling that indicates how steep of a climb Mr. Corker would face in a primary campaign. If Mr. Trump does not change course, his silence could effectively doom any hopes Mr. Corker has for seeking a third term. The president is highly popular among Tennessee Republicans and may be the only person who could reverse Mr. Corker’s standing with primary voters, who have soured on him since he portrayed Mr. Trump as a juvenile in need of day care, whose instability may push the country into World War III. And without Mr. Trump’s direct intervention, Ms. Blackburn is highly unlikely to bow to Mr. Corker. “Marsha Blackburn is not getting out of this race regardless of who gets in,” said Ward Baker, the Nashville-area lawmaker’s chief strategist. "
"WASHINGTON — An immigration debate on Tuesday in the Senate that promised to be freewheeling and democratic got off instead to a rocky start, with Democrats and Republicans in a standoff over how the debate should proceed. But even as the floor debate faltered, a bipartisan group of senators was working behind the scenes to draft an immigration proposal that could garner the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster. At stake is the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers, who have been shielded from deportation under an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. President Trump has rescinded the program, which is set to expire March 5, and has given lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, had set aside this week for debate on legislation that would protect the young immigrants, and address other matters including border security and the wall that the president has proposed on the southern border. In an early morning Twitter post on Tuesday, Mr. Trump cast the debate as the Dreamers’ “last chance,” and encouraged the two parties to work together. “Negotiations on DACA have begun,” the president wrote. “Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5.” But in the Capitol, Mr. McConnell and his Democratic counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, were unable to come to terms on an agreement that would get the debate underway in earnest.

"For the second time in two months, a federal judge has stepped into an intense political fight over immigration policy, issuing an injunction that orders the Trump administration to keep in place the embattled program known as DACA, which protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation. The nationwide injunction, issued on Tuesday by Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, came one month after a court in California also ruled that the administration needed to spare DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Judge Garaufis’s ruling in many ways echoed the one issued by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco. But it also offered additional reasons for why DACA should remain in place as the case continues through the courts, and it detailed the harms that its repeal would cause to young immigrants and others. On Sept. 5, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced that the Trump administration planned to end DACA gradually, saying that the program had been unconstitutionally established by President Barack Obama in 2012. Under the rollback, the Department of Homeland Security is still considering pending DACA applications and renewal requests from recipients who filed by Oct. 5. But the department plans to reject all applications after that. After Mr. Sessions’s announcement, a coalition of immigration lawyers and a group of 16 Democratic state attorneys general, led by Eric Schneiderman of New York, filed separate but linked lawsuits in Brooklyn, claiming that the repeal of DACA was an “arbitrary and capricious” decision largely motivated by a “racial animus” against Latinos. In his ruling, Judge Garaufis agreed with the lawyers that the rollback was arbitrary and capricious; but while he has vociferously criticized Mr. Trump from the bench for his anti-immigrant tweets and public statements, the judge made no mention of racial animus in his findings. Under the ruling, the government will now have to maintain DACA as it was before the Sept. 5 announcement. But it does not have to accept new applications, Judge Garaufis wrote, and it can decide renewal requests on a case-by-case basis. While Judge Garaufis noted that he was “sympathetic” to those who were unable to apply for DACA before Sept. 5, he added that the injunction would not apply to them. The immigration lawyers who brought the case nonetheless hailed his ruling as a victory. “During a week when the Senate is having a battle over immigration, we now have two judges saying that what happened on Sept. 5 was not justified,” said Marisol Orihuela, a lawyer from the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School. “This sends a clear message to lawmakers to act and pass something.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Budget Favors Military, Inflating Deficit” (front page, Feb. 13): The recent budget proposal by this administration makes my head spin. What I want to say to members of Congress is no! That’s my money you’re spending. This administration seems to think that America is a piggy bank that can be tapped at will. The proposed deficit is frightening in its scope and should be cause for major alarm for future generations. Where is the outcry? Where is the outrage to counter the profligate spending spree that’s being considered on Capitol Hill? Regardless of which party you belong to or support, sound fiscal management is what grown-ups do to secure our stability and progress — now and for the future. Tell our legislators, that’s my money you’re spending! If you say nothing now, there’s no point in complaining later. BARBARA BELLMAN, PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: Re “Mr. Trump’s Nasty Budget” (editorial, Feb. 13): President Trump’s slashing of Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps is Robin Hood in reverse, robbing from the poor in desperate need and giving to his wealthy supporters through tax cuts. The thievery is most pronounced with his proposed Medicare cuts. Working-class families paid into Medicare all their lives out of their meager incomes with the expectation that it would help pay their medical bills in their old age. Mr. Trump’s proposed cuts would effectively steal from those lifelong contributions by significantly reducing the benefits. Is there no shame? ROBERT J. FIRESTONE, NEW YORK To the Editor: "
"[See Westminster dog show photos from 2021.] Flynn the bichon frisé was crowned Best in Show at the 142nd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Tuesday night. The champion, a jovial 5-year-old, cut a striking, cloudlike figure in the ring: His powder-puff fur was painstakingly coifed, and he trotted jauntily across the floor with a step that looked almost lighter than air. “It feels a little unreal,” Bill McFadden, his handler, said. “I came in expecting nothing and just hoping for a good performance and I think I got it.” McFadden, who has been showing the breed at the Westminster Dog Show since 1991, said he believed this would be Flynn’s final year at the competition. He turns 6 in March. “I’d have to ask the owners, but I’m pretty sure I can drop the mic and say he’s retired,” McFadden told Fox Sports. Seven finalists had a shot at greatness this year. Aside from Flynn, Lucy the regal borzoi, a silly pug named Biggie and Slick the joyful Border collie won their groups on Monday night (hound, toy, nonsporting and herding). Ty the giant schnauzer, a winsome Sussex spaniel named Bean and Winston the impossibly cute Norfolk terrier advanced on Tuesday in the sporting, working and terrier groups. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump suggested on Tuesday that the United States was likely to impose restrictions on imported metals, reviving the prospects for a continuing investigation whose future has been called into question amid months of pushback and delays. Meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the president said such restrictions would help save struggling steel companies from foreign competitors that “dump” low-priced metal on American markets. “What we’re talking about is tariffs and/or quotas,” Mr. Trump said. The White House had billed the meeting as a listening session to let lawmakers air concerns about pending actions on aluminum and steel imports, as well as Mr. Trump’s infrastructure plan that was proposed on Monday and current trade measures like the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In April, the president began twin investigations into imports of steel and aluminum under the little used Section 232 of a 1962 trade law, which permits sweeping restrictions to protect national security. Supporters of the action say American metal makers badly need the assistance to survive and continue producing planes, armored vehicles and other products for the military. But the measure also has plenty of critics, who fear that such restrictions amount to a protectionist grab by metal makers and will raise prices for steel and aluminum. They argue that because the metals are widely used to make other products, other industries — including automobile manufacturers and food packagers — would suffer. That pushback, which has garnered the sympathy of many pro-trade Republicans, appears to have turned a trade action that the White House initially viewed as relatively straightforward into a more extended affair.

"To the Editor: Re “With Wall, House Panel’s Partisan Divisions Will Be Literal” (news article, Feb. 9): The House Intelligence Committee has historically worked on a bipartisan basis, with staff members sitting together in a secure office because of their classified work. That is why I was shocked to learn that Republicans on the committee have decided to physically separate Republican and Democratic staff members in the committee’s secure spaces. The construction of a partition to separate staff is a physical manifestation of a dire problem in Washington. Republicans and Democrats are polarized, and a lack of meaningful dialogue has contributed to the gridlock. The Trump administration has demonized our intelligence community, and the House Intelligence Committee’s chairman, Devin Nunes, has fed those partisan flames. Separating the Democratic and Republican staff members of a bipartisan committee will further endanger the bipartisan approach to national security.

"WASHINGTON — One week after Rob Porter, his staff secretary, resigned amid spousal abuse allegations, President Trump said on Wednesday that he was “totally opposed to domestic violence,” his first condemnation of the alleged conduct behind a scandal that has engulfed the White House. His statement, which members of both parties had said was long overdue, came as John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, faced new questions about his handling of Mr. Porter’s case, including how he could have held a temporary high-level security clearance for more than a year in light of the allegations, and as committees in both the House and the Senate announced they would investigate the circumstances surrounding the granting of Mr. Porter’s clearance. Mr. Kelly told senior aides last fall to put an immediate end to granting new interim security clearances like the one given to Mr. Porter and directed them to resolve any issues preventing employees who held them at the time from receiving a full clearance, according to two people familiar with the discussion. At a meeting in the West Wing, Mr. Kelly said he was assigning Kirstjen Nielsen, then his deputy, to enforce the new policy, the people said. But it is not known whether Mr. Kelly, Ms. Nielsen or any other senior officials sought to delve into why Mr. Porter was operating with only an interim clearance. Mr. Porter resigned last week after allegations that he had abused his two former wives were reported by The Daily Mail. In the following days, Mr. Trump repeatedly declined to comment publicly on the episode — or on the issue of domestic violence — even as he went out of his way to praise Mr. Porter and express sympathy with him, noting that he had denied the accusations. But during a tax event on Wednesday at the White House, the president finally weighed in, saying: “I’m totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind. Everyone knows that, and it almost wouldn’t even have to be said.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. I’m occasionally going to use this newsletter to update readers about the situation in Puerto Rico, because I think it’s important to keep the crisis there fresh in our minds. There isn’t nearly enough political pressure on the federal government to help the people of Puerto Rico. The basics. Almost five months after Hurricane Maria hit the island, about 25 percent of residents still lack electrical power. The official death toll is only 64, but The Times has estimated that the real number may be 1,052. Thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the island for Florida, and experts estimate that as many as 300,000 more could leave if significant rebuilding doesn’t take place. Without wholesale rebuilding, “the island is likely to find itself back in the same place after the next big storm,” Mekela Panditharatne, an environmental lawyer, wrote in an op-ed this week. Anxiety and depression have surged among the island’s residents. (For more on the brewing mental-health crisis, listen to Caitlin Dickerson on “The Daily” podcast.) Government failures. The federal response has been plagued by mistakes, waste and apparent cronyism. An Atlanta company with a single employee and a spotty record received a $156 million contract to deliver 30 million freeze-dried meals to the island, for example. The company delivered only 50,000. And boxes of food and water stockpiled in a government office in Florida were infested by rats, Bianca Padró Ocasio of The Orlando Sentinel reported last week. As for the cronyism: Whitefish Energy — a Montana-based company with personal ties to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s interior secretary — received a $300 million contract last year to restore power. Whitefish employed only two full-time employees on the day Maria made landfall. The Puerto Rican government terminated the contract after its questionable terms prompted investigations. Looking ahead. To stay up to date on Puerto Rico’s progress, I recommend following The Tampa Bay Times, The Orlando Sentinel and Patricia Mazzei, The Times’s Miami bureau chief. If you want to do something to help, my colleague Nick Kristof suggests donating to the Children’s Health Fund or the Hispanic Federation. In September, The Times’s Niraj Chokshi recommended several other charities. In other news. Democrats’ strong overall performance in special elections has continued this week. Last night, the party won a Florida legislative seat in a district that President Trump had won in 2016. Democrats also continued to show signs of progress in Oklahoma. But there have also been signs of how much work Democrats have to do to take back Congress. The party fared even worse in a Georgia district last night than it had in 2016, a reminder of how strong Republicans remain in the Deep South. And on Monday, Democrats failed to flip a winnable Minnesota statehouse seat, largely because of mediocre turnout from their base. "
"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — In their first and second games together at the Olympic Games, the players on the unified Korean women’s ice hockey team suffered humiliating shutout losses against Switzerland and Sweden. But for the only team to compete here with athletes from both North and South Korea, a 4-1 loss against Japan on Wednesday night was the most painful defeat. In what has been an Olympics rife with geopolitical undertones, the game between Japan and Korea was the most political of all, pitting the unified Korean team’s players against rivals from the country of their former colonial occupiers. “I would say the games against Japan, more than anything else, have been something that have brought the North and South Koreans together,” said Randi Heesoo Griffin, who scored the only Korean goal. “We’ve been saying we really need to win this game.” Symbolically, the showdown was much more than a meeting between teams ranked ninth and 22nd internationally. The colonial legacy lingers over any game played between Japanese and Korean teams. This one was played in an especially heated atmosphere: Before the Pyeongchang Olympics began, tensions between the Japanese and South Korean governments had been building over longstanding disputes about history and territory.

"NEW DELHI — The United States has indicated that it will seek to place Pakistan on a watch list of countries that are not doing enough to counter terrorism financing, threatening Islamabad with global isolation, according to a senior Pakistani official. The United States is likely to introduce the motion next week in Paris, where the Financial Action Task Force, a global body created to fight terrorism financing and money laundering, will vote on the matter, the official, Miftah Ismail, a financial adviser to Pakistan’s prime minister, said. Pakistan was on the list from 2012 to 2015, and officials worry that being added again could hinder the country’s access to international markets as it prepares to repay roughly $3 billion in debt this summer. In an effort to stave off returning to the list, Pakistan has quietly adopted sanctions against two groups that the United States accuses of being fronts for the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, moving to seize their schools, ambulances and other assets this week. The United States has been trying for years to get Islamabad to move against Lashkar-e-Taiba, which India accuses of being behind the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai that shut down the city for several days and killed more than 160 people. “We’re talking to the U.S. and trying to get them not to take any action against Pakistan,” Mr. Ismail said by telephone. “I think they’re listening to us and I’m more than hopeful we won’t be gray-listed.” But his optimistic tone faded as he recalled a meeting with United States Treasury officials this month. The Pakistani delegation walked away with the impression that “they are still going to put us on the gray list,” he said, calling the Trump administration’s foreign policy inconsistent. "
"WASHINGTON — A broad bipartisan group of senators reached agreement Wednesday on a narrow rewrite of the nation’s immigration laws that would bolster border security and resolve the fate of the so-called Dreamers, even as President Trump suggested he would veto any plan that does not adhere to his harder-line approach. Their compromise legislation sets up a clash pitting the political center of the Senate against Mr. Trump and the Republican congressional leadership. Senators in both parties have been racing against a self-imposed end-of-the-week deadline to write legislation that could win wide support by increasing border security while at the same time offering a path to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Members of the bipartisan group, which calls itself the Common Sense Coalition, said their deal does just that. They were working Wednesday evening to determine whether their bill could garner the 60 votes necessary to break a filibuster. “The president’s going to have a vote on his concept. I don’t think it will get 60 votes,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the group, adding: “The bottom line then is: What do you do next? You can do what we’ve done for the last 35 years — blame each other. Or you can actually start fixing the broken immigration system. If you came out of this with strong border security — the president getting his wall and the Dream Act population being taken care of — most Americans would applaud.” "

"Congress is now considering long-overdue legislation that authorizes faster access to internationally stored electronic data needed to prosecute serious crime and disrupt terrorist plots in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. The legislation, the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act, would preserve law and order, advance the United States’ leadership in cybersecurity, ease restrictions on American businesses and enhance privacy standards globally. This is a priority for both of our governments. American efforts to investigate crime and terrorism are increasingly impeded by a lack of access to data stored outside the country, even when it is held by companies subject to United States jurisdiction. Britain and other allied foreign governments face similar problems. All too often, officials in one country investigating a serious crime with victims in that very same country cannot get data they need simply because it is on a server halfway across the world. The internet is moving fast, and our legal constructs are not keeping up. This leaves tech companies in the difficult position of having to withhold information that could protect public safety. To make matters worse, a case at the United States Supreme Court could leave our governments and others with no effective way to obtain vital evidence of serious crimes. Oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 27 in that case, which asks whether Microsoft may comply with a United States warrant to disclose information related to an American crime stored on a cloud server in Ireland. Microsoft argues that it cannot. Fortunately, there is a legislative solution to this problem that advances a model that empowers law enforcement. The Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Chris Coons of Delaware, and members of the House have proposed legislation that would clarify the legal authority of the United States to obtain data stored in another country, and would authorize special agreements to resolve potential conflicts of law. The bill would authorize the attorney general to enter into such agreements, but only with allies that respect privacy and protect civil liberties, and that have records of promoting and defending due process. The first one would be with Britain, which already has the authority to enter into such a pact. These agreements would not apply to foreign judicial orders directed at American citizens, or anyone in the United States, for that matter. Instead, the bill would promote swift justice among nations that share a common commitment to the rule of law, while protecting the privacy and safety of our citizens. The prime minister has stressed the great importance of the legislation to British authorities investigating criminal and terrorist activity. One of us, Paddy McGuinness, has testified before both houses of Congress to make the case for this change. President Trump adopted this priority upon taking office as part of his call for lawful access to information. "
"Certain issues have become so noisy and stigmatized that they seem to be all-consuming and invisible at once. Abortion is one of them, and Katie Watson wants to change how Americans talk about it — when, that is, they deign to truly talk about it at all. Rates of abortion may be on the decline, largely because of long-term contraceptive use, but as Watson points out in “Scarlet A: The Ethics, Law, & Politics of Ordinary Abortion,” the procedure is far from a fringe practice. Nearly one in five American pregnancies ends in abortion (a number that doesn’t include “spontaneous abortions,” the medical term for miscarriages). Nearly one in four American women will have an abortion in her lifetime. Yet silence perpetuates a belief that abortion is atypical, even when the statistics say otherwise. The conversational void is then filled by advocates on both sides, who emphasize what Watson calls “extraordinary abortion.” Abortion rights activists highlight severe fetal abnormalities and pregnant 12-year-olds; anti-abortion activists highlight pregnancies that are terminated after viability. Such cases are all too real, but fixating on them distorts our understanding of what abortion ordinarily is. Instead of the most common cases, the ones “we discuss most are the ones that occur least,” Watson writes. “There’s something unreal about the American abortion conversation.” Watson, a bioethicist at Northwestern’s medical school and a senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, comes to the debate with her own convictions. Forty-five years ago, with Roe v. Wade, “abortion was correctly identified as a constitutionally protected right, and it must remain legal,” she writes. “That’s not negotiable for me.” What she wants to do is engage directly with the fact that the majority of Americans, even those in favor of abortion’s legality, have deeply ambivalent feelings about abortion itself. “We should be able to acknowledge the complexity of private decision making,” she writes, “without threatening the right of private decision making.” As a guide to the various ways of thinking about abortion, “Scarlet A” is readable and respectful — and therefore, in its own quiet way, revolutionary. Katha Pollitt’s excellent “Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights” (2014) was also addressed to those Americans in the “muddled middle” of the debate, though Pollitt explicitly set out to persuade them that abortion, by allowing women a measure of control over childbearing and therefore their lives, was an unequivocal moral good. Watson’s goal with “Scarlet A” — to get Americans to just start talking with one another — is less polemical but no less difficult, at least in this distrustful day and age. "
"In his meticulously crafted Netflix special “Tamborine,” Chris Rock says Donald J. Trump might just work out as president, then takes a moment to listen to the silence of the crowd at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. “Yeah, I said it,” he adds, in what has become something of a catchphrase for him. Wearing a simple black T-shirt and jeans, Mr. Rock, 53, made his case based not on Mr. Trump’s potential, but rather on how his disastrous tenure could lead to something better, reminding the audience that the mistakes of George W. Bush led to Barack Obama. “People overlook George Bush’s contribution to black history,” he joked. This was one of the few bits in this triumphant comeback special, posted Wednesday, that I don’t recall from his show in Durham, N.C., exactly one year ago, the opening night of his “Total Blackout” tour. Major chunks of material were the same, yet the comedy still seemed transformed. This special, his first in a decade, is more searching and confessional than his previous work, digging into the end of his marriage after 16 years. He has honed this material, beefing up jokes and cutting out fat, and his comedy has become tighter, funnier if also slicker, shifting from a story of a comic struggling with demons to one describing how he once was lost and now he’s found. Mr. Rock’s humor has long married a supremely controlled craft with an appealing sense of danger. “Yeah, I said it” lets you know he wasn’t supposed to. When he started in New York clubs in the 1980s, he closed some sets by saying: “I was in South Africa the other day. Or was it Boston?” After telling that joke on “The Arsenio Hall Show,” the host asked him if he ever worried that his jokes would upset people. Mr. Rock responded that his next target would be Johnny Carson because of a tabloid report that he had a black grandchild he did not financially support. Mr. Hall cut him off, abruptly ending the interview. "
"President Trump has been nothing if not bold in his promises to generate supercharged economic growth. When a report showed a strong 3.3 percent growth rate last fall, he said, “I see no reason why we don’t go to 4 percent, 5 percent, and even 6 percent,” and he has spoken wistfully of emerging economies where growth can reach higher than that. Even if you treat those musings as presidential bombast, his administration is making detailed projections that the economy will expand much faster in the decade ahead than it has in recent years — a forecast that underpins the Trump policy agenda. The administration forecasts growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent through the next decade, compared with around 2 percent projected by private forecasters and the economists at the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve. If the administration’s forecast comes true, it will imply an economy 12 percent bigger in 2028 than that projected by the more cautious forecasts — an extra $2.8 trillion in economic activity that year, in today’s dollars. But when you look closely at the details of the forecast, not all of it quite adds up. To come true, it would require  some of the strongest improvements in productivity seen in decades, yet also require that interest rates not react the way they have historically when growth strengthens.

"AMMAN, Jordan — President Trump threatened to retaliate against aid recipients like Jordan for having denounced his decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But on Wednesday, his top diplomat gave Jordan more money. In a remarkably cordial reception that contrasted sharply with Vice President Mike Pence’s visit last month, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson signed an agreement that guarantees Jordan nearly $1.3 billion in annual assistance from the United States for the next five years. The aid pact, an increase over the roughly $1 billion in current annual aid to Jordan, was all the more striking because the Trump administration has proposed eliminating much of America’s foreign assistance budget. The increase partly reflected Jordan’s longtime role as an important partner in fighting extremism in the region and housing millions of refugees from the Syria war. But it also appeared to show the value the administration places on Jordan regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even though Jordan was among the 128 members of the United Nations that voted to condemn the United States two months ago over Mr. Trump’s decision on Jerusalem, the contested holy city that Palestinians want part of as their future capital. Mr. Trump and his United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, vowed back then to “take names” and remember how American aid recipients had voted, implying their assistance would be cut. "
"A scathing report released Wednesday found “serious derelictions” in a 10-day, $122,000 business trip the secretary of veterans affairs took to Europe, which included airfare for his wife and extensive sightseeing. According to the report, Secretary David J. Shulkin traveled to Denmark and London for meetings about health care for veterans, accompanied by his wife, a small staff and a six-person security detail, but nearly half of his time was spent visiting castles and other tourist sites. “This was time that should have been spent conducting official V.A. business and not providing personal travel concierge services to Secretary Shulkin and his wife,” Inspector General Michael J. Missal concluded in the report. To justify paying for the secretary’s wife’s $4,000 airfare, the report said, the department’s chief of staff altered an email to indicate that Dr. Shulkin and his wife had been specifically invited to an honorary dinner in Denmark, when in fact they had not. While the couple were in London, the report found, they improperly accepted tickets to a tennis match at Wimbledon. Dr. Shulkin is one of several cabinet secretaries to be accused of lavish spending on travel. Tom Price was dismissed as secretary of health and human services over his use of private jets. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s military parade will not come cheap. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, estimated on Wednesday that the public display of America’s military might that Mr. Trump has called for could cost between $10 million and $30 million, and said the government would have to come up with a way to cover the cost. Funding for the parade was not included in the White House’s 2019 budget request, which was released on Monday, because it was a relatively new idea, Mr. Mulvaney said at a House Budget Committee hearing on Wednesday. He explained that the final cost would be determined by the size, scope and length of the parade. “We will continue to work with you folks if we decide to continue forward with this initiative,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “Of course, you’d have to appropriate funds for it or we would have to find funds that we’ve already appropriated.” Stan Collender, a former staff member on the House and Senate budget committees, said that the funding for the parade could be found without a formal budget request by using existing money already in the Department of Defense budget or possibly from the Department of Homeland Security or the National Park Service. The president has said that he wants to celebrate the armed forces with a spectacle akin to the Bastille Day parade in France. The last such celebration in Washington occurred in the summer 1991 when the end of the relatively brief Persian Gulf War was celebrated with a $12 million dollar victory parade. "
"In the waning days of 2016, during a news conference at a music festival in Australia, the singer-songwriter Amanda Palmer made a prediction: “Donald Trump is going to make punk rock great again,” she said. “We’re all going to crawl down staircases into basements and speakeasies and make amazing satirically political art.” Around the same time, Mac McCaughan, the singer, guitarist and songwriter for the North Carolina-based indie-rock band Superchunk, was spending a lot of time in his Durham basement, writing songs. He’d heard predictions like Ms. Palmer’s. In fact, this idea that conservative governance spurs outbursts of artistic protest from progressive-minded musicians is almost conventional wisdom. It dates back at least as far as the political and musical convulsions of the 1960s, and was renewed in the late ’70s and early ’80s, when pioneering punk bands like the Clash, the Jam and the Minutemen were viewed as an antidote to the conservative politics of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. But Mr. McCaughan wasn’t buying it. “In the aftermath of the election, I was definitely not someone saying, ‘Well, at least there will be all this great protest music,’” he said in a telephone interview. “I’d happily never make another record if it meant this administration wasn’t in power. Most protest music is terrible. It’s pedantic, it’s usually preaching to the choir.” And yet the album that grew from Mr. McCaughan’s sojourns to his cellar seems to fulfill Ms. Palmer’s prophecy. “What a Time to Be Alive,” Superchunk’s 11th studio album, is filled with the same sort of noisy, tuneful, hyperkinetic guitar rock the band has been bashing out for nearly 30 years, with one key difference: Despite almost never showcasing his political beliefs in Superchunk’s music previously, Mr. McCaughan has focused pretty much all 11 songs on the new album on the challenge of living and surviving in Trump’s America. “It’d be weird to live in the world now and make a record that ignored what was going on,” Mr. McCaughan said.

"Near the end of 2015, the playwright Lindsey Ferrentino and the actress Jamie Brewer were watching clips of Donald J. Trump, then a candidate, appearing to mock a reporter with a physical disability. They were horrified — which made their work on a new play, centered on a character with Down syndrome, all the more significant. “From that point forward, the play took on a new meaning for me,” Ms. Ferrentino said. “Big time,” Ms. Brewer added. “Watching you watch that video, seeing your reaction to it, you cried,” Ms. Ferrentino said, turning to her. “I was emotional,” Ms. Brewer said. The play, “Amy and the Orphans,” which opens March 1 in a Roundabout Theater Company production at the Laura Pels Theater, is a barrier-breaking show. Ms. Brewer, 33, and her understudy, Edward Barbanell, 40, are thought to be the only known performers with Down syndrome to play the lead in an Off Broadway or Broadway theater production. The show is about three siblings who reunite after their father’s death, and the road trip that follows. Ms. Ferrentino, who debuted with the critically acclaimed play “Ugly Lies the Bone,” in 2015, was insistent that the title role be played by someone with the disability, even leaving a note in an early draft of the script: “Finding a talented actor with Down syndrome isn’t difficult. So please do it.” Ms. Brewer is a veteran actress best known for her groundbreaking work on the television series “American Horror Story.” Mr. Barbanell, who goes by Eddie, played Billy in the 2005 movie “The Ringer,” starring Johnny Knoxville. He and Ms. Brewer have performed onstage for much of their lives. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) There are many ways elected officials can respond to criticism from their local newspaper. A letter to the editor. A call to the publisher. A tweet. Or they can just ignore it. Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican at the center of the storm over the release of a classified memorandum challenging the F.B.I. investigation of President Trump and Russia, has come up with a response particularly fitting for our times: He has created his own news site, a curation of news from both nonpartisan and partisan sources. It is called “The California Republican.” Some of the headlines on The Republican, the existence of which was first reported by Politico, have little to do with Mr. Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. But others provide the defense of Mr. Nunes that he may have found lacking in more conventional news media. “There’s another memo you haven’t heard about. What’s in it?” reads one headline, referring to a memorandum written by Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “The Grassley-Graham memo appears to back up the now-famous Nunes memo, according to National Review.” It’s not all-Nunes-all-the-time. Another article pointed to the latest cost overruns involving the high-speed train Gov. Jerry Brown is trying to build in California, over the objections of California Republicans, among them, Mr. Nunes. It’s hard to fault Mr. Nunes for being unhappy with his press coverage. An editorial in The Fresno Bee, for example, referred to Mr. Nunes as “Trump’s stooge.” "
"Barnaby Joyce was probably the last politician average Australians would expect to be embroiled in a sex scandal. A comparison to Mike Pence isn’t so far-fetched: They’re both second in charge of a conservative government led by a flashy businessman, and standard-bearers for family values, tilled in the nation’s agrarian heartland. For most of the Australian public, Mr. Joyce was a bumbling farm boy who meant well. Last week, though, a story broke that turned public sentiment against him. Following investigations by two small websites last year, the Sydney-based Daily Telegraph reported that the deputy prime minister was having a child with a former staff member, Vikki Campion. A photo on the front page of the tabloid showed Ms. Campion, pregnant and unwitting, crossing the street. (“Bundle of Joyce” said the headline.) That this story, like so many others, involves personal hypocrisy is hardly surprising. Mr. Joyce has been a strident opponent of gay marriage, basing his opposition in part on what he has called his four daughters’ right to a “secure relationship with a loving husband” and the right of every child “to know her or his mother and father.” What is more noteworthy is the degree to which the Joyce affair has sparked a long-overdue debate about the deference Australian media still accords politicians when it comes to their private lives. Mr. Joyce’s relationship with Ms. Campion, we’ve learned in the past few days, was an open secret among the Canberra press corps. Back in October, Sharri Markson, the reporter who eventually got the print scoop, wrote a piece alluding to a “deeply personal crisis” in Mr. Joyce’s life. Now that the story’s out there, it’s very easy to read between the lines about “vicious rumors” and “personal pressures” in dozens of media clips from last year. The deputy prime minister’s private situation was well known enough that he got into a pub brawl with a constituent about it last year and apparently knocked the man’s hat off. Did the media choose not report on Mr. Joyce because they didn’t have all the facts? Perhaps in part. As the national broadsheet The Australian has reported, repeated inquiries about Ms. Campion’s multiple job titles, let alone her taxpayer-funded salary, were met with stonewalling. Mr. Joyce would refuse to talk about the relationship when they asked. (This week, he released a statement denying that the relationship, and Ms. Campion’s employment in the government, breached ministerial rules.) Another major consideration is that Australian journalists face extremely strict libel laws, the kind Donald Trump would appreciate. And yet The Telegraph wasn’t congratulated by its peers for nailing down a tough story — if anything, it was condemned, with concerns raised about hurting the feelings of Mr. Joyce’s daughters (as if their feelings had not already been hurt); the tawdriness of a long-lens picture of a pregnant woman (undeniable, but perhaps an unfortunate byproduct of those stringent libel laws, which demand absolute proof); and the sentiment that “we’re no saints ourselves.” "
"JERUSALEM — As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fought back Wednesday against a police finding that he had accepted nearly $300,000 in bribes, his cool self-confidence betrayed not the slightest worry that he could be forced to step down anytime soon. “The coalition is stable, and no one, me or anyone else, has plans to go to elections,” he declared in Tel Aviv. “We will continue to work together with you for the citizens of the State of Israel, until the end of our term,” in late 2019. If Mr. Netanyahu had entered a dangerous new period in which he must battle for his political survival and avoid imprisonment, he did so possessed of political advantages that no Israeli prime minister has before enjoyed. Beloved by his base and respected even by his adversaries as a guardian of Israel’s security, Mr. Netanyahu remains the dominant figure on the Israeli stage, his combined 12 years as prime minister closing in on the record of David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s principal founder. And he has defended that position in part by steadily chipping away at the institutions that balance the powers of his office in ways that seem to echo the aggressive tactics of President Trump, except that he was doing it before there was a President Trump. He and his governing coalition have campaigned to curb the activist Israeli judiciary, demonized the rambunctious press as a bastion of left-wing partisans, attacked the funding of nongovernmental organizations whose worldview they see as hostile and, as the police closed in, he has done his utmost to discredit them, too.

"WASHINGTON — AT&T is seeking to put the head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division on its witness list in a trial over the government’s decision to block the phone giant’s $85 billion merger with Time Warner, according to two people with knowledge of the pretrial activity. The company’s request for the antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, to testify is highly unusual. By putting Mr. Delrahim on the witness list, AT&T is effectively forcing him to defend his own decision to oppose the blockbuster merger. The trial over the Justice Department’s lawsuit to stop the deal is scheduled to begin on March 19. “I never heard of something like that happening in my time there,” said John M. Newman, an assistant professor of antitrust law at the University of Memphis School of Law and a former trial lawyer for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “It’s a big nasty move to poke a finger at the other side by calling its counsel as a witness.” Mr. Delrahim was included in a list of witnesses submitted to the court by AT&T in recent days, according to two people with knowledge about the company’s demands, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential. AT&T has also asked for internal communications between Mr. Delrahim’s office and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they said. As part of that request, AT&T has also asked for email, phone and other communications between the White House and officials in the Justice Department, the people said. AT&T and Time Warner announced their $85 billion deal in October 2016. If completed, it would create a media and telecom giant with AT&T’s wireless and satellite television service and Time Warner’s movies and television assets. The combination is expected to transform the media landscape and set up the company to have a powerful grip over how consumers get streaming entertainment over mobile devices. But the Justice Department sued to block the merger last November. Mr. Delrahim and other officials said the combination of telecom and media giants would harm competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. "
"WASHINGTON — In Pennsylvania, a Republican lawmaker unhappy with a State Supreme Court ruling on gerrymandering wants to impeach the Democratic justices who authored it. In Iowa, a running dispute over allowing firearms in courthouses has prompted bills by Republican sponsors to slash judges’ pay and require them to personally pay rent for courtrooms that are gun-free. In North Carolina, the Republican Party is working on sweeping changes to rein in state courts that have repeatedly undercut or blocked laws passed by the legislature. Rather than simply fighting judicial rulings, elected officials in some states across the country — largely Republicans, but Democrats as well — are increasingly seeking to punish or restrain judges who hand down unfavorable decisions, accusing them of making law instead of interpreting it. Civil liberties advocates and other critics have a different take: The real law-flouting, they say, is by politicians who want to punish justices whose decisions offend their own ideological leanings. Court-bashing is nothing new. As far back as the 1800s, New Hampshire’s legislature disbanded the state’s Supreme Court five times, said Bill Raftery, a senior analyst at the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., who has tracked legislation affecting the judicial system for years.

"You’ve been a White House correspondent for 21 years. To some extent, there’s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn’t like, but nothing compared with this. There’s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term “fake news” — he’s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press. What’s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It’s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you’re getting more in the weeds of what’s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don’t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it’s not about journalists; it’s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you’re bashing the idea of getting truth out. What’s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We’re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn’t know the person’s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don’t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too. Your reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I’m so sad about that. My boss has always said, “You need to know how to play poker.” I don’t. I’m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people’s minds being in the gutter after President Trump’s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don’t play to the camera. I go in there, and I’m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much. "
"WASHINGTON — As the Census Bureau finalizes the questions for the 2020 census, key voices in the Trump administration are pressing for surveyors to ask one critical question: Are you a United States citizen? Advocates of the so-called citizenship question say it is merely clerical, an effort to ascertain how many noncitizens reside in the United States. But the question would have broad ramifications, not only for the politics of redistricting that will emerge from the census but for an issue that goes beyond partisanship: public health. The fear is that immigrants — even those in the country legally — will not participate in any government-sponsored questionnaire that could expose them, their family members or friends to deportation. But low response rates from any demographic group would undermine the validity of the next decade of health statistics and programs, health experts warn. Scientists use census data to understand the distribution of health conditions across the United States population. In turn, officials use the data to target interventions and distribute federal funding. “Data is the lifeblood of public health; it needs to be transparent and objective,” said Edward L. Hunter, the former chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Washington office and now the president of the de Beaumont Foundation, which focuses on public health. “The census will have cascading effects upon every rate, every percentage, every trend we monitor over time. It’s very unsettling for people who need to use that data.” The debate is heating up as a critical deadline approaches: The Census Bureau says it must submit a final list of the 2020 census questions to Congress by March 31. In a December document first reported by ProPublica, the Department of Justice argued that inquiring about citizenship status in the decennial census was critical to enforcing Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against racial discrimination in voting. Measuring the total number of citizens of voting age in a region is vital to understanding voting rights violations, the department argued. "
"R
ussia is a land of stories. Stories of the czar and his people, of Lenin and the revolution, of the Great Patriotic War; of the transformation of a backward land into a mighty, modern industrial state; of Sputnik, of Laika, of Gagarin. Then the story of Stalin’s reign of terror, the story of a country that ossified and stagnated and eventually collapsed, the story of Vladimir Putin, the K.G.B. officer who climbed to power amid chaos and re-established order. And how did he do that? With stories of the past, retold in such a way that everything in them led up to and justified the Russia that exists today. For almost my entire life, these stories have exerted a powerful pull on me. When I was growing up, Russia was not only closed, and therefore mysterious, it was presented as our antithesis: We were free, the Russians were oppressed; we were good, the Russians were evil. When I got older and started to read, the situation became more complicated, because it was from Russia that the best and most intense literature came: Dostoyevsky’s “Crime and Punishment,” Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” Gogol’s “Diary of a Madman.” What sort of a country was this where the souls were so deep and the spirit so wild? And why was it there that the thought of the profound inherent injustice of the class society was transformed into action, first by the revolution of 1917 and then by the proletariat’s 70-year dictatorship? And why did a beautiful story about the equality of all human beings end in horror, inhuman brutality and misery? Russia is still an enigmatic country to me. Every day there is news from Russia — we hear about Putin, about his imprisoned dissidents, about his meddling in the elections of his rivals — all of it serving the notion that “Russia” is a singular, comprehensible, clear-cut entity. But what do the people who live inside of that entity think? What is “Russia” to them, what are the stories they tell themselves? A hundred years after the revolution, 25 years after the fall of Communism? For years, I have wanted to see Russia with my own eyes, to meet some of the people who live inside of that entity, to find out what they think it means to be Russian. That is why, early one morning in October, I found myself driving from Moscow to Ivan Turgenev’s estate, accompanied by a photographer and a translator. If I wanted to see what life in Russia was like, unfiltered by news stories, I couldn’t think of any better place to start than Turgenev’s world, the countryside that formed the setting for his first book, “A Sportsman’s Sketches.” Published in 1852, “A Sportsman’s Sketches” is a collection of simple stories about a hunter’s encounters as he wanders around the woods. There is nothing here of Dostoyevsky’s psychological and emotional savagery and depth, nor of Tolstoy’s epic complexity or his ability to encapsulate an entire society with a few strokes; these stories are in all ways modest, aimless even. A man strolls through the forest with a shotgun over his shoulder, he exchanges a few words with someone he happens to meet, possibly shoots a bird or two, possibly spends the night in a barn on the way home — and that’s it, that’s the whole story. And yet the book numbers among the greatest works of world literature, largely because Turgenev gets so close to the world he is describing, the Russian society of the 1840s. His characters and descriptions do not lead to anything beyond themselves, they are not in themselves part of a greater sequence of events, they stand apart from everything — except the specific time and the place. And it is from there that we experience the world. The landscape we drove through was flat and monotonous, the sky a pale gray. Sometimes we would pass a rundown gas station, sometimes a small town would come into view, sometimes the forest would open up into fields. Then, among all the trees, a little park suddenly turned up on the right. I saw a black wall and a flame burning. "

The core index, which excludes food and energy, also came in above forecasts, prompting Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan, to describe it as “hotter than Hades.” While the stock market shrugged off the jump in inflation, bond markets got a bit of a jolt. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year. "
"The remote rain forests in Peru’s northeast corner are vast — so vast that the clouds that form above them can influence rainfall in the western United States. The region contains species, especially unusual fish, that are unlike any found elsewhere on Earth. Scientists studying the area’s fauna and flora may gain insights into evolutionary processes and into the ecological health and geological history of the Amazon. Now the area has become home to one of the Western Hemisphere’s newest national parks. Yaguas National Park will protect millions of acres of roadless wilderness — and the indigenous people who rely on it — from development and deforestation. “This is a place where the forest stretches to the horizon,” said Corine Vriesendorp, a conservation ecologist at The Field Museum in Chicago, one of many organizations that worked to win the national park designation, Peru’s highest level of protection. “This is one of the last great intact forests on the globe.” The designation stands in contrast to moves in the United States that may weaken protections for wilderness. President Trump has made a priority of scaling back national monuments like Bears Ears in Utah, and many advisers to the National Park System recently quit, citing concerns about the administration’s commitment to environmental protections.

"One of the striking features of Donald Trump’s first year in office was the all-but-complete abandonment of the populist economic vision upon which he successfully campaigned. Candidate Trump stiff-armed Republican economic orthodoxy and won the Midwest by promising a flood of infrastructure spending, universal health care, protectionism, middle-class tax cuts — a right-wing Keynesianism for the common man. But as president he defaulted to Paul Ryan’s agenda, chasing the Tea Party dream of Obamacare repeal, issuing a budget proposal thick with discretionary spending cuts, and pursuing a tax reform tilted heavily toward corporations. The best way to understand this turn was to recognize that personnel are policy, and since “Trumpism” was an unexpected irruption and Trump himself is not exactly the sort of guy who worries about having a policy brain trust, the people available to staff and guide his administration were inevitably more conventionally conservative than the half-sketched ideas of his campaign. Once Steve Bannon, the only inner-circle figure with an ideological vision, flamed out spectacularly as a Karl Rove-like eminence, a default to Ryanism was all-but-guaranteed, and with it the abandonment of Trump’s promise to remake the G.O.P. as a “worker’s party.” But if that was the major policy story of year one, the drift of Republican policymaking since the failure of Obamacare repeal has been a little different, a little more populist, a little closer to the way that Trump campaigned. Even without a Bannon-like figure consciously shaping policy, Trumpism still exerts a gravitational pull on the Republican Party, because its broad outlines are actually popular in a way that the austerian elements of the overlapping Ryan and Tea Party agendas never really were. This pull exerted itself weakly but meaningfully on the tax bill, which was dominated by a corporate tax cut but also reshaped around the edges to cut more taxes for the middle class and families. It exerted itself a little more on Trump’s decision to replace Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chairman with Jerome Powell, which amounted to a vote for a looser monetary policy rather than the hard-money approach that Republicans had consistently favored under Obama. And then on the budget that just passed Congress, Trumpism was more like a Death Star tractor beam, dragging the G.O.P. well away from all its professed Obama-era priorities: Gone was the sequester, gone was all the talk of cutting and capping and balancing, and instead we got a guns-and-butter budget that would have done Lyndon Johnson or George W. Bush proud. Combine this flood of spending with the Trump White House’s attempt to get a skills-based and restrictionist immigration reform through Congress, throw in some smaller ideas under consideration, like the Marco Rubio-Ivanka Trump paid parental leave plan, and you have a Year 2 of the Trump era in which Trumpism actually seems meaningful again. Not as a completely coherent agenda, obviously, but as a tendency, a force pulling conservatism toward a nationalism-infused deficit-financed populism even when Ryan and Mick Mulvaney are theoretically setting the agenda. "
"The White House knew about problems with the staff secretary Rob Porter’s security clearance nearly a year before he was forced to resign, F.B.I. director Christopher Wray said this week. We know now that the hold up on his clearance was tied to allegations of domestic abuse — and the Trump White House seems to have known that by last November, too. This contradicts Trump aides’ reassurances that they were as shocked as anyone to read about Porter’s alleged misogynist violence in The Daily Mail last week. (I fail to see how the notion that the executive branch gets its intelligence from The Daily Mail could possibly be reassuring to any sentient creature crawling this planet’s sizzling crust, but many things are beyond me these days.) Wray testified that the F.B.I. sent the White House a partial report about the “problems” with Porter in March 2017, following that with a full background check in July, and a further update in November. The investigation was “administratively closed” in January, several weeks before Donald Trump presumably — according to the White House’s initial timeline — heard about the allegations against his buddy. True to form for the Trump White House, even doing nothing was an unachievably high bar. Not only was Porter allowed to remain in his position (and briefly defended by the administration after the allegations finally became public), at the time of his termination he was reportedly being considered for multiple promotions: speechwriting, an expanded policy portfolio, a crack at deputy chief of staff. CNN reported that chief of staff John Kelly, aware of the allegations for months, “told associates that Porter was one of the few competent professionals on his staff and wanted to ensure that he was being used to his full potential.” One wonders if Kelly saw the photographs of Porter’s ex-wife’s face, the gold and the purple nimbus around her eye, the angry swell, the throb of it. What a luxurious degree of compartmentalization we afford white men — to not only separate Porter the guy-whose-ex-wife-filed-a-protective-order-against-him from Porter the guy-who-is-pretty-good-at-being-a-staff-secretary, but then to weigh their relative importance and choose the latter. (I believe that unit of measurement is called “capitalism.”) Inasmuch as we can judge a person’s interior based on their actions, it’s fair to say that a man who disregards women’s physical and sexual boundaries, as President Trump reportedly has, does not care about women. If it is possible to simultaneously care about women and subordinate their wishes to yours, to prioritize your sexual urges over their bodily autonomy, then what does “care” even mean? I think it’s also fair to say that a man who lashes out at women with physical violence, as Porter allegedly has, harbors some degree of hatred for them. What else does “hatred” mean if not this — the object of our fury, the thing we love to hurt? "
"So Kavous Seyed Emami, an Iranian-Canadian university professor and environmentalist, “commits suicide” in Tehran’s Evin prison two weeks after his arrest. His wife Maryam, summoned last Friday, is shown his body hanging in a cell. He is buried four days later in a village north of the capital, without an independent autopsy and after his family has come under intense Revolutionary Guard pressure to accept the official version of events. Tell me another. Seyed Emami’s death is an outrage and an embarrassment to the Islamic Republic. I met him in Iran in 2009, on the eve of a tumultuous presidential election that would lead to massive demonstrations and bloody repression. The theocratic regime that promised freedom in 1979 only to deliver another form of repression stood briefly on a knife-edge. Seyed Emami was a thoughtful, mild-mannered man, a sociologist and patriot with a love of nature. The notion that he would hang himself in a prison where they remove even your shoelaces strikes me as preposterous. “I still can’t believe this,” his son Ramin Seyed Emami, a musician whose stage name is King Raam, wrote on Instagram. Since anti-government protests began late last year, mainly in poorer areas that had been strongholds of the regime, Seyed Emami is the third case of a supposed suicide while in custody. In him, several of the phobias of Iranian hard-liners found a focus. He was a dual national of the kind President Hassan Rouhani, a reformist, is trying to lure back to the country to spur growth. He was an environmentalist, one of the founders of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, at a time when mismanagement and reckless dam building by the Revolutionary Guard and its front companies have contributed to water shortages. He was a Western-educated Iranian of the Rouhani camp, whose confrontation with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is in a particularly delicate phase. Why delicate? Because nobody knows how to handle the succession to Khamenei, who is 78, has ruled for almost three decades and, as divine arbiter (a man standing in for the occulted 12th imam until his expected reappearance), embodies the anti-democratic intrusion of heaven on a system with a veneer of democratic institutions.

"SYDNEY — Australia’s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has spent most of his career advocating for rural voters and strong families, and shouting down welfare cheats. But on Wednesday in Parliament, he offered a full-throated defense for remaining in office despite an affair with a former staff member who is now pregnant, and with whom he lived rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy supporter. Such is the scandal known as #barnababy, which in just one week has gone from a debate about privacy, sex and tabloids to an indictment of Australia’s crony politics. “This whole incident is absolutely tailor-made to undercut people’s faith in the Parliament, which is already at an all-time low,” said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in Queensland. The longer Mr. Joyce stays in office, she added, the more resentment about politics grows. All of Canberra, Australia’s capital, seems to be on trial now, with its cozy, clubby ways looking increasingly inappropriate. “It is not a healthy place,” Professor Rimmer said. “It runs on alcohol and gossip and fumes and power.” "
"Good morning on this Valentine’s Day-Ash Wednesday. It’s the biggest day of the year for roses. We traced a bouquet from Manhattan’s flower district back to the source, and it turns out that behind the collective show of love is a feat of logistics. It began last summer, at a flower farm around 9,000 feet above sea level, in the mountains of Ecuador, when a rose bush began to show buds, said Stephen Faitos, who runs Starbright Floral Design, a small shop in the flower district. About six months later, those buds were poised to bloom, and the farm opened an online auction in which florists across the world — including Starbright Floral Design, which Mr. Faitos runs with his father — could bid on the blossoms. The roses were then cut, setting the countdown clock ticking on their 19-day life span. They traveled by truck along winding mountain roads to Quito, were packed onto a cargo plane and flown to Miami, inspected by customs and United States Department of Agriculture officials, and flown that same day at La Guardia Airport. Starbright’s drivers were waiting there with a refrigerated truck and chauffeured them into Manhattan, where they joined some 40,000 flowers from around South America that the shop had ordered for Valentine’s Day. They included two dozen colors; 12 shades of red alone. The roses were all a little tired-looking from the journey, the florists said, so workers spent the next few days nursing them back to health — hydrating, cleaning and preening them before arranging them into $100 dozens to be delivered to New Yorkers.

"It may not be on any syllabus, but college has always been a time for young people to learn about relationships and sex. But as the internet increasingly influences the ways we interact, it also transforms how students date and find partners. We asked students at nine colleges and universities how technology affects the campus dating scene. Madeline Apple, University of Michigan, Class of 2018 Dating apps may have killed the college dating scene. Because it’s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it’s become harder to actually meet anyone. As students, we are told over and over that college is a time for us to expand our social groups, to meet new people and grow into adults. But the indecisiveness that is built into dating app culture can stunt us — we’re trapped in an endless cycle of swipes! Commitment, already a scary concept to many, becomes even more difficult with the false illusion that the dating possibilities are endless. Frankly, dating apps can also just make things incredibly awkward. My freshman year I swiped through hundreds of people. At one of the last tailgates of the year, a random man walked by me and yelled: “Hey! We matched on Tinder! You are Tinder girl!” I was mortified. Suddenly everyone around me knew that I was on Tinder. And I had swiped through so many people, I had no idea who this guy was. He was just another nameless “match” that I would never get to know. Because, needless to say, I walked away and never spoke to that guy again. Tinder is supposed to bring people together, but it actually pushes them emotionally further apart. The fact that there could be hundreds, if not thousands, of potential dates in your pocket gives an illusion of possibility. In reality, students just become more isolated in a world of fake interactions and awkward run-ins with old matches. We’re not getting out of our comfort zone to meet new people. Why approach someone in person when you can hide behind a Tinder profile? "

"PARKLAND, Fla. — A heavily armed young man barged into his former high school about an hour northwest of Miami on Wednesday, opening fire on terrified students and teachers and leaving a death toll of 17 that could rise even higher, the authorities said. Students huddled in horror in their classrooms, with some of them training their cellphones on the carnage, capturing sprawled bodies, screams and gunfire that began with a few shots and then continued with more and more. The dead included students and adults, some of whom were shot outside the school and others inside the sprawling three-story building. The gunman, armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, was identified as Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old who had been expelled from the school, the authorities said. He began his shooting rampage outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in this suburban neighborhood shortly before dismissal time around 2:40 p.m. He then made his way inside and proceeded down hallways he knew well, firing at students and teachers who were scurrying for cover, the authorities said. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” one student yelled over and over in one video circulating on social media, as more than 40 gunshots boomed in the background. By the end of the rampage, Mr. Cruz had killed 12 people inside the school and three outside it, including someone standing on a street corner, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Two more victims died of their injuries in local hospitals. The aftermath at the school was an eerie shrine, with chairs upended, a computer screen shattered with bullet holes and floors stained with blood. "

"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Budget Favors Military, Inflating Deficit” (front page, Feb. 13): It seems to me that the White House put the proverbial cart before the horse. Shouldn’t the budget have come first, laying out the country’s spending needs, before the tax plan? The tax cuts will strip away a large portion of the federal resources that should have been available to finance the budget. We now have a proposal from the White House that would have the states come up with the money, presumably from state taxes, to supplement federal funds for infrastructure projects, a version of robbing Peter to pay Paul. LOIS BLOOM, WILLIAMSBURG, VA. To the Editor: Even the most poorly informed Trump voters knew full well that he lied on the campaign trail and in the presidential debates repeatedly and without compunction. Yet his working-class supporters somehow thought he was not lying to them when he promised support for Medicare, Social Security and other programs that they and their children rely upon? Their determination to ignore (and in some cases even celebrate) President Trump’s lies in the fun and games of the political season has now come home to roost. There would be truly awful consequences for them if his budget priorities should actually be adopted. MIKE WOFFORD, OKLAHOMA CITY To the Editor: Re “Plan, Unliked and Unlikely, Replaces Some Food Stamps With a Box of Food” (news article, Feb. 14): Of all the absurd and misguided ideas touted in the budget released by President “King of Debt” Trump, none are quite as utterly ridiculous as sending food boxes to food stamp recipients to compensate for cutting their benefits. I thought a favorite rallying cry of Republicans was against the “nanny state.” What could be more intrusive and nanny-like than deciding what people will eat?! Forget the totally impossible logistics (if you can) and consider that someone sitting in D.C. will decide which particular vegetables, meats, grains and dairy a poor family struggling to survive will eat. Are they going to screen each family for allergies, wheat or dairy sensitivity, health or weight issues? Or are they going to send “menus” ahead allowing the family members to check off what they prefer, as in a nursing home? If I hadn’t read it in The New York Times, I would have thought it was straight out of a “Saturday Night Live” skit. It would be laughable if it weren’t so Orwellian and scary. DAPHNE CASE, NORWALK, CONN. "
"Among the numerous harebrained ideas in President Trump’s budget proposal this week, one stands out as especially pernicious: a scheme that would slash an essential antipoverty program and put fresh food further out of reach for 46 million low-income people, or one in seven Americans. The Trump administration wants to cut the budget of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, popularly known as food stamps, by nearly 30 percent over a decade. It plans to accomplish this, in large part, by giving low-income families boxes of pasta, cereal and other nonperishable foods, rather than giving them the full amount of their benefit on electronic cards, as the SNAP program works today. Those cards can be used at about 260,000 retail stores and farmers’ markets nationwide to buy a wide range of fresh and packaged food, allowing recipients to shop with their families’ preferences and dietary needs in mind. The administration argues that its proposal, which also would make it harder for adults living without children or other dependents to benefit from the program if they aren’t employed, is “designed to improve nutrition and target benefits to those who need them, while ensuring careful stewardship of taxpayers’ money.” If Mr. Trump and his aides actually cared about improving nutrition and the lives of low-income Americans, they would be trying to put more money into SNAP, not less. The program has done a heroic job of reducing poverty and improving the lives of millions of people. Studies have found that the program’s beneficiaries are less likely to report not having enough to eat. They are also less likely to take sick days and are shown to spend less on health care compared with similar people who do not benefit from the program. Further, children who grow up in families enrolled in SNAP are more likely to graduate from high school and be economically self-sufficient as adults. Right-wing ideologues in the Trump administration seem to consider SNAP a wasteful welfare program that needs to be brought to heel. In reality, the program is a relative bargain that provides fairly modest benefits to some of the poorest people in the country. The government spent about $70 billion on SNAP in 2017, less than 2 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget. The average beneficiary gets $126 a month. The people who are helped by the program tend to have very low incomes, are retired or have disabilities. A family of three generally has to earn less than $26,600 a year to qualify. "
"WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren addressed questions about her racial heritage and vowed in a speech on Wednesday to a group of tribes to do more for Native Americans, using an unannounced appearance to confront a political liability before a potential bid for president. In remarks to the National Congress of American Indians, Ms. Warren quickly, and bluntly, invoked President Trump’s derisive nickname for her, recalling that he had called her “Pocahontas” last year at a ceremony honoring Navajo code talkers from World War II. “The joke, I guess, is supposed to be on me,” she said of a taunt that stems from her longstanding claims of American Indian ancestry, which she has been unable to document. Ms. Warren, speaking from prepared remarks, did not offer new evidence of what she has said is her Cherokee and Delaware heritage, conceding, “You won’t find my family members on any rolls, and I’m not enrolled in a tribe.” “And I want to make something clear: I respect that distinction,” she said to applause. “I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes — and only by tribes.” Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a former professor at Harvard Law School, listed herself as a member of a minority group in a law school directory but has not claimed to be a Native American since being elected to the Senate in 2012.

"Hazleton, Pa. — President Trump’s new plan to limit and control what low-income families can eat is short on both compassion and common sense. The president’s proposed budget that was unveiled this week includes a radical change to the way the food-stamps program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, works. Now, recipients of SNAP benefits choose produce, meat, fish and other groceries for themselves. Under his proposal many SNAP recipients would have half their monthly benefits replaced by packages of food selected by the government. According to the Department of Agriculture, this program, called America’s Harvest Box, would involve about 81 percent of all SNAP households. The boxes would consist of “shelf-stable” foods like peanut butter, pasta and canned goods, but the plan is skimpy on other details, such as specifics on how exactly these food packages would be distributed. As someone who grew up needing food stamps and free school lunches, I cannot understand the logic or lack of empathy behind this plan. I spent my entire childhood in poverty, reliant on public assistance from the day I was born until my high school graduation and with a few brief sporadic returns after that. Some of my most vivid childhood memories involve accompanying my mother to the store, where she exchanged food stamps for the groceries our family needed. In those days, food stamps came in paper form, so she had to perform a ritual at the checkout counter, tearing each voucher from its booklet. These days, electronic cards called E.B.T.s, which can be used like credit cards at checkout, eliminate the awkward process of fumbling with booklets. But that doesn’t make it any less painful to be so poor that you need help paying for food. Being poor means getting shamed and criticized for each minor decision you make, both by politicians and your neighbors standing in line behind you at the grocery store. "
"The phalanx of intelligence chiefs who testified on Capitol Hill delivered a chilling message: Not only did Russia interfere in the 2016 election, it is already meddling in the 2018 election by using a digital strategy to exacerbate the country’s political and social divisions. No one knows more about the threats to the United States than these six officials, so when they all agree, it would be derelict to ignore their concerns. Yet President Trump continues to refuse to even acknowledge the malevolent Russian role. It’s particularly striking that four of the men who gave this warning to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday — the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo; the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats; the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray; and the Defense Intelligence Agency director, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley — were all appointed by Mr. Trump. They testified that the president has never asked them to take measures to combat Russian interference and protect democratic processes. Mr. Trump isn’t completely oblivious about Russia, of course. He fired Mr. Wray’s predecessor, James Comey, to derail the F.B.I.’s investigation of possible Trump campaign involvement with the election hacking, and reportedly asked Mr. Coats and Mr. Pompeo to help end the investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Mr. Flynn’s contacts with Russians. With the midterm elections only nine months away, the federal government is taking some defensive measures. It is trying to get at least one election official in each state a security clearance to make them aware of threats, and is providing states with enhanced online security to ensure that Americans’ votes will not be manipulated. Nevertheless, absent Mr. Trump’s commitment, there can be no robust mobilization to take all measures needed to confront an insidious problem that strikes at the heart of the democratic system. These would include a comprehensive and well-funded plan for protecting critical infrastructure, countering cyberattacks and mitigating propaganda. The president should not only be strengthening electoral defenses, but also pushing back against Russia, instead of ignoring a law Congress adopted overwhelmingly to impose sanctions for election meddling and aggression against Ukraine. The list of potential activities meriting sanctions covers weapons deals, human rights abuses and Russian cyberattacks against the United States and other democracies. Although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assured Congress on Wednesday that sanctions “are coming,” there’s little reason to believe him. The State Department recently argued that it didn’t impose sanctions against companies doing weapons deals with Russia because the threat of sanctions was enough to deter some of those deals. But there is no excuse for not acting against Russia for cyberattacks — Mr. Trump’s own intelligence chiefs say such activity has increased, not diminished. So why is Mr. Trump still ignoring such conclusions? Some have said he is giving Russia a green light to tamper with the 2018 elections. That would have once been an absurd suggestion. It can no longer be dismissed out of hand. "
"WASHINGTON — The admission by President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer that he sent $130,000 to a pornographic film actress, who once claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, has raised potential legal questions ranging from breach of contract to ethics violations. The lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, told The New York Times on Tuesday that he had used his own funds to facilitate the payment to the actress, Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, adding that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign had reimbursed him for the payment. He insisted that the payment was legal. The Wall Street Journal first reported last month that Mr. Cohen had arranged the payment soon before the 2016 election, as Ms. Clifford was considering speaking publicly about the purported affair. But Mr. Cohen’s assertions left many questions unanswered, including whether the payment was truly a personal gift by him or whether he was reimbursed by some other party, like Mr. Trump or an associate of Mr. Trump. In a brief interview on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen declined to answer questions about whether Mr. Trump had reimbursed him, whether the two men had made any arrangement at the time of the payment, or whether he had made any payments to other women or accusers of the president. “I can’t get into any of that,” Mr. Cohen said. Charles Wolfram, an emeritus professor of legal ethics at Cornell University, said the situation raised a host of potential issues, but that more facts were needed to understand which rules applied to it.

"PEN America has not been shy about its dismay over President Trump and his policies. The organization spearheaded an open letter criticizing his travel ban and has closely tracked his relationship with the media.

While previous iterations have had a more global lens, this one — the 14th — will feature writers from around the world mostly discussing the United States. “We are deliberately training the festival’s wide lens on America itself, probing the fissures and inconsistencies in our own culture,” Chip Rolley, the festival’s director, said in a statement. The festival will unfold across the five boroughs. The opening event will take place on April 16 at the Cooper Union’s Great Hall, with Mr. Whitehead, Leila Slimani and Maxine Beneba Clarke, who will discuss the underground railroad, immigration and the refugee crisis. On April 20, Jelani Cobb, Gregory Pardlo and The New York Times Magazine writer Nikole Hannah-Jones will explore race relations 50 years after the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On April 22, Hasan Minhaj of “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” will discuss being an Indian-American Muslim in the Trump era, and reflect back on his performance at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner. (The president skipped the event.) Also on April 22, Ron Chernow, the author of “Alexander Hamilton,” will speak with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes about his 2017 biography, “Grant,” about the life and presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. And the #MeToo movement is on the festival’s agenda: On April 17, Ms. Clarke and others will present a program of poetry and other readings under the title of “Us Too.” Ms. Gay, a Times Op-Ed contributing writer, will address the movement in a wide-ranging conversation on April 20.

"Winston Churchill is supposed to have said: “With integrity, nothing else counts. Without integrity, nothing else counts.” In fact, that seems to be one of those Churchillian epigrams that Churchill never actually got around to saying. But it captures an important truth about politics, that dishonor is like a cancer that spreads inexorably as it feeds upon ambition, protects itself with lies and doubles down with cover-ups. Looking at the chaos in the White House these days, I worry about inexperience, incompetence and lack of judgment. But maybe I worry most about an utter lack of integrity — and the way it is proving infectious. The contagion of dishonor has spread irresistibly through the White House staff, turning aides into con artists. Indifference to ethics has spread through the cabinet and agencies, resulting in endless scandals. And the epidemic has rippled through much of the G.O.P. (with some heroic exceptions), turning lawmakers into enablers and hypocrites. The Rob Porter affair, for example, isn’t just about Porter any more but about what seems to be a cover-up and a dismissiveness toward domestic violence. John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, claimed that he had removed Porter within 40 minutes of learning of credible allegations of Porter’s domestic abuse; to listen to F.B.I. testimony, it now seems it may have been seven months. President Trump said on Wednesday that he is against domestic violence. But when you have to say that, something is wrong. "
"SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. — This is Republican country, at least by California standards. But on a recent night, every folding chair set up in a tidy home on a suburban cul-de-sac was filled with a voter who wanted to meet one of the five Democrats running for Congress here. At first glance, the packed room — eight miles from what was once Richard Nixon’s Western White House — would seem an encouraging sign for Democrats looking to capture Republican districts like this one. This district, held by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who is not running again, is a critical part of the Democratic campaign to take back Congress. But the crowded field of candidates running for this open Republican seat spotlights what has become a major concern for Democrats. Under a new voting system in California, the top two vote-getters in the June primary — no matter their party — will face off in the general election in November. In a year of remarkable political energy stirred by opposition to President Trump, so many Democrats want to run for Congress that they could end up dividing the vote in districts like this one, producing a November runoff between two Republicans and in the process upending any hope of a House takeover. “It’s created a lot of heartburn,” said Mike Levin, an environmental lawyer and the Democratic hopeful who spoke here, of the bounty of candidates. “This is absolutely a real and valid concern that we all need to address. Leave it to California.” Sharon Williams, 42, a wardrobe stylist who hosted the wine-and-cheese forum with Mr. Levin, said she walked the streets of her neighborhood to find people to come meet him because she wanted Democrats to rally around one candidate. “I am deeply concerned with the number of Democrats who are running in our district,” she said.

"WASHINGTON — The meeting, to say the least, had not gone well. Upset at a presidential dressing down, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had just left the White House vowing to resign. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, raced out of the building, found him in his car, banged on the door and implored him to come back inside. The dramatic episode, described by Mr. Priebus in a soon-to-be-released book, proved a turning point in the relationship between President Trump and his attorney general, one that has shaped the administration ever since. More than any president in modern times, Mr. Trump has engaged in a high stakes public conflict with the Justice Department with extensive potential consequences. Mr. Priebus’s account comes in a new chapter included in the paperback edition of “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,” by Chris Whipple, to be published on March 6 by Broadway Books. In interviews with the author, Mr. Priebus gave the first extended description of his tumultuous six months as Mr. Trump’s top aide. Vanity Fair posted an excerpt from the new chapter on Wednesday. Mr. Priebus described a roller-coaster experience trying to impose discipline on one of the most undisciplined figures in American politics, a period that led to his unhappy departure last summer when Mr. Trump unceremoniously announced his resignation on Twitter just before Mr. Priebus disembarked Air Force One in the rain. From rushing out ill-prepared executive orders to arguing over the president’s Twitter fixation, Mr. Priebus struggled as none of his predecessors had before in a job that is historically among the toughest in Washington. “Take everything you’ve heard and multiply it by 50,” he said. Working for Mr. Trump, he added, was “like riding the strongest and most independent horse.” But he expressed admiration for Mr. Trump’s toughness and allowed that perhaps the president was right about Twitter. The meeting that nearly led to Mr. Sessions’s resignation came last May shortly after the president fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was heading an investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and any cooperation with Mr. Trump’s campaign. The dismissal of Mr. Comey, which Mr. Trump in an interview with NBC News linked to his unhappiness with the Russia investigation, triggered the appointment of a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to the ire of the president. "
"To the Editor: Re “Russia at Work on U.S. Midterms, Spy Chiefs Warn” (front page, Feb. 14): The continued political and economic success of our democracy depends on a well-founded belief in the integrity of our election system. Therefore, the Russian attempt to undercut our confidence in electoral integrity is an existential threat. Russian efforts will, if left alone, become ever more sophisticated and effective. Unfortunately, President Trump is concerned only about what he thinks the Russians can do for him in what he hopes will be his campaign to hold on to the presidency. If the Republicans are not yet ready to start impeachment proceedings, the least they can do is pass a congressional resolution calling on the president to demand that all Russian electoral interference cease immediately, backed by an order requiring, in the face of noncompliance, the immediate removal of all Russian diplomats from our country. Cyberwarfare against our electoral system is war. Better to recognize that now and act accordingly. It is not time to react militarily, but it is past time to react effectively. Russia must be isolated from the family of nations. DONALD S. COBURN
MONTEREY, MASS. To the Editor: Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, says we are under attack from Russia. Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I thought that when our country comes under attack we retaliate. So far there has been no retaliation that I know of. Even the modest attempts of the Congress to impose sanctions, which really amounted to a slap on the wrist, have been ignored by our president. Of course you don’t want to give away important information to the enemy, but it would be good to know whether we are taking strong steps to not only counter future attacks but also to give the enemy pause before trying again by making the penalty very painful. ORIN HOLLANDER, JAMISON, PA. To the Editor: Russian efforts, through social media platforms, to influence United States elections succeed because of the inability of individuals to evaluate information they receive and the biases of the source. The plethora of “information” now available on multiple media platforms requires the reader to possess the ability to determine what is reliable information. Schools, particularly high schools, need to have courses that teach critical reasoning and how to evaluate sources of information. The landscape has changed, and so must our education system.

CAMBRIDGE, MASS.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) We will probably always call it Silicon Valley. But the steady move of technology companies into downtown San Francisco is shifting the center of gravity of what is arguably America’s most innovative industry from the rambling, suburban streets of the Valley to the tightly concentrated and increasingly vertical neighborhood behind San Francisco’s Embarcadero. Facebook’s decision last year to lease more than 400,000 square feet in a skyscraper across from the newly opened Salesforce Tower will put offices of the biggest names in tech — Google and LinkedIn among them — within walking distance of each other. In the middle of all this is the Transbay Transit Center, which opens in June and is advertised as the Grand Central of the West. “The building is starting to come to life,” said Dennis Turchon, senior construction manager for the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the public organization charged with building the structure. To critics it is a glorified bus terminal, and an expensive one at that — the cost hovers around $6 billion, according to the authority. Yet the transit center has ambitions to be much more. A 5.4-acre park on the roof has a half-mile walking loop, an outdoor theater and gardens populated by dozens of mature trees. It’s an elevated park that has been compared to the High Line in New York. The tech offices that surround the center connect directly with the park, as does a gondola that will whisk visitors to the park for the sidewalk below. "
"WASHINGTON — By the time the furor over a presidential aide accused of spousal abuse reached a second week, the White House account of what happened became less clear, not more. The contradictions were multiplying. The daily news briefing was filled with caveats. “I can only give you the best information that I have.” “I can’t say definitively, but I’m not aware of any communication.” “I can’t say with 100 percent certainty, but not that I’m aware of.” “This is the information that was given to me by those individuals.” The rule of thumb for crisis communications in any White House is to get a complete and accurate account of events out quickly, if for no other reason than to keep a negative story from lasting longer than it otherwise might. But President Trump’s White House has thrown out the rule book in so many ways. The continuing questions about Rob Porter, the staff secretary who resigned after being accused of abusing two former wives, have provided a case study in how shifting stories can make matters worse. “It’s very clear that in this situation, one of the reasons they’re struggling here is there’s not one complete set of information on what happened, why it happened and what to do to move forward,” said Doug Heye, a former congressional aide and communications director for the Republican National Committee. “This should have been a two- or three-day story.” Instead, “That this has gone on this long really speaks to the series of mistakes here.” Critics say the conflicting accounts stem from the top, from a president who has made so many false statements or given so many contradictory versions of the truth in so many instances that even his own advisers cannot trust him. He originally said that he pushed out Michael T. Flynn, his first national security adviser, because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence. But after Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., the president said that the deception with investigators also prompted the dismissal. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s inaugural committee paid nearly $26 million to an event planning firm started by an adviser to the first lady, Melania Trump, while donating $5 million — less than expected — to charity, according to tax filings released on Thursday. The nonprofit group that oversaw Mr. Trump’s inauguration and surrounding events in January 2017, the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee, had been under pressure from liberal government watchdog groups to reveal how it spent the record $107 million it had raised largely from wealthy donors and corporations. Its chairman, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s, had pledged that the committee would be thrifty with its spending, and would donate leftover funds to charity. In a statement released by the committee, he praised it for carrying out the inauguration and more than 20 related events with “elegance and seamless excellence without incident or interruption, befitting the legacy and tradition that has preceded us.” But the mandatory tax return it filed with the Internal Revenue Service revealed heavy spending on administrative and logistical expenses associated with planning and executing several days’ worth of events for donors and supporters around Mr. Trump’s inaugural ceremonies. By contrast, the return showed that the group’s charitable donations included only a previously publicized $3 million for hurricane relief, as well as a total of $1.75 million to groups involved in decorating and maintaining the White House and the vice president’s residence, and $250,000 for the Smithsonian Institution. The 116-page filing indicates that the majority of the funds — more than $57 million — went to four event-planning companies. "
"For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday’s live updates. Newtown. San Bernardino. Las Vegas. Sutherland Springs. And now, Parkland. Five of the six deadliest mass shootings of the past six years in the United States. In each of them, the gunman had an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle. The N.R.A. calls the AR-15 the most popular rifle in America. The carnage in Florida on Wednesday that left at least 17 dead seemed to confirm that the rifle and its variants have also become the weapons of choice for mass killers. It is not hard to see why. Originally designed for troops to kill enemy fighters, the weapon became the military’s M16 and the shorter M4 carbine. It was easily adapted for civilian use, with one major difference: Military versions can fire fully automatically — or in bursts of several shots — by depressing the trigger once. The civilian semiautomatic version requires a pull of the trigger for each shot. But other features that make the AR-15 so deadly on the battlefield remain. It is light, easy to hold and easy to fire, with a limited recoil. Bullets fly out of the muzzle more than twice as fast as most handgun rounds. "
"WASHINGTON — After a gunman in Las Vegas slaughtered country-music fans with assault weapons that mimicked a machine gun, lawmakers from both parties said they would move quickly to ban so-called bump stocks. After a mass shooter massacred churchgoers in Sutherland Springs, Tex., the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, was stirred to action, pledging legislation to bolster the nation’s instant background check system for would-be gun buyers. Congress has effectively done neither. That inaction sank in on Thursday, as lawmakers confronted yet another mass shooting, this time with some of the survivors imploring Congress to finally take action. Republicans called for prayers, but argued that no single fix to the nation’s gun laws would deter a shooting like the one on Wednesday in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead, many of them children. “This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said. “We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together.” Democrats, who have put forward a spate of gun safety bills only to see them left unaddressed by Republicans, who control the House and Senate, seethed with frustration. “This isn’t going to stop, members, it’s going to continue,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a leading gun control advocate, told her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “And we become culpable when we do nothing to stop it.” "
"WASHINGTON — A second federal appeals court ruled on Thursday against President Trump’s latest effort to limit travel from countries said to pose a threat to the nation’s security. The decision, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., will have no immediate practical impact. The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear an appeal from a broadly similar decision from the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. In December, in a sign that the Supreme Court may be receptive to upholding Mr. Trump’s latest order, the court allowed it to go into effect as the two cases moved forward. The cases concern Mr. Trump’s third and most considered effort to make good on a campaign promise to secure the nation’s borders. But challengers to the latest ban, issued as a presidential proclamation in September, said it was tainted by religious animus and not adequately justified by national security concerns. The ban restricts travel from eight nations, six of them predominantly Muslim: Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. The restrictions vary in their details but, for the most part, citizens of the countries are forbidden from emigrating to the United States and many of them are barred from working, studying or vacationing here. The Fourth Circuit, by a 9-to-4 vote, ruled that the latest ban, like an earlier one, most likely violated the Constitution’s Establishment Clause, which forbids religious discrimination by the government. The majority based its conclusion in large measure on statements Mr. Trump has made as a candidate and while in office. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Thursday that he would visit Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people this week in the deadliest school shooting in years, and would work with state and local leaders “to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” The president tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims in the hours after the shooting on Wednesday, and as images of terrified students sprinting frantically away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School dominated the news, Mr. Trump’s aides urged him to make a public statement. But he opted not to say anything more until Thursday, when he delivered a subdued seven-minute speech at the White House. “We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life,” Mr. Trump said, “that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.” He made no mention of guns. Wednesday’s incident was the deadliest school shooting since a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. It was the latest mass shooting to elicit a national mourning period and an outcry from Democratic lawmakers, who accused Mr. Trump and Republicans of not doing enough to curb gun violence. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump approved the removal of an Obama-era regulation intended to prevent people with mental disabilities from buying guns. But as he has done in the recent past, on Thursday Mr. Trump answered cries for tighter restrictions on guns by emphasizing the need for Americans to report the behavior of “mentally disturbed” people to the authorities. “So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet hours before he addressed the public. “Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” "
"To the Editor: Re “In Response to Florida Shooting, Trump Focuses on Mental Health Over Gun Restrictions” (nytimes.com, Feb. 15): President Trump has the gall to put out a statement regarding the horrific shooting in Florida that is a boldfaced lie. He said, “We are here for you — whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain.” Not a word about gun control, only mental illness. The statement is an insult to the intelligence of the American public. The shooter had an AR-15 rifle, precisely the kind of weapon that should not be in the hands of anyone other than military personnel in combat or combat training. Mental health, while always a factor, is irrelevant when it comes to the availability of weaponry like this, which in the hands of anyone poses a high risk of violence. This is insane. I fear that like all the other school shootings and mass killings this country has faced in the last year, this one will roil in social media for a couple of days and then disappear in a morass of political idiocy pandering to the National Rifle Association. Only one thing will ease the pain of the victims and their loved ones: a strong and powerful move to guarantee every American citizen’s right to be free of fear from the uncontrolled access to firearms that sets this country apart from virtually all other developed countries around the world. PETER C. ALKALAY, SCARSDALE, N.Y. "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate summarily blocked three measures on Thursday — including one backed by President Trump — to resolve the fate of the so-called Dreamers, leaving hundreds of thousands of them facing an uncertain future. As senators struck down measure after measure, a week that began with the promise of a rare open, free-ranging debate on the issue crashed headlong into the same divisions that have prevented Congress from fixing the nation’s immigration system for decades. The lack of consensus left in question whether any solution on the Dreamers can be reached. In a rebuke to the president, senators voted overwhelmingly, 39 to 60, against the White House-backed bill, which would have committed $25 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico, placed strict limits on legal immigration, ended the diversity visa lottery and offered 1.8 million Dreamers an eventual path to citizenship. Senators were 21 votes short of the 60 required to open debate, and the rejection of the president’s plan was bipartisan: Democrats refused its get-tough approach to legal immigration, while many conservative Republicans derided it as amnesty. Before the vote on Mr. Trump’s plan, senators rejected two bipartisan measures, including one written by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and another drafted by a broad bipartisan group of centrists calling themselves the Common Sense Coalition. The votes were a stark reminder that Congress remains paralyzed by the immigration issue. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both tried to overhaul the system, but were stymied by lawmakers frozen into inaction, in part because of powerful interests on both sides. "
"The White House is assertively working to make America white again, and Democrats are too afraid to speak that truth. The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect. The pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people. It should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration’s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. “By greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,” the economist Michael Clemens said. “Decades ahead,” he added, “many fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.” The administration’s focus is not random. Nor is it illogical, if one’s goal is to maximize the influence of white people. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country’s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country’s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump’s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution. "

"To the Editor: Re “Census Sabotage,” by David Leonhardt (column, nytimes.com, Feb. 9): I couldn’t agree more about just how important the 2020 census is and what is at stake if we get it wrong. With the next census just two years away, the Trump administration has still not nominated a director but has been filling traditionally nonpartisan positions with political hacks. The White House adviser Kellyanne Conway’s former pollster has been added to the census payroll, and until recently the administration even flirted with giving the deputy director position, which has always been filled by an experienced civil servant, to a Republican redistricting expert with no census experience. The administration is trying to add a last-minute question about citizenship that the Census Bureau’s own research shows will lower response rates and make the census less accurate and more expensive. It’s hard not to conclude that some in the Trump administration want to sabotage the 2020 census for political purposes. Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. should reject these efforts. Our democracy depends on it. Our economy depends on it. And our Constitution requires it. CAROLYN B. MALONEY

"WASHINGTON — The American citizen imprisoned by the military for five months as an enemy combatant told interrogators that he worked for the Islamic State guarding a gas field and monitoring civilians, and captured recruiting files indicate that he registered with the group as a fighter in July 2014, a newly declassified court document said. But the man also insisted to his interrogators that he traveled to Syria intending to work as a journalist and was arrested, later agreeing to work for the Islamic State to gain release from prison, the document also showed. The court filing does not accuse him of having fought for the group. The document, made public late Wednesday, was a description of facts about the man’s case as gathered by the F.B.I. While it did not make his name public, it lifted much of the secrecy with which the government has draped his case since acknowledging that a Syrian militia had captured him and transferred him to American custody. The capture of the citizen, and the Trump administration’s decision to hold him in wartime detention as an enemy combatant, has revived a legal and policy debate about the scope of executive power and individual rights that had subsided since the Bush administration claimed a right to hold two American citizen terrorism suspects indefinitely and without trial. The Obama administration rejected that approach. The filing publicly acknowledged for the first time the basic outline of the man’s life, which has been previously reported based on unnamed sources — including that he was born in the United States but raised in Saudi Arabia, where he is a dual citizen — while filling in many new details about him. They include that he attended college in Louisiana — apparently studying electrical engineering — but did not earn a degree there. He is married and has a 3-year-old daughter, and he took two trips to the United States in 2014, shortly after her birth, in an effort to register her as an American citizen. "
"JERUSALEM — In a trio of new polls, Israelis have declared what they think of the bribery case against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the answer is roughly the same as what they think of Mr. Netanyahu himself: About half think he should step aside. His right-wing supporters overwhelmingly think he should stay. Mr. Netanyahu’s Israel is as polarized as it has been in generations, and under his lengthy tenure, the national conversation has become steadily more toxic. Now, as the prime minister awaits a possible criminal indictment, his efforts to cling to power could pose even greater strains on a society that already seems at risk of tearing itself apart. “Imagine if, in the next few weeks, there is a justified case for Israel to go to war,” said Shlomo Avineri, a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “Half of this country would think Netanyahu’s position was impacted by his legal situation. That is unacceptable. Political decisions are sometimes existential in Israel. If we had to go to war, the decision would be contaminated for a lot of people.” Mr. Netanyahu has dismissed the police recommendations to charge him as “slanted” and “full of holes, like Swiss cheese.” The attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, praised the police on Thursday, in his first public remarks on the recommendations. The state prosecutors and the police, he said, had worked with the goal of “preserving the rule of law in Israel, turning over every stone in order to bring the truth to light.” The next several months, as the nation awaits Mr. Mandelblit’s decision on an indictment, are likely to be raucous, with zero-sum politics taken to a new level. Mr. Netanyahu’s foes will portray him as a felon-in-all-but-fact, while his allies paint him as the persecuted victim of a left-wing conspiracy that extends all the way up to the commissioner of police. But it has been all politics, all the time, in Israel for years. Israel has always been a noisily contentious land of debates with the volume on 11. Beyond the left-right divide lies an unruly and acrimonious diversity, with fault lines between secular Jews and religious Jews, ultra-Orthodox Jews who will serve in the military and those who will not, Arabs and Jews, settlers and everyone else. Its parliamentary system, designed to give a voice to minorities, ends up playing a part, giving disproportionate power to small parties. "
"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Shortly after 11 a.m. for the last several days, Sung Baik-yoo, the chief spokesman for the organizers of the 2018 Winter Olympics, has leaned into a microphone at a news conference and provided a ticket sales update. The news is always a little more positive than the day before. By Thursday, Sung said organizers were within one percent of their target of 90 percent sold out, a figure that equals about one million tickets sold. Yet the scene at venues here in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from the ski slopes in the mountain cluster to the ice sports stadiums of Olympic Park, tells a story far different from Sung’s pronouncements of success. Swaths of empty blue seats have been a familiar backdrop despite organizers’ efforts to fill in gaps by providing volunteers with so-called passion tickets that allow them to attend events and by bringing in school groups by the busload. So far, fans have been able to show up right before the start of all but the most popular events and buy a ticket. Peter Skinner, an Australian who traveled to the Games from his home in Bangkok, said he regretted purchasing tickets months before the Games started. “We’re never again buying tickets in advance,” said Skinner, as he walked with his wife toward the hockey arena for the first session of the men’s competition. One event they had been looking forward to, the men’s downhill, was postponed along with several other skiing events because of bad weather. They headed to figure skating instead. "
"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senators pushing to revive legislation that would bring sweeping changes to federal sentencing laws cleared a key hurdle on Thursday, but the effort appeared likely to stall once again. Advocates of criminal justice overhaul from both parties say that their proposals have only gained in popularity since 2015, when a similar and much-promoted bipartisan push petered out amid disputes as 2016 campaigns took shape. A new version of the measure passed the Senate Judiciary Committee 16 to 5 on Thursday, winning plaudits from an unlikely coalition of conservative, libertarian and liberal lawmakers and outside groups that have backed it. What happens next will depend on whether that coalition can persuade Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow a full Senate vote. The prospects appeared dim. Mr. McConnell, who controls the Senate floor, continues to see the issue as a loser for Republicans, despite a wave of similar overhauls embraced by states across the country. He has argued that the issue divides Republicans, many of whom remain averse to lessening criminal penalties of any kind, and could dampen enthusiasm at the polls. It will be up to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the influential chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the lead author of the bill, to try to change Mr. McConnell’s mind, and he suggested that President Trump’s desire for legislative accomplishments could help sway the leader.

"WASHINGTON — Even before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s legal setback this week, a rare fissure had opened up between him and President Trump. The White House rebutted reports that he and the Americans had discussed annexing parts of the West Bank, and Mr. Trump voiced fresh concerns about Israel’s openness to a peace accord. White House officials insisted on Wednesday that the recommendation of bribery and fraud charges against Mr. Netanyahu would have “no impact on the timing or content” of a peace plan. But Mr. Trump has not rallied publicly to the Israeli leader’s defense, and veterans of Middle East diplomacy said his troubles could pose an unpredictable new obstacle to Mr. Trump’s peacemaking efforts. For a president who has embraced Mr. Netanyahu at every turn, the pushback on Israel was striking. Coming two months after Mr. Trump alienated the Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, it suggests that the administration is recalibrating its approach to the two sides as it wrestles with when, and how, to present a peace proposal. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Wednesday in Amman, Jordan, that the plan was “fairly well advanced” and added, “It’ll be up to the president to decide when he feels it’s time and he’s ready to put that plan forward.” The lack of visible progress, and the cone of silence, surrounding the peace initiative have raised questions about how much of a plan the White House really has. Several officials, however, said that the proposal being devised by two of Mr. Trump’s aides, Jared Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, was detailed and substantive, and that Mr. Trump’s willingness to risk friction with Mr. Netanyahu over it showed that he was more, not less, committed. Certainly, Mr. Trump is not missing chances to press his case. Aides recount, for example, that last month, when he reached Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on his cellphone in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Mnuchin relayed that he was in a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan. Mr. Trump requested to speak to the king, whom he then asked for help in dealing with the aggrieved president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. "

"The Trump administration is seeking to withdraw the United States from the international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. It is trying to rescind regulations on the issue. It has even scrubbed mentions of global warming from government websites. Yet its attempt to suppress the facts has not entirely succeeded, with federal agencies continuing to issue warnings, including in a major climate report published last year. The latest climate alarm came this week in a Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Here is what the document, issued by Daniel R. Coats, the director of national intelligence, said about climate change and other environmental problems, with my annotations: Only six weeks into the year, this is already coming true. Cape Town, the second-largest city in South Africa, is so low on water after an extended drought that it may be forced to shut off the taps in early April. Water scarcity is a factor in the violent conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and in both countries, control of water supplies is being used as a weapon of war. After running through an accurate summary of the warming trend and the risk it poses, the document appears — though the language is ambiguous — to suggest the possibility of sudden climate change of the sort that might cause global upheaval. Most scientists say that over the next few decades, at least, the likely prospect is a gradual worsening of climate-related problems. But beyond a few decades, they are less willing to rule out catastrophes like the disappearance of polar sea ice, which could potentially cause profound climatic disruption. "

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Another school shooting in the U.S., Jacob Zuma steps down and the latest from the Champions League. Here’s the news: • At least 17 people were killed in a shooting at a high school in Florida. The dead included adults and students. The 19-year-old gunman had been expelled from the school, the authorities said. He initially evaded capture by blending in with fleeing students. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, more than 400 people have been shot at U.S. schools, over 100 of whom were killed. _____ "
"The cast of “Roseanne” talks about its impending broadcast return. And Nathan Chen seeks redemption and a medal. 20/20: ROSEANNE: THE RETURN 10 p.m. on ABC. The reboot of “Roseanne” won’t begin until next month, but it’s already drawing tense headlines and protests because of Roseanne Barr’s support for President Trump (in her character and in real life). “I’ve always had it be a true reflection of the society we live in,” Ms. Barr said in January. “Half the country voted for him, half of them didn’t.” On this special, Ms. Barr and the rest of the cast (which includes John Goodman and the current Oscar nominee Laurie Metcalf) will sit down to address the direction of the new season, and talk about the legacy of its original nine. THE GREY (2012) 7:30 p.m. on BBC. Liam Neeson has fought human traffickers, Sith lords, airplane hijackers and dark knights. But in this 2012 movie, his foe is furrier: wolves. This film by Joe Carnahan depicts a group of men, including Neeson, fighting for survival after a plane crash in Alaska. Soon, the group begins to take on the qualities of a surrounding wolf pack. “It’s a fine, tough little movie, technically assured and brutally efficient, with a simple story that ventures into some profound existential territory without making a big fuss about it,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review in The New York Times; he designated it a Critic’s Pick. PYEONGCHANG 2018 OLYMPICS 8 p.m. on NBC. After a disappointing Olympics debut, the American figure skater Nathan Chen seeks redemption in the short program. Medals will be awarded in men’s skeleton and women’s snowboard cross, as the American snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis, in her fourth Olympics, continues her hunt for her first gold medal. There will also be women’s skiing in cross-country and freestyle. PILLOW TALK (1959) 10:15 p.m. on TCM. The technology that drives the romance of “Pillow Talk” — a telephone party line — may be outdated, but the chemistry between Rock Hudson and Doris Day is not. Day was an Oscar best-actress nominee for her verbal jousts and bright songs. “Her dudgeons are as chic and spectacular as her nifty Jean Louis clothes, and her fall for Mr. Hudson’s deceptions is as graceful as a ski-run down a hill,” Bosley Crowther wrote in his review in The Times. PARENTHOOD on Hulu. Before the emotional devastation of “This Is Us,” and before the cliffhanging Bay Area intrigue of “Big Little Lies,” there was “Parenthood,” which achieved both over six tear-jerking seasons. The show, which arrives on Hulu on Thursday, followed three generations of the Berkeley-based Braverman family through divorces, career setbacks, abortions and adoption struggles. The cast is made up of character-actor all stars, from Peter Krause to Lauren Graham to Monica Potter. Head over to Watching for a guide to which seasons to watch — and which to skip. "
"CROSSVILLE, Tenn. — The gravel parking lot at the Fitzgerald family’s truck dealership here in central Tennessee was packed last week with shiny new Peterbilt and Freightliner trucks, as well as a steady stream of buyers from across the country. But there is something unusual about the big rigs sold by the Fitzgeralds: They are equipped with rebuilt diesel engines that do not need to comply with rules on modern emissions controls. That makes them cheaper to operate, but means that they spew 40 to 55 times the air pollution of other new trucks, according to federal estimates, including toxins blamed for asthma, lung cancer and a range of other ailments. The special treatment for the Fitzgerald trucks is made possible by a loophole in federal law that the Obama administration tried to close, and the Trump administration is now championing. The trucks, originally intended as a way to reuse a relatively new engine and other parts after an accident, became attractive for their ability to evade modern emissions standards and other regulations. The survival of this loophole is a story of money, politics and suspected academic misconduct, according to interviews and government and private documents, and has been facilitated by Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has staked out positions in environmental fights that benefit the Trump administration’s corporate backers. Fitzgerald welcomed President Trump at one of its dealerships during the campaign, and it sells baseball caps with the slogan “Make Trucks Great Again.” "
"First, read the first three paragraphs of today’s article: What have you heard in the news or on social media about Russian attempts to meddle in elections in the United States? What do you know about bots spreading disinformation on social media? What questions do you have? Now, read the entire article, “Russia Sees Midterm Elections as Chance to Sow Fresh Discord, Intelligence Chiefs Warn,” and answer the following questions: 1. What did Mr. Coats and the other intelligence chiefs at the annual hearing on worldwide threats say are the central challenges facing the United States? 2. What is President Trump’s position on Russian meddling, according to the article? How does it differ from Mr. Coats’s position, as well as that of Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director? 3. What have bot armies done so far to spread information that deepens political division, according to the article? 4. What details does the article provide about the Russian attempts — or the lack of them — to penetrate voting machines or American ballots? "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — An annual United Nations report released on Thursday offered a stark assessment of the 16-year Afghan war, showing a slight decline in civilian casualties from an all-time high but a rise in complex bombing attacks that have taken a heavy toll in the capital. The report said at least 10,453 Afghan civilians had been wounded or killed in 2017. At a time when the American and Afghan governments are releasing fewer statistics — the Afghan Army stopped publishing military casualty numbers in November, for example — the United Nations report on civilian casualties is one of the few reliable indicators of how the war is proceeding. “The chilling statistics in this report provide credible data about the war’s impact,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, the United Nations secretary general’s special representative for Afghanistan, said in a statement. The report came out a day after the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, issued an upbeat assessment of the Afghan Army’s recent progress, saying that “the Taliban cannot win.” In contrast, the United Nations report focused on a rise in attacks deliberately targeting civilians in 2017. Those attacks, intended to undermine the authority of the American-backed government, accounted for 27 percent of all civilian casualties last year. This category includes casualties caused by suicide bombers detonating in populated areas and targeted killings, but excludes those caused by ground fighting, airstrikes and explosions aimed principally at military targets, like some roadside bombs.

"The Senate’s top education leaders will consider reinstating Pell grants for incarcerated students, a move that would restore a federal lifeline to the nation’s cash-strapped prison education system. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said the committee would consider reinstating the federal financial aid grants in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act currently underway. The move would reverse a decades-old decision to strike the benefit from the higher education law and signal a shift toward recognizing education as a centerpiece in efforts to overhaul criminal justice law. The federal student aid could be used to cover the cost of college courses taught in prisons, online or both. Mr. Alexander said that he was open to re-examining Pell grants for prisoners, which were banned in the 1994 crime bill passed under President Bill Clinton. In 2015, President Barack Obama’s Education Department piloted an experimental program that allowed 12,000 incarcerated students to be eligible for the financial aid. If reinstated, millions of dollars would be made available to eligible students in the United States’ prison population of 1.5 million. “Most prisoners, sooner or later, are released from prison, and no one is helped when they do not have the skills to find a job,” Mr. Alexander said in a statement. “Making Pell grants available to them in the right circumstances is a good idea.” Mr. Alexander will find an ally in his committee’s ranking Democrat, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, with whom he has partnered to broker deals, including reauthorizing the country’s elementary and secondary education law and preserving insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.

"WASHINGTON — In 2006 and again in 2013, Republican moderates joined Democrats in the Senate to pass sweeping overhauls of the nation’s immigration laws with a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, only to see the compromises torpedoed by a wave of angry activism in the conservative news media and grass roots. This time, as senators again search for a way forward on immigration, a revolt from the right has so far failed to materialize, in large part because of the intransigence of a different player: a man in the White House who has mostly satisfied immigration hard-liners. President Trump’s gamble was risky. And at first his plan struck many conservatives as too generous because it would offer 1.8 million young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children the opportunity to become citizens. But by coupling his offer with demands to sharply reduce legal immigration — a trade-off many Democrats say they cannot accept — then threatening to veto anything that does not meet those demands, the president has made a bipartisan compromise exceedingly difficult. That may have been the point, as it sits just fine with many on the right who never wanted a deal in the first place. “Trump outsmarted them,” said Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host and author who was one of the many voices on the right who helped bury the 2013 immigration legislation that died when the House refused to take it up. “They won’t cut a deal is my prediction.” This approach has benefits for Mr. Trump and his party. The president keeps a key campaign promise by not agreeing to anything his base would consider too lenient. "
"For the latest news in the wake of the Florida school shooting, read Thursday’s coverage. PARKLAND, Fla. — The suspect in one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history confessed to the police that he “began shooting students that he saw in the hallways and on school grounds,” according to a police arrest report released Thursday. The suspect, Nikolas Cruz, 19, carried a black duffel bag and backpack, where he hid loaded magazines, the report said. He arrived at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in an Uber at 2:19 p.m. on Wednesday and pulled out a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, according to details described by the authorities at a news conference on Thursday. Mr. Cruz also shot people inside five classrooms on the first and second floors of the freshman building. He eventually discarded the rifle, a vest and ammunition in a stairwell, blended in with fleeing students and got away, the authorities said. After leaving the school, Mr. Cruz walked to a Walmart, and bought a drink at a Subway. He also stopped at a McDonald’s. He was arrested by the police without incident as he walked down a residential street at 3:41 p.m. “He looked like a typical high school student, and for a quick moment I thought, could this be the person who I need to stop?” said Officer Michael Leonard. Here are the takeaways: • Mr. Cruz faces 17 counts of premeditated murder — one for each of the people he is accused of killing on Wednesday in a shooting that was captured on cellphone video by terrified students. He is being held without bond at the main Broward County jail, where he has been placed on suicide watch, according to Gordon Weekes, the county’s chief assistant public defender. "
"WASHINGTON — In terms of rip-roaring debates, it certainly didn’t rival Calhoun versus Webster. It definitely was not in the pantheon with Lincoln and Douglas. In fact, it really didn’t even measure up to Biden meets Palin. The promised freewheeling, take-on-all-comers Senate showdown over immigration policy never really materialized before it all collapsed Thursday with the defeat of four proposals, including President Trump’s, which suffered the worst loss of them all. After raising expectations of an elevated, old-school clash of ideas, the Senate delivered a dud, a major disappointment to those hoping to see a revived Senate confront the tough, politically charged issues by hashing them out on the floor. Over four days of what was supposed to be a rare, open-ended fight, the Senate chamber was often empty, save the lone Republican forced to preside over the inactivity. In the end, the showdown came down to a series of votes on four doomed proposals rather than a daily competition between lawmakers offering a series of defining amendments as in the past. In the run-up to the final decision, the number of dramatic votes on such amendments reached exactly zero. “I think it’s safe to say this has been a disappointing week,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in the aftermath of the legislative failure. For much of the week, the marble hallways were quiet. The C-Span screen noted frequently that there were “no votes scheduled.” Congressional reporters who had heard legends of gripping floor debates from the turn of the century (the 20th, that is) were bemoaning the missed opportunity. The real work — what there was of it — went on behind closed doors as varying groups of lawmakers tried to put together something that could attract the required 60 votes. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Nikolas Cruz was charged today with 17 counts of murder in the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Our live briefing has the latest. Here’s what we know about Mr. Cruz, 19, who had been expelled from the school and was described as a “troubled kid” who enjoyed showing off his firearms. Here’s our full story on Wednesday’s attack, and a map of what happened inside the school. • The numbers are mind-numbing: More than 430 people have been shot in 273 school attacks since the one at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. Three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history were in the past five months. • A bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement on Wednesday to pay for President Trump’s proposed wall on the southern border, and to resolve the fate of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

"Students at the University of Michigan have staged a rare protest against the brutal dictatorship of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro. According to The Michigan Daily, more than 100 people joined a rally less than 24 hours after two students created an “SOS Venezuela” Facebook event. “I think the event created a lot of awareness, not just for the University students, but in general,” The Daily quoted a sophomore as saying. “I think these voices that were heard today are going to keep carrying on; people are going to keep talking about this for a while.” Go Blue, for raising awareness of the worst humanitarian disaster to befall the Western Hemisphere in decades. Just one problem: The protest took place four years ago. Scour the Web and you’ll find a handful of reports of anti-Maduro protests or teach-ins at universities in recent years, usually organized by Venezuelans living in the U.S. And most politically informed people are more-or-less aware of Venezuela’s political and economic disorders. No doubt they don’t like what they see, and no doubt they wish it were otherwise. They just don’t seem to care that much. Every generation of campus activists embraces a worthy foreign-policy cause: Ending apartheid in South Africa; stopping ethnic cleansing in the Balkans; rescuing Darfur from starvation and genocide. And then there’s the perennial — and perennially unworthy — cause of “freeing” Palestine, for which there never is a shortage of credulous campus zealots. Then there are the humanitarian causes young activists generally don’t embrace, at least not in a big way. Cuba’s political prisoners. Islamist violence against Christians in the Middle East. The vast and terrifying concentration camp that is North Korea. Where are the campus protests over any of that? "
"Donald Trump has turned the political world upside down, again and again, like a kid flipping a coin. Every day we wake up to either a new scandal or several lingering ones. It is astounding. It is maddening. It is numbing. At this moment, he is embroiled in a scandal of a six-figure payment to a porn star who goes by the name Stormy Daniels and who, at one point, gave an interview in which she claimed that the two were engaged in an extramarital sexual affair. He is also embroiled in a scandal over why a top aide, Rob Porter, accused of physically assaulting his two ex-wives, was allowed to remain on the White House staff even after these allegations had been brought to the attention of the White House by the F.B.I. Exacerbating this scandal is the fact that the official White House timeline about the events leading to Porter’s resignation turned out to be a lie, according to sworn testimony on Tuesday by the F.B.I. director Christopher Wray. It is also exacerbated by the fact that after Porter resigned, Trump praised him, and initially failed to say anything about domestic violence in general, reserving that condemnation for a week later, when he said, “I’m totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind.” And of course, there is the omnipresent issue of Russia attacking our elections in 2016 and the investigation into whether anyone in the Trump orbit colluded or cooperated with the Russians, conspired to commit a crime, lied to officers or tried to obstruct justice. That’s just the big three at the moment. We also mustn’t forget that the president has never released his tax returns, he refused to sever ties with his businesses, and he is burning through our money going to golf courses or his properties with decadent regularity. He also defended Nazis and was disrespectful to the hurricane-ravaged people of Puerto Rico. "
"With all the noise coming out of Washington, it’s been easy to forget about the Supreme Court. The court has been very quiet: during a recess of nearly four weeks, only the peripatetic Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made news, of a sort. But once the justices get back to business on Friday, that interlude of near invisibility will end. On the agenda for their closed-door meeting Friday morning is an urgent and highly unusual request from the Trump administration for the court’s intervention in the continuing debate over the fate of nearly 800,000 “Dreamers,” the young people brought to this country by their undocumented parents. They have been shielded from deportation since 2012 by the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which President Trump wants to phase out beginning less than three weeks from now. Blocked by a lower court from carrying out that plan, the administration seeks to vault over the normal appellate process, asking the Supreme Court for prompt relief from what Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco calls an “institutional injury to the United States.” The justices’ response — which may come as early as Monday — will tell us more clearly than anything since Inauguration Day what stance the rule-bound court is prepared to take toward the norm-breaking president. Will the Roberts court serve as Donald Trump’s enabler? Or will the court see itself, as it has on rare occasions at other troubled times in the country’s history, as a firewall between the president and the rule of law? With its overheated language and repeated reference to “the ongoing violation of federal law by more than half a million people,” the petition the administration filed last month reads not so much as a legal document but as a recruiting brochure, aimed at a very small but immensely powerful audience of nine. In freezing the DACA program in place last month while lawsuits against its termination proceed, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that the plaintiffs, who include individual DACA recipients, the University of California, and a group of states and California counties, were likely to succeed on their claim that the order to terminate DACA was “arbitrary and capricious” and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act. (On Tuesday, a second federal district judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, in Brooklyn, issued a similar ruling. Cases are also pending in the federal courts of Maryland, Virginia, Florida and the District of Columbia.) Because Judge Alsup sits in San Francisco, any appeal would go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That’s President Trump’s least favorite court, the court that rejected the his bans on immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries, including the current version that is now before the Supreme Court. The morning after Judge Alsup’s ruling, the president tweeted: “It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing sides in a case (such as DACA) always come to the 9th Circuit and almost always win before being reversed by higher courts.” So while filing an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the administration’s lawyers also went to the Supreme Court with a “petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment,” a request to the justices to hear the case this spring without waiting. The Supreme Court’s rules reserve this court-jumping procedure for cases of “imperative public importance.” Only a handful of cases has cleared that bar, including the Nixon tapes case, which effectively forced the president’s resignation and the 1981 case that ratified the agreement that ended the Iran hostage crisis. Invoking those cases, Solicitor General Francisco insists to the court that “that standard has been met here,” an assertion the plaintiffs vigorously dispute. "
"BANGKOK — A senior cabinet minister and army general from Myanmar arrived in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Thursday to discuss a trouble-plagued scheme to repatriate Rohingya Muslims who fled military assaults and now are in camps in Bangladesh. In less than half a year, around 700,000 Rohingya escaped attacks in their home state, Rakhine, and what the international community has called ethnic cleansing by Myanmar’s security forces. The Myanmar government insists it is committed to the repatriation of those Rohingya who can prove they recently left Rakhine. The Bangladeshi side says the same. But few expect that the two days of meetings between Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swe, Myanmar’s home minister, and Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, his Bangladeshi counterpart, will elicit much action. Over months of sporadic talks, each side has blamed the other for failing to put in place a voluntary repatriation agreement signed in November. On Monday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh called on the international community to increase pressure on Myanmar to take back the Rohingya. “The problem has been created on the other side of the border, and the solution to this problem also lies there,” Ms. Hasina said while on a visit to Vatican City. “That’s why the bigger responsibility of implementing the agreement lies on Myanmar’s shoulders, but we haven’t gotten that kind of response from Myanmar yet.” "
"WASHINGTON — Last April, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, led the charge for his agency to approve rules allowing television broadcasters to greatly increase the number of stations they own. A few weeks later, Sinclair Broadcasting announced a blockbuster $3.9 billion deal to buy Tribune Media — a deal those new rules made possible. By the end of the year, in a previously undisclosed move, the top internal watchdog for the F.C.C. opened an investigation into whether Mr. Pai and his aides had improperly pushed for the rule changes and whether they had timed them to benefit Sinclair, according to Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey and two congressional aides. “For months I have been trying to get to the bottom of the allegations about Chairman Pai’s relationship with Sinclair Broadcasting,” Mr. Pallone, the top Democrat on the committee that oversees the F.C.C., said in the statement to The New York Times. “I am grateful to the F.C.C.’s inspector general that he has decided to take up this important investigation.” It was unclear the extent of the inspector general’s investigation or when it might conclude, but the inquiry puts a spotlight on Mr. Pai’s decisions and whether there had been coordination with the company. It may also force him to answer questions that he has so far avoided addressing in public. The inquiry could also add ammunition to arguments against the Sinclair-Tribune deal. Public interest groups and Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Pallone, are strongly opposed to the deal, arguing that it would reduce the number of voices in media and diminish coverage of local news. Sinclair’s chief executive, Chris Ripley, has called Mr. Pai’s relaxation of media ownership rules a “landmark” development for his company and the industry. A union of Sinclair and Tribune would create the nation’s biggest television broadcaster, reaching seven out of 10 American homes. The F.C.C. and Justice Department are widely expected to approve the merger in the coming weeks. "
