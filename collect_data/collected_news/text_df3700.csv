"The Seattle Symphony enjoyed a string of artistic successes under the musical leadership of the French conductor Ludovic Morlot, so when he announced last spring that he would step down after the 2018-19 season, there was widespread curiosity about who would succeed him. The orchestra formed an 11-member search committee, but in the end they did not need to look far: The orchestra announced Tuesday that its next music director would be the charismatic Danish conductor Thomas Dausgaard, who has been its principal guest conductor since 2014. Mr. Dausgaard, 54, who is also the chief conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the Swedish Chamber Orchestra, will become music director in Seattle in 2019. In a statement he praised the orchestra’s “generosity, team spirit, devotion and abandon.” The orchestra has become known for interesting work. It commissioned and presented the premiere of “Become Ocean,” by John Luther Adams, which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize, and this spring plans to produce the premiere of its sequel, “Become Desert.” The orchestra has released a number of well-received recordings. And earlier this year it responded to one of President Trump’s travel ban proposals by giving a free concert called “Music Beyond Borders” highlighting works from the targeted countries. Mr. Dausgaard has been an audience favorite in Seattle. A critic for The Seattle Times wrote last spring that: “In 40 years of reviewing concerts for The Seattle Times, I have never seen a guest maestro more warmly received by the audiences.” Simon Woods, the orchestra’s president and chief executive, said in a statement that Mr. Dausgaard’s journey from principal guest conductor to music director was “a kind of organic artistic progression that is rare and treasurable.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Gunman’s girlfriend returns to U.S. Marilou Danley, who was overseas when Stephen Paddock killed 58 people in Las Vegas and wounded hundreds more, arrived from the Philippines on Tuesday night. Law enforcement officials hope she can shed light on Mr. Paddock’s motives. Here are the latest updates. Investigators shared new details on Tuesday, including surveillance measures the gunman had put in place and information about his weapons, some of which could fire hundreds of rounds a minute. Video from police body cameras was also released. "
"Good morning on this mild Wednesday. New York continues to mourn the victims of the attack in Las Vegas, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. A vigil was held at New York University on Monday, and another at Brooklyn Borough Hall last night, for those killed in Las Vegas and other victims of gun violence. As more details emerge about the Las Vegas shooting and the gunman who carried it out, we wanted to know how gun laws in our city and state compare to those in Nevada, and other areas of the country. “New York State, as a whole, has stronger gun safety laws than the rest of the country,” said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “It’s also one of a handful of states that allows cities to have their own gun laws.” How do New York’s gun laws differ from other states? In New York, you must obtain a permit and pass a rigorous background check for all gun purchases. In most states, buying a gun from a private seller — in a classified ad or online — does not require a permit or passing a background check, Mr. Skaggs said. In New York, even if you meet the requirements to purchase a gun, law enforcement may still deny you. Also, if your gun is lost or stolen, you are required to report it to the police. What are the state’s rules for owning assault weapons? Under the 2013 Safe Act, passed after the 2012 mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School, New York prohibits the purchase or possession of large-capacity magazines and assault-style weapons (unless you owned the gun before January 2013). Other semiautomatic weapons, in which the trigger must be pulled to fire each bullet, are legal in New York, but you cannot legally purchase a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds. In Nevada, and much of the country, Mr. Skaggs said, magazine capacities are not regulated. "
"In the more than seven months since he became administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt has been on a reckless mission to dismantle public health safeguards and environmental protections. Mr. Pruitt’s E.P.A. wants to postpone or roll back dozens of rules that save lives and provide clean air and water, including efforts by the Obama administration to combat climate change and to protect rivers and streams from pollution. Last week brought more bad news: Mr. Pruitt is proposing to end a decades-long agreement with the Justice Department that funds the E.P.A.’s lawsuits against polluters responsible for creating hazardous waste sites. Neither Congress nor the courts will have the final say. The decision rests with the Trump administration. Since the Reagan administration, the E.P.A. has reimbursed the Justice Department for the cost of suing companies as part of the Superfund hazardous waste site cleanup program. In communities like the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Times Beach, Mo., the Justice Department sued polluters to force them to pay the cost of relocating residents. More recently, the E.P.A. covered the upfront costs of suing the W. R. Grace chemical conglomerate in the small town of Libby, Mont., where hundreds have died from asbestos poisoning, and compelling General Electric to clean up decades of PCB pollution that ravaged the Hudson River. But in its budget proposal, the E.P.A. said it no longer intended to reimburse the Justice Department for Superfund litigation costs. These lawsuits are expensive, with Justice Department lawyers doing battle, often for years, with the largest law firms in America. But the return on the agency’s investment is substantial. The Justice Department recovers hundreds of millions of dollars every year in cleanup costs to replenish the Superfund program’s coffers, which enables the E.P.A. to conduct more hazardous waste cleanups, including emergency responses to chemical releases like those that occurred after Hurricane Harvey. For the Environment and Natural Resources Division at the Justice Department, which represents the E.P.A. and other federal agencies in court, funding from the E.P.A. is essential. In its budget proposal for 2018, the Justice Department indicated that it expected to receive approximately $25 million from the E.P.A., enough to pay for 69 lawyers as well as support staff, nearly 20 percent of the division.

"It’s time to talk about taking away guns — not everyone’s guns and not all of them, but a whole lot. I know I am inviting enormous vitriol with that sentence, but it has to be said. Every time the nation suffers an act of terrorism on our soil like the one on Sunday in Las Vegas, we have the same fruitless debate in which opponents of sensible gun regulation hide behind the Second Amendment and supporters of gun control dance around it. In the aftermath of murder sprees, politicians, columnists and other prominent people suggest perfectly sensible reforms in hopes of reducing the lethality of these horrors or the ease with which they are mounted. On Monday, Hillary Clinton talked about the lunacy of allowing easy access to silencers. She wondered if the bloodletting might have been even worse if the killer had dampened the sound of his shots. Following the usual pattern, opponents of gun control attacked her for her “ignorance” about the technology of firearms and what silencers really do or don’t do. Following another well-worn trail, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said it was just not the right time to talk about gun laws. (In the same way, I suppose, that football games are not the right time to talk about institutionalized racism.) "
"After Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the presidential election, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they want her to retire. But they don’t say from what. We’ve never been quite sure what to do with our also-rans. William Howard Taft, having been defeated by Woodrow Wilson in 1912, became the 10th chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, which as fallback plans go is not half bad. On the other hand, after Horace Greeley lost to Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, he checked into an asylum. Greeley died on Nov. 29, just 24 days after his loss, before the Electoral College votes had even been counted. The cause of death was listed as “brain fever.” Assuming that Mrs. Clinton is neither appointed to the Supreme Court nor succumbs to brain fever, what is it that we want from her? What do we want from anyone who has sought our affections and failed? Our presidential also-rans are like a democracy’s version of a crazy ex-boyfriend, or -husband (or -girlfriend or -wife). In some instances, you hope that you can continue a civil relationship, for the good of the children. Other times, your best option is a restraining order. This situation didn’t begin with Mrs. Clinton, of course. To get a sense of perspective, you could do worse than to spend an afternoon at 105 Main Street, in Norton, Kan., which is not only the site of the First State Bank but also the They Also Ran Gallery, a collection of paintings and photographs of 61 people who have sought the presidency and lost. Founded by the banker William Walter Rouse in 1965, the gallery is one of at least two very interesting places in Norton, the other being a medium-security prison where, according to its website, inmates train and groom shelter dogs.

"Before reading the article: Closely and carefully examine the matrix pictured, or a larger version here, that shows the results of a survey asking social scientists, lawyers and public health officials, as well as a representative sample of the American electorate, how effective each of 29 policies would be in reducing firearm homicide deaths, regardless of political feasibility or cost. What do you notice about the upper-right corner of the matrix? Where on the matrix can you find the policies deemed both effective and popular, and what specific policies fall there? Which policies are much less effective and less popular with both the experts and the public? What questions do you have after examining the matrix? Why? Now, read the article, “How to Prevent Gun Deaths? Where Experts and the Public Agree,” and answer the following questions: 1. What popular measures in the survey were supported by more than 85 percent of registered voters, according to the article? What least popular idea was still favored by nearly 50 percent? 2. What did Daniel Webster, a professor and director of the Johns Hopkins center for gun policy and research, say about the controversial topic of guns and the surprise result from the polls conducted? 3. What does President Trump support in terms of gun rights, according to the article? What do the matrix and polling results show about the concealed carry bill as an idea for reducing gun homicides? Is it effective? Popular? 4. How does the article’s matrix on mass shootings compare with the matrix on firearm homicide deaths, above? 5. What measures are supported by academics opposed to gun control? 6. What measures are supported by law enforcement professionals? 7. What strategies for increased safety were not included in the survey, according to the article? 8. Study the list at the end of the article that gives a ranking for effectiveness and a percentage of public support for each suggested policy. What can you determine about the relationship between effectiveness of a suggested policy and its percentage of public support? Why did you answer the way you did? Finally, tell us more about what you think: Do you agree with any of the measures in the article that are proposed to prevent gun deaths in the United States? If so, which ones, and why? Do you have any ideas of your own that you think might work to prevent gun deaths, either in general or specifically; for example, with mass shootings, gang-related homicides or other types of gun deaths? If so, what are your ideas, and why do you think they might work? For more student opinion on guns and gun control, see the Learning Network’s Civil Conversation Challenge.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico on Tuesday was packed with awkward moments that seemingly begged for the late-night treatment. Mr. Trump groused about having to address the fallout from Hurricane Maria, saying, “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack.” Touring the storm’s wreckage, he told a hurricane victim to “have a good time.” He casually tossed emergency rolls of paper towels into a crowd, as if shooting a basketball. Jim Jefferies, host of the new “Jim Jefferies Show” on Comedy Central, was particularly outraged by the comment about the budget. Stephen Colbert was taken aback by the “have a good time” line. And Mr. Colbert bristled at the way Mr. Trump described the storm during an address to Puerto Rican journalists: “Your weather is second to none, but every once in a while you get hit,” Mr. Trump said. “And you really got hit, there’s no question about it.” Jimmy Fallon summed up the visit with a one-liner. The more news we get about the man who killed 58 victims and himself in Las Vegas on Sunday, the less he sounds like any known mass gunman before him. He was reportedly a multimillionaire with no criminal record. "
"LAS VEGAS — Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Thursday’s live updates. In her first public statement since the Las Vegas massacre, the gunman’s girlfriend said Wednesday that he had sent her on a trip to the Philippines and wired her money there, but that she did not know he was planning to harm anyone. The statement from the woman, Marilou Danley, which was read by her lawyer, Matthew Lombard, came after Ms. Danley went to the Los Angeles offices of the F.B.I. for questioning, according to a law enforcement official. It was released as the authorities sought her insight into what prompted a man with no evident criminal history to become a mass murderer. She stressed that she returned to the United States voluntarily, “because I know that the F.B.I. and the Las Vegas police department wanted to talk to me, and I wanted to talk to them.” • The authorities found evidence that the gunman, Stephen Paddock, planned to escape after the shooting and survive, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said at a news conference on Wednesday evening. • The bureau is trying to reconstruct Mr. Paddock’s actions, including finding and interviewing “everyone and anyone who crossed his path in recent weeks,” Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I., said at a cybersecurity conference in Boston. "
"You’ve been moderating “Meet the Press” for just over three years. Do you think your job is the same today as it was, say, 10 months ago? What the audience expects hasn’t changed. People come to us for the same reasons: to be educated and informed. My biggest change is that I feel the need to reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians. The wall has always been there, but sometimes there have been too many holes in it. One legitimate criticism of the political press over the last two decades has been the appearance of coziness between people in the media and the political elite. It’s a lot easier for me, say, as a sports fan to accept a personal fandom, whereas in politics, I’m not going to tell anybody whom I vote for, not even my kids, who ask me all the time, because their friends ask them. O.K., but you did vote for someone. You have opinions. Is that the same as being biased? No. I don’t advocate — that’s the big difference. Now, that said, we’re all human beings. We’re born with original bias. By our very nature, we’re subjective. It’s not as if you can eradicate bias out of anything, but it’s about fairness. You’ve also said that character isn’t ideology. In politics, 90 percent of the disagreements are about policy or ideological point of view. Some people will believe they fit into a “right and wrong” paradigm, but a lot of times political disagreements don’t. I’m held to a standard of decency in my job. I think there’s nothing wrong with doing the same to politicians. If someone is a bad character, what is your role as a journalist? You just point it out. At the end of the day, it’s still up to the voter, not me. Do you think you did a good job covering the events of 2016? I’m going to give you a Donald Rumsfeld answer: You cover the campaign that’s in front of you. You don’t get to cover the campaign you want. There are always lessons to be learned, and look, it’ll impact what happens next. Someday, we’ll say that somebody would’ve never been elected had 2016 not happened, right? Barack Obama might not have become president if Hillary Clinton had run in 2004. If Katherine Harris didn’t ever run for secretary of state in 1998, and the Democrat ends up winning that race against a scandal-ridden Republican incumbent at the time, whom Harris beat in the primary, so the Democrats control the certification process in Florida in 2000 — who knows what happens? That’s what I love about politics: that butterfly effect. We don’t try to erase a result; we just move on from it and build from it. "
"Uber’s relationships with cities tend to begin or end in war. Smaller markets experience the company as a powerful invading force — often a welcome one. The company’s model easily outclasses and undercuts provincial competitors, conscripting local cabbies and enlisting new drivers. Flimsy taxi regulations backed by weak municipal governments are quickly overwhelmed by the multibillion-dollar company and its armies of lawyers and lobbyists and their briefcases full of case studies and legislative suggestions. But in larger markets with bigger taxi companies, municipal governments bristle at the company’s deep, evident disdain for their authority — and they’re capable of striking back. Last month, in a sudden show of force, London told Uber that its license to operate in the city wouldn’t be renewed. The city’s transit authority cited a number of reasons for its actions: Uber’s approach to reporting crimes; its background-check policies; its aggressive attempts to thwart regulators; general appeals to “public safety” and “corporate responsibility.” “While Uber has revolutionized the way people move in cities around the world, it’s equally true that we’ve got things wrong along the way,” Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, wrote in a public letter. But this performance of contrition came on the heels of the company’s first effort at retaliation. It had already mobilized its drivers and users, starting a petition accusing the city of having “given in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice,” of threatening the livelihoods of tens of thousands of its workers and of depriving millions of customers. The effort quickly garnered more than 800,000 signatures. London’s threat to Uber is clearly existential: Being shut out of one of its largest markets is terrible for business and sets a dangerous precedent for the company as it tries to expand around the globe. But governments similarly perceive, in Uber, a broader challenge to their legitimacy. Uber doesn’t so much do business in cities as unilaterally install itself as infrastructure. Its incompatibilities with local regulations or national employment law are presented as neither features nor bugs but as evidence of evolution and progress. It identifies, vets and credentials drivers. It fields complaints and arbitrates disputes, exercising authority over those it deems bad actors. It lets riders rate drivers and vice versa, creating a sort of customer-service-centric accountability. Because Uber purports to be self-regulating, its users and drivers share in the company’s feeling that outside interference is unwelcome and even unnatural. It now has a constituency, hundreds of thousands strong, angry with their government on behalf of a corporation. The same week Uber was given notice in London, Mark Zuckerberg sat down in front of a camera in Menlo Park, Calif. His desaturated earth-tone palette was matched color for color by his office in the background, as if to provide camouflage. Indeed, it was easy to miss the sheer range and strangeness of what he was there to say. “I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,” he said. “The integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world.” "
"Hollywood, Calif. — Sarah Silverman, during the first test run of her new political variety show, “I Love You, America,” introduced a nude couple in the front row. Next was a generic white male host behind a desk to her right, a familiar face, she said pointedly, for audiences to look to when things get uncomfortable. But they weren’t the most surprising supporting players on this studio set, which looked like a cross between a roadside diner and an upscale thrift store. That may have been a Trump voter, part of a group of ordinary people interviewed by Ms. Silverman, a liberal comedian who spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year. Asked about his support for the president, he explained that Mr. Trump had fewer scandals than Hillary Clinton. Ms. Silverman cringed and the crowd murmured, anticipating a sharp comeback. Instead, she smiled politely and moved on. Is this really Sarah Silverman? “You’ve never changed someone’s mind by arguing,” she said the next day, sitting on a couch in her office watching footage from the show, which will have its premiere on Hulu on Oct. 12. “Or facts. Facts don’t change people’s minds, as crazy as that sounds.” Gesticulating across from an American flag mounted above her desk, Ms. Silverman said there are enough comedians on television, sure of their rightness, explaining why their opponents are wrong. “I am interested in hearing about people’s feelings, and as corny and hippie-granola as it sounds, it is the root of everything,” she said. Ms. Silverman, 46, one of the greatest stand-up comics of her generation, pioneered a swaggeringly feminine brand of raunchy, button-pushing humor that paved the way for comics like Amy Schumer and Ali Wong. In recent years, she has pivoted from this style, embracing a more earnestly engaged voice. With this new show she moves even further away, risking alienating her fans and experimenting with the limits of political comedy in the Trump era. In this increasingly divisive moment, is there an audience for a comedy show that aims for common ground? "
"President Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico risks compounding the damage caused by Hurricane Maria. His vow on Tuesday to wipe out the United States commonwealth’s huge debts sent its bond prices plunging on Wednesday. The island’s devastation may well necessitate a fresh restructuring, but that won’t address urgent issues. The White House needs to provide money and supplies, not distraction. The president spent a few hours touring the island on Tuesday, tossing rolls of paper towels to locals and praising what he said was the “great job” being done by federal emergency teams and military commanders. Roughly two-thirds of grocery stores and gasoline stations have reopened and power was restored earlier this week to the business district of the capital, San Juan. Most of the island’s hospitals, though, rely on intermittent deliveries of diesel to power generators — so they are still in the dark. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced shortly after the president left that the death toll had more than doubled, to 34. It will take months, if not years, to rebuild damaged roads, the power grid, homes and other infrastructure. The catastrophe-modeling firm AIR Worldwide has estimated insured losses of anywhere between $40 billion and $85 billion. Given the scale of the task, it seems likely bondholders will ultimately face an even bigger haircut than they were bracing for. In May, Puerto Rico initiated a form of bankruptcy to restructure its more than $70 billion of debt. The commonwealth’s general obligation bonds due in 2035 were trading around 57 cents on the dollar before Hurricane Maria struck, declining to some 45 cents on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s comments provoked a surge in sell orders that wiped an additional 25 percent off the price on Wednesday, according to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s electronic quotation service. Driving away investors won’t help Puerto Rico’s recovery effort. Mr. Trump doesn’t even have the authority to abrogate debts, something the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, seemed to recognize Wednesday when he said the president’s comments shouldn’t be taken literally. Even if the president wants to help negotiate a more generous restructuring for the island, that process is a slow, painstaking one. That’s the opposite of what the territory and its 3.5 million people need most. "
"The Trump administration on Wednesday walked back the president’s apparent vow to wipe out Puerto Rico’s debt, suggesting that the island would have to solve its own fiscal woes despite the catastrophic damage it has endured from two powerful hurricanes. “I wouldn’t take it word for word with that,” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on CNN in reference to President Trump’s suggestion that the United States might clear Puerto Rico’s debt. Mr. Mulvaney said that the administration would be focusing its efforts on helping Puerto Rico rebuild from storm damage but that the commonwealth would continue to proceed through the debt restructuring process it was undertaking before the storm. “Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out how to fix the errors that it’s made for the last generation on its own finances,” Mr. Mulvaney said. A person with knowledge of the plans to assist Puerto Rico said the president had wanted creditors to grasp the scope of the destruction, and to realize that immediate priorities had to change. The person said that there was now an urgent need for cash on the island, and that Congress could address some of it by loosening the restrictions on programs for housing, health and infrastructure construction that various federal agencies had offered. The funds would be used on the island and not flow through to the creditors, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the debt situation was still being revised. "
"Michael Grimm, who is trying to win back his old House seat after serving time in federal prison, secured a notable new supporter on Wednesday: Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, who has sought to bolster the candidacies of populist outsiders since leaving the White House. The two met at Mr. Bannon’s Capitol Hill townhouse on Wednesday afternoon, three days after Mr. Grimm announced he was challenging Representative Dan Donovan of Staten Island for the Republican nomination in New York City’s last G.O.P.-held congressional seat. “We’re joining the Bannon portfolio of Republican challengers to anti-Trump Republican congressmen,” said Michael Caputo, a Grimm adviser who also served as an adviser to Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Andy Surabian, a political strategist who works closely with Mr. Bannon and who was at Wednesday’s meeting, said, “Steve likes the fact that Grimm is a straight-talking, fire-breathing, conservative populist.” Chris Grant, a New York Republican political strategist who Mr. Caputo said will serve as Mr. Grimm’s general consultant, also attended the strategy session. “We agreed to cooperate through this campaign,” Mr. Caputo said. “What exactly that means will unfold in the weeks ahead.” Mr. Grimm and Mr. Bannon posed for a photo — Mr. Grimm in a blue suit and Mr. Bannon in his familiar layers of button-down shirts — before they parted ways. “Game on!” Mr. Grimm wrote on Twitter, posting the picture. From the start, Mr. Grimm has tried to frame his comeback bid around the idea that he would be a stronger ally to President Trump in Congress than Mr. Donovan, a former district attorney who took office in a special election after Mr. Grimm pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud. Mr. Grimm served seven months in prison. “Our president needs help draining the swamp,” Mr. Grimm shouted at his announcement on Sunday. At another point he said, “Let’s hear it for our president, Donald J. Trump.” Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for Mr. Donovan, called Wednesday “a bad day for swamp-draining.” “Michael Grimm had one of the most liberal voting records when he was in Congress on issues like immigration, trade and gun control. These are issues that Steve Bannon has talked extensively about and Michael Grimm’s record is actually completely counter to him on that.” Mr. Bannon has sought to aggressively insert himself into the congressional political landscape since exiting the White House, most notably campaigning against Mr. Trump’s choice in a Senate special election. Mr. Bannon backed Roy Moore, an outspoken social conservative, who beat the candidate that Mr. Trump had endorsed, Luther Strange. "

"WASHINGTON — Legislation to rescue the Children’s Health Insurance Program sailed through a Senate committee on Wednesday, but touched off a partisan conflict in the House, diminishing hopes that the popular program would be quickly refinanced. Funding for the program expired on Sunday, and state officials said they would soon start notifying families that children could lose coverage if Congress did not provide additional money. It was impossible to say when Congress might pass a bill and send it to President Trump. By voice vote, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill on Wednesday that would provide more than $100 billion over five years for the program, which insures nearly nine million children. The committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, hailed the bill as “a prime example of what government can accomplish when both parties work together.” Mr. Hatch wrote the bill with the senior Democrat on the committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon, just as Mr. Hatch helped create the program in 1997 with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. But in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, lawmakers brawled Wednesday over a similar bill to provide money for the children’s health program. Democrats strongly support the program, but complained that Republicans would take money from Medicare and the Affordable Care Act to offset the cost. The House committee eventually approved the bill, by a vote of 28 to 23, with all of the opposition coming from Democrats. "
"WASHINGTON — Three United States Army Special Forces were killed and two were wounded on Wednesday in an ambush in Niger while on a training mission with troops from that nation in northwestern Africa, American military officials said. “We can confirm reports that a joint U.S. and Nigerien patrol came under hostile fire in southwest Niger,” Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Falvo, a spokesman for the United States Africa Command in Stuttgart, Germany, said in an email. All five American soldiers were Green Berets, said two United States military officials. The attack took place 120 miles north of Niamey, the capital of Niger, near the border with Mali, where militants with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, an affiliate of Al Qaeda, have conducted cross-border raids. Niger’s troops were also believed to have suffered casualties, but details were not immediately known. The deaths represent the first American casualties under hostile fire in a mission in which United States Special Forces have provided training and security assistance to the Nigerien armed forces, including support for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. A Special Forces soldier died in a vehicle accident in Niger in February. One of the military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss continuing military operations, said American forces were rushing to the scene of the ambush, presumably to evacuate American and Nigerien casualties, and possibly to hunt down the attackers. President Trump was briefed on the deaths of the Green Berets, said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Wednesday to approve $29 billion in additional hurricane relief and debt forgiveness, seeking to help Puerto Rico and other battered areas and to shore up the troubled federal program that provides flood insurance to homes and small businesses. The request came nearly a month after lawmakers approved a first installment of $15 billion in disaster relief, taking action after Hurricane Harvey caused devastation in Texas and while Hurricane Irma was heading toward Florida. Many more billions of dollars in aid requests are likely to come as Puerto Rico and other areas assess the damage from this year’s hurricanes. The latest request seeks $12.8 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stay current with the nearly $200 million a day the agency is spending on recovery work. It also asks for lawmakers to wipe out $16 billion in debt that the National Flood Insurance Program owes to the Treasury and has no immediate way to repay. Under the White House proposal, premiums for flood insurance would rise, at least for homeowners who could afford to pay more, while private insurers would be encouraged to start writing their own flood insurance. In addition, the White House is also seeking $577 million in response to wildfires that have been prevalent this year in Western states, and is calling for efforts to limit the cost and devastation of wildfires. “With two more months of hurricane season remaining and wildfires continuing to burn in the West, we must act expeditiously to ensure that communities have the assistance they need, when they need it,” wrote President Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in a letter to congressional leaders on Wednesday. "
"Pettiness, such pettiness, in this noxious swamp of maybe-morons. “I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters on Wednesday, declining to refute an NBC report that he had privately called President Trump a “moron” this year. “This is what I don’t understand about Washington. Again, I’m not from this place. But the places I come from, we don’t deal with that kind of petty nonsense.” There was no immediate estimate available for the collective pettiness of Texas, where Mr. Tillerson was raised, nor of the oil industry, where he spent his career until Mr. Trump summoned him to the pettiness hub along the Potomac. But for a certain class of Washington denizen, Mr. Tillerson’s slight opened a new front in the nation’s forever-war against the reputation of its capital. The thrashing of Washington culture by voters, nonvoters, members of Congress — that much is a sacred rite. A sitting secretary of state, at odds with his president and blaming the city’s trifling instincts for stoking tensions, is another matter. “It’s profoundly paradoxical,” said Rick Tyler, a longtime Republican strategist who served as communications director for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas during last year’s Republican presidential primary race. “His boss is the most petty person ever to come to Washington.” Barney Frank, the retired longtime Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, marveled at how wholly a sitting government in Washington had embraced a view of Washington villainy.

Vance Jr., last week returned a five-year-old campaign contribution from President Trump’s personal lawyer after journalists raised questions about Mr. Vance’s 2012 decision to end a criminal investigation into fraud allegations against Mr. Trump and his children, a spokesman for Mr. Vance’s campaign said. The investigation had delved into allegations that Mr. Trump’s eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Jr., had lied to buyers of units at the Trump SoHo, a 46-story luxury condominium-hotel in Lower Manhattan, about how many apartments had been sold, painting a rosy picture of sales at the struggling project. The buyers sued the Trumps and their partners in the project, and in late 2010 the Manhattan district attorney’s office started looking into whether laws had been broken. Mr. Vance, a Democrat, said on Wednesday his decision to drop the investigation in August 2012 had nothing to do with donations the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, made to his campaign. He said he had determined after two years of investigation that his office could not prove a crime had been committed. “The idea for me that I would make a case decision for $5,000, or $50,000 or $100,000, is ludicrous, because it’s so much more important for me to have the work of this office be perceived as fair and unbiased and not for sale,” he said in an interview. “None of the decisions revolved around campaign contributions at all, or anything other than my assessment that this was not a case the office should prosecute, on the merits.” One of the contributions, for $25,000, was returned in May 2012, just before Mr. Kasowitz met with Mr. Vance and two senior prosecutors to argue the Trumps had done nothing illegal. Mr. Vance ended the investigation three months later. The second contribution, for $32,000, came five months after Mr. Vance made his decision. That contribution was returned last week, after journalists made inquiries about it. Mr. Kasowitz’s role in the case, and the contributions to Vance’s campaign, were first reported in a joint article by The New Yorker, ProPublica and WNYC. "
"As Canadian lawmakers took up legislation on Wednesday that would bar businesses from dealing with foreigners who have committed human rights abuses, a nonprofit group called the Russian Congress of Canada pushed hard against the measure. The lawmakers say the effort was part of a broader lobbying campaign orchestrated by Russia against such laws, including one in the United States. Canadian human rights advocates say they were also singled out. The pro-Russia group denies any connection to the Kremlin, but lawmakers say the push fits a pattern of Moscow-backed interference in the West. And they say that the lobbying campaign, which began in 2014 and grew with attacks last spring on Canada’s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, highlights the dangers of Russian meddling in Canada. Nonetheless, the bill passed unanimously in Parliament on Wednesday evening. It allows Canada to sanction, freeze assets or deny entry to foreigners from any country that has violated human rights or engaged in corruption. “Everybody realizes that some organizations are being used as a proxy for Putin,” James Bezan, a conservative member of Parliament and a supporter of the bill said. “These groups are trying to disrupt and discredit this legislation in Canada and democracy within our own borders.” The legislation, informally known as the Sergei Magnitsky Law, is named for a lawyer who died in a Russian prison under mysterious circumstances after exposing one of the biggest government corruption scandals during President Vladimir V. Putin’s time in power. "
"Jill Bialosky, a prolific poet and essayist who is a top editor at W. W. Norton & Company, is facing accusations that passages in her new memoir, “Poetry Will Save Your Life,” are plagiarized. In a review posted online Wednesday in The Tourniquet Review, a literary journal, the critic William Logan claimed that Ms. Bialosky had “plagiarized numerous passages from Wikipedia and the websites of the Academy of American Poets and the Poetry Foundation.” He offered direct comparisons between the language used in her memoir and the language found on other websites, and in one instance, in another author’s book. “My rule is, check basic facts when finishing a review,” Mr. Logan wrote in an email on Wednesday. “Take nothing on trust.” “The similarity of language made my heart sink,” he said, after he first noticed an overlap between her passage about Robert Louis Stevenson and what appears on the Academy of American Poets’ website. The academy’s page says: “Born on November 13, 1850, in Edinburgh, Scotland, Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson came from a long line of prominent lighthouse engineers. During his boyhood, he spent holidays with his maternal grandfather … Prone to illness, Stevenson spent many of his early winters in bed, entertained only by … love of reading, especially William Shakespeare … and ‘The Arabian Nights.’” Ms. Bialosky wrote: “Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on November 13, 1850. He came from a family of lighthouse engineers. During his boyhood he was prone to illness and spent many of his childhood winters in bed, entertained by reading Shakespeare and The Arabian Nights.” "

he cottages where we stayed last weekend in the Blue Mountains are well known for attracting friendly kangaroos. But in the parking lot, there were also signs warning us not to feed them. So what were we to do when we saw a family, who appeared to be immigrants or tourists from India based on their accents, tossing slices of white bread to the hopping herd? My 7-year-old daughter, a roo lover supreme, wanted to tell them to stop, but my wife and I found ourselves resisting. “No, no,” we told her as she ran toward them, “leave them be.” Was that the right call? Or were we shirking our civic duty? For a nation settled by convicts, Australians can be sticklers for the rules. I think of this every time I see people waiting for the “walk” sign at crosswalks where cars are nowhere to be seen, or when I interact with officials in Canberra or civil servants in New South Wales, who tend to insist that the way they do things is the only way they could ever be done, ever, anywhere. Isn’t this also one of the lessons of “The Castle”? The idea that Australians who try to follow the rules are meant to be honored? "
"Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Thursday’s live updates. A familiar pattern often emerges as the authorities investigate a mass shooting: speculation in online forums that one person couldn’t have possibly committed this act alone. Law enforcement officials have stated multiple times that, at this point, they believe that Stephen Paddock, who killed at least 58 and himself and wounded hundreds on Sunday night in Las Vegas, was the only gunman. (Still, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Wednesday that “it was troublesome that he was able to move this much gear into the hotel unassisted.”) Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department explicitly addressed the issue on Monday night: “I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory or that rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock.” Similar rumor mongering has emerged in the wake of previous mass shootings. The morning after a gunman opened fire at a nightclub in Orlando, the police dispelled the rumor that he had accomplices. Some falsely believe the Sandy Hook shooting was staged and seized upon a mysterious “man in the woods” as proof of an additional conspirator. The man was searching for his daughter, a student at the elementary school. In fact, mass shootings have historically been solo acts, with some exceptions like Columbine and San Bernardino. After Sunday’s shooting on an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, several readers have written to The New York Times inquiring about the viral claim that there was a second gunman or additional gunmen. "
"I don’t know how to break it to Idris Elba. So I just say it. “Is Kate Winslet really the woman you want to be stuck with when disaster strikes in freezing weather? You do know that she didn’t move over to make room on that door and Leo slipped into the icy Atlantic?” The British actor laughs. He is sitting atop the New York skyline in a dining room at the Mandarin Oriental. “Kate Winslet is surprisingly resilient to almost anything,” he says. “I mean, she is a bruiser. Tough. As. Nails. And if we were ever to fall off a real mountain, her and I, we would survive because she’s not like a slouch in any shape or form.” And, to be fair, Ms. Winslet did hoist Richard Branson’s mother down some stairs after a lightning bolt in a hurricane sparked a fire that engulfed the Branson holiday home on Necker Island, where she and her children were staying in 2011. That was when she met her husband, Mr. Branson’s nephew, a.k.a. Ned Rocknroll, when he rushed into the burning house with a headlamp. “She was just like, ‘That guy’s for me,”’ Mr. Elba says. The actor is starring with Ms. Winslet in the “The Mountain Between Us,” based on a novel about strangers who struggle, snuggle and eat roasted mountain lion in the frigid Utah wilderness after their small plane crashes. Mr. Elba often plays opposite very strong women, and he says that’s fine with him. His Ghana-born “Mum” is so into tough love, he says, that at his 45th birthday party recently, she turned her cheek away when he went to kiss her. Mr. Elba also portrays the New York lawyer who defends Molly Bloom, the audacious poker madam to the stars played by a fiery Jessica Chastain in the Aaron Sorkin movie, “Molly’s Game,” out Nov. 22. And the actor created one of the most memorable romances in TV history in the popular BBC series “Luther,” when his London homicide detective in the big tweed overcoat, known by his deputies as “his satanic majesty,” gets in an erotic and psychopathic entanglement with a latter-day Lizzie Borden, played with film-noir panache by the flame-haired Ruth Wilson.

"A year ago, the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Bob Dylan, shocking folks all over the world — most notably, Bob Dylan. In its announcement, the Nobel Prize committee compared the singer-songwriter to the ancient Greek poets, Homer and Sappho, even though he probably more closely identified with the 1960s bluegrass poets, Homer and Jethro. For the next two weeks, Dylan said nothing in public, while the committee fretted and old school writers of paragraphs fumed. Irvine Welsh, author of “Trainspotting,” called it “an ill-conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.” (Prediction: Welsh never wins a Nobel Prize.) Eventually, Dylan broke silence, thanked everybody and apologized for the confusion, saying the award simply had left him “speechless.” A Nobel Laureate, speechless? That’s not supposed to happen. During his year as a Nobel laureate, he didn’t write a new memoir or release an album of new songs. He didn’t scream at President Trump or even save a rain forest. (Those jobs await Madonna’s Nobel.) Instead, Dylan seemed trapped beneath an avalanche of unsolicited prestige. For decades, he’d been going about his business, writing songs and playing them, and then — boom! — he’s suddenly a big Nobel literary cheese. The times, they certainly a-changed. "

The pot of unclaimed money is known as the earned income tax credit. And Californians have access to it twice over — through programs offered by both the state and federal governments.

"LAS VEGAS — President Trump comforted the victims of Sunday’s deadly mass shooting and paid tribute to those who tended to them, taking up on Wednesday a harrowing duty of the modern presidency that has nevertheless become numbing in its regularity. After touring the wreckage of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico a day earlier, a somber Mr. Trump headed to Las Vegas, where 58 people were slain by an assailant raining bullets into a crowded country music festival from the blown-out window of his hotel room high above them. “What I saw today is just an incredible tribute to professionalism, and what they have done is incredible. And you never want to see it again,” Mr. Trump said, after spending about an hour talking to patients in the trauma center of a Las Vegas hospital that received 100 people in the hours after the shooting. “We met patients that were absolutely, terribly wounded,” the president added. “And the doctors, the nurses, all of the people at the hospital, have done a job that is indescribable.” In a four-hour visit to this bereaved city, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania, also toured the operations center of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which coordinated the response to the shooting. On one wall hung a poster with an aerial view of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where the gunman perched, and the site of the music festival below it. “This is a rough time,” Mr. Trump told the assembled police officers, some of whom had risked gunfire to direct the concertgoers toward safety. “But if you didn’t get up there so quickly, it could have been worse — a lot worse.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Ta-Nehisi Coates has criticized my column on kneeling athletes, and several readers also made a version of his point, in emails. I wanted to offer a few thoughts in response. First, I appreciate Coates’s prefacing his critique with kind words about most of my work, and the feeling is mutual. If you’ve heard his name but haven’t yet read any of his articles or his books, you should remedy that. Here is part of what he said, on an episode of Pod Save America, edited slightly for brevity (and here’s an Atlantic article in which he expanded the argument): David Leonhardt’s column “points out Martin Luther King, John Lewis, March on Washington, boycotts, etc., and how the civil rights movement presumably successfully appealed to America by pointing out the things that bring us together. And this is contrasted with N.F.L. players who are kneeling today in the movement inaugurated by [Colin] Kaepernick. “And David says, ‘While I’m in sympathy with these players, they need to look at the past and learn that it’s possible to appeal to the masses of Americans, that you can get Americans on your side if you can find something that bridges the gap, that brings us all together. And kneeling doesn’t do that.’ “And he shows some polling data to show that. I read that, and I almost threw my computer across the room. Because in fact there is polling data about what Americans thought of Martin Luther King, and the Freedom Riders, and the March on Washington. It wasn’t a high opinion at all.” "
"While the citizens of Puerto Rico persevere through the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the island’s creditors are engaged in a very different recovery effort. At the very moment when the island needs relief, those creditors are trying to increase the value of their debt holdings. Few things could be more damaging to Puerto Rico’s ability to rebuild. President Trump, who visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday, has said in tweets that the island’s debts “sadly must be dealt with.” That is true — but not by enhancing creditors’ returns. Instead, the island’s crushing debt should be reduced to the maximum extent through the legal framework established by Congress last year. Mr. Trump himself now seems to agree with that idea, without offering details. “They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we’re going to have to wipe that out,” he said in an interview on Fox News Tuesday. “You’re going to say goodbye to that, I don’t know if it’s Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that.” Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico was already enduring a debt crisis. The commonwealth had accumulated more than $70 billion in debt, paying interest rates as high as 8.5 percent. The public pension funds were depleted, and Medicaid money allotted from the Affordable Care Act had nearly run out. Gross national product had dropped by 15 percent since 2006, and the population had shrunk by more than 10 percent. Unlike municipalities such as Detroit, Puerto Rico did not have the right to declare bankruptcy and seek relief under Chapter 9 of bankruptcy law. So in June 2016, Congress passed Promesa (“promise”), a tough, bipartisan compromise that provided a comprehensive restructuring authority and independent oversight to temporarily oversee the island’s tangled finances. While imperfect, Promesa offered a powerful tool to reduce the island’s debt. "
"[Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] The Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine produced one very hot summer. Through August, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recorded between 1,000 and 1,500 nightly cease-fire violations, a large majority committed by Russian-led forces. Ukrainian soldiers and civilians continue to be killed or injured on a daily basis. While the attacks have tailed off since Labor Day, Moscow this month teed up a huge military exercise in western Russia, Belarus and Kaliningrad that stoked fears of an even broader assault. Since invading Ukraine three and a half years ago, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has mastered the tactical rheostat, turning up the heat at will, then cooling things down when the United States and Europe push back. In this way, he hopes to keep Ukraine permanently destabilized, fueling domestic discontent at Kiev’s inability to end the occupation, buying time to buy back the influence Russia lost by invading and bullying Ukraine into a Russian sphere of influence. President Trump’s pro-Putin predilections make him the least likely answer to Ukraine’s predicament. Yet his administration is quietly fashioning a policy that just could break the ice — if Mr. Trump agrees. It starts with a united front among Mr. Trump’s senior advisers — Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster. They see Russia’s occupation of eastern Ukraine for what it is: a gross violation of the most basic norms of international conduct that the United States helped establish after World War II. It is not acceptable for one country to change the borders of another by force. It is not O.K. for one sovereignty to dictate to another which countries or organizations it may associate with. It is not all right for Russia to decide Ukraine’s future. Mr. Trump’s team rightly believes that if the United States fails to stand against the abuse of these principles, the international order America built will be weakened. The administration enlisted a smart, seasoned diplomat, Kurt Volker, to run point on its Ukraine policy. He succeeds Victoria Nuland, whose dogged diplomacy gave the Kremlin fits. Hiring Mr. Volker at the same time the State Department is busy firing virtually every other special envoy sends a message to Moscow that Washington remains focused on ending the occupation, not ignoring it. So does the administration’s commitment to maintain the tough sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia and painstakingly tended to keep Europe on board. Those sanctions, coupled with sharply lower oil prices, have cost Russia dearly — including by denying it the sophisticated technology it needs to exploit increasingly hard-to-reach energy reserves. The Trump administration told Moscow sanctions will stay in place as long as Russia stays in Eastern Ukraine. "
"WASHINGTON — Long-simmering tension within President Trump’s national security team spilled into public view on Wednesday as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson took the extraordinary step of calling a news conference to affirm his support for Mr. Trump, despite what associates describe as his deep frustration with the president and talk of resignation. Mr. Tillerson praised Mr. Trump but did not deny a report that he once referred to the president as a “moron.” Mr. Trump welcomed Mr. Tillerson’s statement of support and declared “total confidence” in his secretary of state. If Mr. Tillerson had hoped to douse questions about how long he would stay, he instead further fueled a debate about his future. Although he insisted he had never considered resigning, several people close to Mr. Tillerson said he has had to be talked out of drafting a letter of resignation on more than one occasion by his closest allies, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff. And they said he has regularly expressed astonishment at how little Mr. Trump understands the basics of foreign policy. A former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson has never found his place as a subordinate to the hard-charging, unpredictable president. He has bristled at being undercut, as he was over the weekend when Mr. Trump publicly said Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time” by trying to open talks with North Korea. At the same time, Mr. Tillerson has alienated lawmakers, foreign policy veterans and the news media while demoralizing the State Department, and critics inside and outside the White House consider his troubles self-inflicted. The president initially viewed Mr. Tillerson as a granite-jawed cabinet secretary who fit Mr. Trump’s requirement that top advisers look as if they came out of “central casting,” as he has put it. Mr. Trump regularly boasted about hiring the head of the world’s largest corporation — and in the presence of a profoundly uncomfortable Mr. Tillerson, whom the president for months referred to as “Mr. Exxon.” But the deliberate, slow-talking oil executive has little personal chemistry with the quick-talking, impulsive Mr. Trump. Mr. Tillerson has avoided expressing his pique to the president. But aides and Trump associates who have been in the room with them said Mr. Tillerson’s body language, eye rolling and terse expressions left little doubt that he disapproves of Mr. Trump’s approach.

"Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Wednesday made a statement from the Treaty Room of the State Department reiterating his support of President Trump. The following is a transcript of that statement, as prepared by The New York Times. For more coverage of his statement, read here » TILLERSON: Good morning. There are some news reports this morning that I want to address. First, my commitment to the success of our president and our country is as strong as it was the day I accepted his offer to serve as secretary of state. President Trump’s America-first agenda has given voice to millions who felt completely abandoned by the political status quo and who felt their interests came second to those of other countries. President Trump’s foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think is achievable on behalf of our country. We’re finding new ways to govern that deliver new victories. Our job is now to achieve results on behalf of America. We are doing that. We’ve created international unity around our peaceful pressure campaign around North Korea, including influencing China to exert unprecedented economic influence on North Korea. At the Riyadh summit, the president rallied Muslim-majority nations to assume new responsibilities for stopping terrorism. NATO members are now contributing more to shared security. And our approach to South Asia and specifically Afghanistan means building upon our relationships with India and Pakistan to stamp out terrorism and support the Afghan government in providing security for their own people. And ISIS’s fraudulent caliphate in Iraq and Syria is on the brink of being completely extinguished, thanks to an aggressive new strategy led by the president. "
"Before Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and before Hurricane Irma sideswiped the island less than two weeks earlier, the U.S. territory was already struggling to recover from an 11-year economic recession and overwhelming public debt. Now with no electricity and undrinkable water on much of the island, along with a loss of 80 percent of crop value, the island faces a humanitarian crisis. In this lesson, we help students to learn more about current events in Puerto Rico using New York Times reporting and videos. In the Warm Up, we start with two brief videos and a quick quiz. Then, we provide a menu of activities to help students learn more about the island — and find ways to help. _________ If students haven’t yet seen images of the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean, they might have a hard time appreciating the intensity of these tropical storms and the havoc they wreaked on communities. Start the lesson by having students watch this two-minute video showing Hurricane Maria and its effects in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands. After watching, ask students what they noticed during the video. What questions do they have? Next, have them watch another short video, below — this one less than one minute long — of residents in the hard-hit mountain town of Utuado sending video messages to their loved ones off the island. What is their reaction? "
"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Wednesday that relations with America had “become hostage to the internal political situation in the U.S.,” but that his country had “many friends” in the United States who can help improve relations between the two nations when the political tensions in America settle down. “Certain forces use the Russian-American ties to solve internal political problems in the U.S.,” Mr. Putin said at a high-profile energy development forum in Moscow. “We are patiently waiting until this process in the internal political life in America will end.” Ties between Moscow and Washington have ebbed and flowed since President Trump took office, despite Russian lawmakers’ Champagne toast after election night in hopes that Mr. Trump would make significant moves in Russia’s favor. Speaking on Wednesday about his personal relationship with Mr. Trump, Mr. Putin said that there was basically “none.” “We have met only once, and spoke on the phone several times on several issues that are of mutual interest,” Mr. Putin said. The two leaders met in July in Hamburg, Germany, at a Group of 20 summit meeting, at which they had a long official conversation and also a shorter private one. “I believe that such a person like Mr. Trump, with his character, will never be hostage to someone’s interests,” the Russian president said, in a conference hall full of representatives of major international energy companies and organizations Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin’s leadership style. Many in Russia had hoped that Mr. Trump would lift the sanctions imposed by the United States over Moscow’s decision to annex Crimea and destabilize Ukraine, and that he would give Russia a free hand to act in the former Soviet republics. None of that has been realized, however. Instead, relations between the two countries have sunk even deeper as further revelations have surfaced about Russia’s meddling in the United States presidential election campaign. Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, has sharply criticized Russia over Crimea. Kurt Volker, a supporter of sanctions against Moscow, was appointed as the United States’ special representative to Ukraine. Still, Mr. Putin expressed optimism about the future of Russia’s relationship with the United States. “We have many friends in America who want to develop ties with us,” he said at the forum. “We support ties with them irrespective of the current political situation.” "
"WASHINGTON — The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee delivered a stark warning on Wednesday to political candidates: Expect Russian operatives to remain active and determined to again try to sow chaos in elections next month and next year. At a rare news conference, Senators Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the committee’s chairman, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and its vice chairman, broadly endorsed the conclusions of American spy agencies that said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a campaign of hacking and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. “The Russian intelligence service is determined — clever — and I recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously,” Mr. Burr said. “You can’t walk away from this and believe that Russia’s not currently active,” he added. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Mr. Putin initially wanted to hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, but later tried to explicitly help Donald J. Trump’s insurgent campaign. The senators said they have reached no conclusion on whether anyone around Mr. Trump was part of that effort. “The issue of collusion is still open,” Mr. Burr said. The news conference was the most extensive since the committee began its investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election early this year and the first time the senators have detailed so fully the trajectory of their secretive investigation and their sense of the stakes. Both men come from swing states where the presidential campaign was fought aggressively. That appeared to have made an impression. “There needs to be a more aggressive whole-of-government approach in terms of protecting our electoral system,” Mr. Warner said. “Remember, to make a change even in a national election doesn’t require penetration into 50 states.” "
"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Puerto Rico’s official death toll from Hurricane Maria more than doubled from 16 to 34 two weeks after the storm as a result of a full accounting intended to add up the piecemeal reports from around the island, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Wednesday. Governor Rosselló said at a news briefing Wednesday that he had commissioned the accounting to add up the reports slow to arrive from devastated hospitals and local medical agencies. The new tally may still not be complete, but it offers the clearest picture yet of the death toll and how people died during and after Maria, he said. Nineteen people were killed directly by the storm — by drowning, being buried in mudslides, struck by falling objects or otherwise, Governor Rosselló said. He said the others had died indirectly — from a heart attack or suicide, or because they languished without oxygen or necessary medical care as hospitals floundered without power and patients were cut off from care. “We were not able to aggregate this complete set of data before,” Governor Rosselló said. “We were getting little bits of certified data, but after yesterday’s effort, we have a more complete picture of what has occurred in terms of direct deaths due to the storm and indirect as well.” Hector Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s secretary of public safety, indicated that there were “three to five” deaths that were still being studied to verify whether they were hurricane-related. “I don’t think this will be the final number,” Mr. Pesquera said. “And we’ve never said it will be.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will repeal the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s effort to fight climate change, and will ask the public to recommend ways it could be replaced, according to an internal Environmental Protection Agency document. The draft proposal represents the administration’s first substantive step toward rolling back the plan, which was designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, after months of presidential tweets and condemnations of Mr. Obama’s efforts to reduce climate-warming pollution. But it also lays the groundwork for new, presumably weaker, regulations by asking for the public and industry to offer ideas for a replacement. The E.P.A. document, “October 2017 Tiering List,” lays out coming policy issues of high priority for the agency’s office of air and radiation, which oversees air pollution policies. “The agency is issuing a proposal to repeal the rule,” the document states. It says the agency will issue a formal notice of its intention to develop a new rule “similarly intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric utility generating units and to solicit information for the agency to consider in developing such a rule.” "
"“Hello, thank you for coming,” the shy 20-something Russian man said haltingly to 10 of us at Mazeish restaurant on the Lower East Side. We had each paid $65 to attend Displaced Dinners, a charity series hosted by the restaurant to help refugees set up their lives in America. These refugees — such as the Russian man — speak at, and sometimes cook, the Displaced Dinner meals, keeping the proceeds minus the cost of the food. His eyes betraying slight anxiety and emotional tumult, the Russian man proceeded to unspool his narrative of bureaucratic struggle and sweat-soaked nights. He traced the circuitous path by which he’d been arrested at an anti-Putin rally in Moscow two years ago and now, living in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, is seeking political asylum. The guests peppered him with questions: What were the conditions of the prison like? Have you changed your name? Are you scared? As I tucked into my food, I thought, “This will definitely be the most nuanced Yelp review I’ll ever write.” The United States accepted at least 84,994 refugees from 78 countries last year. The Trump administration plans to reduce these numbers, but it still seems important to discuss how best to treat those refugees who make it to these shores. What should we keep in mind when interacting with them? If you start chatting with your Ethiopian cabdriver, it can be rude to ask a lot of questions about Addis Ababa or the Great Rift Valley — he probably wants to be perceived as American, not Ethiopian.

"A Canadian-Iranian accountant who helped advise Iran’s negotiation team in talks that led to the 2015 nuclear agreement with the United States and other big powers has been sentenced to five years in prison for spying. News of the conviction and sentence, reported on Wednesday by Iran’s state-run Tasnim News Agency, did not identify the defendant by name, describing him only as a “spy who had infiltrated the team.” But after news of the arrest first emerged in August 2016, Iranian lawmakers critical of the nuclear agreement identified the defendant as Abdolrasoul Dorri Esfahani, a dual citizen of Canada and Iran. Mr. Esfahani was an adviser to Iran’s central bank and was believed to have helped the country’s nuclear negotiators bargain for the sanctions relief contained in the 2015 nuclear agreement. Canadian news reports have described Mr. Esfahani as an accountant involved in financial aspects of the agreement, which ended or eased many sanctions in return for Iran’s reduced nuclear fuel enrichment and verifiable pledges of peaceful atomic energy use. He was further described in some press accounts as a former diplomat at The Hague who had worked on resolving property disputes between the United States and Iran that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution and the break in relations between the two countries.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Baffled U.S. investigators hope that Marilou Danley, who was in the Philippines when her boyfriend, Stephen Paddock, killed 58 people and injured hundreds in Las Vegas, can help explain what drove a man with no evident criminal history to become a mass murderer. F.B.I. agents met Ms. Danley when she returned to the U.S. late Tuesday. They are also interviewing Mr. Paddock’s ex-wife, and trying to find “everyone and anyone” who crossed his path recently. Here are the latest updates. _____ • President Trump arrived in Las Vegas, above, to offer support and consolation, after having visited storm-ravaged Puerto Rico a day earlier. "
"My wife is a doctor, and her work schedule has long led me to wear a blackout mask while I sleep. Even still, I wake up every morning before dawn whether I want to or not. I take a moment to despair at my inability to return to sleep, then I reach for my iPad to check the news. On Monday, that news told me that Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young had been awarded the Nobel Prize for their studies of circadian rhythms. It was exactly those rhythms that pulled me out of dreamland. An inescapable feature of this planet is its cycles of day and night, and all life has become attuned to them. Our bodies have an internal clock that primes us for activity during hours when it is light and rest when it is dark. Remarkably, this clock doesn’t exist in just our brains. Almost every cell in our bodies — in our guts, livers and fat — shows an intrinsic rhythm when closely examined. Collectively, our cells’ rhythms affect not only waking and sleeping, but also blood pressure, body temperature and the ability to digest food and resist infection. Circadian rhythms are synchronized by daylight but, surprisingly, run independent of it. This is why jet lag occurs when you experience light cues that are at odds with your cellular biological clock. Drs. Hall, Rosbash and Young have been honored for uncovering the molecular pathways that control the circadian cycle. In particular, they identified a molecule (called “period”) that drives the biological clock. Its levels rise during nighttime to allow rest, and then decay during the day to spur activity. Period isn’t exclusive to human bodies. It functions in all animals, governing the morning crowing of the rooster and the evening songs of crickets. Evolution long ago invented an elegant way to coordinate life’s activity with daylight, and scientists have discovered it. "
"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Every mass shooting in the United States is inevitably followed by a call for gun control, but major legislation never passes. We look at how the National Rifle Association became a powerful lobbying group. Also, a gun store owner talks about putting military-style weapons into the hands of civilians. On today’s episode: • Robert Draper, a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine, talks about the history of the N.R.A. • John Markell, owner of a gun store in Roanoke, Va., discusses his business. Background reading: • Founded in 1871 to teach marksmanship to city-dwelling Union soldiers, the N.R.A. was originally a nonpolitical and noncontroversial league of sportsmen. Everything changed during the urban tumult of the 1960s. • President Trump, who is to visit Las Vegas today, said, “We will be talking about gun laws as time goes by.” But the shooting appears to have done little to change the gun debate in Washington.

"Austin, Tex. — Since the establishment of the Guantánamo Bay military commissions over 15 years ago, the dominant legal question has been whether they may try individuals charged with ordinary domestic criminal offenses that are not recognized as international war crimes. After years of conflicting decisions, that question has finally reached the Supreme Court, which will decide on Thursday whether to consider the issue in its current term. The case involves a Yemeni prisoner at Guantánamo, Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al-Bahlul, who was convicted by a military commission in 2008 of conspiracy to commit war crimes. While this is a crime under domestic law, it is not recognized as a war crime by international law. Hence the constitutional question: Does a military commission’s assumption of federal court jurisdiction over domestic crimes violate the Constitution, which reserves the “trial of all crimes” to the judiciary? The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld Mr. Bahlul’s conviction last year. But Judge Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, said the question in play should be decided because “other cases in the pipeline require a clear answer.” He’s absolutely right. Settling this question would go a long way toward settling the structural legitimacy of the Guantánamo tribunals. The justices should take heed and grant certiorari. (Disclosure: I have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to take Mr. Bahlul’s case.) Although the United States had occasionally used military commissions to try enemy soldiers before the Sept. 11 attacks, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of such trials only in areas under military occupation or in cases in which the offenses were international war crimes. Because military occupation presupposes the absence of a functioning, civilian government, military tribunals are the only option. And as for international war crimes, the Supreme Court concluded during World War II that such offenses committed by enemy belligerents fell outside of the Constitution’s jury-trial protections — which otherwise require that all serious crimes be tried in civilian court. The principal innovation (and one of the central controversies) of the post-Sept. 11 military trials at Guantánamo has been to extend the reach of military commissions to purely domestic criminal offenses, especially conspiracy and “providing material support to terrorism.” The government has been unable to tie almost any of the Guantánamo detainees — most of whom were, at most, low-level Qaeda fighters — to specific international war crimes. But rather than simply hold the detainees in military detention or try them in civilian court, the government has used the secrecy-laden criminal proceedings at Guantánamo to push the constitutional envelope. Each of the eight convictions obtained by the commissions to date has included at least one purely domestic criminal charge, and five turned exclusively on such offenses. And each of the three cases pending at Guantánamo, including the trial of five men accused of being the masterminds of the Sept. 11 attacks, includes charges unsupported by the Supreme Court’s pre-Sept. 11 precedents.

"After even the most vicious of hurricanes, most Americans find there are comforts they can fall back on, however minuscule. They probably have a job to go to. Their cellphone can make calls. And even if they have no electricity, there is someplace a reasonable drive away that does — a friend’s or relative’s home, a restaurant that serves a hot meal. But if you are one of the residents of the American islands in the Caribbean, getting your life to resemble anything close to normal can take many months, if not longer. I lived on St. Thomas 15 years ago. When I was barely out of college, I accepted a job as a reporter for The Virgin Islands Daily News without even knowing where the place was on a map — the kind of rash decision that 22-year-olds are excellent at making. But my two years there were formative. And I developed an appreciation for the people and their culture, which in many ways resembled their status as a United States territory: technically American but uniquely Caribbean. When I returned there last week to report on the aftermath of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, I was immediately reminded of their many disadvantages. On a good day, the power often goes out. There were many evenings I would be sitting in the newsroom or watching television at my beachfront one-bedroom and everything would suddenly go dark. Like many people there, I bought a battery-powered alarm clock after waking up one morning to discover I had overslept because there had been a power failure in the middle of the night. The power grid, which like Puerto Rico’s has been neglected for decades, is especially vulnerable to storms. Now it is now mostly flattened, its wires lying across roads or tangled in trees, its poles snapped in half, its transformers sitting in puddles of stagnant floodwater. It will take months to fully restore. "
"Today, European Union regulators stepped up their tax campaign against American tech giants in a big way. • Europe’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said she would take Ireland to court over its failure to collect huge back tax bills from Apple. • Regulators ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros ($293 million) in unpaid taxes from Amazon. James Kanter, NYT: The context • Last year, Ireland was ordered to claim $15.2 billion in back taxes from Apple. • Luxembourg is already under scrutiny for its tax regime. In 2015, the country faced orders to claw back €30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit. The bigger picture Rochelle Toplensky, FT: Erasing the territory’s $73 billion in obligations would involve major losses for investors. And it isn’t clear whether the president or federal government actually has the power to do it. President Trump said, “I don’t know if it’s Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is, you can wave goodbye to that.” "
"Another day, another embarrassing foreign policy circus in the nation’s capital that can only further erode trust in American leadership at home and abroad. At its center is Rex Tillerson, who traded his job as top dog at the oil giant ExxonMobil to become secretary of state, only to find himself substantively and personally undercut by President Trump as recently as Sunday on the issue of Korea, where Mr. Tillerson wanted negotiations as Mr. Trump threatened war. On Wednesday, after NBC News reported that Mr. Tillerson was on the verge of resigning last summer, the secretary quickly called a news conference in which he asserted that he never considered doing so, though he did not personally deny a report that he had grown so disenchanted with the man in the Oval Office that he once called him a “moron” at a Pentagon meeting with the national security team and cabinet officials. Mr. Tillerson was said to be particularly upset by Mr. Trump’s highly politicized speech to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization the secretary once led. Various other Trump officials reportedly urged him to stay on at least until the end of the year, and Vice President Mike Pence counseled him on ways to ease tensions with the president. The conflicts are numerous and mounting. Last week, in Beijing, Mr. Tillerson described efforts to explore contacts with North Korea over the nuclear issue, only to have Mr. Trump scorn the initiative as a waste of time, leaving the impression that he was focused mainly on military options. In June, Mr. Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and other gulf states to ease their blockade of Qatar, only to have Mr. Trump endorse the crackdown. The Trump administration has twice certified that Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear deal that was one of former President Barack Obama’s major diplomatic achievements. Mr. Trump has left little doubt about his contempt for the deal. Domestic issues have also caused a wedge. Mr. Trump reportedly was furious when Mr. Tillerson distanced himself from the president’s disgraceful handling of the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., by saying the “president speaks for himself.” "
"Until their father’s personal lawyer intervened, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. were under criminal investigation by Manhattan prosecutors for possibly defrauding buyers of units in the Trump SoHo development, according to an investigation by ProPublica, WNYC and The New Yorker. An email showed the siblings “discussed how to coordinate false information they had given to prospective buyers,” according to the report. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., acknowledged that he dropped the case after a visit from President Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz, who has contributed to Mr. Vance’s political campaign, but said he did so because it was the right thing to do. Perhaps it was, and perhaps the president’s son and daughter did nothing criminal. But the deceptive behavior at the heart of the case would be familiar to anyone who’s observed Mr. Trump’s business career. The hustler is in the White House now, and the young members of the Trump family, with the cloud of suspicion that now constantly surrounds them, are top advisers. It’s recently come to light that Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both top administration officials, have been using at least three different personal email accounts for some government business, in potential violation of federal records acts. Mr. Kushner didn’t reveal his use of private email in a lengthy interview with Senate investigators who are looking into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in undermining the 2016 election. USA Today revealed on Wednesday that shortly after Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating those possible ties, asked for related White House records, the couple rerouted personal email accounts to Trump Organization servers. The White House levied small fines on both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump in late August for filing late updates to their financial disclosures, McClatchy reported this week. Such fines are rare, but this was a second fine for late filing by Mr. Kushner. Mr. Kushner has repeatedly botched legally required disclosures of his business assets, and omitted Russian contacts on his security clearance form, asserting that despite the assistance of a cadre of experienced lawyers, he just can’t seem to get the paperwork right. Some national security experts have said that if he weren’t the president’s son-in-law, Mr. Kushner would have been denied clearance under such circumstances. Since Ms. Trump entered the White House, her apparel brand has benefited or sought to benefit from trademark decisions in China, Japan, Kuwait, Qatar, Panama, Brazil and elsewhere. Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner like to be seen as moderating influences in the chaos of the Trump White House. John Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, appears to recognize that Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump are a drag on a White House already plagued by problems. Let’s also hope that he can persuade the Trump family members to deal more forthrightly with the American public than they did with their investors. "
"With their nine-page “framework,” President Trump and congressional Republicans have turned to tax cuts in a bid to get a victory on their policy agenda. Mr. Trump has promised to deliver “the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.” It achieved a rare feat of bipartisan agreement in Washington — worry from the left and the right about the plan’s potential to increase the deficit. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, warned that the plan would deepen the deficit by $5 trillion to $7 trillion. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said, “If I think it adds one penny to the deficit, I’m not going to vote for it.” Are the proposed tax cuts a huge giveaway to the rich? Most definitely. Will they, as advertised, create a booming economy with benefits that trickle down to everyone else? I don’t think so. Mr. Trump’s plan will widen the country’s already dangerous wealth and income gaps, and because the gains go mostly to those at the very top, the tax cuts won’t do much to promote broad-based consumer spending or overall job growth. That’s enough to reject the plan. But it would be unwise to oppose tax cuts, or any other federal legislation, simply because they add to the deficit. Why? Because bigger deficits wouldn’t wreck the nation’s finances. Unfortunately, budgetary effects are the sun around which everything revolves in Washington. Should we invest a trillion dollars in our crumbling infrastructure, offer Medicare for All or pass the biggest tax cut in the country’s history? Propose any of these, and the first question on everyone’s lips will be, “How are you going to pay for it?” The reason is simple: Lawmakers are obsessed with avoiding an increase in the deficit. "
"Two of the year’s most highly anticipated books are on this week’s list of recommendations: Jennifer Egan’s follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning “A Visit From the Goon Squad” (2010); and Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “We Were Eight Years in Power,” his first book since “Between the World and Me” made him as close to a household name as public intellectuals get. The rest of the list offers a wide range of subjects, from the poet Eileen Myles’s memoir about life with a beloved dog to Attica Locke’s murder mystery set in Texas to N. K. Jemisin’s conclusion of her award-winning Broken Earth fantasy trilogy. John Williams
Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer MANHATTAN BEACH, by Jennifer Egan. (Scribner, $28.) Egan’s latest novel tells overlapping stories, but is most fundamentally about Anna Kerrigan, a young woman who works at the Brooklyn Naval Yard during World War II. “It’s a dreadnought of a World War II-era historical novel,” our critic Dwight Garner writes, “bristling with armaments yet intimate in tone. It’s an old-fashioned page-turner, tweaked by this witty and sophisticated writer so that you sometimes feel she has retrofitted sleek new engines inside a craft owned for too long by James Jones and Herman Wouk.” WE WERE EIGHT YEARS IN POWER: An American Tragedy, by Ta-Nehisi Coates. (One World, $28.) “We Were Eight Years in Power” is a selection of Coates’s most influential pieces about race in America from The Atlantic, with subjects including Barack and Michelle Obama, Donald J. Trump, reparations and mass incarceration. Newly written brief essays introduce each one. “Most of these pieces force a reckoning with ideas that people, mainly whites, avoid contemplating or reject or insist (sometimes rightly) are more complicated,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes. “Taking in Coates’s essays from start to finish” is “a bracing thing, like drinking a triple scotch, neat.” DIFFICULT WOMEN: A Memoir of Three, by David Plante. (New York Review Books, $16.95.) Plante’s memoir, first published in 1983 and now reissued, is a portrait of three of his friends (or so they believed): the novelist Jean Rhys; the feminist writer Germaine Greer; and Sonia Orwell, George’s widow. “Few writers have betrayed confidences with such uninhibited malice,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “‘Difficult Women’ is creepy, it is cruel, it is morally indefensible — and it is exhilarating. As Dylan Thomas wrote: ‘When one burns one’s bridges, what a very nice fire it makes.’” LITTLE FIRES EVERYWHERE, by Celeste Ng. (Penguin Press, $27.) The magic of Ng’s second novel, which opens with arson and centers on an interracial adoption, lies in its power to implicate every character — and likely many readers — in the innocent delusion that “no one sees race here.” The story’s vast and complex network of moral affiliations — and the nuanced omniscient voice that Ng employs to navigate it — make this novel even more ambitious and accomplished than her 2014 debut, “Everything I Never Told You.” DEFIANCE: The Extraordinary Life of Lady Anne Barnard, by Stephen Taylor. (Norton, $28.95.) Lady Anne Barnard was a Georgian-era London socialite whose legacy included roughly a million words in memoirs, letters, journals, diaries and poems, most of which are unpublished. Over the course of Taylor’s biography, a picture emerges of Anne as a cleareyed yet self-doubting woman determined to live life on her own terms even as she worried about her right to set those terms.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “You have disappointed a lot of Catalans.” That was Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan leader, directly addressing King Felipe VI of Spain in a televised speech. Mr. Puigdemont accused the king of endorsing the “catastrophic” policies of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy instead of offering dialogue with Catalan separatists. Mr. Puigdemont said he wanted a negotiated settlement of the dispute. He made no mention — as he had previously — of plans for a unilateral declaration of independence. _____ • In the U.S., baffled investigators hope that the girlfriend of Stephen Paddock, who killed 58 people and injured hundreds in Las Vegas, can help explain what drove him to become a mass murderer. She returned to the U.S. from the Philippines late Tuesday. (Here is a public statement she made.) "
"KINGSTON, N.Y. — The Washington chef José Andrés has spent the past week in Puerto Rico cooking meals in hot-tub-size paella pans for Americans affected by Hurricane Maria. With his team, working out of mobile kitchens, restaurants and food trucks, he’s prepared more than 50,000 meals and counting. But you don’t have to be a famous restaurateur to make a difference through food. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, many Americans have taken to the streets. Some have taken a knee. Others have donated, written, called and boycotted. Me? I’m cooking. I have been an avid home cook for my entire life. I started making Thanksgiving dinner for my family when I was still in middle school. Now, along with voting and volunteering, one of the ways I resist is by cooking for activists here in Kingston, N.Y. I bring lasagnas to phone-banking meetings, roll rice-and-bean burritos for canvassers to eat on the go and drop off corn muffins at protests. I’ve also challenged myself to look closely at what happens around my own table. A few months back, Nicole Taylor, a fellow cookbook author, asked me the last time I invited someone who doesn’t look like me over for a meal. It’s a critical question we should all be asking ourselves, because the most valuable tool in our kitchens isn’t found in any drawer or cupboard: It’s the table. Remember that Derek Black, whose father was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, began to rethink his white nationalist views after being invited to Shabbat dinner by a college classmate. Over the summer, dismayed by the lack of racial diversity in food media, I invited four friends in the industry to my home for a weekend of conversation and organizing. My wife and I were the only white people there. Except to sleep, none of us ever left the kitchen table. That weekend’s endless meal has sustained me in so many ways. Listening to their experiences has helped inform every decision I make as a white cookbook author who has access to platforms such as the one you’re reading. "
"Stephen Colbert used a harsh profanity to describe President Trump on Wednesday during an appearance on stage at Michael Moore’s one-man Broadway play, “The Terms of My Surrender.” Mr. Colbert, the host of “The Late Show” on CBS, was one of the special guests whom Mr. Moore regularly invites to take part in the production. As the two men sat in armchairs with a large American flag illuminated in the background, Mr. Moore asked Mr. Colbert at one point, “How do you carry on now?” — a reference to the liberal late-night host’s approach to the Trump presidency. Mr. Moore added, “Your ability to use satire and humor to say the emperor has no clothes is profound every single night.” Laugh through the fear, Mr. Colbert replied. “Trump keeps summoning monsters of abstraction — things that aren’t real — they’re extensions of the ordinary, fears that you have that he plays on,” Mr. Colbert said. “He wants to brush people into a corner where he can shine his feeble, fucking anemic firefly of a soul,” Mr. Colbert continued, inching his two pointer fingers close together. The audience erupted into boisterous applause, and Mr. Moore gave a laugh. Mr. Colbert’s comments came during a conversation that lasted nearly 20 minutes, covering topics from American politics to Catholicism. At one point Mr. Colbert urged Americans not to be afraid in the current political climate, and described comedy as a balm. “When you’re laughing, you’re not afraid, and if you’re not afraid you can think,” he said. Referring to the Trump presidency, he added: “We felt our way into this thing, and we have to think our way out of it.” Mr. Colbert is one of Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics on late-night television, and his remarks about the president regularly trigger conservative ire and, occasionally, controversy. During one joke on his show in May, Mr. Colbert used coarse language to suggest a sexual relationship between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In response, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission said his agency was reviewing complaints about the joke; the commission ultimately took no action. "
"Our topic for today is hypocrisy. The scene is — where else? — Congress. This week the House of Representatives voted 237 to 189 to make it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman who has been pregnant more than 20 weeks. Victory for the anti-choice forces. One of whom was apparently very interested in maintaining all options when he thought his own girlfriend was expecting. Meet Tim Murphy, a Republican congressman from the Pittsburgh suburbs who has a doctorate in psychology, and is the co-author of a couple of books with titles like “Overcoming Passive-Aggression.” He’s married but — prodded by information revealed at his lover’s divorce trial — he admits having strayed with another psychologist. Murphy is a co-sponsor of the anti-abortion bill. At about the same time it was passing, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published a note his mistress had texted in January, complaining about the way he kept putting pro-life messages on his Facebook page “when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week. …” Whoops. This is not actually a unique story. There’s a history of lawmakers who are eager to restrict abortions in every case not involving their own personal sex life. Back in the ’90s Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, was targeted by his ex-wife, who claimed he had helped her get an abortion while they were married. It was a particularly embarrassing episode since Barr was so dedicated to the anti-choice movement he once said he’d stop his wife from having an abortion even if she had gotten pregnant via a rape. (This was a different ex-wife from the one who announced Barr had taken her to the abortionist. One of the things the various stars of this story have in common is a certain friskiness.) More recently, Representative Scott DesJarlais, a Tennessee Republican who bragged about his “100 percent pro-life voting record,” was confronted with pesky divorce records that showed he’d encouraged women to have abortions, including his ex-wife and a patient with whom he was having an affair. DesJarlais, a physician, is still in Congress and this week he was right there voting again against other people’s abortion rights. "
"Updated, 9:32 a.m. Good morning on this warming Thursday. Subway riders: Have you noticed anything missing from your commute? Like, maybe a seat? On Tuesday, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rolled out redesigned subway cars on the E line, with some of the seats removed. The agency hopes that up to 10 more people will be able to squeeze into each new car — meaning 80 to 100 extra commuters per train — to help reduce overcrowding. In all, 100 cars will lose their seats in the pilot program. The L train and the 42nd Street Shuttle are next in line for the redesign, according to the authority. Yesterday, we waited at the 34th Street station for a few trains to pass before one of the refurbished models, with its navy blue wrapping, pulled into the station. On board, we noticed a faint smell, like that of a freshly opened Band-Aid. Perhaps it came from the ceiling and walls, which were decorated with colorful new wallpaper that gave the car the feel of a preschool playroom. "
"Democrats point to a thousand reasons that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election. Here is another. In political circles, it’s common knowledge that in four key states President Trump unexpectedly carried counties that Democratic presidential campaign strategists had failed to recognize as crucial terrain — sparsely populated areas of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In “What I Got Wrong About the Election,” for example, published right after Clinton lost, David Plouffe, who had managed the Obama campaign in 2008, wrote that Plouffe added that this “happened in thousands of counties throughout the country, and it added up quickly.” What Democrats missed was the profound political impact recent immigration trends were having on the more rural parts of the once homogeneous Midwest — that the region had unexpectedly become a flash point in the nation’s partisan immigration wars. In a Brookings essay published last month, John C. Austin, director of the Michigan Economic Center, a local think tank, writes that the region is experiencing a “steady stream of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.” As a result, Austin continues, Austin went on, in an email, to provide more detail about the power of immigration to move white voters into the Trump column: In February 2017, Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist, conducted four postelection focus groups with white voters who had cast ballots for Trump in Macomb County, Michigan, an area he has been studying since 1985. The participants were not Republicans. They were whites without college degrees who identified themselves as independents, as Democratic-leaning independents, or as Democrats who voted for Obama in 2008, 2012 or both. "

"WASHINGTON — The reconnaissance patrol was supposed to be a routine training mission along the border between Niger and Mali for the nearly dozen United States Army Special Forces trainers and the Nigerien soldiers with them. The American team leaders told their superiors in seeking approval for the mission that there was a “low risk” of hostile activity in the region 120 miles north of Niamey, Niger’s capital, according to a senior United States military official briefed on the mission planning. Late Wednesday afternoon, that mission proved anything but low risk. The patrol was ambushed by what commanders believe was a heavily armed Qaeda force from Mali, leaving three Americans dead and two others wounded. The combat casualties were the first that the United States has suffered in a widening counterterrorism mission in Niger, in northwest Africa. Pentagon officials expressed shock on Thursday at the deaths during such a routine mission. The brazen daytime attack raised serious questions about how the Special Forces — elite Green Berets who have spent years operating in shadowy combat zones — conduct threat assessments in the country and how their chain of command approves them. Pentagon officials vowed to examine how many Special Forces training missions had been conducted in border areas before Wednesday’s assault — and whether the Americans in Niger had inadvertently settled into a pattern of predictable activities that Qaeda fighters could exploit with deadly consequences. The concerns are particularly acute given that the ambush took place near the village of Tongo Tongo, just inside Niger in a region recently destabilized by cross-border jihadist attacks on the Nigerien army and refugee camps. In mid-June, the Nigerien army mounted an operation in this same northern Tillaberi region to take on the jihadists. "
"Mayor Bill de Blasio heads into the first general election debate next week with a commanding lead over his opponents, including the Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday. Sixty-one percent of likely New York City voters favored Mr. de Blasio for re-election, although only 57 percent said he deserved a second term. Ms. Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman who represents areas of Staten Island and southwest Brooklyn, garnered 17 percent in the poll, while Sal F. Albanese, who lost to Mr. de Blasio in the Democratic primary and is running on the Reform Party line, received 8 percent. Bo Dietl, a former police detective who runs a private investigations firm and is running on his own anti-de Blasio line, received 6 percent. A poll by NBC News and the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, also released on Thursday, found similarly wide margins for the mayor. With a fund-raising advantage and strong support from unions and other groups, Mr. de Blasio is gliding toward re-election, even though he has not spent much time on the campaign trail. So far, the mayor has not outlined a robust second-term agenda beyond continuing and expanding initiatives from his first four years, and he has allowed his staff and volunteers to mind his campaign. Mr. de Blasio has instead made himself more visible through mayoral work in communities, including accelerating the pace of town-hall meetings around the city. "
"WASHINGTON — A federal watchdog investigating whether the Internal Revenue Service unfairly targeted conservative political groups seeking tax-exempt status said that the agency also scrutinized organizations associated with liberal causes from 2004 to 2013. The findings by the Treasury Department’s inspector general mark the end of a political firestorm that embroiled the I.R.S. in controversy, led to the ouster of its commissioner and prompted accusations the tax collection agency was being used as a political weapon by the Obama administration. The exhaustive report, which examined nine years worth of applications for tax-exempt status, comes after a similar audit in 2013 found that groups with conservative names like “Tea Party,” “patriot” or “9/12” were unfairly targeted for further review. The new report found that the I.R.S. was also inappropriately targeting progressive-leaning groups. While the investigation does not specify the political affiliations of the groups, names that were flagged included the words “Progressive,” “Occupy,” “Green Energy,” and Acorn — the acronym for the now defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration noted that the report makes no characterization of the political leanings of any of the groups. The I.R.S. came under fire for its aggressive questioning of conservative groups in 2013. After a surge in applications for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012, the agency acknowledged that it began singling out terms such as “Tea Party” and “patriot” as a shortcut for determining if organizations were actually engaging in social welfare, which would qualify them for tax-exempt status, or if they might be political organizations.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • U.S. investigators are grappling with the “secret life” of Stephen Paddock, hunting for details of his last 10 years and any clues to his motives in killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds in Las Vegas. Here’s the latest. He was a high-stakes video gambler, drawing on sharp analytic skills and interacting little with other players. Mr. Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, said after returning from the Philippines that she hadn’t known of his plans. Read her statement. We reconstructed the 14 minutes of chaos unleashed by Mr. Paddock, who used devices known as bump stocks to increase the shooting power of his semiautomatic rifles. In a significant shift, the National Rifle Association lobby endorsed restricting the device’s use. Our team has also debunked some rumors that spread after the shooting. _____ "
"Cubans have long regarded emigrating to the United States as something of a birthright derived from the privations they endured as a result of sanctions that Washington has imposed on Cuba for decades. Last week, for the first time in decades, the United States effectively shut down the immigration pipeline from the island as it sharply reduced its staff at the embassy in Havana in response to mysterious ailments there, leaving in limbo more than 100,000 Cubans, most of whom are seeking to reunite with relatives. The decision to indefinitely suspend visa processing at the embassy — one of the busiest consular posts in the region — could mean that the United States will fail to honor its obligations under a 1994 deal that requires the admission of at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year, current and former American diplomats say. The accord was reached in an effort to stem an exodus by Cubans who took to the seas in rafts by the thousands in the 1990s trying to reach Florida. The halt in visa services comes roughly nine months after Washington ended its “wet foot, dry foot” policy. That policy, which required Cubans caught trying to reach the United States by sea to return home but allowed those who make it onto American soil to stay, had in recent years enabled an additional tens of thousands of Cubans to move to the United States. The sudden suspension of legal pathways for Cubans to settle in the United States could set off a new migration surge, experts in both countries said, particularly if Cuba experiences an economic downturn.

"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday ordered the Justice Department to take the position in court cases that transgender people are not protected by a civil rights law that bans workplace discrimination based on sex. The move was the Trump administration’s latest contraction of the Obama-era approach to civil rights enforcement. The dispute centers on how to interpret employment protections based on “sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In December 2014, the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., ordered the Justice Department to view “sex” as encompassing gender identity, extending protections to transgender people. But in a two-page memo to all United States attorneys and other top officials, Mr. Sessions revoked Mr. Holder’s directive. The word “sex” in the statute, Mr. Sessions said, means only “biologically male or female,” so the Civil Rights Act does not ban “discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.” He added that the department “will take that position in all pending and future matters,” except in cases in which a controlling lower-court precedent dictated otherwise, in which case it would reserve the option to revisit the issue on appeal. The policy change comes as the Justice Department is trying to get out of an employment discrimination lawsuit in Oklahoma that it filed alongside a transgender plaintiff, noted David Lopez, a former general counsel to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A judge appointed by President George W. Bush had previously ruled in that lawsuit that the Civil Rights Act does cover gender identity, agreeing with the department’s Obama-era interpretation. Federal appeals courts have reached varying views on whether the Civil Rights Act’s ban on sex discrimination extends to gender identity, but five circuits have ruled that it does, said James D. Esseks, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & HIV Project. "
"Ai Weiwei is many things — a restless artist in all media, China’s most prominent dissident, and a compulsive Instagrammer — but he’s a New Yorker, too. He lived here for a decade back in the 1980s and early 1990s. You can tell by the way he casually jaywalks through Greenwich Village without needing to really look at the traffic. “I’m hopelessly in love with this city,” he said as he ambled down Thompson Street recently, stopping at a store with chess pieces in its window and musing on the chess obsession of his idol, Marcel Duchamp. Though now Berlin-based, he has been spending time in New York preparing his Public Art Fund project, “Ai Weiwei: Good Fences Make Good Neighbors,” the most extensive installation that organization has ever mounted. It debuts Oct. 12 with more than 300 artworks throughout five boroughs, anchored by three large sculptures, in Central Park, Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village and Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. In a nod to Duchamp, Mr. Ai said the project uses “the city as a ready-made.” The installations are part of Mr. Ai’s effort to draw attention to the international refugee crisis, the subject of his new documentary, “Human Flow,” which opens in New York and Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, and represents a year and a half of work, during which he traveled to a dozen countries.

"On Monday, about 1,000 people, most of them young women, lined up at a New York City theater for a poetry reading by Rupi Kaur. Giant fake sunflowers outside made a safe space for guests to pose for Instagram in their hijabs, baseball caps, pantsuits, combat boots and cocktail dresses. Then on Tuesday came a big and quietly savage profile in The Cut. On Wednesday, The Guardian published an article on the “inevitable backlash” against her. What a week! Ms. Kaur, who is 25 and Punjabi-Canadian, is used to the ups and downs. In the three years since her blockbuster “Milk and Honey” was first self-published and later picked up by Andrews McMeel Publishing, she has dealt with all the issues other women face on Instagram and off: comparisons, aggression, bullying. But she has also built a community and an audience there in particular, with 1.6 million followers. Daunted by the tough stuff, she remained, because “it came back to the accessibility,” she said. “Instagram makes my work so accessible and I was able to build a readership,” Ms. Kaur said recently in a cafe in SoHo. “But then I always feel like within the literary world there’s of course downsides, because you have that label attached to your work and then, for some reason, that means you aren’t a credible literary source.” Instagram was where, in 2015, Ms. Kaur first seized on some fame, when the platform removed a photo of her. In it, she was in bed, back to the camera, with fake menstrual blood stains on her sweatpants and sheet. Instagram said the removal was an accident, and then returned it; now it’s just shy of 100,000 likes. Ms. Kaur appended a note: “i will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in an underwear but not be okay with a small leak.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Tillerson Denies Rift With Trump as Tensions Flare on Public Stage” (front page, Oct. 5):
The lack of self-respect and integrity among many of President Trump’s apologist servants is disappointing. While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was working hard in Beijing to establish communications with North Korea, directly or indirectly, Mr. Trump totally undermined him by tweeting that he was “wasting his time.” If something like that happened under any president before Mr. Trump, it would have been seen as shamefully disrespectful, terribly counterproductive and unbelievably bizarre. Yet Mr. Tillerson doesn’t have the courage to stand up for principle and quit. Shame on him for helping to enable Mr. Trump and for blindly serving his apparent master instead of the best interests of the American people. DAN ROTHMAN
FOUNTAIN VALLEY, CALIF. To the Editor: If Rex Tillerson owned up to calling the president a “moron” he’d be fired immediately, but he’d also earn the respect of many Americans and governments around the world. That would be his legacy as secretary of state. STAN PETERS, WARRENTON, VA. "
"A scientific enigma lies at the heart of a strange confrontation between the United States and Cuba. According to the State Department, nearly two dozen diplomats at the American Embassy in Havana have been stricken with a variety of mysterious medical symptoms, including hearing loss and cognitive difficulties. After concluding that staffers were the victims of a stealth attack, the department withdrew nonessential personnel from Havana and issued an advisory urging Americans not to visit. On Tuesday, the Trump administration expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the United States. The State Department has not provided further details about the medical condition of the affected staffers. But government officials have suggested anonymously that the diplomats may have been assaulted with some sort of sonic weapon. Experts in acoustics, however, say that’s a theory more appropriate to a James Bond movie. Sound can cause discomfort and even serious harm, and researchers have explored the idea of sonic weaponry for years. But scientists doubt a hidden ultrasound weapon can explain what happened in Cuba. “I’d say it’s fairly implausible,” said Jürgen Altmann, a physicist at the Technische Universität Dortmund in Germany and an expert on acoustics.

"To the Editor: Re “On Busy Calendar, E.P.A. Chief Puts Interests of Industries First” (front page, Oct. 3): The Environmental Protection Agency exists to protect human health and the environment. Its administrator, Scott Pruitt, continually undermines the purpose of this agency he is supposed to be running. We know that. It is unsurprising, but we cannot allow that to negate the fact that it is unacceptable at every level. Yes, he spends government money irresponsibly and meets with the wrong people, but the real issue and dangers go beyond that. He refused to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos, overruling the scientists working under him and ignoring objective evidence of significant hazards, and he delayed new rules for methane. He is continually endangering our health and the health of future generations and our planet. I’ve lost track of how many policies he has hastily rescinded in just a few months — policies that were designed to protect us. LILY VOGELSONG, TUSCALOOSA, ALA. To the Editor: As his recently published schedule proves, Scott Pruitt has consistently sought meaningful engagement with only a narrow subset of stakeholders — most notably, rich corporate polluters. My organization, Waterkeeper Alliance, which represents 176 clean-water advocacy organizations across the United States, requested a meeting with Mr. Pruitt in April. Our request was denied because of “a very busy schedule” (undoubtedly meetings with polluters), and we were instead directed to other Environmental Protection Agency staff members. Mr. Pruitt has shown that he is not interested in or willing to meet with nongovernmental organizations whose mission is aligned with E.P.A.’s — that is, protecting human health and the environment. It is reprehensible that the government official responsible for protecting American citizens from pollution is shutting out groups working on behalf of the public interest. We welcome the opportunity to meet with him and hope that he will, at some point, provide health and environmental advocates the same opportunities to be heard that he has routinely provided to polluters.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to overrule his top national security advisers and decline to certify the Iran nuclear agreement, according to people who have been briefed on the matter, a decision that would reopen a volatile political debate on Iran but is likely to leave in place the landmark deal negotiated by the Obama administration. By declining to certify Iran’s compliance, Mr. Trump would essentially kick it to Congress to decide whether to reimpose punitive economic sanctions. Even among Republicans, there appears to be little appetite to do that, at least for now. Still, Mr. Trump’s expected move would allow him to tell supporters that he had disavowed the accord, while bowing to the reality that the United States would isolate itself from its allies if it sabotaged a deal with which Iran is viewed as complying. Mr. Trump repeatedly ridiculed the accord during the 2016 presidential campaign, vowing to rip it up. White House officials cautioned that the president had not yet formally decided to “decertify” the agreement. But he faces an Oct. 15 deadline, and he has made little secret of his intentions, most recently when he declared at the United Nations two weeks ago that the agreement was “embarrassing to the United States.” Mr. Trump will present his decision on the deal as part of a broader American strategy to crack down on Iran for its ballistic missile program and destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East. Administration officials said he had signed off on the overall approach and hoped he would present it before the deadline. The strategy is an effort by the Trump administration to make the nuclear agreement only part of a multidimensional approach to pressure Iran on many fronts, including its missile program, its support for militant groups like Hezbollah and its intervention in the Syrian civil war on behalf of the Assad government.

"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders in Congress are under attack from all sides of their own party, battered by voters from the right and left, spurned by frustrated donors and even threatened by the Trump White House for ineffective leadership and insufficient loyalty. Since last week, Senate Republicans lost one of their own when Roy S. Moore, the firebrand former state judge, trounced Senator Luther Strange in a Senate runoff in Alabama. The retirement of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee kicked off a potentially fratricidal fight for his seat, with the establishment’s preferred successor, Gov. Bill Haslam, declining to run on Thursday. An audiotape surfaced of Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, lambasting Republican leaders and urging conservative donors to close their wallets to lawmakers who are disloyal to President Trump. And a House Republican, Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, was forced to resign this week after a text from his mistress became public in which she mocked him for trumpeting his staunch opposition to abortion as he pressured her to terminate a pregnancy. Former Representative Michael Grimm of New York has also resurfaced after serving time for felony tax fraud to challenge his Republican successor on Staten Island — with the backing of Mr. Trump’s former strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who was first elected to Congress in 1978, said he had never seen rank-and-file Republicans so stirred up against the party’s leaders in Congress. “Right now, the Moore-Bannon faction prevails,” Mr. Shelby said. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are making no attempt to mask their fear, predicting that failure to pass a tax overhaul in the coming months will lead to a wipeout in next year’s midterm elections. For the first time, some senators are contemplating whether their advantages on the electoral map next year could crumble amid a wave of primary challenges and other departures, putting their two-seat majority in jeopardy next year.

"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia warmly welcomed King Salman of Saudi Arabia under the gleaming chandeliers of the Kremlin on Thursday, signaling a rapprochement between two longtime rivals who have faced off in some of the world’s thorniest conflicts. King Salman’s visit, the first by a Saudi monarch, sought to cement growing ties between the world’s two largest oil producers, which have coordinated efforts to stabilize crude prices, lift their economies and end the war in Syria. The visit highlights efforts by King Salman, since he ascended the throne in 2015, to shift away from his country’s historical reliance on the United States and diversify its international partnerships, analysts said. The visit also acknowledges Russia’s increasing clout in the Middle East, and the kingdom’s tacit acceptance of the enduring rule of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, whom Saudi Arabia had opposed and Russia had intervened to save. “We cannot ignore that Russia has become a key player in the Middle East, particularly due to the Obama doctrine that saw the U.S. role in the region shrink,” said Faisal J. Abbas, editor in chief of Saudi Arabia’s Arab News, who was in Moscow for the visit. “Russia, with its financial and military might, stepped into the equation.” The recalibration of the kingdom’s foreign relations comes as it ushers in domestic reforms that could alter its socially conservative society. King Salman, 81, removed the power of arrest from the country’s religious police, and announced last week that the ban on women driving would be lifted. Other changes, such as repealing the ban on cinemas, are expected soon. "
"Seth Forrence is the fourth-generation manager of his family’s apple farm, Forrence Orchards, in Peru, N.Y. He is only 41, but the business, he said, has changed drastically during his lifetime. Traditional varieties like McIntosh and Cortland are slowly giving way to the sweetness of Honeycrisp and SnapDragon, and the trees are getting smaller; up to 1,200 can be packed into one acre. But there has been one constant during his time on the farm: the Jamaicans. At the orchard on a recent afternoon, a white 15-passenger van pulled up. The foreman, James Spence, who goes by Jimmy, got out, followed by another dozen Jamaican men of all ages. Dressed in long-sleeve shirts and pants, the unseasonably warm weather didn’t seem to be an issue. They said it reminded them of Jamaica. Joking with one another in a mix of English and Patois, the Jamaicans grabbed aluminum ladders from a nearby trailer, slung buckets around their necks and headed for the trees. “Get them red, get them big, no drops, no bruises,” Jimmy said. “O.K.?” Not that they needed the reminder. All the men were experienced pickers – they’ve been coming back for years, some of them decades. “They’re part of the family,” said Mr. Forrence, who remembers having a Jamaican babysitter as a child. “Jimmy has been with the family for 31 years.” Jimmy corrected him: “32.” New York is the second-largest apple-producing state in the country (the first is Washington State), churning out more than one billion pounds of fruit each year, according to the New York Apple Association. Weekenders looking to frolic in the orchards on a beautiful fall afternoon barely put a dent into such a bounty. To complete the harvest within the narrow picking window (late August through October, weather depending), orchards hire thousands of foreign workers, including hundreds from Jamaica. It’s a practice that stretches back more than 70 years in the region, and to the 1970s at Forrence Orchards. The workers come under the H-2A program, which brings temporary agricultural labor to the United States. For this year’s apple season, the Forrences hired 185 Jamaicans, split into about a dozen crews. "
"CHANTILLY, Va. — Standing before the space shuttle Discovery in a voluminous hangar outside of Washington, Vice President Mike Pence announced on Thursday a renewed focus on putting Americans in space and making a return to the moon. “We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond,” Mr. Pence said during a meeting of the National Space Council. The council, a group of senior federal officials that coordinates policy between NASA, the Defense Department and other agencies involved with space, was disbanded in 1993, but President Trump signed an executive order in June to reestablish it. (The meeting, which was held at the National Air & Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, was streamed live on the internet). Council members include Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao; Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross; General H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser; and Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Pence did not lay out a timetable for when American astronauts would step on the moon again or propose a strategy for getting there, much less broach the topic of a price tag. In his introductory comments to the council, Mr. Pence described the United States space program as in decline, and leveled sharp criticism of the Obama administration. “Rather than competing with other nations to create the best space technology, the previous administration chose capitulation,” he said.

"The Trump administration urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to dismiss two cases challenging its revised travel ban, issued in March, saying they are moot in light of recent developments. But the plaintiffs urged the justices to decide the cases notwithstanding recent changes in the scope and duration of the travel restrictions. The court had been set to hear arguments in the case on Oct. 10. But the justices removed the case from the argument calendar last month after the administration announced in a presidential proclamation that it would replace temporary travel restrictions issued in March that had limited travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. The new restrictions, which are set to take effect on Oct. 18, apply in various ways to nine countries. Most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea will be barred from entering the United States, while citizens of Iraq and some groups of people in Venezuela will face restrictions or heightened scrutiny. “A case is moot,” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote on Thursday, “when a challenged government regulation is replaced by one that is not substantially similar.” The new restrictions are different from the earlier ones in important ways, he wrote, and were “based on detailed findings regarding the national security interests of the United States that were reached after a thorough, worldwide review and extensive consultation.” A challenge to the new restrictions, Mr. Francisco wrote, “must proceed on its own terms and in the district court in the first instance.” "
"Washington Redskins receiver Terrelle Pryor said he was called racial slurs from the crowd during Monday night’s game at Kansas City, and the N.F.L. said on Thursday that it was looking into the incident. On his way out of the game, Pryor made an obscene gesture to the crowd, which he said was motivated by the slurs. A brief video published by TMZ Sports shows the scene after the confrontation had started. It revealed obscene words and gestures on both sides, but no racial slurs are clearly audible. “We are looking into all aspects of it, and we will report back when we have concluded that review,” Joe Lockhart, an N.F.L. spokesman, told NBC. “We have no tolerance for racial comments directed to anyone. Those fans are not welcome to come back this week, next week, or any time.” On Instagram on Wednesday, Pryor said that he was called the slur multiple times. He said that as a result, an N.F.L. employee stood next to him from the second quarter on. He wrote that such incidents were “the exact reason why guys are kneeling during anthem.” “Me flicking the person off is more deserving,” he wrote. “I do apologize to my teammates and the organization. But at some point you keep calling us the N-word, we going to start acting up.” Race has been a major issue for the N.F.L. this year, with many players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination and police brutality. President Trump has weighed in, scolding those who do not stand. Pryor stood for Monday’s anthem — “I chose not to kneel because as a team we decided to be one and stand,” he wrote — but at least two Chiefs players did not. The Chiefs won the game, 29-20. Pryor, 28, was a quarterback at Ohio State and initially in the N.F.L. with the Raiders, then converted to wide receiver with the Browns. He was briefly a member of the Chiefs, but he did not get in a game. In May, Orioles outfielder Adam Jones was racially taunted by some fans in Boston. He received an extended ovation from Red Sox fans the next night. "
"WASHINGTON — When Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson traveled to Saudi Arabia with President Trump last spring, he impressed hosts and visitors alike by swaying along with the traditional men’s dancers swathed in white robes and brandishing swords. “Not my first sword dance,” Mr. Tillerson deadpanned afterward. Indeed, the calculation behind Mr. Tillerson’s appointment was that he could parlay decades of experience as an oil executive brokering deals in the Middle East and elsewhere into success in the nation’s top diplomatic post. But as Mr. Tillerson has discovered, the most important target of any secretary of state’s diplomacy is the president he serves. Now the man brandishing the sword is Mr. Trump, who holds it over Mr. Tillerson’s neck, poised to swing at any moment. The relationship between the two men has grown so acidic that Mr. Tillerson felt compelled to call an extraordinary news conference on Wednesday to deny that he was thinking of resigning — a move that paradoxically only increased speculation that he might in fact resign, of his own free will or not. Even if he stays, Mr. Tillerson is now a wounded figure, his credibility at home and abroad diminished by the perception that he does not have a close alignment with the president. Foreign leaders and diplomats may doubt that he truly represents the administration or that his assurances will stick. A countdown clock has been set, ticking away toward what many assume is the inevitable departure. “Tillerson has good instincts on many foreign policy issues and is ready to provide independent advice,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime State Department peace negotiator now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “Despite Tillerson’s efforts to project the fact that it’s all one big happy family, however, the road ahead with a president who consistently undercuts him publicly won’t be easy.” Michael Doran, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who served in several national security positions under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump has made clear that staying on the same page as his top advisers is not a priority. In some cases, he said, that may provide value in forging a “good cop, bad cop” strategy that gives Mr. Tillerson leverage to demand more in negotiations with other countries. "
"A federal agency on Thursday imposed tough new restrictions on so-called payday lending, dealing a potentially crushing blow to an industry that churns out billions of dollars a year in high-interest loans to working-class and poor Americans. The rules announced by the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are likely to sharply curtail the use of payday loans, which critics say prey on the vulnerable through their huge fees. Currently, a cash-strapped customer might borrow $400 from a payday lender. The loan would be due two weeks later — plus $60 in interest and fees. That is the equivalent of an annual interest rate of more than 300 percent, far higher than what banks and credit cards charge for loans. Because most borrowers cannot repay their debts quickly, the loans are often rolled over, entangling those who take them in hard-to-escape spirals of ever-growing debt. The new guidelines pit the consumer bureau, an independent watchdog created in the aftermath of the financial crisis, against congressional Republicans and President Trump, who has made rolling back business regulations a centerpiece of his agenda. The bureau has aggressively pursued new regulations and enforcement actions since Mr. Trump took office, even as other federal agencies loosened the reins on the industries they monitor. "

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • An opening on gun control. After resisting legislative limits on guns for years, Republicans signaled that they were open to banning the firearm accessory that Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas gunman, used to make his rifles mimic automatic-weapon fire. We explain what “bump stocks” are, and how he used them. With photographs and maps, we look inside Mr. Paddock’s 32nd-floor suite, where the casino regular stayed for free as a reward for his loyalty. We also learned about his gambling habits. (He preferred video poker.) Here are the latest updates in the investigation. Mr. Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, said on Wednesday that she hadn’t known of his plans. She was in the Philippines at the time of the shooting and thought — because he had wired her money and told her to buy a house — that he was breaking up with her. Read her statement. • Fourteen minutes of chaos. Using videos and police scanner conversations, we reconstructed the events that left 58 dead and about 500 injured. We also debunked some rumors that spread after the shooting. "
"The Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein faces a series of previously undisclosed allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact stretching back nearly three decades, according to a New York Times investigation published on Thursday afternoon. During that time period, Mr. Weinstein has settled at least eight times with women, including actresses and assistants, according to two company officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Soon after the article was published, the actress and writer Lena Dunham applauded the women who came forward. Those “who chose to speak about their experience of harassment by Harvey Weinstein deserve our awe,” she said. “It’s not fun or easy. It’s brave.” Amber Tamblyn, who addressed her own experience with sexual harassment in an Op-Ed article in The Times last month, also praised the women, including the actress Ashley Judd, who shared their stories.

"PYONGYANG, North Korea — To fly into North Korea on an old Russian aircraft is to step into an alternate universe, one in which “the Supreme Leader” defeats craven American imperialists, in which triplets are taken from parents to be raised by the state, in which nuclear war is imminent but survivable — and in which there is zero sympathy for American detainees like Otto Warmbier. Warmbier was the University of Virginia student who was arrested for stealing a poster, then sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and eventually returned to the U.S. in a vegetative state. “He broke the law in our country,” said Ri Yong-pil, a senior Foreign Ministry official, adding that Warmbier was returned (a week before his death) as a “humanitarian” act. Another senior ministry official, Choe Kang-il, insisted that North Korea had provided excellent care and spent “all the money for nursing” him. Something in me snapped. I asked how North Koreans could possibly boast about their spending on a young man when he was in a coma only because of them. Choe replied just as hotly that Warmbier had not been mistreated and was in fine condition when he was sent back home. “The U.S. administration, or some people with a certain intention, let him die,” Choe said. “This must be intended to foster and spread anti-Communist hatred within America.” Officials offered no apology and gave no ground, reflecting a hard line toward the United States that I found everywhere on this visit; Choe derided President Trump as “a crazy man,” “a thug” and “a pathetic man with a big mouth.” I’ve been covering North Korea on and off since the 1980s, and this five-day trip has left me more alarmed than ever about the risks of a catastrophic confrontation.

Here’s what Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said to CNN: He later told Bloomberg: The context Heather Gillers, WSJ: Howard Cure of Evercore Wealth Management told The WSJ: “I think the market was very anxious about the paper to begin with.” David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors told Politico: “No idea what [Trump] means. It certainly threw a curve at markets.” A reminder Here are Mr. Trump’s comments on Puerto Rico, in an interview with Fox News: A looming deadline Puerto Rico’s Treasury secretary, Raúl Maldonado, said the government could shut down on Oct. 31 if Congress doesn’t provide billions of dollars in emergency funds. (He has requested $6 billion to $8 billion.) The commonwealth’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, told Bloomberg: A Big Creditor Is Unmasked The Intercept’s David Dayen figured out that Seth Klarman’s $30 billion hedge fund, Baupost Group, owns nearly $1 billion worth of the island’s debt. • Baupost owns Cofina bonds, which are backed by some of Puerto Rico’s sales tax revenue. • The hedge fund bought the bonds through a shell company named Decagon Holdings.

"It was exactly six years ago — a lifetime in the world of politics in Washington — that A.J. Ferate, then a senior regulatory lawyer and lobbyist at Devon Energy in Oklahoma City, first reached out to Scott Pruitt, then a little-known first-term attorney general, to ask for a bit of help. Back in 2011, Devon executives were so determined to try to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from enacting a new rule intended to more aggressively limit methane leaks from oil and gas wells — a potent contributor to climate change — that they drafted a letter for Mr. Pruitt to send to Lisa Jackson, then the E.P.A. administrator. Shortly thereafter, Ferate followed up. Mr. Pruitt’s office sent the letter nearly verbatim. Devon Energy ultimately donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Attorneys General Association and an affiliated organization. The New York Times reported on that in 2014, detailing the alliance between Mr. Pruitt and the oil and gas industry while he served as Oklahoma’s attorney general. Our stories were part of a package that won a Pulitzer Prize. So why return to the issue now? Well, until this year, Mr. Pruitt was never really able to deliver on what Mr. Ferate, and Devon Energy, wanted: the termination of the methane rule, and of a related effort by the E.P.A. to collect data on methane emissions by oil and gas companies.

"LONDON — The Russian energy and aluminum company EN+ said on Thursday that it planned to raise $1.5 billion in an initial public offering in London and Moscow. The listing would be one of the largest by a Russian company since the Kremlin drew sanctions and international condemnation by annexing Crimea in 2014. The I.P.O. would be a test of how attractive Russian assets are to investors, given the often tense geopolitical background. EN+ is owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska. Mr. Deripaska is a member of the inner circle of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and he once had close ties to Paul J. Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager. Mr. Deripaska offered this year to cooperate with congressional committees investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States, but American officials were said to be unwilling to accept his conditions, which included a request for full immunity. Maxim M. Sokov, the chief executive of EN+, said in a news release that listing in London and Moscow “will further increase our profile among the international financial community, support our deleveraging plans and give new investors a chance to participate in an exciting yield and growth story.” “Looking ahead, we are confident that we can create real value for all shareholders, deliver strong growth and pay an impressive dividend,” he added. EN+ said it intended to list global depositary receipts on the London Stock Exchange and on the Moscow Exchange, adding that it intended to list in London next month. The company said it planned to use the proceeds to repay a portion of its debt. As part of the offering, AnAn Group, a Singapore-based strategic partner of CEFC China Energy Company, is expected to act as a cornerstone investor and has committed to purchase $500 million in securities. EN+ is a producer of hydropower through EN+ Power and of aluminum through Rusal, in which it holds a 48.1 percent stake. EN+ reported revenue of $5.8 billion in the first half of this year. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch International, SIB (Cyprus) Limited and VTB Capital are acting as joint global coordinators on the offering. "
"I have never understood the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment. From a law-and-order standpoint, more guns means more murder. “States with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides,” noted one exhaustive 2013 study in the American Journal of Public Health. From a personal-safety standpoint, more guns means less safety. The F.B.I. counted a total of 268 “justifiable homicides” by private citizens involving firearms in 2015; that is, felons killed in the course of committing a felony. Yet that same year, there were 489 “unintentional firearms deaths” in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Between 77 and 141 of those killed were children. From a national-security standpoint, the Amendment’s suggestion that a “well-regulated militia” is “necessary to the security of a free State,” is quaint. The Minutemen that will deter Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are based in missile silos in Minot, N.D., not farmhouses in Lexington, Mass. From a personal liberty standpoint, the idea that an armed citizenry is the ultimate check on the ambitions and encroachments of government power is curious. The Whiskey Rebellion of the 1790s, the New York draft riots of 1863, the coal miners’ rebellion of 1921, the Brink’s robbery of 1981 — does any serious conservative think of these as great moments in Second Amendment activism? And now we have the relatively new and now ubiquitous “active shooter” phenomenon, something that remains extremely rare in the rest of the world. Conservatives often say that the right response to these horrors is to do more on the mental-health front. Yet by all accounts Stephen Paddock would not have raised an eyebrow with a mental-health professional before he murdered 58 people in Las Vegas last week. What might have raised a red flag? I’m not the first pundit to point out that if a “Mohammad Paddock” had purchased dozens of firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition and then checked himself into a suite at the Mandalay Bay with direct views to a nearby music festival, somebody at the local F.B.I. field office would have noticed.

"Updated Feb. 1, 2018 The list of Trump scandals keeps growing. “Amid the chaos and dysfunction,” Slate’s Jamelle Bouie writes, “it can be easy to miss that this White House is corrupt. Remarkably, unbelievably, corrupt.” Given the number of potential scandals involving personal enrichment — of President Trump, his family or top administration officials — I wanted to create a list of all the major ones. Here goes: • The presidency is benefiting Trump’s business in numerous ways. Government officials have stayed in hotels that bear Trump’s name, for example, while some foreign government officials have taken steps to curry favor by better accommodating Trump-branded properties in their countries. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club doubled its membership rates after he won the White House. Trump’s companies sold more than $35 million in real estate last year, according to one report. Many of the sales went to opaque shell companies, which hide the buyers’ identities, and flow into a trust the president may access. Trump International Realty, run by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s sons, is seeking new business in South Florida. Also: Eric Trump has been giving his father quarterly updates on the financial health of his businesses, despite promises that the president would have no involvement. Those businesses have also done deals with foreign governments, despite the president’s pledge that they wouldn’t. • Trump has spent more than $30 million of taxpayer money traveling to properties he owns, by one estimate. • Ryan Zinke, Trump’s secretary of the interior, is under investigation for chartering a $12,000 flight from Las Vegas to Montana at taxpayers’ expense. Zinke also failed to disclose an investment in a Montana gun company, booked a $12,000 flight on an oil executive’s plane, spent almost $40,000 of a wildfire preparedness fund to pay for flights and paid $6,000 for a helicopter trip to visit Vice President Mike Pence. • David Shulkin, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, charged taxpayers for a trip to Europe that included stopovers at Wimbledon and Westminster Abbey, plus a river cruise for him and his wife.

"Although the U.S. Department of State recently issued a travel warning on Cuba, a number of cruise lines plan to add itineraries to Cuba next year. The Sept. 29 statement, which “warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Cuba,” is based on a series of mysterious illnesses that have befallen U.S. Embassy workers in Havana. But several cruise lines operating ships in and around Cuba have released statements pushing back on the warning, noting that no tourists have been harmed in these incidents. They also say cruising is compliant with new travel restrictions that were imposed in June by President Trump, who essentially rolled back President Obama’s easing of sanctions in 2014. The new rules make independent travel more difficult, essentially funneling interested travelers to tour companies, including cruise lines. Although the Trump administration’s expulsion of Cuban diplomats this week in retaliation for the American diplomats’ ilnesses suggests that relations are becoming more fraught between the two nations, travel remains legal, and non-Cuban-born Americans seeking to visit Cuba may still receive their visas to do so through their airline, cruise line or tour operator. It is possible, given the skeleton crew operating at the Cuban embassy, that the visa process could slow, but at present tour operators say they have visas on hand. Several cruise companies had already announced significant expansion of their Cuba operations before the warning was issued. Carnival Cruise Line launched its Cuba itinerary aboard the Carnival Paradise in June and recently announced five new sailings in 2018. Departing from Tampa, the mix of four-to-eight-day cruises include Havana as a port of call along with other Caribbean island stops (from $589 a person). Norwegian Cruise Line is adding four-day cruises to Cuba from Port Canaveral next May. The trips also visit Key West and offer an overnight in Havana (from $599 a person). "
"The architecture of Canada’s new National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa is both symbolic and haunting, with six concrete triangles depicting the stars that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany, and that marked millions of them for extermination during World War II. But while the structure’s design embodies Jewish suffering during the Holocaust, a plaque placed outside it failed to mention Jews or anti-Semitism, an omission that has drawn furious criticism. The plaque outside the memorial — the country’s first national Holocaust monument, 10 years in the making and inaugurated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week — paid tribute to the “millions of men, women and children murdered during the Holocaust” and the “survivors who persevered and were able to make their way to Canada after one of the darkest chapters in history.” The omission of any mention of Jews in the inscription was immediately seized upon by opposition politicians, rights advocates and the Israeli news media. Some groups turned to social media to express criticism. The plaque was removed. The Times of Israel headline blared, “Canada Holocaust memorial omits any mention of Jews, anti-Semitism.” David Sweet, a lawmaker from the opposition Conservative Party, asked Canada’s Parliament, “How could the prime minister permit such a glaring omission of reference to anti-Semitism and the fact that the millions of men, women and children who were murdered were overwhelmingly Jewish?” He added: “If we are going to stamp out hatred of Jews, it is important to get history right.” "
"WASHINGTON — Rising exports and falling imports shrank the United States’ trade deficit in goods and services to the lowest level in nearly a year, data released Thursday by the Commerce Department showed. The trade deficit — the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports — narrowed to $42.4 billion in August, down $1.2 billion from July. Exports for the month were $195.3 billion, while imports came to $237.7 billion. The nation’s trade deficits with China and the European Union both shrank in August. Josh Feinman, the chief economist of Deutsche Asset Management, said those trends were largely the result of a strengthening global economy that buoyed American exports, as well as the weakening of the value of the dollar. “Global growth is looking better,” Mr. Feinman said. “That does create a little bit of a tailwind for exports.” He cautioned that the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, could be distorting the data somewhat, as ports closed and people stayed home from work and shops. Despite the narrowing in August, the overall trade deficit is still growing on an annual basis. It was up 8.8 percent in the first eight months from the same period in 2016, according to Commerce Department data. President Trump has often pointed to the trade deficit as evidence that the United States is not benefiting from global trade in the way that it should. He has promised that his America-first policy will help shrink the gap, consistently citing deficits with other countries as a sign that the United States is losing when it comes to global trade. And he has typically blamed trade agreements and negotiators for failing to achieve the best terms for American exporters. "
"Not since the Cold War has there been a diplomatic mystery as intriguing as the “sonic weapon” purportedly used against American and Canadian officials in Havana. The Trump administration has yet to identify a culprit or a device that would explain the rash of symptoms among officials first noted months ago and acknowledged in August, but these are real and deeply worrisome: hearing loss, dizziness, headaches and cognitive issues. Every country keeps tabs on potentially hostile diplomats and spies, and the Cold War spy vs. spy games were rich in gimmickry and trickery. But deploying a tool that causes serious health problems would be a serious violation of accepted international behavior. Cuba’s repressive government must be the prime suspect. It would certainly want to keep watch over a large batch of newly arrived American diplomats and intelligence operatives. If Cuba is found to have used some new surveillance machine, the United States would have the obligation to respond angrily. But until there is concrete evidence about the source of the attacks, the Trump administration is wrong to expel Cuban diplomats from Washington, as it did on Tuesday. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s explanation that Cuba should be punished for failing to protect American diplomats presumes that Cuba was at least aware of the attacks, which the United States has neither demonstrated nor claimed. So far, the Cuban government has strongly denied any awareness of a sonic weapon and has actively assisted American investigators. Other parties, most notably Russia, must also figure as suspects: President Vladimir Putin would probably welcome a setback to U.S.-Cuban relations. Until something more is known, punishing Havana serves only to further undermine the sensible opening to Cuba begun under Barack Obama. President Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the détente — in June his government ordered restrictions on contacts with Cuba that have slowed the flow of visitors to the island, and last week the State Department warned Americans not to travel there, though there is no evidence that tourists are in danger. The sonic attacks on Americans are too serious to be used for cynical political ends. "
"LOS ANGELES — An invitation to visit Pink in Venice, a few blocks from the beach, for a home-cooked Monday night dinner could seem like a contrived play for authenticity. But it’s hard to remain skeptical when faced with a giggling baby. Faux-intimate or not, the domestic scene earlier this month featuring Top 40’s long-reigning rebel was disarmingly unpolished: an entryway cluttered with roller skates, stuffed animals, kites and bike helmets; a chicken in the oven; and the singer’s second child, the nine-month-old Jameson, making only a moderate mess with his spoon-fed mush. (Willow, 6, was elsewhere with her father, the former motocross racer Carey Hart.) Pink, who has spent nearly two decades selling her relative edge and honesty from within the pop machine, is not quite Martha Stewart. She wore tattoo-baring overalls and diamond earrings as she passed the baby (named for the whiskey) to his nanny, and began dressing a salad with the uncertainty of a 20-something playing dinner party. Slide sandals emblazoned with the words “Frigid Whore” sat nearby. This is the life of a well-adjusted veteran star, who’s not quite sure how she’s survived this long and stayed this sane. A vestige of the Y2K, peak-CD, MTV “TRL” generation, Pink, now 38, hasn’t melted down or ever really gone away, a fact she owes to never having been “the one.” “I’ve never won the popularity contest,” she said over the roasted chicken and vegetables she declared “mostly cooked.” “I was never as big as Britney or Christina. If you look at any paragraph about pop music, I don’t get mentioned — my name doesn’t come up. And yet, here I go again, right under the wave, duck-diving.” It’s not that she’s been ignored, or burrowed in a niche. Since her debut, “Can’t Take Me Home,” in 2000, Pink has sold more than 16 million albums and some 45 million digital songs in the United States, according to Nielsen Music; she’s had 23 songs in the Billboard Top 40 (including her current single, “What About Us”), with four No. 1 hits and 11 more that reached the Top 10. She headlines arenas around the world and will perform on “Saturday Night Live” on Oct. 14, the day after the release of “Beautiful Trauma,” her seventh solo album. "
"Can this tax plan be saved? Given the chorus of derision that greeted the release last week of the “Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code,” as the White House is calling it, the most ambitious attempt at tax reform in over 40 years would appear to be on a respirator, if not yet dead. Predictably, Democrats, their allies and many independent economists pounced on the plan as a tax cut for the rich. Deficit hawks, including many Republicans, denounced it as recklessly driving up the federal deficit. And legislators from high-tax states, including Republicans, howled at the proposal to end the deduction for state and local taxes. Not surprisingly, for the most part President Trump has taken the approach of publicizing the benefits of his plan — mostly corporate and business tax cuts — while leaving the hard part, closing loopholes, to Congress. As Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, put it: “Tax cuts are easy. Tax reform is hard.” But this plan is just an opening salvo. I was surprised this week, in interviews with tax experts from across the political spectrum, to hear that all those issues can be resolved, if Congress is willing to take up the challenge. Critics of the plan have mostly ignored that substantial elements of it have drawn bipartisan support. Almost everyone agrees that corporate tax rates need to be cut because of global competition. Companies should not be able to stash earnings overseas tax-free. With the standard deduction doubled, many more individual taxpayers could file a simple short-form return. A lower rate for small businesses and pass-through entities, while more controversial, should promote economic growth. “The most important things for the middle class will be better economic performance and growth in wages,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative pro-growth advocacy group. “That’s a much more powerful force than any tax policy. From that perspective, this is a promising start. But it’s only a start.” "
"Major leaguers set records in 2017 for home runs, strikeouts and relief innings. The top eight teams in slugging percentage all reached the postseason. So did the top eight pitching staffs in strikeouts. Now, a season of extremes hurtles into October. With the wild-card games complete, the best-of-five division series are set: Boston at Houston; the Yankees at Cleveland; the Chicago Cubs at Washington; and Arizona at the Los Angeles Dodgers. The American League games start Thursday, the National League Friday. “You could make the argument the field is as strong as it’s been in recent memory – and not just with one or two defined strengths, but really well-rounded teams,” Chris Antonetti, the Indians’ president of baseball operations, said last week. “Anyone’s really capable of winning.” That is true, and we hate to spoil the suspense. But if you’d like to know precisely what will happen, here are our reality-based, sure-to-be-accurate predictions: Oct. 6, Houston, A.L.D.S., Game 2 – Eight players have collected five hits in a postseason game, most recently Albert Pujols in the 2011 World Series. Make way for another as the Astros’ Jose Altuve – who has 98 more hits than anyone else in the majors over the last four seasons – torments the Red Sox in Game 2. Oct. 9, New York, A.L.D.S., Game 4 – The mighty Yankees bullpen, which collected 26 outs in the wild-card game, is called on to bail out Luis Severino again in Game 4 against the Indians. After Severino’s scoreless first inning, Chad Green escapes a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the second. The Indians win to advance, but Severino does improve his postseason earned run average to 20.25 – mercifully lower than Jay Witasick’s infamous 21.60 showing in 2001. "
"WASHINGTON — The House took the first major legislative step Thursday toward enacting a promised overhaul of the tax code, approving a budget blueprint that would allow a future tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes. The House voted 219 to 206 to pass the budget resolution, with 18 Republicans voting against it. The belated approval of a spending and revenue blueprint for the fiscal year that began on Sunday offered a momentary display of Republican cohesion as the party moves ahead in its attempt to overhaul the tax code for the first time since Ronald Reagan was president. The document itself ostensibly charts a path toward a balanced budget over the next 10 years, giving Republicans something to offer their core conservative voters while providing Democrats with new lines of attack in the 2018 midterm elections. But few people believe the broad spending road map will lead anywhere. What is important is parliamentary language that would shield a tax bill from a filibuster in the Senate. A week after Republicans conceded defeat in their attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, that constituted a step forward in their new legislative quest. “Our budget is the golden key that unlocks pro-growth tax reform,” said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee. For Republican lawmakers still looking for a major legislative achievement in the Trump era, the hard part still remains. President Trump and Republicans in Congress need to agree on the contents of a bill to overhaul the tax code, a daunting task. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) San Francisco’s drug problem is in your face. Walk around long enough and you may well kick a used syringe or see someone shooting up in plain view. The visibility of the scourge is one reason city leaders are starting to move seriously toward creating so-called supervised injection sites. It would be among the first American cities to do so. Supervisor London Breed has been a champion of the idea. In an interview, she recounted some of the efforts so far to address the drug problem: outreach, a needle exchange program and cleanup crews that collect thousands of syringes a month. “But that’s not all working,” she said. Needle exchanges have existed in the United States since the 1980s. They’ve been shown not only to slow the spread of deadly viruses, but also to aid in recovery by luring addicts into the public health system. Supporters say injection facilities, which include clean syringes and medical supervision, extend those benefits. Australia, Canada and several European nations have had them for years. "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed Randal K. Quarles as the Federal Reserve’s vice chairman for supervision, an important victory for the Trump administration in its campaign to ease some financial regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Quarles is the first person to officially hold the position, created after the crisis to sharpen the Fed’s focus on financial stability and regulation. As a governor on the Fed’s board, Mr. Quarles will also vote on monetary policy. Daniel K. Tarullo, who stepped down from the Fed earlier this year, was the Fed’s point man on regulation but was never confirmed as vice chairman. The vote, 65 to 32, ensures that the Fed will still have four governors on its seven-seat board after its vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, steps down later this month. The Trump administration has not nominated candidates for the three remaining vacancies. President Trump also must decide whether to replace or renominate the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, when her term ends in February. Mr. Quarles said at his confirmation hearing in July that the government should relax some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry since 2008. The Trump administration argues that regulation is impeding lending and economic growth. “Regulatory policies enacted since the financial crisis have improved the safety and soundness of the financial system,” Mr. Quarles said. “But as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order.” "
