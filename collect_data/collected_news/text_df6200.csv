"Update: The United States and South Korea formally announced the trade agreement in a joint statement on Wednesday, and said that it “represents important progress in improving U.S.-Korea trade and economic relations.” WASHINGTON — President Trump scored his first significant trade deal this week, securing a pact with South Korea that represents the type of one-on-one agreement that Mr. Trump says makes the best sense for American companies and workers. The deal, which is expected to be formally announced on Wednesday, opens the South’s market to American autos by lifting existing limits on manufacturers like Ford Motor and General Motors, extends tariffs for South Korean truck exports and restricts, by nearly a third, the amount of steel that the South can export to the United States. Mr. Trump used his threat of stiff steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to extract the concessions he wanted, helping produce an agreement that had stalled amid disagreements this year. But winning the deal may have had more to do with the geopolitical realities confronting the United States and South Korea as America embarks on tricky nuclear discussions with North Korea. The United States cannot afford a protracted trade standoff at a moment when it needs the South as an ally. The trade deal came as the Chinese state news media reported that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, made an unannounced visit to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping weeks before planned summit meetings with American and South Korean leaders. The political success of the trade agreement — and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations — is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington’s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president’s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests. "
"BEIJING — North Korea’s enigmatic young leader, Kim Jong-un, made an unannounced visit to Beijing, meeting with President Xi Jinping weeks before planned summit meetings with American and South Korean leaders, Chinese and North Korean state news media reported on Wednesday. The visit amounted to Mr. Kim’s international debut: It was the 34-year-old leader’s first trip outside North Korea since he took power in 2011, and his first meeting with another head of state. The surprise discussions added another layer of complexity to the rush of global diplomacy around North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Mr. Kim told the Chinese leader that he was open to dialogue with the United States, including a potential summit meeting with President Trump, and was committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, according to an account published by China’s news agency Xinhua. “If South Korea and the United States respond with good will to our efforts and create an atmosphere of peace and stability, and take phased, synchronized measures to achieve peace, the issue of the denuclearization of the peninsula can reach resolution,” Mr. Kim said, according to Xinhua’s summary of his meeting with Mr. Xi. Hours after the meeting was announced, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he looked forward to meeting Mr. Kim, and that there was “a good chance” that the North Korean leader would “do what is right for his people and for humanity.” "
"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, recently warned dozens of foreign diplomats — including the Russian ambassador — that the United States would retaliate if adversaries abroad meddled in its coming elections. “To those who would try to attack our democracy, to affect our elections, to affect the elections of other countries, to undermine national sovereignty, I have a word of warning: Don’t,” Ms. Nielsen told an estimated 80 foreign envoys and other officials during a speech last week, according to a person in attendance. Two other people with knowledge of the event confirmed the comments. All three spoke on the condition of anonymity because the remarks were given at a closed-door meeting. It was an unusually stern warning by Ms. Nielsen, and was among the harshest threats of retaliation by a member of President Trump’s cabinet. Ms. Nielsen is one of the most outspoken advocates of the administration’s policies, and has resisted being drawn into the controversy over Russian meddling during the 2016 election that put Mr. Trump in office. Ms. Nielsen told the dignitaries gathered at Blair House, the presidential guesthouse, that election tampering would be detected and meddling states would suffer consequences, according to the person in attendance. The New York Times obtained a list of people who attended, including ambassadors from across the world. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman confirmed the speech at Blair House but declined to provide details. "
"In a last-minute move that would give Republicans an advantage in maintaining control of the House of Representatives, the Trump administration is reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Coming from an administration that has been hostile toward immigrants, the change was not surprising, but it’s galling nonetheless. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the decision Monday, less than a week before the Census Bureau, which his department oversees, is supposed to send final questions for the 2020 census to Congress. If his decision stands — the attorney general of California has filed a lawsuit to block it, and other elected officials are preparing to do so — it would be the first time in 70 years that the federal government has asked people to specify their citizenship status on the census form sent to every household. This is important because the census count determines how many House seats each state gets. The census is also used to determine the allocation of more than $600 billion in federal spending, including Medicaid, food stamps and grants to schools. Asking about citizenship would reduce responses from immigrant families, which are already less likely than others to answer government surveys and are terrified by President Trump’s anti-immigrant policies and statements. An inaccurate count is likely to provide more representation to states with fewer immigrants and higher response rates and take seats away from states like California where response rates would be lower. Given the geography of American politics, that would probably lead to more power for Republicans, and less for Democrats. Experts say even citizens and permanent residents would be less likely to respond if they have relatives who are undocumented immigrants. Mr. Ross’s decision was based on the disingenuous argument that the Department of Justice needs to know the citizenship status of residents in each census tract so it can better protect the rights of minority voters under the Voting Rights Act. Even putting aside the laughable notion that this administration cares about minority voting rights, this argument is bunkum — the Justice Department has been enforcing that law without access to such data for decades. The last census that asked people to report their citizenship status was conducted in 1950, 15 years before the Voting Rights Act became law. What’s more, the Justice Department already has access to citizenship data through the American Community Survey, which is conducted every year. The timing of this change is highly suspect. It comes too late to be included in a field test of the 2020 census the government is conducting right now with 275,000 households in Providence County, R.I. In his memo, Mr. Ross sought to play down concerns that the citizenship question would reduce response rates by claiming there was no “empirical evidence” to back up that argument. Yet, by seeking to insert the question so late in the process, he has prevented officials from empirically testing how people will react to it. "
"Time Inc., the franchise, is being dismantled for scrap. The Meredith Corporation, which acquired the company less than two months ago, recently put Time magazine and three other titles back on the market. An analyst who follows Meredith said the once-venerable magazines aren’t worth much more than $10 million each and will be a hard sell “unless some rich family wants to own them for vanity reasons.” On the contrary: This presents a terrific investment opportunity. But before you plunk down that sum, it’s at least worth considering what else $10 million can get you: A military parade. A diamond bath just like Taylor Swift’s. A pad on Park Avenue.

"WASHINGTON — At least 12 states signaled Tuesday that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, arguing that the change would cause fewer Americans to be counted and violate the Constitution. The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said he was leading a multistate lawsuit to stop the move, and officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington said they would join the effort. The State of California filed a separate lawsuit late Monday night. “The census is supposed to count everyone,” said Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts. “This is a blatant and illegal attempt by the Trump administration to undermine that goal, which will result in an undercount of the population and threaten federal funding for our state and cities.” The Constitution requires that every resident of the United States be counted in a decennial census, whether or not they are citizens. The results are used not just to redraw political boundaries from school boards to House seats, but to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and subsidies to where they are needed most. Census data provide the baseline for planning decisions made by corporations and governments alike. Opponents of the added citizenship question said it was certain to depress response to the census from noncitizens and even legal immigrants. Critics accused the administration of adding the question to reduce the population count in the predominantly Democratic areas where more immigrants reside, in advance of state and national redistricting in 2021. The Trump administration defended the citizenship question by saying it was needed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, which relies on accurate estimates of voting-eligible populations. "
"As a start-up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014, the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies, a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon. It was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge’s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app — a mobile-phone-based personality quiz — to gain access to Facebook users’ friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach. By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app. The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain. [Read more about the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower contending that data-mining swung the Brexit referendum.] The revelations pulled Palantir — co-founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel — into the furor surrounding Cambridge, which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016. Mr. Thiel, a supporter of President Trump, serves on the board at Facebook. "
"BUDAPEST — Billboards. TV campaigns. Radio programs. The anti-immigrant government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban uses different levers to influence public opinion, particularly on the subject of the European refugee crisis. Even school textbooks. On Page 155 of the latest eighth-grade history textbook, students are told that Mr. Orban thinks refugees are a threat to Hungary — and then encouraged to believe he is right. “It can be problematic,” the book concludes, “for different cultures to coexist.” It is a testament to the scope of Mr. Orban’s program for remaking Hungary that part of the far-right leader’s message is now woven into the school curriculum. For the past eight years, Mr. Orban has waged a systemic assault on the hardware of Hungary’s democracy — rewriting the national Constitution, reshaping the judiciary and tweaking the electoral system to favor his Fidesz party. Less conspicuously, Mr. Orban is also trying to recode the software of Hungary’s democracy — its cultural sphere, civil society and education system. His party’s appointees or supporters dominate many artistic institutions and universities. A growing number of plays and exhibitions have had nationalist or anti-Western undertones. Religious groups and nongovernment organizations critical of Fidesz have seen funding dry up. He has especially vilified pro-democracy organizations funded by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros. National opinion surveys are used to steer public opinion as much as collect it, while history is also up for grabs. The government has jousted with educators over textbooks while promoting a narrative of Hungarian victimhood and ethnocentrism. "

"LONDON — The whistle-blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday, like a pink-haired, nose-ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data. In testimony to the House of Commons’ select committee on culture, Mr. Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, described the inner workings of SCL, a political consultancy that gave its clients access to a vast collection of personal information harvested from Facebook. In one of the longest sessions in recent memory, Mr. Wylie made a number of jaw-dropping assertions, most significantly that the company’s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain’s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered. But mostly, Mr. Wylie tried to explain data-mining. He looked like a cerebral skate-rat, which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility, but in this case it seemed to help. He was polite. He resembled, as one journalist put it, “a patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran.” His message was clear: If you aren’t already worried about how your personal data is being used, now would be a good time to start. “The way I like to think of it, data is the electricity of our new economy, and electricity can be quite dangerous,” he said. “We enjoy the benefits of electricity, despite the fact that it can literally kill you.” Cambridge Analytica released a statement describing Mr. Wylie as “a part-time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since then.” It said Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary of the SCL political consultancy, did not use its cache of data in Donald J. Trump’s 2016 campaign, and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal, or Brexit, from the bloc. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump kept a relatively low profile and did not make any public appearances on Tuesday, but emerged for a rare evening trip outside the White House to meet with deep-pocketed donors at a real estate developer’s home in Virginia. Mr. Trump, who usually prefers a steak served at his own hotel if he leaves the confines of the White House at night, traveled to the McLean, Va., home of Giuseppe Cecchi, according to a person with knowledge of the president’s plans. Mr. Cecchi is a loyalist who previously hosted Mr. Trump for a $10,000-a-couple fund-raising dinner in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Since arriving back in Washington on Sunday from his Florida estate, Mr. Trump’s schedule showed no public appearances and he kept his usual tweeting to a minimum. He has opted instead to leave it to his aides to field questions about a continuing investigation into his campaign’s contact with Russia, allegations by a pornographic actress that his lawyer paid her to stay silent about an affair, a move to expel 60 Russian diplomats and his administration’s support for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The White House declined to offer additional information about the dinner, but stressed that it was not a fund-raiser. “Tonight, the president will be having dinner with a group of supporters at a private residence in Virginia,” said Lindsay Walters, a deputy White House press secretary. “This dinner is not a fund-raiser. No funds have been solicited.” "

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Don’t write an obituary for the Orange Curtain just yet. For years, it seemed that the demographic change in Orange County might push the suburban enclave to shed its image as a conservative island. And in 2016, voters chose a Democrat candidate for president for the first time since the Great Depression. But now, political leaders there seem poised to reclaim their role as a counterpoint to much of the rest of California. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors took two significant votes: One scrapped a previously approved plan to open temporary shelters for the homeless in the wealthy towns of Huntington Beach, Irvine and Laguna Niguel. In the other, the board voted to join a lawsuit from the Trump administration against California’s so-called sanctuary state law. Both votes from the all-Republican board were unanimous, though one member was not present. Thousands of people had shown up to voice their views on the divisive policies. The vote to join the federal government’s lawsuit against the state came just days after the Los Alamitos City Council adopted a measure to exempt itself from the new state law that strictly limits communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. “We cannot let the state begin cherry-picking which federal laws it decides to follow,” Supervisor Michelle Steel said in a statement after the meeting. Immigrant rights advocates called the vote “shameful” and said they were “scapegoating our own communities.” Other opponents reminded the jurors that Orange County was a leader in backing Proposition 187, an anti-illegal immigrant measure that was later struck down by the courts. The votes are not the only sign of backlash. Earlier this week, the Orange County Sheriff’s office said it would begin listing everyone scheduled to be released from jail on a public website, as a way to get around the state law restricting communication with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. It is unclear how the county will now deal with the hundreds of people it forced out of a homeless encampment along the Santa Ana River earlier this year, but county leaders say they expect local leaders to discuss options at a court hearing on Tuesday.

"An advertising trade group that gave an award to Cambridge Analytica last year for its “big data” work during the 2016 presidential election is now urging marketers to reconsider the ethics of how consumer information is collected and used. The trade group, the Advertising Research Foundation, said it was waiting for more information before formally rescinding the award given to Cambridge Analytica, the British political consulting firm that was recently reported to have improperly harvested the data of 50 million Facebook users. The revelations have brought intense criticism of Facebook, which is facing inquiries from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic around how it handles user information, and have many people taking a closer look at the role of data in online advertising. ""We’ve tended to assume that because you can do something, you should,” Scott McDonald, chief executive of the ad group, said in an interview on Tuesday. He added that advertisers had been more concerned with the accuracy and validity of data they received from technology companies than with asking whether they should be collecting that data and using it to target consumers in the first place. Mr. McDonald addressed the Cambridge Analytica situation and the need for new guidelines during a speech on Wednesday morning at the group’s annual convention in New York. Things were much different last year, when Cambridge Analytica won a gold prize at the foundation’s David Ogilvy Awards, which have been given annually since 1994. The firm was honored for its work for the Trump campaign, in which it identified and advertised to undecided voters. The selection, made by a jury of ad industry leaders, was “very controversial because of the nature of the campaign,” Mr. McDonald said. But the ad group viewed itself as “Switzerland,” he said, and was simply conducting “a scientific evaluation of the quality of work.” “Nobody had any idea the data might have been pilfered,” he said. Mr. McDonald said he planned to potentially poll the jury again and “see if the accusations are sustained” before officially stripping Cambridge Analytica of the award. The existence of the award highlights the enthusiasm with which marketers have approached the reams of consumer data generated by digital devices and their belief that people are happy to share whatever information technology may be collecting from them. The Advertising Research Foundation, which acknowledged that the United States may adopt new regulations on how consumer data is collected, said it planned to work with other industry groups to form new guidelines for collecting and protecting that information. Mr. McDonald said advertising had gone too far in viewing consumers as prey, noting that even the industry’s vocabulary had become militarylike. “We talk about ad campaigns, consumers we target. We talk about subway takeovers, pop-ups,” he said. “These are fairly aggressive, and I don’t think we even think about it — they’re just embedded in the metaphors of advertising.” "
"WASHINGTON — A top Trump campaign official had repeated communications during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential race with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence, according to a document released on Tuesday by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election. The campaign official, Rick Gates, had frequent phone calls in September and October 2016 with a person the F.B.I. believes had active links to Russian spy services at the time, the document said. Mr. Gates also told an associate the person “was a former Russian Intelligence Officer with the G.R.U.,” the Russian military intelligence agency. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating numerous contacts between President Trump’s advisers and Russia-linked individuals and entities leading up to and after the November 2016 election. The document, filed in Mr. Mueller’s name, stated that the communications between Mr. Gates and the individual were “pertinent to the investigation.” The individual is identified only as “Person A,” and the document describes him as someone who worked for Mr. Gates and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, as part of their earlier representation of Russia-aligned parties and politicians in Ukraine, including the former president of Ukraine. A person with knowledge of the matter identified Person A as Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who for years was Mr. Manafort’s right-hand man in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort has told associates that he does not believe that Mr. Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, but the document released on Tuesday shows that Mr. Gates told others of his history in the intelligence services. That history was widely discussed for years among people who worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates in Ukraine. "
"Ricky Gervais, the British comedian, does not care what you say about him on Twitter. He does not care if you are offended. He does not care if you hate the latest joke he told about rape, or the Bible, or Caitlyn Jenner, or Hitler or your child’s fatal peanut allergy. And just to make sure you’re crystal clear on all of the tweets he does not remotely care about, he has built his new Netflix stand-up special, “Ricky Gervais: Humanity,” around them — these negligible tweets, the droning of gnats, several years of which he appears to have accidentally screen-grabbed and saved to his phone. (Ricky Gervais: Butterfingers!) Similarly, I don’t care about Formula One racing, which is why I’m working on a tight 75-minute act about the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Gervais seems to care quite intensely, of course, which is natural. It would be grotesque, inhuman, not to care. Absorbing critique on a scale as vast as Gervais’s Twitter feed (13.1 million followers), whether the specific critiques are warranted or not, is objectively grueling. Stand-up comedy is vulnerable and hard. Twitter is awful. Devoid of context, Gervais’s bravado might be sympathetic, a relatable if tedious coping mechanism. As Gervais himself helpfully points out in “Humanity,” however, nothing can truly be divorced from context. So here’s some context for you: Last week, the secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, testified in front of a House subcommittee that trans women in homeless shelters make cisgender women “not comfortable.” According to a 2016 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 20 percent of trans people report having been homeless at some point because of their gender identity, 55 percent report being harassed by homeless shelter residents and staff, and 29 percent have been turned away from shelters for being trans. Meanwhile, on Netflix, Gervais graphically speculated about Caitlyn Jenner’s gender confirmation surgery, repeatedly referred to her as a big strong man, relentlessly called her by her pre-transition name and compared gender dysphoria to a human choosing to identify as a chimpanzee. That is the context within which Gervais insists he doesn’t care about critiques of his work — critiques pointing out that describing trans women as goofy, freaky, delusional men who’ve just “popped on a dress” isn’t edgy or cheeky, it’s dangerous. Giggling at the “weirdness” of trans people — presenting your spasms of discomfort as something relatable — makes it harder for trans people to find a safe place to sleep. Transphobia is not a pet issue of the hypersensitive but a continuing international emergency. And sure, some critiques are silly or bad. Public opinion is a numbers game: Distribute your work to a large enough sample and you’ll accrue people who love you, which is intoxicating, but also people who don’t, which is painful. You’ll find some who get the jokes but hate them anyway and some who hate you without even bothering to watch. This doesn’t actually say much about humanity except that it is vast and varied. Yet, out of this data set, some comedians and their fans seem determined to gerrymander an epidemic of bowdlerization. "
"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. He was, to my mind, an ideal Republican candidate: a conservative Midwestern governor with a crusading political biography, access to big donors and a record unspoiled by service in Washington. I enjoyed predicting to my friends in New York that he’d be the Republican nominee, and watching their surprise that I wasn’t betting on Jeb. So it was with mixed feelings, in September 2015, that I reported a tip I got that Scott Walker was ending his campaign. I was on the Metro desk at the time but had kept up my relationships in Washington, and I teamed up with colleagues covering the primaries to confirm Mr. Walker’s surrender. It happened in a flash: I had my first scoop of the presidential race, and my political instincts were proved decisively wrong. In retrospect, it’s easy enough to see Mr. Walker as a hopeless candidate — a too-dull-for-television personality, obsessed with campaign mechanics and untutored in important matters of policy. So rapid was the onset of Mr. Walker’s irrelevance, he never even earned a scornful, Trump-authored nickname. (Sleepin’ Scott?) But blaming Mr. Walker alone — as gratifying as that might be — would miss a larger point. Like many political reporters, I’ve spent months reflecting on the arc of 2016, pondering where my coverage might have missed the mark and why. Many of the conventional explanations have been shallow and unsatisfying. It’s not the case, for instance, that the news media didn’t cover President Trump’s supporters or listen to their voices, or that reporters failed to visit the middle of the country. Scores of reporters have the datelines and airline receipts to prove it. "
"UNION CITY, N.J. — Senator Robert Menendez officially announced his intention to run for re-election at a raucous rally on Wednesday, a remarkable turn two months after federal prosecutors dismissed corruption charges against the New Jersey Democrat. With nearly every state Democratic luminary inside a packed high school gymnasium here, it was an unusual show of force for a candidate who already enjoys a considerable lead in early polling. In his kickoff speech, sometimes delivered in Spanish, Mr. Menendez vowed that he would continue to fight against President Trump’s agenda. “There is a president in Washington who spends his days dividing us and distracting us, but never delivering for us,” Mr. Menendez said, drawing some of his loudest cheers. In January, it was far from assured that Mr. Menendez would even be on the stage. For 11 weeks last year, the senator was a defendant in a federal corruption trial with headlines tracing the prosecution’s case, which accused him of abusing his office to help his friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor and political benefactor from Florida. But after jurors could not reach a verdict, the judge declared a mistrial and Mr. Menendez pronounced himself vindicated. Then the situation quickly changed. First, the Department of Justice announced that it would retry Mr. Menendez. Then the federal judge who oversaw the trial acquitted Mr. Menendez of several charges, severely hampering the retrial effort. Within days, the Department of Justice had dropped the case. "
"WASHINGTON — A lawyer for President Trump broached the idea of Mr. Trump’s pardoning two of his former top advisers, Michael T. Flynn and Paul Manafort, with their lawyers last year, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The discussions came as the special counsel was building cases against both men, and they raise questions about whether the lawyer, John Dowd, who resigned last week, was offering pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation. The talks suggest that Mr. Trump’s lawyers were concerned about what Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort might reveal were they to cut a deal with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in exchange for leniency. Mr. Mueller’s team could investigate the prospect that Mr. Dowd made pardon offers to thwart the inquiry, although legal experts are divided about whether such offers might constitute obstruction of justice. Mr. Dowd’s conversation with Mr. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, occurred sometime after Mr. Dowd took over last summer as the president’s personal lawyer, at a time when a grand jury was hearing evidence against Mr. Flynn on a range of potential crimes. Mr. Flynn, who served as Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, agreed in late November to cooperate with the special counsel’s investigation. He pleaded guilty in December to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and received favorable sentencing terms. Mr. Dowd has said privately that he did not know why Mr. Flynn had accepted a plea, according to one of the people. He said he had told Mr. Kelner that the president had long believed that the case against Mr. Flynn was flimsy and was prepared to pardon him, the person said. The pardon discussion with Mr. Manafort’s attorney, Reginald J. Brown, came before his client was indicted in October on charges of money laundering and other financial crimes. Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, has pleaded not guilty and has told others he is not interested in a pardon because he believes he has done nothing wrong and the government overstepped its authority. Mr. Brown is no longer his lawyer. "
"BEIJING — With a dose of mystery and the flair of a showman, North Korea’s young leader, Kim Jong-un, used his debut as an international statesman on Wednesday to present himself as confident, reasonable — and willing to bargain. Mr. Kim’s surprise two-day visit to Beijing, his first known trip abroad since taking power, was effectively a reminder of how much he has set the agenda in the crisis over his nation’s nuclear arsenal — and of what a strong hand he has going into talks, first with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea next month and later with President Trump. Mr. Kim has yet to say what concessions he is willing to make, or what he may demand from the United States in return. But he continued to dominate the diplomatic process, reaffirming his willingness to meet with Mr. Trump and repeating his vague commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in talks with President Xi Jinping of China, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency. During Mr. Trump’s first year in office, Mr. Kim raced ahead with breakthrough tests of missiles capable of hitting the United States mainland and what he claimed was a missile-ready hydrogen bomb. Then he abruptly changed course and used the Winter Olympics to seize the initiative, surprising the world with a rapprochement with the South and then an offer to meet with Mr. Trump. Through it all, the Trump administration has been largely relegated to reacting and catching up to Mr. Kim. And so it was again this week, when Mr. Kim suddenly showed up in China on an armored train and was shown beaming next to Mr. Xi, whose cooperation has been critical to Mr. Trump’s strategy of “maximum pressure” on the North. The state media in China and North Korea announced the meeting on Wednesday, after two days of secrecy. In images and in words, Mr. Kim and Mr. Xi signaled that they had repaired the relationship between their countries, which had soured as Mr. Kim had accelerated his nuclear program and Mr. Xi had responded by endorsing — and enforcing — more punishing sanctions proposed by the United States. "
"BEIJING — Kim Jong-un’s surprise visit to Beijing this week to meet President Xi Jinping added an element of intrigue to talks over North Korea’s nuclear program. It was also a propaganda opportunity for both men. For Mr. Xi, the meeting was a chance to cultivate an image as a peacemaker on the global stage. For Mr. Kim, it was an opportunity to signal membership in the club of world leaders. Here’s a look at how the Chinese and North Korean news media portrayed the meeting. In North Korea, Mr. Kim is often pictured alongside throngs of admirers who hang on and record his every word. But it was Mr. Kim who was taking notes during his meeting with Mr. Xi, at least in the Chinese news media coverage on Wednesday. Mr. Kim, 34, was shown scribbling on a piece of paper as Mr. Xi, 64, spoke of the need for close ties between their two countries. The images gave Mr. Xi the appearance of an elder statesman at a time when he has sought to expand China’s influence over global affairs. Ryan Hass, a former director for China at the National Security Council who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the coverage signaled that Beijing is “in control of a complex security challenge, serving as the center of international efforts to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula.” "
"SINGAPORE — Days before winning the election in 2016, Donald Trump stood on a stage and directed an accusation at a tiny country halfway across the world: Singapore, he said, was stealing American jobs. Singapore is now on the tip of Mr. Trump’s tongue again — but this time, he’s expressing admiration for its death penalty for drug trafficking. He has reportedly invited government representatives to brief the White House on their approach to drug trafficking, including their use of capital punishment. Mr. Trump seems to believe he can learn a thing or two from Singapore. This is convenient for the Singapore government, which has been using the global opioid crisis as an argument for the retention of capital punishment. While the American media reported Mr. Trump’s praise for Singapore’s “zero tolerance” stance, the country hanged a 39-year-old Ghanaian named Billy Agbozo on March 9, and a 56-year-old Singaporean, Hishamrudin bin Mohd, on March 16. Both had been convicted of drug trafficking. These are the first two executions of 2018, as far as we know; information about imminent executions is not made available, and the prison service announces the number of hangings only in its annual report. But the borrowing of ideas hasn’t been a one-way street: the government here has taken a page out of Mr. Trump’s book. The new Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods is holding public hearings to explore measures for tackling “fake news.” The committee is meant to examine a range of options, but there are strong hints that new restrictions on the media are on the way, not least because the law minister, who is also a member of the committee, has already said that legislation is a “no-brainer.” Mr. Trump constantly proclaims that his “America First” policy will prevent the United States from being taken for a ride by other countries, while Singapore denounces foreign interference in its domestic politics. Yet when the occasion suits, both are more than happy to borrow ideas from elsewhere to control their populations. Such opportunism is the hallmark of authoritarians constantly on the lookout for ways to consolidate or expand their power. Both governments claim they’re solving urgent problems: to get the opioid crisis in the United States under control, to pre-empt disinformation campaigns that might threaten Singapore’s stability. But neither proposed solution is likely to solve the problem, and might even make things worse. "

"Fifty years later, the 1968 presidential election and the Vietnam War still shadow American politics. But the war actually had little effect on the vote that November — even though surveys showed that Vietnam was by far the most important issue on voters’ minds, they saw little difference between the Republican nominee, Richard Nixon, and his Democratic opponent, Hubert H. Humphrey, both of whom they scored “slightly conservative” on the University of Michigan’s seven-point “Vietnam scale.” The real consequences of the election and the war were on the Democratic Party, with collateral effects on the Republicans. The Democrats’ united, confident and longstanding commitment to the spread of liberal values throughout the world eroded in the aftermath. Fragmented by internal divisions over the war, the party also overhauled its process for choosing presidential candidates in ways that upended its previous domination by Southerners, unions and big-city bosses. The decade had begun with the election of John F. Kennedy, whose main issue in the 1960 presidential campaign was the Cold War, which he believed America was losing to the Soviet Union. Kennedy pledged in his Inaugural Address to do whatever was necessary “to assure the survival and success of liberty,” a declaration that placed him squarely in the tradition of his party. Ever since Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt led the United States onto the world stage as a promoter of liberal values during the first half of the 20th century, most Democrats had been comfortable with this role. Indeed, an animating premise of Democratic liberalism was that the federal government has the ability to solve virtually any problem it chooses to take on, domestic or foreign. Soon after taking office, Kennedy began escalating American military involvement in Vietnam. In June 1961, following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, he told James Reston of The New York Times that “we have a problem in making our power credible” and “Vietnam is the place.” By November 1963, Kennedy had dispatched 16,300 military advisers to South Vietnam. As late as the morning of Nov. 22, he said, “Without the United States, South Vietnam would collapse overnight.” Assuming the presidency when Kennedy was assassinated a few hours later, Lyndon B. Johnson felt bound to continue his predecessor’s course. Less confident about Vietnam than he was about domestic matters, Johnson regularly asked the foreign policy advisers he inherited from Kennedy — chiefly Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, and his national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy — what Kennedy would have done, and then he did it. Their confident recommendation was that the American commitment to victory in Vietnam must be maintained. "
"Since the Parkland shootings in Florida, Senator Marco Rubio has done many of the things liberals say they are desperate, desperate for decent Republicans to do. He has changed his position on gun control, expressing support for new restrictions: age limits on gun purchases, new background check rules, possibly magazine restrictions. He has co-sponsored legislation encouraging states to issue restraining orders that temporarily would strip people deemed dangerous of their guns. Some of these measures have conservative support, but in other cases the Florida Republican has effectively bucked the N.R.A. But over the same period Rubio, more than any other prominent Republican, has been vigorously and sometimes virulently attacked by the student-led movement that filled D.C. with protesters last weekend. When he showed up for the CNN town hall he met boos and heckles; one of the shooting survivors told him that just looking at him was like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle. Notwithstanding his subsequent policy concessions, at the March for Our Lives the students wore price tags around their neck, $1.05 each — the amount of money Rubio’s campaigns have received from the N.R.A. divided by the number of students in Florida schools. David Hogg, one of their leaders, began his speech with the price tag line, and told a CNN interviewer that if anything he feels that their attacks on the Florida senator haven’t been provocative enough. There was a time, not so many years ago, when Rubio was attacked and his efforts at bipartisanship regarded skeptically because liberals perceived him as a threat — a plausible and eloquent leader for a less bunkered G.O.P., a bridge between the party’s old white base and a more multicultural America. That time has passed, at least for now: After Rubio was defeated and partially undone by Donald Trump, and especially after he turned in his #NeverTrump card and filmed a hostage-video endorsement, the official media consensus on the Florida senator flipped from “Great Republican Hope” to “Liddle Marco,” and anti-Rubio sentiment became dominated less by anxiety than by contempt. That contempt seems to inform some of the reaction to his every public utterance since Parkland. But I think that in their anti-Rubio zeal the student activists are also picking up on a general approach to politics that the Trump era has encouraged among liberals — a view that since the current Republican majorities were forged by anger and a kind of smash-mouth politics, it’s incumbent upon liberals to give no quarter in return, and to treat any sudden conciliation from a prominent figure like the Florida senator not as an opportunity for deal making but as a welcome sign of weakness that should inspire further fierce attack. This theory has a certain logic to it. Yes, if anti-gun activists spent less time screaming at him, Rubio’s efforts might open up a little more common ground on gun policy. But Rubio is only one senator, previous pushes for gun regulation have had Republican senatorial sponsors before dying by filibuster, and in 2013, when liberals were broadly favorable to his efforts, Rubio couldn’t deliver immigration reform because the Republican House wasn’t having it. The problem, then, is relying on the bipartisan impulses of few Republican politicians when what you need is a broader climate change. The path to that change requires first putting the fear of God (or, if you prefer, the fear of the Arc of History) into vulnerable Republican lawmakers, and then making them unpopular enough that you can simply beat them.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, made a surprise trip this week to meet with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Kim’s first trip abroad since taking power in 2011. Mr. Kim is preparing for summit meetings with U.S. and South Korean leaders, and the visit suggests that he values or needs China’s approval — and possibly advice — before the talks. New satellite images suggest that North Korea is expanding its nuclear production capabilities, which could complicate President Trump’s efforts to persuade Pyongyang to give up its weapons. • The U.S. and South Korea are to announce a bilateral trade agreement today. It’s the type of deal that Mr. Trump says benefits American workers, but it may have more to do with geopolitical realities. • Fearing an undercount, at least a dozen states signaled on Tuesday that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Opponents say the question would dissuade noncitizens, and even legal immigrants, from answering. The Trump administration says it’s needed for accurate estimates of voter numbers. "

"WASHINGTON — In the final months of the Obama administration, the Justice Department announced a new approach to preparing prisoners for life beyond their cells. Officials created a prison school system, pledged money for technology training and promised to help prevent former inmates from returning to prison. Almost immediately after taking office, Trump administration officials began undoing their work. Budgets were slashed, the school system was scrapped and studies were shelved as Attorney General Jeff Sessions brought to bear his tough-on-crime philosophy and deep skepticism of Obama-era crime-fighting policies. Now, nearly a year and a half later, the White House has declared that reducing recidivism and improving prisoner education is a top priority — echoing some of the very policies it helped dismantle. This whiplash approach to federal prison policy reflects the tension between Jared Kushner, the president’s reform-minded son-in-law and senior adviser, and Mr. Sessions, a hard-liner whose views on criminal justice were forged at the height of the drug war. It has left both Democratic and Republican lawmakers confused and has contributed to skepticism that the Trump administration is serious about its own proposals. On Capitol Hill, a wholesale reconsideration of American sentencing laws and prison policies has bipartisan support. Dozens of senators have sponsored a bill to change mandatory-minimum sentences and ease drug laws that have been used to seek lengthy sentences for nonviolent offenders. The bill also includes provisions to expand education, worker training and drug rehabilitation programs in prison. Mr. Kushner, administration officials say, supports such sweeping change. Mr. Sessions is adamantly opposed. The two men reached a compromise in recent months: Mr. Kushner could push for the prison changes, but Mr. Sessions would position the administration strongly against a broader overhaul. "
"PELHAM, N.Y. — Dr. Andrew Mutnick closely follows national politics, and has even gone door-knocking for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. But he admits he was caught off guard by the political landscape of his own backyard. It was not until Donald J. Trump won the presidency that Dr. Mutnick, a pediatrician with offices in Manhattan and Westchester County, learned that his own Democratic state senator, Jeffrey D. Klein, had been empowering Republicans in Albany. “I’m like, ‘Jeez, what? Really? Where have I been?’” he recalled thinking after discovering Mr. Klein’s leadership of a group of eight Democrats who have a power-sharing arrangement with Republicans in the State Senate. “I thought that if I didn’t know about this, I bet a lot of people don’t know,” Dr. Mutnick said. “It’s an incredibly insidious arrangement that is very difficult to untangle and understand.” Across the nation, a backlash to the Trump agenda is underway, especially among angry suburban voters like Dr. Mutnick. The latest example surfaced earlier this month in a Pennsylvania congressional special election, where Conor Lamb, a Democrat, defeated his Republican opponent in a district outside Pittsburgh that Mr. Trump had won by 20 percentage points. In New York, Democrats are mostly focused on unseating six Republican members of the congressional delegation. But for some, merely targeting Republicans is not enough; Mr. Klein’s group, the Independent Democratic Conference, is now fair game because it is viewed as an enabler to Republican rule — helping them control the State Senate even though Democrats hold a numerical majority.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Trevor Noah is not impressed by John R. Bolton, President Trump’s new pick for national security adviser. Bolton is known for his hard-line right-wing views, and he’s one of the few prominent members of the foreign-policy intelligentsia who still vociferously defend the United States’ 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2015, Bolton criticized President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran in an opinion article for The New York Times suggesting that the United States should launch pre-emptive strikes against Iran. On “The Daily Show” on Tuesday, Noah quoted from an interview Bolton gave to Fox News shortly after writing that article. Meanwhile, Stephen Colbert poked fun at Bolton’s prodigious facial hair and implied that Trump was probably expecting Bolton to play the role of a yes-man. Colbert sat down with Samantha Bee, who had traveled to Washington over the weekend to attend the March for Our Lives. Bee said she was stirred by the young people she met protesting, adding that when she was young, her hobbies were a bit more unsavory than theirs. “I was stealing cars when I was 15, 16 years old,” she admitted. “I was terrible.” Colbert was stupefied to hear that.

"BEIJING — China accused the deal maker who bought the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York of bilking investors of more than $10 billion. The vast amount of money that officials said the deal maker, Wu Xiaohui, had obtained illegally raised the stakes in a prosecution meant to show Beijing’s resolve to crack down on the titanic borrowing binge of recent years. The Chinese government last month seized Mr. Wu’s company, Anbang Insurance Group, in a move seen as making an example of a firm that piled on too much debt too fast and added risks to the country’s already creaky financial system. The $10.3 billion that prosecutors allege that Mr. Wu and Anbang raised illegally would make the case one of China’s biggest financial crimes trials. Mr. Wu pleaded guilty to the charges and asked the court for a light sentence, according to an account of the proceedings posted late Wednesday on the official social media account of the court in Shanghai where he is standing trial. He is almost certain to be found guilty, as Chinese courts convict nearly everyone prosecutors accuse. His plea was a turnabout from what the court had earlier described as a more defiant stance. Earlier on Wednesday, the court had said Mr. Wu had told the court that he did not know whether what he did constituted a crime, suggesting he would fight the charges. Mr. Wu had also denied charges that he had instructed his employees to escape abroad, to change their computers and mobile phones and to delete emails, financial data and corporate records once officials began investigating Anbang in March 2017, according to the court. Lawyers for the tycoon could not be reached for comment. The court in Shanghai released only a partial accounting of the proceedings online, and an independent description of them was not available. In China, such proceedings are typically closed to foreign news media. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that the Second Amendment — the right to keep and bear arms — “will never be repealed,” responding to an opinion piece written by a retired Supreme Court justice who called for just that. Mr. Trump’s declaration in an early morning tweet came after days of silence on the subject, despite student-organized  marches around the country over the weekend calling for more gun control. On Tuesday, the retired Justice John Paul Stevens wrote an Op-Ed  in The New York Times calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. “Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday,” Mr. Stevens wrote. “These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.” Repealing the Second Amendment would have to be approved by Congress, and there are no signs that such a move is underway.

"At least for a night, America said it really did want more “Roseanne.” The revival of the vintage ABC sitcom got off to an enormously strong start on Tuesday night, drawing 18.2 million viewers and a 5.1 rating among adults under 50, according to Nielsen. The “Roseanne” numbers rank as the highest total of any comedy on the broadcast networks since the 2014 season premiere of “The Big Bang Theory.” For comparison’s sake, NBC’s reboot of “Will & Grace” in September drew a little over 10 million viewers and a 3.0 rating among 18- to 49-year-olds. Earlier this month, ABC’s revival of “American Idol” reached an audience of 10.3 million viewers and scored a 2.3 rating in the prize demographic. Both debuts were cause for celebration at both broadcast networks. The “Roseanne” numbers, however, are in an entirely different category and stand to grow when delayed viewing is factored in. Many TV industry executives were divided on whether or not a new version of “Roseanne” would take off. Though the industry has been in a reboot craze for the last two years (series like “Full House,” “Twin Peaks,” “The X-Files,” “One Day at a Time” and “Murphy Brown,” have all been brought back to life), the results have ranged from “meh” to solid. Unlike those shows, “Roseanne” has seemingly appealed to viewers for reasons having nothing to do with nostalgia: In interviews leading up to the sitcom’s premiere, the show’s Emmy-winning star, Roseanne Barr, made it clear that she was a supporter of President Trump and let it be known that her program would grapple with a hot political moment that has divided some American families.

"You may be reeling from revelations that the private Facebook data of millions unwittingly got in the hands of a voter-profiling firm with ties to President Trump. And you may be weighing the pros and cons of deleting your social media accounts altogether. But before you go there, ask yourself a simpler question: Why do you hoard so much data on social networks in the first place? For many of us, our timeline of posts has piled up since we signed up for Facebook and Twitter. While the social networks portray their products as time capsules of your fondest memories and conversations, the experience of poring through past posts is more like rummaging through a digital junk drawer of good, bad and ugly moments. And the hoarded data is just sitting out there for others to see, including potential employers who are doing background checks and any enemies who may be trying to dig up something against us. So why keep eternal timelines? I posed my question to Zizi Papacharissi, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Chicago who teaches courses on social media. She said many of us leave up our timeline of posts because Facebook and Twitter don’t make it simple to clean them up. There’s no button to set ablaze a large swath of content, like a year’s worth or even a month’s worth of posts. So we leave everything, including silly comments from our college years and rants we made when we were angry about politics or other matters. “If you say something online, it has a different kind of permanence,” Ms. Papacharissi cautioned. “It’s always there to haunt you.” So over the last two months, I decided to do something different by trying to erase that permanence. Specifically, I used web tools to eradicate the vast majority of my Facebook and Twitter posts. Those turned out to be impractical and tedious to use — though automated, the programs were flawed and missed many posts after several attempts. The chore took about five hours, spread out over weeks. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. • Confident, reasonable — willing to bargain. That’s how North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, came across in his debut as a global statesman — and he did so with a dash of mystery. Here’s how the Chinese and North Korean news media portrayed the meeting with President Xi Jinping. Mr. Kim’s two-day visit — his first trip abroad since taking power — was a reminder of how much he has set the agenda in the North Korean nuclear crisis and, our correspondent writes, what a strong hand he has going into negotiations. President Trump was quick to chime in.

"It has been my greatest professional honor to serve our country’s more than 20 million veterans. Almost three years ago, I left my private sector job running hospitals and came to Washington to repay my gratitude to the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country. I believe strongly in the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and nothing about my political experience in Washington could ever change that. I also believe that maintaining a strong V.A. is an essential piece of the puzzle that is the United States’ national security system: We can only expect our sons and daughters to risk their lives and fight for our freedom if we can keep our promise to care for them when they return home broken, injured or traumatized. There is no excuse for not holding up our end of the bargain. The mission set forth by President Abraham Lincoln to care for those who have “borne the battle” is a sacred duty that I will remain committed to always. During my tenure at the department, we have accomplished a tremendous amount. We passed critical legislation that improved the appeals process for veterans seeking disability benefits, enacted a new G.I. Bill and helped ensure that we employ the right people to work at the department. We have expanded access to health care by reducing wait times, increasing productivity and working more closely with the private sector. We have put in place more and better mental health services for those suffering from the invisible wounds of war. We are now processing more disability claims and appeals than ever before and, for the first time, allowing veterans to see the status of their appeals by simply logging on to their accounts. Unemployment among veterans is near its lowest level in years, at 3.5 percent, and the percent of veterans who have regained trust in V.A. services has risen to 70 percent, from 46 percent four years ago. It seems that these successes within the department have intensified the ambitions of people who want to put V.A. health care in the hands of the private sector. I believe differences in philosophy deserve robust debate, and solutions should be determined based on the merits of the arguments. The advocates within the administration for privatizing V.A. health services, however, reject this approach. They saw me as an obstacle to privatization who had to be removed. That is because I am convinced that privatization is a political issue aimed at rewarding select people and companies with profits, even if it undermines care for veterans. Until the past few months, veteran issues were dealt with in a largely bipartisan way. (My 100-0 Senate confirmation was perhaps the best evidence that the V.A. has been the exception to Washington’s political polarization.) Unfortunately, the department has become entangled in a brutal power struggle, with some political appointees choosing to promote their agendas instead of what’s best for veterans. These individuals, who seek to privatize veteran health care as an alternative to government-run V.A. care, unfortunately fail to engage in realistic plans regarding who will care for the more than 9 million veterans who rely on the department for life-sustaining care.

"President Trump made a personal phone call on Wednesday to a political supporter with a huge megaphone — Roseanne Barr. Mr. Trump called Ms. Barr to congratulate her on the revival of her comedy, “Roseanne,” and to thank her for her support. The call was confirmed by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. The president, an obsessive about how TV shows perform, was enthralled by the “huge” ratings “Roseanne” had received, said a person familiar with the call. The show’s first episode, broadcast Tuesday evening on ABC, averaged 18.2 million viewers. “Roseanne,” featuring a working-class family of five and assorted relatives, returned to the air this week more than two decades after it ended its run. The lead actress’s character plays a backer of Mr. Trump. (Roseanne’s TV sister, Jackie Harris, by contrast, supports Hillary Clinton, though ultimately voted for Jill Stein.) Ms. Barr herself has been a vocal defender of Mr. Trump. In an interview with The New York Times published Tuesday, Ms. Barr said that she decided to turn her character, Roseanne Conner, into a Trump supporter because she felt it was an “accurate portrayal” of the political preferences of many working-class Americans. “I just wanted to have that dialogue about families torn apart by the election and their political differences of opinion and how we handle it,” she said. “I thought that this was an important thing to say at this time.” Ms. Barr defended the president at several points in the interview, objecting to a suggestion that he opposes many of the views that she and Roseanne Conner have espoused over the years, like support for abortion rights, same-sex marriage and organized labor. Mr. Trump used to back abortion rights before running for president as a Republican, but he has never supported same-sex marriage. “I think he voices them quite well,” she said of the stances that the president shares with her — and her character. She insisted that Mr. Trump favored same-sex marriage, even though he has never endorsed its legalization. “He has said it several times, you know, that he’s not homophobic at all,” she said. Ms. Barr did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday night. "

"PEORIA, Ariz. — With allegations of sexual misconduct swirling around President Trump, Debbie Lesko — a Republican candidate for Congress — sat down recently and clicked on “60 Minutes.” There was Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, saying that she had hidden a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump out of fear for her safety. Ms. Lesko, an ally of Mr. Trump’s, listened. And after, she said she found Ms. Clifford’s story “a little hard to believe.” “The business that she’s in — I’m sorry,” Ms. Lesko said. “People can make any kind of allegations they want, that doesn’t mean they’re true.” Here in Arizona, Ms. Lesko is in the final stretch of a special House race in the state’s deeply conservative Eighth Congressional District, which is being watched as a test of Mr. Trump’s popularity and as a possible foretelling of the fall midterm elections. The seat came open after the incumbent was caught in a sex scandal of his own. "
"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department’s inspector general, facing increasing political pressure from Republicans in Congress and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said on Wednesday that his office would investigate the surveillance of a former Trump campaign official. The announcement came amid a stream of attacks in recent months from the White House and Republican lawmakers seeking to undermine the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, said he would examine whether law enforcement officials complied with the law and departmental policies in seeking permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap the former campaign adviser, Carter Page. Law enforcement officials had long had concerns that Mr. Page, a former investment banker based in Moscow, was acting as a Russian agent. Republicans have seized on details about the court-ordered surveillance of Mr. Page as evidence that the Justice Department abused its authority in the Russia investigation. Mr. Horowitz did not name Mr. Page in his announcement. Mr. Horowitz said he would also review what the Justice Department and the F.B.I. knew at the time about a former British spy and longtime F.B.I. source, Christopher Steele, who provided information about Mr. Page that was included in the surveillance application. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision but acknowledged that it fell short of demands by three Republican committee chairmen that the Justice Department appoint a second special counsel to investigate the accusations of surveillance abuses.

"Trade pacts typically require years of detailed negotiations. The North American Free Trade Agreement needed two years. Creation of the World Trade Organization took eight. The Trump administration wants to remake global trade in a matter of months. To secure agreements quickly, the White House has taken a contentious approach to negotiations not seen in decades, threatening allies and adversaries alike with harsh sanctions like tariffs and quotas. Those tactics have returned a few early concessions from trading partners, including South Korea, whose revised trade agreement was formally announced by the United States on Wednesday. But it remains to be seen how much American workers would benefit from these deals and whether the global trading system can sustain the chaos. President Trump and his chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, have set a series of crucial deadlines that are rapidly approaching. Temporary exemptions on imports of steel and aluminum from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea have been scheduled to expire on May 1, and the Trump administration has been using that deadline as a cudgel to extract concessions from those nations. Mr. Trump is demanding that Canada and Mexico, which have been locked in tense, monthslong negotiations with the United States over Nafta, agree to a rewrite of the trade pact in a matter of weeks. He is seeking Europe’s support by then in a trade showdown with China, and has publicly questioned whether the United States will continue to accept a deal made long ago that allows the European Union to charge a tariff on imported cars that is four times as high as the United States’ tariff. In what might be the most difficult trade fight ahead, the Trump administration is taking steps to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion a year worth of goods from China as soon as late April. "
"NDONGA, Central African Republic — This remote village doesn’t have an official school, and there’s no functioning government to build one. So the villagers, desperate to improve their children’s lives, used branches and leaves to construct their own dirt-floor schoolhouse. It has no electricity, windows or desks, and it doesn’t keep out rain or beetles, but it does imbue hope, discipline and dreams. The 90 pupils sitting on bamboo benches could tutor world leaders about the importance of education — even if the kids struggle with the most basic challenges. “It’s hard to learn without a paper or pen,” Bertrand Golbé, a parent who turned himself into a teacher, acknowledged with a laugh. “But this is the way we have to do it. “They never have had breakfast when they arrive,” Golbé added. “They’re hungry. It’s difficult.” Yet the students do learn, here in one of the poorest countries in the world: They spoke French with me, and some were doing real geometry when I happened to drop in. One student, Doria Seleyanca, 13, said that his father had been killed in the warfare that has engulfed Central African Republic for 14 years, and his family doesn’t have much. “I eat one meal a day,” he explained stoically. Doria said he wanted to grow up to be a teacher — and he knew that an education was the only ticket to a better life. "
"It often seems that there is no end to President Trump’s cruel determination to transform America into a country that divides and dehumanizes its people. After his denigration of Muslims, refugees and undocumented immigrants, the latest example of this disgraceful proclivity is a presidential policy banning most transgender people from serving in the military — the second attempt to do so in less than a year. It puts thousands of servicemen and servicewomen at risk of losing their careers and means countless others may never get a chance to put on the uniform. The policy Mr. Trump announced Friday states, “Transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service,” unless the Pentagon grants an exception. This exacerbates uncertainties about how such a policy would be enforced and “makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome,” the American Civil Liberties Union said. The policy can’t yet take effect because federal courts have issued temporary injunctions that stay the ban on transgender service members that Mr. Trump abruptly decreed in a series of tweets last July, without consulting the nation’s top generals. Transgender Americans first secured the right to defend their nation as equals in 2016, under President Barack Obama, who made gender identity a protected category in the Pentagon’s equal opportunity policy. Mr. Trump’s announcement last summer was an attempt to reverse that Obama-era policy — and a clear effort to pander to Vice President Mike Pence, other right-wing zealots and regressive generals. The United States “will not accept or allow” transgender people in the military “in any capacity,” Mr. Trump tweeted at the time. The president, who avoided fighting in the Vietnam War by getting five deferments, also suggested that transgender enlistees are unfit to serve, tweeting that the military “must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.” In October, after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked the move and said the ban was probably unconstitutional, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to find a way to carry out a version of the ban, and in February, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis provided a recommendation. Mr. Mattis, a former Marine general, said that there were “substantial risks” related to transgender people who serve in the military and that allowing some of them to serve would amount to an exemption from certain mental, physical and sex-based standards, potentially undermining troops’ readiness and disrupting unit cohesion. "
"WASHINGTON — As the White House prepares to levy punishing tariffs on an array of Chinese goods, it is planning a much more strategic strike against China’s dominance in cutting-edge technology by restricting investment in American innovation. The Trump administration is preparing to limit Chinese investment in sensitive American technology, ranging from microchips to 5G wireless technology, as it tries to prevent China from gaining an edge in industries projected to power the global economy for decades. After years of tough restrictions on American companies trying to operate in China, including coercing the transfer of proprietary technology, the White House is looking to subject China to similar investment hurdles in the United States. To do so, the Treasury Department is considering using a powerful law generally reserved for national emergencies, according to administration officials. The 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was used to place sanctions on other countries after the Sept. 11 attacks, gives the president broad authority to respond to an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” including by halting incoming Chinese transactions, nullifying business deals and freezing foreign-owned assets. Matt Gold, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the statute has allowed the United States to impose economic sanctions on nations like Iran and Sudan and tends “to involve restrictions on U.S. firms investing in those countries or doing business with firms of those countries.” Using the law to restrict investment from China would allow the president to “block transactions to move funds, dispose of assets or otherwise do business,” Mr. Gold said. That would be a significant broadening of America’s existing power when it comes to foreign investment. The United States has broad export controls on sensitive technologies, and it reviews international mergers through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which can recommend that the president block foreign investments that pose a threat to national security.

"Which would you rather have, a Donald Trump Wall or a Donald Trump Military Parade? No fair saying neither. Trump’s been pushing hard for both, and sooner or later the man has to win something. So if you had to choose, which way would you go? A. Parade, but there should be floats. B. Wall, but maybe around Mar-a-Lago. C. I don’t care as long as he doesn’t bomb anybody. Reasonable answers! And I’ll give you an advance hint of how it’s working out: The wall option is toast. Congress passed its big spending package last week, and the president’s request for wall money was ignored like a burp at a dinner party. All Trump got was $1.6 billion for stuff like fence repair. “I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill” Trump tweeted, complaining that “the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.” “Not fully funded” is a euphemism for “totally ignored.” Twittering Trump also bitterly complained that Congress had not done anything about DACA reform — protection for the people who were brought here illegally as children. That was, indeed, strange on two points. You’d think the Democrats would have tried to do something. But the Dreamers are safe now because of court orders, and their supporters think they’ve got more time to work the problem out. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s latest effort at banning transgender individuals from serving in the military amounts to what legal experts said is essentially a reprise of an all-too-familiar directive at the Pentagon: the 1994 “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. A slew of medical and legal professionals have already lined up against the newest White House order, issued late Friday night, which experts said may survive only if it is backed by the Supreme Court. That order is based on recommendations outlined by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in a Feb. 22 memo on the circumstances under which transgender people would be allowed to join or remain in the military. The memo by Mr. Mattis disqualified all people “who require or have undergone gender transition.” But he also recommended that, going forward, “transgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all service members, in their biological sex.” Gender dysphoria is the psychological condition of a person’s discomfort with their biological gender. The memo said that transgender troops who would be grandfathered into the system — under an Obama administration policy that allowed them to serve — could be discharged from the military if they continue to challenge the recommendations in courts. Supporters of transgender rights said the recommendations echoed “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which was repealed in 2010 after 17 years of requiring gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in the military to keep their sexuality a secret.

"To the Editor: President Trump’s inaction in handling the opioid epidemic (“Mr. Trump’s Bluster on Opioids,” editorial, March 21) is heartbreaking. The point of “draining the swamp” was to more effectively address problems that career politicians neglected, with the overprescription of opioids being a prime example. Instead, we have a president who would rather project the image of improvement than actually institute effective changes. This is also seen in the issue of infrastructure, which Mr. Trump is happy to let fall by the wayside, knowing that his base wants him to build an impractical border wall instead. His solutions for the opioid problem reflect his desire for brash and dramatic “solutions”; his proposal to arm teachers occupies the same world as his call to execute drug dealers. What’s heartbreaking is that there are sensible, boring ways to fix such problems but that Mr. Trump most likely will never put them to use.

"The many Americans now cheering President Trump’s willingness to fight a trade war with China no doubt believe that trade in recent years with that Asian nation has destroyed too many American jobs. Not long ago an academic paper by the economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson garnered an unusual amount of public attention because of its estimate that trade with China from 1999 to 2011 destroyed 2.4 million jobs in the United States. Our anxiety about trade-related job loss is not confined to China. Just a few weeks ago Mr. Trump declared that the North American Free Trade Agreement caused a “massive relocation of companies and jobs.” On Nafta’s 20th anniversary, in 2014, the trade skeptic Lori Wallach complained that the agreement had destroyed one million American jobs. These estimates of jobs destroyed by trade sound big, but they’re actually tiny. Relative to overall routine job destruction and creation — “job churn” — the number of American jobs destroyed by trade is minuscule. In January alone, the number of American workers who were laid off or dismissed from their jobs was 1.8 million. The number of workers who quit their jobs that month was 3.3 million. Adding in workers who left their jobs for other reasons, such as retirement and disability, the number of job separations in January was 5.4 million. But there were 5.6 million hires in January, too. Those numbers are typical of most months. Awareness of job churn should calm Americans’ fears about imports. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data on monthly nonfarm discharges and layoffs since September 2006. Unsurprisingly, this number peaked during the Great Recession, at 2.57 million in January 2009. But even excluding the recession months, the monthly average number of workers in the United States who lose their jobs is around 1.75 million. In a normal year, then, the number of workers laid off or dismissed averages 21 million. Compared with the number of total annual job losses, therefore, job losses from trade shrink into insignificance. "

"Repairs on the Staten Island Expressway. Vegetables for nutritional programs in the Bronx. Programs for seniors in Manhattan and Queens. New schools in Brooklyn. The $7 billion from the federal government that funds all these aspects of New York life could be affected by one question on the 2020 census: Are you a United States citizen? That question is provoking fear among the city’s elected officials, who worry that because of its inclusion on the census questionnaire, some immigrants may decline to participate. Census information is not supposed to be shared with other parts of the government, but the Trump administration has said that all undocumented immigrants are subject to deportation, leading many to say they do not trust what the government will do with their information. Immigrants or children of immigrants make up nearly 60 percent of the city’s population, and the ripple effect could be powerful. Officials are concerned that could lead to an inaccurate population count in New York. “People have identified this as an immigrant problem, and that’s really not accurate,” said Joseph J. Salvo, the chief demographer for the Department of City Planning. The city’s education department comes to him for the data it uses to redraw school zones, he said, as does the health department when it needs to understand illness rates.

Last week, lawmakers in Washington took a significant step toward addressing climate change. They just didn’t call it that. Buried in the $1.3 trillion spending bill passed by Congress and grudgingly signed by President Trump were surprisingly large increases in funding for clean energy programs at the Department of Energy. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has helped reduce the cost of solar power, got a 14 percent bump. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which funds long-shot technologies like algae biofuels, got a 16 percent increase. The Office of Nuclear Energy got a 19 percent increase. "
"As environmental concerns drive power companies away from using coal, natural gas has emerged as the nation’s No. 1 power source. Plentiful and relatively inexpensive as a result of the nation’s fracking boom, it has been portrayed as a bridge to an era in which alternative energy would take primacy. But technology and economics have carved a different, shorter pathway that has bypassed the broad need for some fossil-fuel plants. And that has put proponents of natural gas on the defensive. Some utility companies have scrapped plans for new natural-gas plants in favor of wind and solar sources that have become cheaper and easier to install. Existing gas plants are being shut because their economics are no longer attractive. And regulators are increasingly challenging the plans of companies determined to move forward with new natural-gas plants. “It’s a very different world that we’re arriving at very quickly,” said Robert McCullough, an energy consultant in Portland, Ore. “That wind farm can literally be put on a train and brought online within a year. It is moving so fast that even critics of the old path like myself have been taken by surprise.” The shifting dynamics are being seen in the Western states in particular — driven not only by economics, but by regulation and climate as well. The Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates the state’s investor-owned utilities, recently refused to endorse plans by three power companies that included more natural-gas facilities. Commissioners directed them to make greater use of energy storage and plants that produce zero emissions. "
"WASHINGTON — After weeks of uncertainty atop the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Trump dismissed its secretary, David J. Shulkin, on Wednesday and announced he would replace him with the White House physician, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. If confirmed, Dr. Jackson, a career Naval officer who has no real experience running a large bureaucracy, would inherit a set of challenges that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican administrations alike. The department, the federal government’s second largest, has been burdened for years by aging infrastructure, an inefficient health care system and an unwieldy 360,000-person work force. He could also quickly face crucial, multibillion-dollar decisions over the replacement of its outdated computerized records system and legislation that would ease the rules around veterans seeking private health care at government expense. The announcement punctuated what has been a rapid fall from favor for Dr. Shulkin, a politically moderate former hospital executive who delivered Mr. Trump a string of bipartisan legislative victories at a time when he was struggling to find them. But in his final weeks, he struggled to fight off attempts by more conservative administration officials to have him removed and was dogged by an unflattering inspector general report on his overseas travel that undermined his relationship with the president. Dr. Shulkin’s departure was the latest chapter in the remaking of Mr. Trump’s team of senior advisers, a shake-up that has led to the replacement of the secretary of state, the director of the C.I.A. and the national security adviser, along with White House aides. In the midst of that turmoil, Dr. Jackson, 50, who was named to his current position by President Barack Obama in 2013, has grown close with Mr. Trump, a commander in chief who enjoys familiar faces in his orbit and often rewards them with new roles.

"Until last week, the comedian and television creator Donald Glover was working on an animated series for FX about the Marvel superhero Deadpool, a violent mercenary character known for his wisecracks and toilet humor. By this week, the project had been canceled and Mr. Glover was on Twitter publicly raising more questions about what led to his departure from the show. The project, planned as a 10-episode run for the FXX channel and announced in May, was to have been a collaboration with Mr. Glover’s brother Stephen, another pairing of the siblings behind the show “Atlanta,” which airs on FX. (FXX is FX’s sister channel, and both are owned by 21st Century Fox.) But on Saturday, FX, citing “creative differences,” announced that the project had been canceled. Its statement said the Glovers had agreed to part ways with the network and with Marvel television. In an article about the announcement, Variety said the show “may have been a casualty of Donald Glover’s packed schedule.” Mr. Glover, who also releases music under the name Childish Gambino, disputed that characterization in a tweet thread on Wednesday: “For the record: I wasn’t too busy to work on ‘Deadpool,’” he said.

"At the end of a recent Sunday service, the congregants at the Fourth Universalist Society on Central Park West placed their hands on the shoulders of a woman who stood in the center of the church. Then other members reached forward to touch those people’s shoulders, until the entire congregation was linked by touch like a radiating star. It was a symbol of their commitment to put the woman, Aura Hernandez, 37, an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant, at the center of their church’s life for what may be months or even years to come. Two weeks ago, Ms. Hernandez moved into a worn former office at the historic Upper West Side church with her 15-month-old daughter, Camila, to avoid deportation to Guatemala. In doing so, she joins about 40 other immigrants around the nation who are being publicly shielded by houses of worship. She vows to remain there, without going outside, until her immigration status changes. “I don’t intend to stand here with my arms crossed, and do nothing,” Ms. Hernandez said in Spanish at the church on Tuesday, about her goal in seeking sanctuary. “I have to stand up and raise my voice because an injustice is being committed to me and to us. I think I’m here for a reason.” With help from other houses of worship and volunteers, this 130-member congregation will feed Ms. Hernandez, do the family’s laundry, and help care for Camila, who is a U.S. citizen and can go outside. They will buy new carpet and paint for her room, and welcome Ms. Hernandez’s 10-year-old son, Daniel, to live there on weekends and when the school year ends. Daniel, also born in the United States, is living in Westchester County with Ms. Hernandez’s husband, who also is undocumented. It is a difficult situation, but the members of the Fourth Universalist, who met Ms. Hernandez at the March 18 service, said they were excited about being asked for help. Their Unitarian Universalist denomination calls for the use of social action to advance progressive principles, they explained. So for them, this is a unique opportunity. "
"DAKAR, Senegal — Thousands of Ghanaians rallied in the streets of their capital on Wednesday to protest a deal that would give the United States military an expanded role in Ghana. As part of the agreement struck last week, the United States would invest about $20 million in equipment and training for the Ghanaian military, carrying out joint exercises with Ghana and using the nation’s radio channels and runways. Ghanaian officials said the agreement was an extension of a two-decades-long relationship between the United States and Ghana, a West African nation that has been a regular host of bilateral and multilateral military exercises. “It’s the same arrangement we’ve had in times past,” said Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, the deputy minister of information. He said that resistance to the deal was largely driven by the political motivations of opposition lawmakers. But the deal struck a nerve in Ghana, which is in a region where the expansion of the American military has received increasing scrutiny. In Accra, the capital, more than 3,000 people gathered in the streets to protest the agreement. “Having partaken in the struggle and fight towards our independence, we can never sit unconcerned when it comes to an agreement which has the tendency of compromising our sovereignty and integrity,” said Frank Amoako Hene, president of the National Union of Ghana Students, who was among the protesters.

"To the Editor: Re “At Least 12 States Ready to Sue U.S. Over the Census” (front page, March 28): Basic civil disobedience 101: Every resident of the United States — documented and undocumented alike — should refuse to answer any citizenship question on the census. The addition of this question after decades can be nothing but a blatant effort by an administration hostile to undocumented (read: brown) residents to locate and deport them, and to rig congressional districts in favor of Republicans. As with many impulsive and ham-handed decisions by this administration, it is simply a means to an end without consideration of collateral consequences. Here, populations (who are not going anywhere) will be undercounted and could lose funding for trivial things like education, health care and basic civic services as well as their fair and proportionate political representation. We need an accurate count. The Constitution demands it. JOANNE POLVY COHEN
SHERMAN OAKS, CALIF. To the Editor: The Constitution specifically requires a census count of “persons,” not “citizens,” and this unrestricted count of “persons” was specifically intended and constitutionally insulated to protect the states in their then-sovereign prerogative (pre-Dred Scott) to decide who would have the right to vote. If the Constitution had counted citizens, it would have left out slaves. If the Constitution had not counted persons, it would have prevented slaves from being counted as three-fifths “of all other persons” for purposes of increasing the number of representatives that slave states would have in Congress.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is attempting to scale back federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws, freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses, including Facebook, while sidelining officials who have aggressively pursued civil rights cases. The policy shift, detailed in interviews with 20 current and former Department of Housing and Urban Development officials and in internal agency emails, is meant to roll back the Obama administration’s attempts to reverse decades of racial, ethnic and income segregation in federally subsidized housing and development projects. The move coincides with the decision this month by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, to strike the words “inclusive” and “free from discrimination” from HUD’s mission statement. But Mr. Carson dismissed the idea he was abandoning the agency’s fair housing mission as “nonsense” in a memo to the department’s staff earlier this year, and reiterated that point during recent congressional hearings. A spokesman for the agency, Jereon Brown, said any programmatic changes are part of the routine recalibration undertaken from administration to administration, rather than a philosophical shift. Advocates for the poor and career HUD officials say that Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, and his political appointees have begun weakening the department’s fair housing division at a critical moment. The agency now has its greatest leverage to right past wrongs thanks to the $28 billion in disaster recovery Community Development Block Grants that Congress has appropriated to rebuild the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. In an email in November, a top HUD official relayed the news that the head of the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity division, Anna Maria Farías, had ordered a hold on about a half-dozen fair housing investigations given the highest priority under Mr. Carson’s most recent predecessor, Julián Castro. The freeze would be in effect “until further notice,” the official wrote. The investigations, known as “secretary-initiated cases” to indicate their importance, had been used in the past to set precedent and to put other localities and developers on notice. "
"Ecuador’s government said Wednesday that it had suspended internet access for Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who since 2012 has lived in Ecuador’s Embassy in London, out of concern that he was harming its relationships with Britain and other European nations. The decision set off a furious reaction from some Assange supporters. One of them, Kim Dotcom, an online renegade who founded a file-sharing site, urged supporters to gather outside the embassy in protest. The filmmaker Oliver Stone wrote on Twitter: “Free Julian Assange! Restore his internet connection!” Ecuador’s government granted Mr. Assange citizenship in January, the latest step in a longstanding diplomatic standoff. But it said it had suspended Mr. Assange’s online communications on Tuesday because he had imperiled “the good relations that the country maintains with the United Kingdom, with the rest of the states of the European Union, and other nations” through his social-media messages. The government did not provide specifics, but some speculated that the decision might have been related to the Western nations’ coordinated actions against Russia after the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. In a series of Twitter posts this week, Mr. Assange was critical of Western nations’ expulsions of Russian diplomats. The agendas of WikiLeaks and Russia have dovetailed at times, whether by coincidence or intent. In July 2016, WikiLeaks published nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails that had been hacked by the Russian government, embarrassing the party’s nominee, Hillary Clinton. In November, it emerged that Donald Trump Jr. had online conversations with WikiLeaks during his father’s campaign. Two Assange supporters — the English rock musician Brian Eno and the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis — speculated that Ecuador was reacting to tweets in which Mr. Assange criticized the Spanish government’s detention of Catalan separatists and the recent arrest, in Germany, of the separatist leader Carles Puigdemont. They called efforts to isolate Mr. Assange “appalling.” "
"An American military drone strike over the weekend in southern Libya killed a top recruiter and logistics specialist for Al Qaeda’s branch in northwest Africa, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, and a senior military official warned of more attacks on extremists there. The military’s Africa Command said in a statement that the attack killed two militants, one of whom was identified as Musa Abu Dawud, a high-ranking official in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM. Mr. Dawud trained Qaeda recruits in Libya for strike operations in the region, and provided logistics, money and weapons that enabled the group to threaten and attack American and Western interests, the military statement said. Until now, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya — eight since President Trump took office — almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north. Over several months in 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt to destroy the Islamic State’s stronghold there. The missile fired by the American drone on Saturday was the first in southern Libya. It struck a house in Ubari, 435 miles south of Tripoli, in the country’s southwest, a notorious haven for a deadly mix of Al Qaeda and other extremist groups that also operate in the Sahel region of Niger, Chad, Mali and Algeria. The area is also close to major oil fields that were crippled by violent ethnic feuding in 2015. “I wouldn’t say this is the beginning of a wider campaign,” Col. Mark Cheadle, the Africa Command’s chief spokesman, said in an email. But, he added, “If we find targets we can strike, and it is appropriate to do so, I think we would certainly consider the option.” "
"WASHINGTON — A lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by refusing to divorce himself from his businesses cleared a critical hurdle Wednesday when a federal judge in Maryland refused the Justice Department’s plea to dismiss it. In a 47-page opinion, Judge Peter J. Messitte rejected the federal government’s claims that the plaintiffs had not shown that they had suffered injuries that a court could address. The suit, filed by Washington, D.C., and the State of Maryland, accuses Mr. Trump of violating constitutional anticorruption clauses intended to limit his receipt of government-bestowed benefits, or emoluments. The local jurisdictions claim that in hopes of currying presidential favor, government officials are patronizing Trump-owned properties instead of hotels or convention centers that the District of Columbia or Maryland own or have some financial interest in. Although the case could still be thrown out on other grounds, the judge’s ruling adds to the president’s growing legal troubles. Besides the continuing criminal inquiry into Russia’s influence over the presidential election, an actress in pornographic films, a former Playboy model and a onetime contestant on “The Apprentice” have filed civil lawsuits over their alleged relationships with Mr. Trump before he became president. The emoluments case raises basic questions that have never been litigated. Even the specific definition of an emolument is unclear. During a January court hearing, Judge Messitte seemed to acknowledge that the case would ultimately be decided by a higher court than his. "
"Almost a year after Kathy Griffin appeared in a widely condemned photograph that depicted her holding the severed head of President Trump, this comedian and actress is making a TV comeback of sorts. Ms. Griffin will appear on Tuesday in a special episode of the Comedy Central series “The President Show,” in which she will play Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, the network announced on Thursday. “I am kicking the hornet’s nest, as much as I can,” Ms. Griffin said in a phone interview. “I think it’s important to lean into the controversy, because I know so much more about it now,” she added. “I think now enough time has passed where people are starting to see the ridiculousness of what happened to me, and they’re seeing other people that Trump has done it to.” “The President Show” stars Anthony Atamanuik as a satirical version of Mr. Trump hosting a late-night program from the Oval Office. It has also featured other comedians playing members of the Trump family and administration, including Peter Grosz as Vice President Pence, Adam Pally as Donald Trump Jr. and Mario Cantone as Anthony Scaramucci. This will be Ms. Griffin’s first television role since the incident last May in which she posed in a photograph while holding a blood-smeared representation of Mr. Trump’s head. (She has appeared on talk shows since then, including a recent episode of “Real Time With Bill Maher.”) Ms. Griffin was swiftly rebuked by Mr. Trump, who wrote on Twitter that she “should be ashamed of herself.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday, saying in an early-morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes — and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation’s largest e-commerce business. Mr. Trump accused Amazon, one of the country’s most recognizable and successful brands, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its “Delivery Boy.” The president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015. And privately, people close to him said, Mr. Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company, often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos. By focusing on the threat to small businesses, Mr. Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon’s disruptive force. The company has changed industries as varied as publishing, groceries and health care. That has helped the company grow to be worth more than $700 billion, but it has also made it a convenient target. The president has little clear authority to take action against the company. Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company, but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases. Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that “the president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.” "

First: “As I prepare to leave government, I am struck by a recurring thought: It should not be this hard to serve your country,” writes David J. Shulkin in The Times this morning. President Trump dismissed Shulkin yesterday from his post as secretary of veterans affairs. The Russia story. The Times reports that President Trump’s personal lawyer discussed pardoning Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, and Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman. Writing in Just Security, Harvard Law School’s Alex Whiting offers one legal interpretation: If presidential pardons were dangled in an attempt to keep the pair from cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s Russia ties, “it should qualify as a potential act of obstruction of justice.” That’s because the president has the power to issue pardons — but not to secretly offer them in exchange for silence, argues Asha Rangappa, a former F.B.I. special agent. “Even the immense powers of the president can’t be used as a bargaining chip.” Kim Jong-un goes to China. The North Korean leader’s meeting with President Xi Jinping of China this week suggests the two countries are setting aside their differences to advance a shared goal: limiting American influence in Asia, argues Ankit Panda in The Atlantic. China will likely play a key role in upcoming negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program. “Meanwhile,” Panda writes, “the White House remains in chaos.” Now, to millions of Americans, today is one of the best days of the year. It’s baseball’s opening day. "

"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon. • Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook’s board. • Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes. • Another FANG stock took a tumble. • The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments. The DealBook newsletter is taking a break for Good Friday. We’ll be back with you on Monday. Sign up for it here. Amazon hasn’t responded to President Trump’s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won’t. Mr. Trump’s criticisms, though, are largely mistaken. For a long time, Amazon did not pay state sales tax, but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it. It is the case, however, that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform. As for the United States Postal Service, Amazon’s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue. Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon’s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.

"Updated, 10:30 a.m. Good morning on this Holy Thursday. It’s opening day for Major League Baseball, and our two teams have two new faces that will be hard to miss this season. Their managers. Mickey Callaway has taken over for the Mets, and Aaron Boone will lead the Yankees. “The manager is the most public face of every single team, more so than the players,” said James Wagner, who covers the Mets for The Times. “Both teams had managers for a long time,” he added — Terry Collins had been with the Mets for seven years, and Joe Girardi with the Yankees for 10 — “so there’s been continuity for both teams that changed at the same time.” It will be a gamble for both squads because neither manager has done the job before; Mr. Callaway was the pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians, and Mr. Boone was an ESPN announcer with no coaching or managing experience. They are also younger than most managers. At 68, Mr. Collins, was the oldest manager in the major leagues. Mr. Callaway, 42, is one of the youngest. “It’s become a trend to have younger, more inexperienced people be managers,” Mr. Wagner said. “Knowing how to handle data and information and knowing how to relate to the players is more important than having done this for 30 years.” "
"Crucial disputes over Democratic strategy concerning economic distribution, race and immigration have in large part been based on Election Day exit polls that now appear to have been inaccurate in key ways. According to subsequent studies, those polls substantially underestimated the number of Democratic white working-class voters — many of whom are culturally conservative — and overestimated the white college-educated Democratic electorate, a far more culturally liberal constituency. “The short answer is that the exit polls are wrong,” Matthew DeBell, a senior scholar at Stanford’s Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, emailed me. He continued: The Pew Research Center and the Center for American Progress have produced methodologically sophisticated surveys of the electorate that sharply contradict 2016 exit polls. Perhaps most significant, a March 20 Pew Research Center public opinion survey found that 33 percent of Democratic voters and Democratic leaners are whites without college degrees. That’s substantially larger than the 26 percent of Democrats who are whites with college degrees — the group that many analysts had come to believe was the dominant constituency in the party. According to Pew, this noncollege white 33 percent makes up a larger bloc of the party’s voters than the 28 percent made up of racial and ethnic minorities without degrees. It is also larger than the 12 percent of Democratic voters made up of racial and ethnic minorities with college degrees. In sum, Pew’s more precise survey methods reveal that when Democrats are broken down by education, race and ethnicity, the white working class is the largest bloc of Democratic voters and substantially larger than the bloc of white college-educated Democratic voters.

"In the throes of the campaign in September 2016, Mike Pence told a crowd at the Living Word Bible Church in Mesa, Ariz.: “I’m old enough to remember back in the last Clinton administration where America really had a debate over whether character mattered to the presidency. We don’t need to have that debate again. We don’t need to have that debate again. Character matters to the presidency and Donald Trump will bring the highest level of integrity to the highest office in the land. You can count on it.” Ha. This after a lifetime of Trump boasting about his sexual conquests, after years of him going on the Howard Stern show and saying the most debauched things, and just two weeks before the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape on which Trump boasted about kissing and groping women without their permission — in other words, sexual assault. Pence’s proclamation was a lie when he said it, and is even more of a lie now. Trump is involved in litigation over sexual encounters on three fronts, including with the porn star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels. But the Daniels scandal is hardly making a dent. As Politico reported Wednesday, “The data suggest Trump’s past behavior with women is already known among voters — and many are willing to overlook it.” Politico continued: “Trump’s seeming imperviousness to the scandal is stunning given the opinions Americans profess to hold on issues of character. In the most recent Politico/Morning Consult poll, 91 percent said honesty is ‘very important’ for elected officials to embody in their personal life in order to carry out their official duties. Seventy-five percent said the same about morality. On the question of extramarital affairs, 80 percent said they were morally wrong. Despite all that, when asked directly about the Daniels scandal, nearly half of voters say it doesn’t change how they view Trump.” Conservatives have twisted themselves into knots trying to excuse Trump’s vulgarities as acceptable and somehow set them apart from the supposed productivity of the man himself, somehow cleaving the sin from the sinner.

"Even as it issues full-page apologies in print newspapers promising ritualistically “to do better,” Facebook and its allies have minimized the importance of the seismic revelation that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on behalf of the Trump campaign in 2016, had gained access to the private information of about 50 million Facebook users. Some executives have pointed out that the mechanism that until a few years ago allowed a researcher with 270,000 app downloads to have access to 50 million profiles wasn’t exactly a secret, and, besides, Facebook users nominally agreed to the sharing of these profiles so that apps would perform better. The company’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter to complain that Facebook and other “platforms” were being held to a double standard concerning the profiles, since they may well “have been criticized as monopolists for locking them down.” Others poured cold water on the idea that Cambridge Analytica was able to use these profiles as grist for its research on swaying voters by cracking the code of human intention. Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and a Facebook board member, doesn’t tweet anymore, but he “likes” hundreds of tweets a week, a group that recently included a string that mocked the public’s fear that new media forms can be turned into “weapons of total mind control.” Perhaps these are the wrong reasons for outrage, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be outraged. What Facebook is selling to political campaigns is the same thing Uber is selling to its drivers and customers and what YouTube is selling to advertisers who hope to reach an audience of children — namely, the right to bypass longstanding rules and regulations in order to act with impunity. When you look at the Facebook data leak scandal this way, you realize that Facebook’s irresponsibility isn’t merely an abuse of a personal relationship — what its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us” — but also an abuse of a civic relationship. Selling relief from government scrutiny of elections is a different kind of threat to the social fabric than selling relief from government scrutiny of commerce, especially in light of our country’s record of denying voting rights to African-Americans. Facebook can’t be allowed to be a tool for enemies of democracy because it fears that regulation could hurt its bottom line. "
"If you take Jeremy Corbyn at his word, then the leader of Britain’s Labour Party is no anti-Semite. It’s just that, like the Wild West preacher who keeps accidentally wandering into Fannie Porter’s house of ill repute, Corbyn has an odd knack for stumbling into the arms of the Hebraically disinclined. Corbyn is facing public protests and scathing criticism again this week after it emerged that in 2012 he had questioned the removal of a London mural by the artist Kalen Ockerman that looks like a scene drawn from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. He now claims, unconvincingly, that he regrets not looking “more closely at the image.” It also turns out that he was a member of several Facebook groups, one of which displayed “postings about the Rothschild banking family, Jews harvesting organs and theories connecting Israel with Islamic State,” according to London’s Jewish Chronicle. “Had I seen” anti-Semitism, Corbyn says, “I would have challenged it straight away.” This was barely a month after Corbyn issued a Facebook post for Holocaust Memorial Day that included no mention of Jews or anti-Semitism. Following an outcry, Corbyn made public another message, this one mentioning “our Jewish brothers and sisters.” Around the same time, a Labour Party briefing document urged its members to reject an effort to ban Hezbollah in Britain. In 2009, Corbyn had described the Lebanese terrorist group, along with the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, as “friends.” Seven years later he explained he was merely using “inclusive language,” which “with hindsight I would rather not have used.” "
"Legal journalists and bloggers have been having a field day with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s put-down of Justice Sonia Sotomayor during a Supreme Court argument last week. The argument came in a case challenging California’s effort to regulate “crisis pregnancy centers,” offices that look like abortion clinics but that don’t provide abortions. Some provide pregnancy-related medical services, while others don’t have a doctor on the premises and offer no medical services at all. The California law requires clinics without doctors to disclose that fact. Close to the surface of the case, although only obliquely confronted during the argument, is whether the clinics’ operating model is properly described as luring women inside by pretending to be something they’re not. Justice Sotomayor came close to making that accusation. Addressing the lawyer for the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, the network of pregnancy centers that brought the case, she said she had looked at “a few” of the clinics’ websites and had come upon one that showed “a woman on the home page with a uniform that looks like a nurse’s uniform in front of an ultrasound machine” in what looked like an examination room. “I’m fairly sophisticated,” Justice Sotomayor said, and suggested that she might nonetheless have been fooled into thinking she was about to see a doctor. Justice Sotomayor and the lawyer, Michael P. Farris, went back and forth for a some minutes until finally Justice Kennedy jumped in to offer Mr. Farris a helping hand. “Well, in this case I didn’t go beyond the record to look on the internet because I don’t think we should do that,” he began. Aha! “Sotomayor Rapped for Surfing the Web” read The Associated Press headline on an article carried by news outlets all over the country. In a smart article in The Washington Post titled “Supreme Court Rule: (Other) Justices Shouldn’t Conduct Independent Research,” Robert Barnes, the newspaper’s Supreme Court correspondent, had great fun chronicling instances of research conducted outside the official record of a case by members of the Supreme Court including Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, the current Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and, yes, Justice Kennedy himself. Everyone was shocked! shocked! (or at least, amused) to learn there was research going on. In fact, the courtroom exchange opened the window on a subject as elusive as it is fascinating: How do judges know what they need to know in order to perform the job of deciding cases? The formal answer is that when it comes to the facts, appellate judges are bound by the record established at trial. Supreme Court justices, who of course never get near a trial, frequently consult the trial record; in fact, the court’s electronic docket, which lists the procedural progress of every case filed, often includes the notation “record requested.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • What do Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort know? A lawyer for President Trump broached the idea of pardons for the two former advisers last year, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The talks could suggest that the White House was concerned about what Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort might reveal to the special counsel in the Russia investigation. The lawyer who is said to have made the offer, John Dowd, denied the reports on Wednesday. He resigned as the president’s lead lawyer for the Russia inquiry last week. • Separately, a top Trump campaign official had frequent phone calls  before the election with a person the F.B.I. believes had active links to Russian spy services at the time. That’s according to a document released this week by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. • President Trump nominated his physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, replacing David Shulkin. Dr. Jackson, a career Naval officer, appeared in the spotlight this year when he announced the results of Mr. Trump’s first physical while in office. If confirmed, Dr. Jackson would inherit the federal government’s second-largest department, which has been burdened by aging infrastructure, an inefficient health care system and a 360,000-person work force.

"A campaign to unseat eight state Democratic senators — members of a renegade group that has helped empower Republicans to rule the Senate in Albany — will receive a significant boost from the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer. Mr. Stringer on Thursday will endorse two Democratic challengers trying to topple members of the group, the Independent Democratic Conference, in the September primary. “When you run for office as a Democrat and caucus with the Republicans, you are not acting like a Democrat.” Mr. Stringer, a Democrat, said in an interview. “This has gone on for too long. I want to break the dam.” The cooperation of the eight-member body has helped allow Senate Republicans to control the chamber even though they are outnumbered by Democrats. Mr. Stringer will endorse Robert Jackson, who is challenging Marisol Alcantara in Manhattan, and Jessica Ramos, who is challenging Jose R. Peralta in Queens. Although the I.D.C. was created in 2011, its existence — largely tolerated or ignored by many Democrats in New York — has now become a hot-button issue. "
"WASHINGTON — The last time — perhaps the only time — John R. Bolton inspired bipartisan agreement, it was over the shared conclusion that he was perhaps the least diplomatic personality a president could have ever picked to be an American diplomat. That was in 2005, when Mr. Bolton was last considered for a government job. Accounts of his red-faced tirades against intelligence analysts whose findings he disagreed with so concerned members of the Senate that they refused to approve his nomination as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations. He wound up getting the job anyway through a recess appointment by Mr. Bush, who later regretted spending the political capital on such a divisive figure, telling conservatives, “I don’t consider Bolton credible.” Thirteen years later, another president has given Mr. Bolton the far more consequential job of national security adviser. But because that post does not require Senate confirmation, the five months in 2005 that the Senate took to decide whether Mr. Bolton should go to the United Nations remain the only extensive examination of his record and his temperament. Those who opposed him then, like Carl W. Ford Jr., along with many who supported him, say Mr. Bolton has not changed. In an appearance before a Senate committee vetting Mr. Bolton’s nomination in 2005, Mr. Ford, a former assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research in the Bush administration, summed up Mr. Bolton, then an under secretary of state for arms control and international security, as a “kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.” "
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea will meet for the first time on April 27, officials said on Thursday, setting a date for talks meant to extend the recent détente on the Korean Peninsula and pave the way for discussions between Mr. Kim and President Trump. Early this month Mr. Kim agreed to a meeting with Mr. Moon, part of a flurry of diplomacy around North Korea’s nuclear program that began with the North’s participation last month in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Senior negotiators from both Koreas met Thursday at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village on the countries’ border, to agree on a date and discuss other aspects of the summit meeting. The two Korean leaders will meet at Peace House, a South Korean building inside Panmunjom, according to a joint statement the negotiators issued at the end of their talks on Thursday. Peace House lies south of the demarcation line that bisects Panmunjom, which means that Mr. Kim would become the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War. Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, the South’s chief delegate to the Panmunjom talks, hinted at progress toward including denuclearization in the agenda for the Kim-Moon meeting. But he said the two Koreas might need another round of high-level talks in coming weeks to settle the matter. “The South and North agreed on efforts to make the summit successful, sharing its historic significance in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, settling peace there and improving inter-Korean relations,” Mr. Cho told reporters. The meeting will be the third ever held between leaders of the two Koreas. Mr. Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, met with two South Korean presidents — Kim Dae-jung in 2000 and Roh Moo-hyun in 2007 — in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Kim Jong-un’s power play, a French march against hate and a Balkan design facepalm. Here’s the latest: • Confident, reasonable — willing to bargain. That’s how North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, came across in his debut as a global statesman — and he did so with a dash of mystery. Here’s how the Chinese and the North Korean news media portrayed the meeting with President Xi Jinping. Mr. Kim’s two-day visit — his first known trip abroad since taking power — was a reminder of how much he has set the agenda in the North Korean nuclear crisis and, our correspondent writes, what a strong hand he has going into negotiations. President Trump was quick to chime in. He posted on Twitter that Mr. Xi told him that the meeting went “very well” and that Mr. Kim “looks forward to his meeting with me.” _____ • “In France, we kill grandmothers because they’re Jewish.” Condemning anti-Semitic violence, thousands marched through Paris to honor Mireille Knoll, above, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor who was murdered in her apartment last week.

"Rusty Staub reached base 34 more times than Rogers Hornsby. He also reached base more times than — among many others — Tony Gwynn, Nap Lajoie, Ichiro Suzuki and Honus Wagner. He reached base 1,000 more times than Joe DiMaggio. When the man they called Le Grand Orange died on Thursday, baseball lost one of its finest practitioners of the sport’s most important skill. And owing to the unique way in which he approached batting, he died as one of the game’s most underappreciated stars. In 23 seasons, Staub reached base 4,050 times, the 41st highest total in baseball history. (The number grows to 4,165 if you include the 115 times he reached via error.) He was a six-time All-Star who finished his career with 292 home runs, 1,466 runs batted in and 45.8 wins above replacement. Most of those career totals are, admittedly, below Hall of Fame standards. But for some context on how impressive the feat of reaching base 4,000 times is, consider how often those who have accomplished it have been enshrined in Cooperstown. Forty-six players have done it, 43 have been retired long enough to be considered for Hall of Fame induction, and 37 of those players were elected. The six who were not: Pete Rose, Barry Bonds, Rafael Palmeiro, Gary Sheffield, Staub and Manny Ramirez. It is a group that mostly explains itself in terms of Hall exclusion. There are four players who had their careers tainted for many voters through connections to performance-enhancing drugs, one who was barred from baseball for life for gambling on the sport and thus was ineligible for election, and then there is Staub, a treasure of at least two teams’ fan bases, who appeared on the ballot seven times and never garnered more than 7.9 percent of the vote. The problem, of course, is that Staub got so much of his on-base production through walks rather than hits. He finished his career with a good-but-not-great 2,716 hits, and a truly spectacular 1,255 walks. Those totals propelled him to a .362 career on-base percentage, which when combined with his .431 slugging percentage, and adjusted for his home parks and era, made him 24 percent better than the average batter for the duration of his career. Only 19 batters in major league history finished their careers with as many at-bats as Staub (9,720) and an adjusted on-base plus slugging percentage higher than his (124). "
"Eric H. Holder Jr., the United States attorney general for six years under President Barack Obama, stepped away from public service in 2015 but has since emerged as a bulwark against the Trump administration, taking a leading role in challenging the president’s policies in court and trying to chip away at the Republicans’ grip on state governments. Mr. Holder discussed his efforts to fight Republican gerrymandering, whether Facebook should be regulated and the potential legacy of Mr. Trump’s presidency in a wide-ranging TimesTalks conversation with the reporter Alexander Burns on Wednesday night in New York. Here are the takeaways. After the Trump administration announced this week that it would add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, Mr. Holder said he planned to sue to block the change on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which he chairs. The census aims to count everyone who resides in the country, whether they are citizens or not, and Mr. Holder echoed the concerns expressed by several states this week that the citizenship question could reduce the responses from noncitizens and even legal immigrants. He said his lawsuit would be aided by Mr. Trump’s Twitter utterances. “This is one of those incidences where I think the president’s tweets and public statements will become relevant,” Mr. Holder, 67, said. “To show the true intent — that it is not as benign as they would make it out to be. Through the words of Donald Trump and through the tweets of Donald Trump, you’ll see what the true intention was of the administration.” Normally, he noted, it would be difficult to argue in court that the government pushed a policy with a malicious intent. But Mr. Trump’s tweets provide plenty of material for lawsuits, Mr. Holder said. “It is certainly the gift that keeps on giving,” he said. Mr. Holder conceded that he prefers Twitter to Facebook but occasionally catches a glimpse of Facebook when his wife signs on. But he said he had been following the recent news that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. That security breach, along with the social network’s role in spreading Russian-backed propaganda during the presidential election, bolstered an argument for regulating Facebook, Mr. Holder said. "
"Before reading the article: Every 10 years the Census Bureau counts each person who lives in the United States, as required by the Constitution. As The Times recently reported: Watch this short Reuters video about the Trump administration’s decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Do you think asking residents if they are citizens is a good idea? Why or why not? Now, read the article, “At Least Twelve States to Sue Trump Administration Over Census Citizenship Question,” and answer the following questions: 1. Why are 12 states suing to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census? 2. What did Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts say about the new census question? 3. Why are some people opposed to the new question, according to the article? 4. What is the Trump administration’s rationale for adding the question? 5. What details does the article give about the history of asking residents if they are citizens? What does the article say about the timing of the added question? 6. What does Eric. T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, mean when he says adding the new question “will create an environment of fear and distrust in immigrant communities that would make impossible both an accurate census and the fair distribution of federal tax dollars”? Why? 7. Why did Kenneth Prewitt, a director of the Census Bureau under President Bill Clinton and now a professor of public affairs at Columbia University, dismiss the administration’s rationale that the question is needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act by saying, “It’s certainly unnecessary”? Finally, tell us more about what you think: Do you think the citizenship question is necessary for the 2020 census, and why? Do you think some people will ignore the citizenship question on the census or refuse to fill the census out completely? Why? What do you think will happen if the 2020 census data reflects an undercount of the population of the United States, and why do you think so? What do you think is the best way to get a fair and accurate count of the people living in the United States, and why?

"BRIDGEPORT, CONN. — Joseph P. Ganim, the mayor of Connecticut’s largest city, is selling a message of imperfection, but also redemption. He is the embodiment of the second chance: After serving as Bridgeport’s mayor in the 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Ganim, a Democrat, was convicted on multiple charges of corruption and sent to federal prison. Seven years later, he emerged from his “time away,” as he calls it, a changed man. He returned to City Hall as mayor in 2015, vowing to make his mayoral redux squeaky clean — even hiring, as a senior adviser, the F.B.I. agent who was a key member of the prosecution team that convicted him. Now, Mr. Ganim is hoping to pull off an even more improbable comeback: He is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor amid a crowded field of candidates bidding to replace the Democratic two-term governor, Dannel P. Malloy, who is not seeking re-election. Mr. Ganim believes that his life experience will resonate with voters across the state, and not only in cities like Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven that are troubled by crime, unemployment and poverty. “There are people in every pocket of Connecticut who are struggling,” he said. “I’m ‘second chance.’ But there are people who are still looking for their first chance. One thing I do bring — imperfect as I might be — is the experience of solving problems in a public-sector environment.” "
"In announcing Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, as his choice to be the new secretary for veterans affairs, President Trump has taken his latest misstep in what has been the worst presidential personnel process in modern history. We take no pleasure in saying so, including because one of us (Mr. Eisen) worked with Dr. Jackson in the White House, was even treated by him, and can testify that he is a very capable physician. But that good opinion of Dr. Jackson, which was widely held in the Obama administration, by no means qualifies him to run one of the largest, most complex and troubled cabinet agencies in the federal government. Indeed, the very affability of Dr. Jackson’s approach when it comes to his current presidential patient is perhaps his greatest disqualification, followed closely by his lack of relevant management experience and the apparent absence of a normal pre-nomination personnel vetting. Dr. Jackson’s January examination of President Trump, and subsequent news conference, give us great pause because they evinced a disturbing lack of independence — one of the most important qualities in a cabinet member. Dr. Jackson startled observers by not only finding the president healthy, but declaring he would remain so in the future. The doctor even looked into his crystal ball to predict good health for a second term, a pronouncement extending seven years into the future and so more fit for a fortuneteller than a scientist. [Get more of the biggest debates of the day right in your inbox by signing up for the Opinion newsletter.] Some expert observers also felt Dr. Jackson may have understated the president’s heart disease, and even fudged the president’s height (his driver’s license says 6 feet 2 inches; Dr. Jackson reported 6 feet 3 inches) because the lower number would have forced the doctor to admit his patient was obese. When asked why he had such glowing things to say about the president’s health when Mr. Trump gorges on McDonalds, guzzles diet Coke, and seldom exercises, Dr. Jackson said: “Some people have just great genes. I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old.” "
"UNITED NATIONS — Nuclear weapons? Famine? Civil war? Nope. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, on Thursday called climate change “the most systemic threat to humankind” and urged world leaders to curb their countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. He didn’t say much, though, about the one world leader who had pulled out of the landmark United Nations climate change agreement: President Trump. Instead, Mr. Guterres suggested that Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris accord nearly a year ago didn’t matter much. The American people, he said, were doing plenty. “Independently of the position of the administration, the U.S. might be able to meet the commitments made in Paris as a country,” the secretary general said. “And, as you know, all around the world, the role of governments is less and less relevant.” That may be overly optimistic. Sixteen American states and Puerto Rico have pledged to stick to the commitment that the United States made in the Paris agreement to reduce emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025. Those states are on track to keep their promise. But they represent less than a half of the country’s population, and the United States as a country will most likely fall short of its Paris pledge as Mr. Trump dismantles environmental regulations, according to a 2017 study by the Rhodium Group, a private economic research company. And a group led by Michael R. Bloomberg, the United Nations special envoy on climate change, and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, came to the same conclusion in a report that relied on the same data.

"RICHFIELD, Ohio — President Trump heralded a new trade agreement with South Korea at his first public appearance in nearly a week on Thursday, but then immediately suggested that he might delay finalizing it while negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program. “I may hold it up until after a deal is made with North Korea,” Mr. Trump said, immediately after celebrating the new agreement. “Does everybody understand that? You know why, right? You know why? Because it’s a very strong card.” He added, “We’ll probably hold that deal up for a little while, see how it all plays out.” It was unclear what leverage Mr. Trump believed he could gain in the North Korea talks by delaying the deal with the South. The move could be an attempt by Mr. Trump to prod President Moon Jae-in of South Korea to hold a firm line with North Korea when talks begin over its nuclear program. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that South Korea and the United States had reached an agreement “in principle.” “The president, taking into account all relevant considerations — including negotiations with North Korea — will determine the best time to sign a finalized agreement on behalf of the United States,” he said. But Mr. Trump’s comments seemed to undercut a weeklong White House effort to promote the agreement. And they were in keeping with the at-times confusing tone of Mr. Trump’s speech at a muddy-floored training center for union workers here in this Cleveland suburb: His appearance was billed as an attempt to promote his infrastructure plan, but Mr. Trump addressed it only briefly near the end of his remarks, and said it was unlikely to pass soon. After a week marked by persistent scandals and high-profile staff departures, policy was not at the forefront of the president’s mind. Mr. Trump seemed intently focused on delivering his own progress report to supporters on a range of red-meat issues, including his zeal for improving border security, his promise to construct a border wall with Mexico, his administration’s efforts to roll back what he called “job killing” regulations and his thwarting of Democrats.

"Citing President Trump’s “racially charged language,” a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled on Thursday that a lawsuit seeking to preserve a program that protects hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation could continue. The order, by Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, was the strongest sign so far of judicial support for the program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which has for months been the subject of a heated debate in Congress. In October, lawyers for the Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the Brooklyn lawsuit, claiming that the plaintiffs in the case — a coalition of immigration lawyers and a group of Democratic state attorneys general — had failed to make a persuasive case that DACA was rolled back in September because of a racial animus toward Latinos. But in his order rejecting the motion to dismiss, Judge Garaufis pointed directly at Mr. Trump, noting that his numerous “racial slurs” and “epithets” — both as a candidate and from the White House — had created a “plausible inference” that the decision to end DACA violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. “One might reasonably infer,” Judge Garaufis wrote, “that a candidate who makes overtly bigoted statements on the campaign trail might be more likely to engage in similarly bigoted action in office.” In February, Judge Garaufis issued an injunction ordering the Trump administration to keep DACA in place as he considered the legal merits of the suit. That injunction echoed a similar one issued in January by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, who is hearing a separate but related suit. "
"President Trump renewed his attacks against Amazon on Saturday, claiming on Twitter that the Postal Service loses billions of dollars shipping packages for the online giant. He also accused The Washington Post — which is owned by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon — of functioning as a “lobbyist” on behalf of the retailer. Here is our earlier fact-check on Mr. Trump’s assertions about Amazon, with some updates. President Trump assailed Amazon on Thursday, accusing the online retail giant of paying “little or no taxes to state & local governments,” while taking advantage of the United States Postal Service and “causing tremendous loss to the U.S.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The clash between Russia and the West is intensifying. Russia will expel 150 diplomats, including 60 Americans, in retaliation for Western measures designed to punish Moscow for its alleged role in a nerve-agent attack on a former spy in Britain. Russia denies any involvement. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, above, summoned the American ambassador, Jon Huntsman, to his office to give him the news. The Americans were given until April 5 to leave the country. The daughter of the spy, who was also poisoned, is showing improvement as she recovers in a British hospital. ____ 2. The Trump administration is expected to launch an effort to weaken standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy for automobiles. That would be a major victory for car manufacturers, giving them ammunition to potentially roll back industry standards worldwide. "
"If you’re like us, your initial reaction upon hearing that President Trump had picked his personal physician to head the Department of Veterans Affairs was: “What? You mean the guy who looks like a retired Grateful Dead roadie and said ‘unequivocally’ that Mr. Trump would be ‘the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency’ ”? No, not him. The doctor with no managerial experience nominated to head the second-largest federal bureaucracy is Dr. Ronny Jackson, the lead White House physician since 2013 and a rear admiral, who said after an exam in January that Mr. Trump was in “excellent health,” despite being overweight and needing a higher dosage of cholesterol-lowering medication. Mr. Trump tends not to look very far when seeking to fill top government positions. He named his family event planner to head an important regional office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He floated the idea of putting his personal pilot in charge of the Federal Aviation Administration. What’s next, making his son-in-law Middle East peace envoy? But, anyway, it seems that as secretary of veterans affairs, Dr. Jackson would not be tending to Mr. Trump so much as to the right-wing billionaires Charles and David Koch and others who support privatization of veterans’ health care and other services. The man Dr. Jackson would replace as head of this long-troubled department, David Shulkin, whom Mr. Trump fired on Wednesday, was the highest-ranking holdover from the Obama administration and among the few Trump cabinet members with demonstrated ability at their jobs.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Dana Carvey impersonated John R. Bolton, President Trump’s incoming national security adviser, in an interview with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show” Wednesday night. It was a bit reminiscent of Carvey’s famous impression of the first  President George  Bush — but a few notches more ludicrous. Colbert asked “Bolton,” who is known for his far-right views and is said to act abusively toward co-workers, for reassurance that he was not gunning for pre-emptive war with North Korea or Iran. The interview began with Carvey’s character pleading innocence, but it didn’t take long to fly off the rails. By the end, his face was covered in an overgrown mustache, and he was attempting to breast-feed a golden retriever puppy. Here’s how it started. Midway through the interview, Colbert noticed something suspicious going on with his interviewee’s facial hair. "

"The Trump administration is expected to launch an effort in coming days to weaken greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards for automobiles, handing a victory to car manufacturers and giving them ammunition to potentially roll back industry standards worldwide. The move — which undercuts one of President Barack Obama’s signature efforts to fight climate change — would also propel the Trump administration toward a courtroom clash with California, which has vowed to stick with the stricter rules even if Washington rolls back federal standards. That fight could end up creating one set of rules for cars sold in California and the 12 states that follow its lead, and weaker rules for the rest of the states, in effect splitting the nation into two markets. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to frame the initiative as eliminating a regulatory burden on automakers that will result in more affordable trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles for buyers, according to people familiar with the plan. An E.P.A. spokeswoman confirmed that Mr. Pruitt had sent a draft of the 16-page plan to the White House for approval. The particulars of the plan are still being worked out. Those specifics, which are expected this year, could substantially roll back the Obama-era standards, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. “This is certainly a big deal,” said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard environmental economics program. “The result will be more gas-guzzling vehicles on the road, greater total gasoline consumption, and a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The Koreas set a meeting date, a homecoming in Pakistan and lives adrift on Cambodia’s waterways. Here’s what you need to know: • Russia hits back. The Kremlin announced that it would expel 150 Western diplomats and close the American consulate in St. Petersburg, as tit-for-tat retaliation continues over a nerve-agent attack on British soil that London and its allies have blamed on Moscow. Britain said it would review the cases of 700 wealthy Russians who were granted visas largely because they could invest millions of dollars. It also signaled an openness to blocking the Russian government from British financial markets. The moves came on a day of good news in the poisoning attack. Yulia Skripal, above, who was attacked with her father, Sergei Skripal, “is no longer in a critical condition.” _____ • It’s a date.

"Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host, apologized under pressure on Thursday for taunting a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., as at least eight companies confirmed they would pull advertising from her show. The dispute began Wednesday when Ms. Ingraham shared an article about the student, David Hogg, 17, getting rejected from colleges and accused him of whining about it. In response, Mr. Hogg, who has rapidly become a prominent advocate for gun-control policies, called on Ms. Ingraham’s advertisers to boycott her show. Eight of the companies, TripAdvisor, Wayfair, Hulu, Nutrish, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle, Atlantis Paradise Island and Stitch Fix, said they were removing their ads. A ninth, Expedia, said it had recently pulled its advertising but declined to say when. As news of the boycotts began coming out on Thursday, Ms. Ingraham apologized. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” she said, extending an invitation for Mr. Hogg to appear on the show. Mr. Hogg said he was unimpressed by the apology. “She only apologized after we went after her advertisers,” he said. “It kind of speaks for itself.” "

"To the Editor: Re “Cynthia Nixon and the Age of Inexperience” (column, March 25): Frank Bruni’s argument that our current “romance” with inexperienced political candidates degrades the importance of experience more generally reflects an erroneous view of politics in the United States. His essay is a response to Cynthia Nixon’s decision to run in the Democratic primary against Andrew Cuomo for governor of New York, but his point reflects a division between those who believe that political experience is required to govern well and those who do not. There is a long tradition in the United States of governance by people with nonpolitical experience. The reason is simple: In a representative democracy we, in some sense, govern ourselves. Politics is not a technical discipline for which esoteric knowledge is indispensable. My problem with Donald Trump, for example, has nothing to do with his political inexperience and everything to do with his moral and intellectual incompetence. Governing requires wisdom, not technical expertise. It truly is not brain science. JOHN DOUARD, BLOOMFIELD, N.J. To the Editor: Frank Bruni rightly points out the importance of experience in any profession, whether a plumber, doctor or, yes, even a politician, to do the job correctly. The clearest example of lack of experience is the debacle that is the Trump White House. Cynthia Nixon is a wonderful actress and clearly civic-minded. But rather than run for Congress, Ms. Nixon is shooting for the big kahuna — governorship of New York State. We simply don’t need another person learning on the job. Cynthia, please, stay in your lane. "
"To the Editor: Re “V.A.

It should be criminal how our veterans have been treated over the years, by both political parties. Thank you for your service, and don’t let the door hit you on the way out. Dr. David Shulkin, the outgoing V.A. chief, betrayed his position when he spent over $120,000 of taxpayer money on a trip to Europe with his wife. Hardly the actions of a dedicated public servant. Unfortunately, I think the choice to replace him, Dr. Ronny Jackson, is a poor one for many reasons, but at the top of the list is his lack of experience running, well, anything. That, and the glowing physical report he gave Donald Trump — a poster boy for hardening of the arteries — make him suspect in this veteran’s eyes. LEN DISESA, DOYLESTOWN, PA. "
"MOSCOW — Russia on Thursday escalated a confrontation with Europe and the United States over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, saying it would expel 60 American diplomats and an unspecified number of envoys from other countries to retaliate for a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats working in the West and beyond that was ordered this week. Furious at what it described as an anti-Russian campaign orchestrated by Washington and London, the Kremlin exceeded an equivalent response to the United States and ordered the closing of the American Consulate in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city. The consulate is bigger and far more important to relations than the Russian Consulate in Seattle, which the Trump administration ordered closed on Monday as part of its expulsion decree. The crisis over the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter has driven tensions between the Kremlin and the West to their highest pitch in decades and forced European countries like Germany that are usually wary of clashing with Moscow to choose sides. Britain contends that the poison used was a signature Russian nerve agent created by Soviet-era scientists. Voicing alarm that the East-West confrontation was spinning out of control, the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, said that the crisis recalled the Cold War, only without the controls and channels of communication established before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union “to make sure things would not get out of control when tensions rise.” The intensifying crisis has also put new pressure on President Trump. He has been loath to criticize Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and, against the advice of his advisers, he avoided any mention of the March 4 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England, when he telephoned Mr. Putin to congratulate him on his lopsided victory in Russia’s March 18 election. Following his practice of avoiding public criticism of Russia, Mr. Trump made no mention of the expulsions during a speech on Thursday afternoon in Ohio. "
