"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re following today: • Disney’s pursuit of Fox is nearing its conclusion. • The Fed still projects three rate increases next year. • How will Doug Jones’s election affect the Trump agenda? • But Mr. Jones’s arrival probably won’t affect the tax bill. Like what you see? Get the DealBook Briefing in your inbox each morning. Here’s the sign-up. Reuters reports: That’s the answer to the main question investors had ahead of the Fed’s policy statement on Wednesday. In a widely expected move, the Fed increased its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. It also offered improved forecasts for the United States economy. • The central bank raised its forecast for economic growth this year and next to 2.5 percent from September’s projection of 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent.

"NEW ORLEANS — Climate change made the torrential rains that flooded Houston after Hurricane Harvey last summer much worse, scientists reported Wednesday. Two research groups found that the record rainfall as Harvey stalled over Texas in late August, which totaled more than 50 inches in some areas, was as much as 38 percent higher than would be expected in a world that was not warming. While many scientists had said at the time that Harvey was probably affected by climate change, because warmer air holds more moisture, the size of the increase surprised some. “The amount of precipitation increase is worse than I expected,” said Michael J. Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an author of a paper on his group’s findings, which included the 38 percent figure. Based on how much the world has warmed, Dr. Wehner said, before the analysis he had expected an increase of only about 6 or 7 percent. The other study, by an international coalition of scientists known as World Weather Attribution, found that Harvey’s rainfall was 15 percent higher than would be expected without climate change. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the lead author of the second study, said that climate change also made such an extreme rainstorm much more likely. “The probability of such an event has increased by roughly a factor of three,” he said. While the likelihood of a Harvey-like storm was perhaps once in every 3,000 years in the past, he said, now it’s once every 1,000 years or so — which means that in any given year, there is 0.1 percent chance of a similar storm occurring along the Gulf Coast.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Roy Moore lost. Thank goodness. The United States Senate will not have among its members a proud anti-Muslim, anti-gay bigot who is the subject of multiple credible accusations of molestation. The politicians who supported Moore, starting with President Trump, and those who silently refused to condemn him, including many congressional Republicans, will forever be stained by doing so. They supported a man who rejects American values. They also supported a man who managed to lose what should have been an easy Republican win. The immediate implication of Doug Jones’s victory is that the Republican margin in the Senate will shrink to just two votes once Jones is sworn in, sometime in the next several weeks. This means the party can lose only one of its members and still pass legislation (with the vice president breaking a tie). Republicans will now be in even more of a rush to pass their tax plan. I hope the Alabama result causes at least a few of them to reflect on the folly of passing an unpopular bill that increases the deficit and hurts the middle class. Only two more Republican “no” votes can keep it from passing — and the plan violates the stated principles of at least three Republican senators (Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and John McCain). "
"(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Our introduction today comes from Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times. Just about every visitor to San Francisco knows Alcatraz. Many fewer know Angel Island, the verdant dot in the Bay where around 175,000 immigrants from China were detained, in some cases for years, during the first part of the 1900s. Angel Island was an immigration station almost exclusively used for immigrants from China. It was a symbol of the many forms of discrimination that the Chinese endured in America during the early waves of migration, a time when they played such a critical role in the development of the American West, the construction of the railroads being the most famous example. Isolated in the ghetto of Chinatown for decades, it was not until 1994 — almost a century and a half after Chinese people arrived in large numbers for the Gold Rush — that a Chinese-American, Mabel Teng, was directly elected to citywide office in San Francisco, according to David Lee, a political science lecturer at San Francisco State University. The death of San Francisco mayor, Edwin M. Lee, on Tuesday, was a coda in the belated but successful attainment of Chinese political power in the city. Today both members of the State Assembly representing San Francisco are of Chinese descent, as are members of the board of supervisors and many city officials. Mr. Lee’s ascension as mayor in 2011 was a landmark achievement for the Chinese community. “The Chinese were never fully American, never fully part of San Francisco — that is until Ed Lee became mayor,” said Mr. Lee of San Francisco State, who is not related. “It was a symbol of true political acceptance.” "
"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The word traveled, urgently and insistently, along the informal networks of black friends, black family and black co-workers: Vote. Joanice Thompson, 68, a retired worker at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, scrolled Tuesday through the text messages on her phone from relatives reminding each other what needed to be done. Byron Perkins, 56, a trial lawyer, said his Facebook feed was clogged with photos of friends sporting the little “I Voted” stickers given out at polling places. Casie Baker, 29, a bank worker, said her family prodded and cajoled and hectored each other until the voting was done. The message was largely received: African-American voters played an essential role in electing the Democrat, Doug Jones, over his scandal-scarred Republican rival, Roy S. Moore, in a special election on Tuesday for an open Senate seat that proved to be one of the most shocking upsets in recent memory. They said they were motivated by the specific fears that Mr. Moore would help President Trump cut government aid programs, reduce access to health care and neglect criminal justice reform. But they also voted out of a more general concern that the country, in the Trump era, was going back to a place best left in the past. “There’s no state in America where black people recognize the horrors of turning back the clock more than the State of Alabama,” said Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, which is based in Montgomery. “There is a consciousness about this history in the African-American community.” "
"Ask the producers and hosts of coming movie awards shows how or if they’ll be addressing the #MeToo moment, and the responses are a grab bag of no comments, dunnos, T.B.D.s and not sures. Ask the executive producer of the Screen Actors Guild Awards, or the Turner Broadcasting president responsible for the show, and they reply that yes, indeed, things will be different at their gala on Jan. 21: All 13 of their acting awards will be presented by women, as will be the two stunt awards, which will be handed out beforehand. (The show is to be broadcast on TNT and TBS.) The nominations, which were revealed Wednesday, were also announced by women, Olivia Munn and Niecy Nash, and the awards will have a host, their first: Kristen Bell. “Culturally there’s always been a conversation about equality,” said Ms. Bell, chatting Tuesday by phone. “Now there’s some mega-spotlights on this conversation and, dare I say, some pyrotechnics in the background.” “I’m not the first female host,” she added. “I’m the first host. The fact that a female was chosen to be the first one means my genitals become irrelevant.” The woman behind the plan to have women present all (or most) of the awards was Kathy Connell, the executive producer. She has overseen the ceremonies since the inaugural show in 1995, and said the thought came to her after she went to the Women’s March in Washington with her daughter and some friends in January. The idea gained new urgency, she said, as accusations of sexual misconduct by powerful men in the entertainment industry began bursting forth. “I feel pretty strongly about the women’s movement,” Ms. Connell said. “Women stepped forward in such a huge way in this last year.” "
"It was a year that felt like a decade: 2017 saw the arrival of a new president (and an at-the-ready resistance movement), the unsealing of long-held silences on abuse and consent, a radically new world order and a terrifying spate of natural and human-made disasters (fire, water, terror). It was also a year full of stuff. Fashion and commerce don’t grind to a halt even in troubling times, and the designers and retailers of the fashion world responded to turmoil as usual. They invented, rebranded, up-marketed and revitalized. It was a year that gawked at stilettos and embraced ugly sneakers; when an advocacy hat was met with an activism hat; when makeup and a glossy magazine offered a new chance at inclusion; when luxury looked to the bargain basement; and when a lion of the industry, a man seemingly out of his own times, left us too soon. What a long, strange year it has been. Here are the pieces that defined it: what we wore, we carried, wanted, feared and waited for. If the signal political fashion item of 2016 was the Make America Great Again cap — a Republican-red telegraph of support for Donald J. Trump, more instantly legible than any other accessory of a brutal, knockdown presidential race — it found  its opposite in the “pussy hat,” the unofficial headgear of  the anti-Trump resistance. When women’s marches took to the streets in Washington and cities around the country on Jan. 21, many marchers were crowned with knitted pink cat-eared beanies, their patterns  freely distributed online and their production crowdsourced by the Pussyhat Project in a viral knitting campaign of solidarity and support for women’s rights.

"Omarosa Manigault Newman, who achieved a measure of fame playing a villain on “The Apprentice” and cemented a relationship with President Trump that led to a White House appointment, will be leaving her position in January, the administration said on Wednesday. Ms. Newman “resigned yesterday to pursue other opportunities,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “Her departure will not be effective until Jan. 20, 2018. We wish her the best in future endeavors and are grateful for her service.” One of the president’s prominent African-American supporters, Ms. Newman served as the director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison. But the division, which was absent a clear leader for most of the year, atrophied with her in a key position. Two people close to the administration said Ms. Newman neglected to find enough attendees for a Black History Month event early in the administration, for instance. And the office — which is crucial for building coalitions — became seen as what one person close to the White House described as the “island of misfit toys,” where people who could not be slotted into other roles were sent. Reached by phone on Wednesday, Ms. Newman referred a reporter to Ms. Sanders’s statement about her departure. Three administration officials described reports of Ms. Newman being hauled off the White House grounds as overstated. "
"ST. PAUL — The campaign started immediately. Five minutes after being named as Al Franken’s temporary replacement in the United States Senate, Lt. Gov. Tina Smith of Minnesota said Wednesday that she would run for the job next fall, in an election for the two years left in Mr. Franken’s term. Ms. Smith’s appointment keeps a Democrat in Mr. Franken’s seat for at least a year, but also cues up a seismic 2018 election that could shift the balance of power in Minnesota and, quite possibly, in the Senate. Ms. Smith, a far less famous politician than Mr. Franken, whose resignation came amid accusations of sexual harassment, seemed eager to avoid being seen as a senator foisted upon Minnesotans. “Anybody who knows the voters of Minnesota knows that they can’t be told what to do,” Ms. Smith said at the State Capitol after Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, announced that he had appointed her. “My purpose is to go out and ask for those voters’ support, and that is my job to do.” Some Democrats here remain conflicted about Mr. Franken’s resignation, announced after some of his colleagues in Washington called on him to leave over the accusations. And Republicans, who control the Legislature but have struggled in statewide races, sense an opportunity to pick off the seat, which they had expected was out of reach until at least 2020. Next year’s ballot will also include an open race for governor — Mr. Dayton is not seeking another term — and an election for Senator Amy Klobuchar’s position. Ms. Klobuchar, a well-known Democrat, is expected to run for another six-year term. "
"LONDON — Facebook, confounding expectations, said on Wednesday that the company had found no evidence of a significant Russian effort to interfere in the British referendum last year on leaving the European Union. In an emailed statement, Facebook said the Russian agency that had spent $100,000 advertising on its platform to influence the United States presidential election last year had spent only 97 cents on advertisements that were delivered to British users during the two months before the referendum, on June 23, 2016. Those 97 cents bought three ads, all centered on immigration and aimed at American users, Facebook said. The ads were viewed just 200 times by British users over four days in May 2016, the company said. Facebook made its statement in response to questions from a committee of the British Parliament, which has sought to expand on parallel American congressional investigations around the election of Donald J. Trump as president. Damian Collins, the Conservative chairman of the committee, questioned Facebook’s findings, saying the company did not conduct a thorough search, something the company denied. Facebook executives said a search for potential foreign interference in the two months before the British vote had not turned up any Russian advertising spending other than the three ads from the Russian entity. That company, known as the Internet Research Agency, has been identified by American intelligence agencies as the troll farm the Russian government used to influence the United States election. "
"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, was not in a talking mood on Wednesday as he sped through the corridors of the Capitol. It had been roughly 12 hours since Doug Jones, a Democrat, had won election to the Senate — a victory that for Mr. McConnell spelled both bad news and good news. “It was quite an impressive election,” Mr. McConnell, of Kentucky, said tersely. “It was a big turnout, and an unusual day.” The election of Mr. Jones — the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in 25 years — will have significant consequences on the national level, making it more difficult for Republicans to enact their legislative agenda and opening, for the first time, a possible — if narrow — path to a Democratic majority in the Senate in 2018. For Mr. McConnell, it has very immediate consequences: It reduces his already razor-thin majority in the Senate to 51 from 52 votes. But it also relieves Mr. McConnell of a huge problem: having to deal with Roy S. Moore, the unpredictable Alabama Republican nominee whose candidacy was tarred by allegations that he molested a 14-year-old girl and made sexual advances toward other teenagers. Mr. McConnell called repeatedly for Mr. Moore to abandon his campaign and had pledged that Mr. Moore would face an Ethics Committee investigation the moment he arrived in the Senate — an inquiry that could have put the Senate on a torturous path to expel him. Mr. Moore, a deeply polarizing former judge who is aligned with Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, would undoubtedly have given Mr. McConnell headaches on policy matters, as well. “It’s short-term pain, long-term gain,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell, in assessing the election results. "
"WASHINGTON — The day after suffering a political blow in the Alabama special Senate election, congressional Republicans sped forward with the most sweeping tax rewrite in decades, announcing an agreement on a final bill that would cut taxes for businesses and individuals and signal the party’s first major legislative achievement since assuming political control this year. Party leaders in the House and Senate agreed in principle to bridge the yawning gaps between their competing versions of the $1.5 trillion tax bill, keeping Republicans on track for final votes next week with the aim of delivering a bill to President Trump’s desk by Christmas. The House and Senate versions of the tax bill started from the same core principles — sharply cutting taxes on businesses, while reducing rates and eliminating some breaks for individuals — but diverged on several crucial details. In the end, more of the Senate bill appeared to be included in the final version, though lawmakers continued to make significant changes from the legislation that passed either the House or the Senate. The changes included a slightly higher corporate tax rate of 21 percent, rather than the 20 percent in the legislation that passed both chambers, and a lower top individual tax rate of 37 percent for the wealthiest Americans, who currently pay 39.6 percent. But the bill will still scale back some popular tax breaks, including the state and local tax deduction and the deductibility of mortgage interest. In a break from the House bill, the agreement would allow taxpayers to continue to deduct high out-of-pocket medical expenses, and it would retain a provision allowing graduate students who receive tuition waivers to avoid paying taxes on that benefit. Also included in the consensus bill is the Senate’s repeal of the Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty and a provision that opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to energy exploration. Still unclear is the overall cost of the revised legislation, which cannot exceed the $1.5 trillion bucket that lawmakers have allowed if they want to pass the bill without Democratic support. Several of the provisions added by the Senate to help pay for the overall bill were either reversed or scaled back in the consensus version, and some tax breaks eliminated by the House were added back in.

"HONG KONG — Google pulled some of its core businesses out of China seven years ago, after concluding that government controls and surveillance ran counter to its commitment to a free and open internet. Since then, as China’s online scene has grown and prospered, the American search giant has been looking for ways to tiptoe back in. On Wednesday, it unveiled a small but symbolically significant move toward that end: a China-based center devoted to artificial intelligence. The move nods to the country’s growing strength in A.I., thanks to substantial government funding prompted by Beijing’s ambition of having a say in the technologies of the future. Google said the center would have a team of experts in Beijing, where the company has hundreds of employees in research and development, as well as other roles. The center will be led by Fei-Fei Li, who runs Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Lab and leads the artificial intelligence arm of Google’s Cloud business, and Jia Li, the head of research and development for the A.I. division of Google Cloud. The Silicon Valley company, which announced the center’s opening at a software developer conference in Shanghai, cited China’s growing academic and technical contributions to the A.I. field, and said the new center would be “working closely with the vibrant Chinese A.I. research community.” “The science of A.I. has no borders,” Fei-Fei Li said in a post on Google’s website, and “neither do its benefits.” "
"Roy Moore’s stunning defeat in the Alabama special Senate election last night was a temporary setback for the forces of Trumpism that have gripped the Republican Party. It has been clear in recent weeks that not everyone is thrilled by the direction of the Republican Party in the Trump era. Just this week, Joyce Simmons, the Nebraska Republican National Committeewoman, stepped away from her role with the party in response to its support for Mr. Moore. Depressed turnout in reliably Republican areas of Alabama on Tuesday suggest Ms. Simmons was not alone in taking a stand and saying “enough.” Certainly, most Republicans are quite fond of President Trump and the direction he has taken the party. Yet in the wake of the Moore defeat — a concrete sign that Trumpism alone may not be able to sustain the party — dismayed Republicans across the country are left to decide: stay and fight, or simply flee? “This fever will someday break,” Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said in October, “and we can rebuild our party once more.” He decided to neither fight (and seek re-election) nor flee his party. I often hear that sentiment — that what we are experiencing is just a blip — along with the belief that eventually a new generation of Republican leaders will rise up to save the party and the country. Republicans skeptical of a “Trumpified” party should not be so sure. There is no guarantee that young Republicans will produce the green shoots to rebuild the party. Young voters in particular are burning off from both parties — especially the Republican Party — and becoming independents, and the remaining partisans are a more highly concentrated hard-line group.

"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — The once-unimaginable Republican defeat in Alabama’s special Senate election on Tuesday tore open divisions between the party’s establishment and populist wings, inciting bitter recriminations in the Republican Party as Democratic enthusiasm surges — especially in the nation’s cities and affluent suburbs. While the accusations of child molestation and teenage sexual abuse made Roy S. Moore a uniquely poor candidate, it was not lost on Republicans that Democrats, black and white, had flooded to the polls here just over a month after voters in Virginia overwhelmingly rejected Republican candidates. In Alabama, a state that Donald J. Trump won by 28 points last year, exit polls showed that as many voters disapproved of the president as approved of him, an ominous sign for Republicans that revealed both soaring Democratic intensity and growing dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump among moderate voters. “The side that has the energy and anger and enthusiasm usually prevails,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. “And Democrats don’t have to be for anything, they just have to be against us.” Republicans are now bracing for the possibility of another unexpectedly difficult special election, in March, this one in a conservative-leaning House district in western Pennsylvania, and they are resigned to having to spend money to protect what has been a safe seat. Further, Mr. Dent, who has already said he will not seek re-election next year, confirmed he has had conversations with TV news executives about becoming an analyst, raising the possibility that he would leave his seat early and create yet another special election for his party. (“I have no definitive plans,” he said.) And the seemingly unremitting stream of accusations from women about male lawmakers committing sexual misconduct is raising the possibility of even more unexpected resignations, which could at a minimum cause Republicans to have to direct more cash toward races for which they had not planned.

"LONDON — Dog lovers tend to find each other in life, for the rest of humanity is, after all, suspect. On a long flight recently, I fell into a conversation with a woman about dogs. It turned into a conversation about disobedience, and the world’s current need for it. When immense power is in erratic and belligerent hands, as it is today in the United States, the readiness of subordinates to disobey becomes critical. “Befehl ist befehl” — an order is an order — was the German principle that enabled the Nazis’ industrialized mass murder. The woman had been training her pet to become a guide dog. The dog did well until the phase of training dedicated to learning disobedience. A dog trained to lead a blind person needs to refuse orders if the direction received would lead into the path of a car, or onto a subway track, or over a precipice. Her dog had failed this part of the training and became depressed. Dogs are naturally joyous. Seeing them listless is hard. We talked about feeling bad for your dog — a vast subject to dog lovers. But the story of this dog’s failure was also reassuring. It suggested that disobedience is a higher cognitive skill than obedience, and affirmed how essential it can be. (One of the worrisome things about drones is that they won’t disobey.) Jim Kutsch, the president of The Seeing Eye in Morristown, N.J., the nation’s oldest organization training guide dogs for the blind, told me recently: “In all other cases, the human gives a command and the dog is expected to obey that command.” He continued, “In the case of the Seeing Eye dog, the dog is obligated to decide whether the command makes sense. The dog needs to stand still, or turn left or right, and lead me away from danger.” "
"In one of his first acts as president, Barack Obama signed executive orders closing this country’s secret prisons overseas, banning torture and authorizing an end to the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Obviously, Mr. Obama didn’t fully get his way. Guantánamo, though reduced to a few dozen prisoners, is still operating. And the current president has expressed full faith in the harsh methods described euphemistically as enhanced interrogation techniques. “Don’t tell me it doesn’t work — torture works,” Donald Trump insisted during the 2016 presidential campaign. Standing behind Mr. Obama as he signed those orders on Jan. 22, 2009, were 16 retired generals and admirals who had his back, figuratively as well as literally. They were hardly soft-on-terrorism types. A few were lifelong Republicans. But these military men, working with Human Rights First, felt a moral imperative to oppose torture. They were convinced that it not only trampled core American principles, but also produced useless intelligence while potentially endangering United States troops who might fall into enemy hands. A leader of that group was James Cullen, a retired brigadier general who had begun Army life as a private during the Vietnam War. He became a lawyer, serving for many years in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps, and later in private practice. In alliance with the human rights group, he and his once-uniformed colleagues lobbied major politicians to support a ban on coercive interrogations. General Cullen died in Scarsdale, N.Y., last week at age 72. His death is a reminder of how former military men and women of conscience and courage can provide helpful support for the civilian leadership — and, if necessary, be a bulwark against the worst instincts that at times grab hold of it. We are living in one of those times, with a president whose respect for the rule of law is meager and whose expressed affinity for waterboarding and “a hell of a lot worse” is strong. Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with retired generals, and many Americans are counting on them to restrain his most reckless impulses. The endless barrage of insults and threats from the tweeter in chief — plus decisions running counter to sound national security policy — shows that efforts to rein him in have been mixed at best. After an Uzbeki immigrant plowed a pickup truck into people in Lower Manhattan on Halloween, killing eight of them, the president’s reflex was to “send him to Gitmo” — something never done with anyone arrested on American soil.

I hate to bore you with technical jargon, but I suppose it’s important, in the interest of nonpartisan professional transparency, to offer some insight into my methodology. First of all, as a very good sexual harassment investigator, I know that one of the sexual harasser’s classic tells is a history of repeatedly sexually harassing women, or talking about sexually harassing women, in public, either on the internet or on video or on the record with reporters, perhaps as recently as today. A second thing that investigators like me are trained to look for is whether or not saying degrading things about women like a cartoon sex creep is kind of an accused harasser’s whole deal. A third subtle and suspicious clue is if you, the investigator, recently woke up to 17 news alerts on your phone that say, “[Accused Harasser] Just Sexually Harassed [Female Senator] in Front of Everyone Just Now!” Armed with these parameters, I began my investigation by thinking about Donald Trump for an infinitesimally small measurement of time, the barest whisper of consciousness, a mayfly’s breath. And I have some terrible news, America. It is with 100 percent professional certainty that I must inform you our president, Donald Trump, is a sexual harasser, on account of all of the sexual harassment he constantly does. I know this comes as a shock. App-based pay-per-minute grief counselors will be on call at your neighborhood Costco; they are not covered by insurance, but they are covered by In-Churro-Ance™, the Republicans’ Obamacare replacement run by Taco Bell. Caliente savings! Live más! That’s not to say that we shouldn’t subject Donald Trump and every politician accused of sexual misconduct to a rigorous, standardized ethics investigation — we absolutely should — just that I am so tired of participating in the collective national farce that things happening right in front of our eyes might not really be happening. That we do not already know the truth about what our president and the nation he rules think about women. We know. Anyone who says he doesn’t know is lying. The term “sexual harassment,” used here in a social sense, not a legal one, refers to a spectrum of behaviors from unwanted sexual advances to belittling, intimidating or uncomfortable sexual comments. In other words, a spectrum of behaviors that Donald Trump engages in all the time. Barging into the dressing rooms of Miss Teen USA in order to see teenage girls naked (“I sort of get away with things like that,” Trump once told Howard Stern); calling Caitríona Perry, a reporter from Ireland, up to his desk to tell her she has a “nice smile”; once speculating, while seated next to his daughter, Ivanka, that if he weren’t her father, “perhaps I’d be dating her”; instructing a female “Apprentice” contestant to stand and twirl so the male contestants could rate her body; implying, as he did on Twitter Tuesday morning, that his professional colleague Senator Kirsten Gillibrand offered him sexual favors for political donations; bragging about forcibly kissing women and grabbing their genitals — I don’t have to keep listing them, do I? Trump’s own interviews, memoirs, news conferences and Twitter feed evince a pattern of sexual degradation, objectification and assault stretching back decades. Not only does Trump not try to hide these behaviors from the public, he brags and laughs about them. They are, to a certain set of Americans, what makes Trump a real man. Mitch McConnell reassured the public this week that if Roy Moore won the Alabama special election (R.I.P.), he would have been subject to an ethics investigation. How comforting for the teenage girls of America to know that their government is happy to elect a man like Moore first and ask questions later, as long as he’s openly nostalgic for slavery. Investigation, due process, objectivity — yes, these are fundamental to our justice system. And yes, Congress (like any workplace) needs some sort of routine and fair internal protocol for addressing sexual misconduct allegations. But in the far less rigid and more mercurial court of public opinion, we, as a populace, must remain cognizant of the fact that spinning eternally in the “investigation” stage is a well-established right-wing tactic to avoid meaningful action.

"For more than two hours on Tuesday night, many Americans bit their nails and glued themselves to a screen as the votes rolled in. Then, in a matter of minutes, media outlets — in rapid succession — called the Alabama Senate race for Doug Jones, a Democrat who defeated Roy S. Moore, a Republican accused of sexual abuse and child molestation. And almost as quickly, high-profile politicians took to Twitter to weigh in. Just after 11 p.m., President Trump congratulated Mr. Jones on his favored platform, arguing that “the write-in votes played a very big factor” in the outcome, though he also acknowledged that “a win is a win.” About 22,800 write-in votes had been counted. Just before midnight on Tuesday, Mr. Jones was more than 20,000 votes ahead of Mr. Moore with all the precincts having reported. (Mr. Moore did not concede defeat late Tuesday.) Still, Mr. Trump forged ahead. “The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time,” he said on Twitter. “It never ends! Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, said on Twitter that Alabama voters had elected a senator who would “make them proud.” “And if Democrats can win in Alabama, we can — and must — compete everywhere,” she said. “Onward!” Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, released a statement that both praised Mr. Jones and excoriated Mr. Moore. “Doug Jones will be an outstanding Senator who will represent Alabama well. He was a great candidate and will be an even better Senator,” Mr. Schumer said. “Roy Moore was an awful candidate and never should have gotten to the Senate. But make no mistake about it, just like in Virginia, Democrats are energized, focused on the middle class and those struggling to get there, and things are looking better and better for 2018.” Many Republican politicians remained relatively quiet on Tuesday night. But one who spoke out was Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who sent a check to Mr. Jones’s campaign this month and posted a photo of it on Twitter. He kept his comments concise on Tuesday. In an apparent reference to the allegations of sexual abuse against Mr. Moore, Mr. Flake tweeted simply: “Decency wins.” "
"There are so many things I could say right now after watching Doug Jones defeat Roy Moore in the Senate race in Alabama, but for me it comes down to just two words: “Thank you.” Thank you to the majority of Alabamians for loving our country more than you hated Democrats. Thank you for voting as citizens, not as members of a tribe. Thank you for understanding that sending a credibly accused child molester to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate would not only have denigrated your state, it would have denigrated that whole legislative body. Thank you for seeing the decency of Doug Jones, even though he is a Democrat, and seeing the indecency of Roy Moore. And most of all, thank you for sending a message to Donald Trump and Stephen Bannon that you are not as dumb as they think you are. That you see what they are up to — trying to use divisive tweets and racist dog whistles to get as many Americans as possible so aroused and inflamed that they won’t think about the real issues, they won’t think about the actual candidates, they won’t think about the national interest, or even their own self-interest, but just how much they dislike “the other” — and you’re not buying it any more. God bless every one of you. Yours was a deeply patriotic act. It’s too soon to say for sure, of course, whether this is a national trend, but when the majority in a deep-red state like Alabama — where anti-abortion sentiments run so high, making it nearly impossible for a pro-choice Democrat to be elected — repudiates the effort by Trump and Bannon to turn us from citizens into tribes, there is hope for the country after all. It is a real sign of health. I speak from some experience, because I have peered into this tribal abyss. Back in the late 1970s, when I was covering the Lebanese civil war, a story made the rounds in Beirut that the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia had come up with a novel way of discovering a Palestinian trying to pass through one of its checkpoints. The Phalangists would show the driver a tomato and ask: What’s this? If the driver used the standard Lebanese pronunciation, “banadurra,” he was allowed to pass. If he used the Palestinian pronunciation, “bandora,” he could be pulled out of his car and shot on the spot. That is tribal politics at its raw essence: It doesn’t matter how you live your life or what you aspire to for your society. All that matters is your sectarian or tribal identity, revealed by how you pronounce the word for tomato. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • In the Southern U.S. state of Alabama, Democrats celebrated the unlikely victory of their candidate, Doug Jones, above, in an election to fill a crucial Senate seat. (Here are detailed results.) The upset trims the Republican majority in the Senate to one. And it is a snub to President Trump, who backed Roy Moore, the Republican candidate, despite accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Earlier in the day Mr. Trump lashed out at his own accusers as fabricators and insulted a female senator as someone who “would do anything” for campaign contributions. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are near an agreement on a tax bill and began work on dismantling Obama-era rules on higher education. _____ "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump does not readily admit defeat. Knocked to the mat in Alabama with the stunning loss of a Senate seat, he got right back up on Wednesday and defiantly claimed that he had known his candidate would lose all along. He may have been humbled by voters, but Mr. Trump does not exactly do humble. Aides to the temperamental president reported being pleasantly surprised that he did not rage against the setback in private, as he is wont to do in moments of difficulty. But neither did he concede a mistake in backing the Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, despite sexual misconduct allegations, attributing the loss to Mr. Moore and the national party establishment that abandoned him. All but ignoring the political earthquake in Alabama in public appearances on Wednesday, Mr. Trump pushed forward with his drive for major tax cuts, giving little indication that he shared his party’s panic about potentially worse defeats to come in next year’s midterm congressional elections. While aides anticipate possible staff changes, Mr. Trump showed no signs of shifting from the strident, base-oriented politics that have animated his presidency. “I don’t think it’s going to affect it,” Mr. Trump said of the election’s impact on his agenda as he met with Republican lawmakers writing the final version of his tax legislation. “I think we’re doing a lot. This is the biggest thing that we’ve worked on.” Behind the scenes, some advisers hoped the loss would persuade Mr. Trump to stop listening to Stephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist who has vowed war against the Republican establishment. But Mr. Trump talked with Mr. Bannon for 15 minutes by phone on Tuesday, aides said, and seemed disinclined to cut the adviser from his circle. Nor was it clear that Mr. Trump was any more eager to reach across the aisle and build new coalitions with Democrats even as his party’s control of the Senate narrowed to a single seat. With Wednesday’s agreement on a final tax cut bill, Mr. Trump seems poised to push through his first major achievement after a year of legislative frustrations, but it remained uncertain how he would proceed after that. "
"In one of the strange rhymes that history favors, nearly eight years after Barack Obama’s Democrats managed the extraordinary feat of losing a senate race in Massachusetts, Donald Trump’s Republicans have matched the feat by losing a senate seat in Alabama. Roy Moore and Martha Coakley don’t really have a lot in common personally, but their respective defeats have one essential similarity. They are both stark repudiations of a first-term president, foreshadowing a larger repudiation soon to come. What was repudiated in Massachusetts in early 2010 was a specific policy course: The Obama White House’s pursuit of a sweeping and complex health care bill in the teeth of an enormous recession, which unsettled voters who wanted hope and change only so long as the latter didn’t affect their health-insurance premiums. The fact that Coakley was a terrible candidate made it easier for Scott Brown to torpedo her, but the backlash against Obamacare, the feeling that a liberal president had turned too soon from seeking growth to seeking redistribution, was an essential element in her defeat. There is an unpopular Republican tax bill now to echo the unpopular Democratic health care bill eight years ago, but policy is a much smaller part of what was repudiated last night in Alabama. It was not so much a rejection of the Trump agenda as it was a rejection of the whole Trumpian mode of politics, which since our president’s election has consisted of a trebling down on the most unattractive features of his campaign style, a fervent commitment to “triggering the libs” shorn of any populist substance, and a cocksure assumption that any Republicans who aren’t in it for the liberal-triggering care enough about judges and abortion or their tax cuts or the soaring stock market to swallow hard and go along. Roy Moore, in this sense, was Trump’s Trump — the man who took this mode of politics to 11 and beyond. The president has harassment accusations; the judge had mall-trawling accusations. Trump is a race-baiter; Moore was a stock character from a message movie about Southern bigotry. Trump’s populism mixed reasonable grievances in together with some stupid ones; Moore’s populism was the purest ressentiment. And like Trump but much, much more so, the Moore campaign relied on the assumption that Republicans who didn’t care for who he was and what he represented simply had nowhere else to go. So while Moore’s defeat is, yes, specific to him, specific to the statutory rape accusations and all the rest of his problems as a candidate, it’s also a pretty clear foretaste of what you get when you distill white identity politics to a nasty essence and then try to build a coalition around it. You get massive Democratic turnout, black turnout in particular, slumping Republican turnout, and a whole lot of write-in votes from people who should be your supporters. You get Democrats winning elections in the most unlikely places. And you get, quite probably, a Democratic majority in the House and perhaps even the Senate. "
"With Roy Moore’s humiliating loss in the Alabama Senate race, the Trumpified Republican Party finds itself both defeated and dishonored, with no sign that it has yet hit bottom. At every stage of the run-up to this special election, Republicans could have resisted, pushed back, or drawn lines, but their failure to do so led them inexorably to this moment: the defeat of an unreconstructed bigot and ignorant crank who had the full-throated backing of the president they have embraced and empowered. It may be worthwhile charting the party’s descent to this moment. Think of it as a drama in four acts. In Act I, the curtain opens to reveal a gaudy golden escalator, and as Donald Trump descends to announce his candidacy for president, the scene has the feel of a French farce. But the humor is tinged with menace, as his lies and insults pile up, targeting women, the disabled and minorities. As the curtain closes, it is unclear whether Republicans will bring themselves to embrace the erratic usurper. (Exit Jeb! stage right.) The mood is more somber in Act II, as Republicans ponder their choice. A solitary Hamlet-like Paul Ryan paces the stage in a torn doublet and laments the evil days that have fallen on his party; he is accompanied by a Joker (who looks a lot like Lindsey Graham) who tells him that Donald Trump is a “kook,” someone who is “not fit to run the country.” But after several long monologues, in which he rationalizes that “there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so,” the young Mr. Ryan decides that the election is a binary choice and he and other Republicans must go along. He wavers after Mr. Trump engages in what he calls a “textbook definition” of racism and is caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women. Other women come forward, but they are largely ignored. Republicans make the choice to stick with him and to everyone’s surprise, Donald Trump wins. (Exit Mr. Ryan and Joker stage left.) Act III opens to a scene shortly after the inauguration. One after another, Republican leaders bow the knee to the newly enthroned Orange God King, who is surrounded by a motley court of misfits, sycophants and brigands. Even as Mr. Trump’s behavior becomes increasingly outrageous and often unhinged, the party’s grandees appease and flatter him. Courtiers, who come and go, repeatedly reassure him that he is winning. After all, he is giving them what they want: judges, tax cuts, deregulation and an end to Obamacare mandates. Enter Paul Ryan, who is better dressed and a much more cheerful character in this act. He is asked: What choice would Republicans now make? "
"Mobile, Ala. — Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are politically impotent. The president and his former grand strategist threw considerable weight behind Roy Moore, the polarizing Republican Senate candidate in Alabama. For the second time this year, the state that gave Mr. Trump crucial early support during the presidential campaign — and his first senatorial endorsement — has rejected the candidate Mr. Trump endorsed for the Senate. Extraordinarily high turnout among African-American voters pulled the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, a former United States attorney, to a narrow victory. Mr. Moore was held back by a significant resort to write-in ballots (some 1.7 percent of the total, a fact on which Mr. Trump quickly fixated) that presumably came from voters who ordinarily lean Republican — suburban professionals, especially women — along with tens of thousands fewer suburban Republicans voting at all. For example, in Shelby County, neighboring Birmingham, Mr. Trump earned 73,000 votes and a 51,000-vote margin, but it appears that Mr. Moore won 36,000 votes and a 9,000-vote margin. The last four days of the race, though, featured a series of embarrassments for Mr. Moore, several stemming from re-unearthed interviews of his and several more involving gaffes by his team at Mr. Moore’s final campaign rally. As played through the social-media filter (meaning relevant context sometimes was lost), the interviews showed Mr. Moore saying: 1) life was better early in American history despite the existence of slavery; 2) American immorality may well make the United States the focus of evil in the modern world; and 3) all constitutional amendments after the 10th — thus including the antislavery amendments and the one giving women the vote — should be repealed. His own team’s gaffes included one rally speaker talking about the time he and Mr. Moore walked into a brothel featuring teenagers (Mr. Moore insisted they walk right back out). At the same election eve rally, Mr. Bannon blasted MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough for attending a worse college than Mr. Bannon did — a snobbish remark in the best of circumstances, made worse by the fact that Mr. Scarborough’s alma mater is the University of Alabama. To top it off, Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla, played into the most obvious of stereotypes when she told those assembled that she and her husband must not be anti-Semitic because “one of our attorneys is a Jew.” "
"WASHINGTON — Doug Jones’s defeat of Roy S. Moore in Tuesday’s bitterly fought special Senate election was one of the most unlikely upsets in recent campaign history. But the Democrats’ victory in Alabama carries some more immediate political implications. Voters in Alabama’s cities and most affluent suburbs overwhelmingly rejected Mr. Moore’s candidacy, an ominous sign for Republicans on the ballot next year in upscale districts. In Jefferson County, which includes Birmingham and some of the state’s wealthiest enclaves, Mr. Jones, the Democratic candidate, captured more than 68 percent of the vote. And in Madison County, home to Huntsville and a large NASA facility, Mr. Jones won 57 percent of the vote. While these Alabamians, many of them women, may have been appalled by the claims of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moore, results like these were not isolated to this race. They mirrored returns in last month’s statewide and legislative races in Virginia, a state filled with well-heeled suburbanites. These highly educated and high-income voters, while often open to supporting Republicans, are uneasy with the hard-edged politics of President Trump and part of the reason his approval ratings are so dismal. If Republican candidates facing well-off voters next year do not find a way to separate themselves from the president, they will face a punishing midterm election next year. "
"You took nearly two million photos of Barack Obama as his chief official White House photographer. Everyone knows the situation-room photo, everyone knows “Hair Like Mine.” Can you tell in the moment when a picture is going to go viral? Most of the time you’re sort of aware that you’ve captured a really important moment. The day of the bin Laden raid, I think I shot like a thousand photos. The one of the little kid touching his head, it just happened so fast I didn’t realize the significance of the photo until I actually saw it at the end of the day. What is your favorite photo that isn’t famous? It’s a picture of the president on vacation in Hawaii. He’s got his arm around Malia, and on the right side of the frame is Denis McDonough on the phone, about to hand the phone to the president for a conference call with his national-security team after the underwear-bomber incident. It shows when two worlds of being a dad and being a president collide, and that happens when you least expect it. Did having such an intimate look at the inner workings of government for eight years affect how you personally consider politics? I can’t tell you how proud I am to have seen that there are actually a lot of people trying to do good. I was a photographer in the Reagan administration, and I would say the same thing about them. You had to travel everywhere that the president traveled, but you weren’t the president. Did you ever think: Look, do you really need photos of this trip? I’m exhausted. I took one sick day in eight years, and there were times where I didn’t feel good, but I still came in. If you’re truly going to document history, you don’t want to miss anything. You took only one sick day in eight years? I had a colonoscopy, and I had to go under anesthesia. I was ready to go in, but the doctors said it would not be a good idea. "
"This was a terrible year for the tech industry. That’s an odd thing to say at a time of record growth and profits. In 2017, large American tech companies have kept hauling in more money and more users, and — to a degree that might seem dystopian — they continued to expand their foothold in our lives. This was a year in which Amazon created a way for its delivery drivers to let themselves into your house, and Apple created a phone you can unlock with your face. Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point. Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely. Let me explain how this is all playing out. “Platforms” are the shiniest prizes in the tech business. The reason the five most valuable American tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft — are also the five most valuable American companies of any kind is that they own these fundamental building blocks of the digital economy, whether they are operating systems, app stores, social networks, cloud servers, or shipping and logistics infrastructure. Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy — an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn’t live in a secluded cabin in the woods. For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren’t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story. "
"WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein adamantly defended the character and impartiality of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, as he came head-to-head on Wednesday with an increasingly aggressive campaign by Republicans to discredit the inquiry. The Republicans’ effort received a fresh jolt from the release one night earlier of text messages exchanged last year between an F.B.I. agent, Peter Strzok, and an F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page, describing the possibility of an election victory by President Trump as “terrifying” and saying that Hillary Clinton “just has to win.” Mr. Mueller removed Mr. Strzok from the Russia investigation as soon as he learned of the texts, a step that Mr. Rosenstein praised. Nonetheless, Republicans used the messages as fodder to attack the impartiality of Mr. Mueller during an appearance by Mr. Rosenstein before the House Judiciary Committee. “The public trust in this whole thing is gone,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, summing up sentiments among his party. “It seems to me there are two things you can do: You can disband the Mueller special prosecutor, and you can do what we’ve all called for and appoint a second special counsel to look into this.” But the swelling campaign to undermine Mr. Mueller’s investigation, which has dominated conservative media for days, appeared to have little effect on Mr. Rosenstein, who oversees Mr. Mueller. Mr. Rosenstein said he would only fire Mr. Mueller if he had cause under Justice Department regulations — and he said nothing that has happened so far met that standard. Instead, Mr. Rosenstein mounted a step-by-step defense of Mr. Mueller’s conduct. He noted that department rules prevented Mr. Mueller from taking political affiliation into consideration when hiring for career positions, and he distinguished between officials holding political views and making investigative decisions out of bias. He said Mr. Mueller would be careful not to allow the latter. "
"A shake-up in global coal trading has delivered some oxygen to the struggling American mining industry, driving up exports to energy-hungry countries. But the relief may not last. United States coal sales abroad over the first three quarters of the year surpassed exports for all of 2016, according to government figures. Energy experts project an increase of 46 percent for the full year, adding more than $1 billion to coal companies’ revenues. Those are crucial dollars for an industry trying to stabilize itself after nearly a decade of declining prices, expanding competition from natural gas and wind and solar energy, and bankruptcies. Domestic coal-fired power plants continue to close despite promises of regulatory relief by the Trump administration, making the exports all the more critical. The upturn in exports has been particularly helpful to Appalachia, where production is up 11 percent this year. Coal executives attribute the increase mostly to exports, especially of coal for making steel, known as coking coal. Alpha Natural Resources, which came out of bankruptcy in 2016 and exports half of its coking coal production, opened a new mine this year in economically depressed West Virginia, employing 35 workers. In Virginia, several privately held coal companies are adding shifts and drilling new mine sections for the first time in five years to export more coking coal. “Exports are certainly an opportunity for growth,” said John Stranak, the treasurer at Cloud Peak Energy, a major producer in Wyoming and Montana. “Pricing for exports is outpacing sales domestically. The growth in that arena is certainly where we would like to focus.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, buoyed by a steadily strengthening economy, raised interest rates on Wednesday for a fifth time since the financial crisis and predicted that a proposed tax cut moving through Congress would modestly increase economic growth for the next few years without stoking inflation. As a result, the Fed said it did not expect the legislation, which President Trump has called “rocket fuel” for the economy, to accelerate the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates in 2018 and indicated it remains on track for three rate increases next year. The Fed’s highly anticipated economic assessment, delivered after a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee, amounted to a lukewarm endorsement of the Trump administration’s top economic priority. Mr. Trump has suggested that the $1.5 trillion tax cut could nearly double economic growth to as much as 6 percent, a level far greater than most economists think likely. “My colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists,” said Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman. She said they expected the bill to provide “a modest lift.” Ms. Yellen spoke at a news conference after the Fed announced a widely expected decision to increase its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. The increase continues the Fed’s gradual march toward higher rates, which were cut to near-zero during the financial crisis. Wednesday’s increase is the third time this year that the Fed has raised rates, reflecting its confidence that the economy is in good health. The Fed and Congress are moving in opposite directions. The Fed, in raising rates, is reducing the support it has provided to the economy since the financial crisis. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are preparing a $1.5 trillion tax cut for businesses and individuals with the aim of stimulating economic growth. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. The late-night shows all taped on Tuesday before Alabama’s Senate election results came in. But they did have time to respond to some of the day’s news — particularly the video of the Republican candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, riding to the polls on horseback. Watching Mr. Moore’s ride, Stephen Colbert gave him a not-so-friendly greeting. The singer Harry Styles came to James Corden’s aid on Tuesday, hosting “The Late Late Show” after Mr. Corden’s wife went into labor. She later gave birth to a daughter. Mr. Styles took the opportunity to poke fun at his friend. Imagine the TV show “Riverdale” — as Charles Schultz’s “Peanuts.” Seth Meyers took Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla, to task for trying to defend him by pointing out that one of his lawyers “is a Jew.” Dennis Rodman, who is increasingly being called America’s unofficial ambassador to North Korea, will chat with Mr. Colbert on Wednesday. Our film critic was surprised by how much she enjoyed the new Star Wars movie. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • For once, Doug Jones said, Alabama declined to take “the wrong fork” at a political crossroads. The former prosecutor defeated Roy Moore in a special election on Tuesday, an almost-unimagined victory for Democrats that shaves Republicans’ Senate majority to a single seat. Here are the full results, and four takeaways from the election, including robust turnout by black voters. There were over 22,000 write-in votes, more than the margin of victory. Mr. Jones’s win could complicate the Republicans’ legislative agenda in Washington. It also amounts to a snub of President Trump, who had broken with most of his party and embraced the scandal-scarred Mr. Moore. • Watch Tuesday night’s speeches by Mr. Jones and Mr. Moore, who has not conceded. • President Trump repeated on Tuesday his contention that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated the allegations. He also described Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, one of his leading critics, as a “lightweight” who “would do anything” for campaign contributions. "
"TOKYO — Toshiba has cleared one of the last remaining hurdles to a planned sale of its microchip subsidiary and moved a step away from the financial brink. The struggling Japanese conglomerate said Wednesday that it had settled a legal dispute with Western Digital, the American data storage company, that threatened to block the microchip deal. Toshiba is counting on the sale to bring in about $14 billion in much-needed cash after its losses on nuclear power projects in the United States left its finances in tatters. Toshiba and Western Digital said Wednesday that they had agreed to withdraw a cluster of lawsuits and arbitration claims over the deal that they had filed against each other. Under that deal, Toshiba plans to cede a majority stake in the chip subsidiary to a group of investors led by the investment firm Bain Capital. “With the concerns about litigation and arbitration removed, we look forward to renewing our collaboration with Western Digital,” Yasuo Naruke, Toshiba executive vice president and chief executive of the microchip unit, Toshiba Memory Corporation, said in a statement. He added, “Toshiba also remains on track to complete our transaction with the consortium led by Bain Capital.” Toshiba signed a deal in September, after months of tumultuous negotiations, to sell 60 percent of Toshiba Memory Corporation to the Bain-led group, whose members also include Apple and other technology companies that rely on Toshiba’s NAND flash memory chips to make their products.

"To the Editor: Re “Democrat Wins Pivotal Alabama Senate Seat” (front page, Dec. 13): I would like to thank the state of Alabama for carrying our country on your backs on Tuesday and pointing us toward humanity and fairness. I thank, with a lump in my throat, the African-American community, which was pivotal in defeating Roy Moore, turning out in tremendous numbers to vote for Doug Jones. According to exit polls, black women voted 98 percent for Mr. Jones. I also give thanks to the righteous Republicans who helped decency win, such as Condoleezza Rice, Jeff Flake and Richard Shelby (write in!). Right on! And thanks to the basketball star Charles Barkley. Your words were a force. Thank you for helping to galvanize the vote. And finally to Doug Jones, and every single voter and volunteer in Alabama who helped shift the Trump trajectory, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. WENDY MISSAN, MILLBURN, N.J. To the Editor: It may be hard to believe, but there was actually a time when the Republican leadership thought that credible sexual misconduct allegations against their own were disqualifying. In 1995, for example, Senator Bob Packwood was forced out of office by his G.O.P. colleagues after he was accused of sexual assault. "
"Look back on footage from 75 years of the Golden Globes. And Ed Helms hosts a fake news show. THE FAKE NEWS WITH TED NELMS 10 p.m. on Comedy Central. For five years, Ed Helms honed his comedy-journalism chops as a field reporter on “The Daily Show,” traveling the world to report on Speedos and controversial art.

When the Indiana Pacers All-Star Paul George was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder last summer, many analysts panned the deal, predicting it would send the Thunder straight to title contention and the Pacers to the cellar. That hasn’t happend, as the star-studded Thunder have failed to mesh, while the upstart Pacers, led by one of those traded players, Victor Oladipo, have raced to a 16-11 start. Oladipo and George will face their former teams on Wednesday; don’t be surprised if it gets chippy. THE LIBRARIANS 8 p.m. on TNT. The title might sound mundane, but this show isn’t about bookworms: It follows a group of experts in various fields who maintain and protect the secret library where the world’s magical artifacts are kept.

"WASHINGTON — More than one million people signed up last week for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, pushing the total in the federal marketplace to nearly 4.7 million, the Trump administration said Wednesday, days before the annual enrollment period is scheduled to end. The number of sign-ups on HealthCare.gov from Nov. 1 through Saturday was about 17 percent higher than the same time last year. But the final tally is likely to fall short of the 9.2 million who were in plans at the end of the last open enrollment period, which was twice as long as the current one. Insurance counselors around the country, who help consumers enroll, said they had seen a surge of activity despite sharp increases in premiums, a smaller selection of health plans and confusion about the future of the Affordable Care Act after a year in which Republicans have repeatedly tried to dismantle the law. About 1.4 million new customers have signed up this year, and 3.3 million people returned to HealthCare.gov to select the same plan or a different one for 2018. People who have coverage this year and take no action may have their coverage automatically renewed. If their plan is no longer available, the government may assign them to another health plan offered by the same company or a different insurer, and that could significantly increase overall enrollment. The numbers reported on Wednesday were for the 39 states that use HealthCare.gov. They do not include data for 11 states that run their own insurance marketplaces. "

"On the day before the Alabama election, I found myself explaining that I needed to get to work despite the bombing at my subway station because there were women coming in to talk about having been sexually assaulted by the president. Really, we live in interesting times. The bombing — in which no one was seriously hurt but the bomber — has already faded from the memory of New York’s hardened mass transit riders. But the rest of the story is reverberating. We’re in the middle of a women’s uprising that really does feel like a new wave, maybe the one that could actually get the country within shouting distance of power equality. Think about it. This week Roy Moore got skunked in Alabama, thanks in great part to female voters who went for the Democratic candidate instead. Then the U.S. Senate got ready for another woman member — Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith is going to replace Al Franken, who is resigning in the sexual harassment scandal. We have a revolt against sexual harassment that’s running through the political, entertainment, restaurant and communications worlds. And we’re finally trying to focus on the Donald Trump sleaziness sagas that the nation didn’t deal with in 2016. Trump is really behind everything — his election jarred and frightened women so much that there was nothing to do but rebel and try to change the world. “I think it’s very much because of President Trump,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. “For me the Women’s March was still the most extraordinary political moment of my lifetime.” Gillibrand is a leader of the antiharassment campaign in Congress. This week, as some of the women who had stories about Trump’s own hands-on history were talking to the media, she called on the president to resign. Trump responded — as only he can — with a Twitter attack, calling Gillibrand a political “lightweight” who used to come to him “begging” for campaign contributions, “and would do anything for them.” "
"Over the last eight years, political analysts had come to think that Democrats were at a distinct disadvantage in midterm elections, since their younger and nonwhite coalition was less likely to turn out than older and white voters. It is time to retire that notion. Tuesday in Alabama, Democrats benefited from strong turnout that plainly exceeded midterm levels, while white working-class Republicans voted in weaker numbers. It was enough to send Doug Jones to the Senate instead of Roy Moore, in one of the reddest states in the country. This has been a pattern in all of this year’s major special elections, as well as in the Virginia general election. It is consistent with a long-term trend toward stronger turnout by the party out of power in off-year elections. It also suggests that President Trump’s less educated and affluent version of the Republican coalition has eroded the party’s traditional turnout advantage. To the extent that there had been any weakness in Democratic turnout so far this year, it had been among black voters. In Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, for instance, black turnout barely eclipsed midterm levels even as all other voters surged well past it. A similar pattern appeared in Virginia. In majority-black Petersburg, the turnout was even lower than it was in 2013, even as turnout surged in Northern Virginia. But in Alabama, black turnout was far stronger than white Republican turnout, based on county-level data and the exit polls. Black voters probably represented an even larger share of the electorate than they did in 2012 or 2008. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • American Democrats are celebrating an almost-unimaginable Senate victory that shaves the Republican majority to a single seat. A key factor: African-American voters’ distaste for Roy Moore, the Republican candidate in a special election in Alabama, uncorked even deeper alarm over his most prominent backer, President Trump. Here’s how writers from across the political spectrum reacted to Mr. Moore’s defeat. The Democrats urged the Republicans to delay any vote on their nearly completed, sweeping tax bill until the winner, Doug Jones, above, can take office — a request almost certain to be rejected. _____ "
"I love the acknowledgments sections of books. I love what they say and what they do not say. I love what they accidentally say. I love the ways families are discussed, and how the truth about the wretchedness of book-writing finally comes tumbling out, and the combination of neuroticism and relief, pride and latent terror. It is not, however, fashionable to love acknowledgments, and for good reason: Most of them are numbingly predictable in their architecture, little Levittowns of gratitude. The critic Sam Sacks wrote a splendid rant about this for The New Yorker five years ago. “The most radical experimentalist,” he complained, “adheres to the most mindless acknowledgments-page formula.” In my job as a book critic for this newspaper — a role I leave today; is this why I’m contemplating codas, endings? — I have learned what Sacks means. Authors thank their publishers for their patience, and their editors for their brilliance and vision. (“She saw what this book was supposed to be long before I did.”) They thank their agents for betting on them, their friends and family for tolerating their anxiety, and their talented colleagues for invaluable comments that transformed leaden first scribbles into fine threads of spun gold. They thank resourceful librarians, indispensable research assistants and diligent fact-checkers; the foundations that gave them money and the experts who lent them wisdom; and the many universities — assuming the authors are academics — that invited them to conferences to refine their ideas. But even within this rote exercise, even amid the dreary name-checking calisthenics, truths seep out. Some revelations are inadvertent, and not especially flattering to the author. In my head, I have an informal taxonomy of acknowledgments, and one species is the Name-Dropper. Do writers know the kind of insecurity they’re betraying when they do their Trump Towers of thanks, their gold-plated word-piles of self-regard? "
"Combatants in the annual “War on Christmas” have some new data to chew on, thanks to a survey released this week by the Pew Research Center. While many doubt that Christmas is embattled, as some conservative pundits contend, the new study does suggest American attitudes are changing. The Pew study, based on interviews conducted in recent weeks with 1,503 adults, found that while a vast majority of Americans still celebrate Christmas, most find the religious elements of the holiday are emphasized less than in the past — and few of them care about that change. Like much else in the United States, a strong partisan divide runs through the survey results, with responses from Republicans seeming to place an emphasis on religion and those from Democrats on secularism. [ALSO READ: How the ‘War on Christmas’ Was Created] But the data complicate efforts to portray Christmas as either in mortal danger or in no trouble at all, a central issue in a yearslong debate over whether Christmas in America respects Christianity or has been undermined by liberalism. Ninety percent of Americans celebrate Christmas in some form, a figure that has “hardly budged at all” since its survey in 2013, the center said. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson are once again at odds over how to deal with nuclear-armed North Korea after Mr. Tillerson declared on Tuesday that the United States was ready to open talks with the North “without precondition.” The secretary’s comments were remarkably conciliatory for an administration that has repeatedly threatened North Korea with military action, and ruled out any negotiations, if it did not curb its missile and nuclear programs. But a few hours later, the White House distanced itself from his overture. In an unusual statement released to reporters on Tuesday evening, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Mr. Trump’s position on North Korea had not changed — namely, that talks were pointless if the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, continued to menace his neighbors. “North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world,” she said. “North Korea’s actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea.” It was only the latest example of a public rift between the president and his chief diplomat over North Korea. In October, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to open diplomatic lines to Pyongyang. But this time, the comments follow reports that the White House is laying the groundwork for the secretary’s departure from the State Department and his replacement by Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director.

"ISTANBUL — Leaders and officials of Muslim nations declared East Jerusalem the Palestinian capital on Wednesday at a summit meeting in Istanbul, producing the strongest response yet to President Trump’s decision to recognize the city as Israel’s capital. The gathering of the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation was held to formulate a unified response from the Muslim world to Mr. Trump’s decision last week. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was the host; the country currently holds the chair of the I.O.C., and Mr. Erdogan has long championed the Palestinian cause. The meeting condemned in a communiqué Mr. Trump’s “unilateral” and “dangerous declaration” as an effort to change the status of Jerusalem. It said that it considered the action a violation of United Nations resolutions and legally null and void, and that it would hold the United States liable for all consequences of not retracting its decision. It also said it took Mr. Trump’s declaration as an announcement that the United States was withdrawing from its role as a sponsor of peace for the region. Among the 30 leaders present were Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader; King Abdullah II of Jordan; President Michel Aoun of Lebanon; President Hassan Rouhani of Iran; and the emirs of Kuwait and Qatar. Officials were present representing the full 57 members, Mr. Erdogan said. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela also attended by special invitation of Mr. Erdogan. A conservative Muslim, Mr. Erdogan has made the Palestinians’ fate a leading cause of his politics, styling himself as a leader of the wider Muslim community. He criticized some Arab states for what he called their weak response to Mr. Trump’s decision, suggesting they were intimidated by the United States. "
"MEXICO CITY — Protests snaking through city streets, nighttime curfews, a raucous political battle over a president’s re-election: Honduras has been seized by a crisis since a disputed  vote last month. The country has lived through a version of this turmoil before. Eight years ago, a leftist president was ousted by a coup in a fight over what his opponents said was a plan to overturn the constitutional ban on a second presidential term. The resistance movement that sprang up to support him has endured, and the discord that split Honduran society then still defines today’s divisions. Both in 2009 and now, the return of stability in Honduras is important to the United States, which seeks a president there who can be counted on to support American policies to stem the flow of drugs and migrants from reaching the Texas border. The question is whether the United States is willing to overlook a possibly fraudulent election to ensure that outcome. President Juan Orlando Hernández, a conservative hoping to win a second term, has been a willing partner on the concerns that matter most to the United States. And as he increased control over every branch of the government since his election in 2013, no objections were raised from the Obama or Trump administrations — not even when his handpicked Supreme Court justices found a circuitous way to lift the prohibition on running for re-election.

"WASHINGTON — Small tech companies, consumer groups and many celebrities have been up in arms for weeks about a proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle landmark rules that guarantee an open internet. But in one speech, Ajit Pai, the chairman of the agency, called the complaints “hysteria” and “hot air.” In another, he dismissed criticism that by pushing the change, he was doing the bidding of companies like Verizon, his former employer. He joked that his nightmare scenario would be refereeing a dispute between Verizon and Sinclair Broadcasting, another company he has been accused of helping with his policies. “How do you choose,” he said, “between a longtime love and a newfound crush?” The agency was expected to vote on Thursday to dismantle the so-called net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for higher quality delivery to consumers. It would also dial back the stance established during the Obama administration that broadband should be regulated like a utility. The three Republican commissioners, including Mr. Pai, have said they will vote for the proposal, outnumbering the two Democratic commissioners. Passing the plan would be the biggest victory in Mr. Pai’s eventful 11-month tenure as the head of the F.C.C. Under his leadership, the agency has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers. All of this activity has made Mr. Pai, 44, a former lawyer for Verizon and a longtime government bureaucrat, the target of many angry protests. In recent days, government officials — including 18 state attorneys generals and dozens of Democratic members of Congress — have asked the F.C.C. to delay the vote. On Wednesday, the attorneys general said that many of the 23 million public comments that had been filed to the agency about net neutrality appeared to be fraudulent. Mr. Pai has ignored the delay requests. But Mr. Pai’s changes have also made him a pivotal official in the Trump administration’s rush to shed regulations. The effects of his decisions have rippled across the industries Mr. Pai oversees. The looser rules on media ownership, for example, has enabled Sinclair Broadcasting’s $3.9 billion bid for Tribune.

"The first election I can remember was the race between George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis in 1988. Dressed in footie pajamas, I stayed up late with my political die-hard parents. They tried and failed to avoid swearing as the map on television turned red. “Who are we cheering for?” I asked them. “The blue people,” my dad said, because the red people “don’t like us.” Who is “us?” I asked. “Black people,” he said. You could call my dad’s opinion reductionist. Or you could acknowledge that in the Alabama Senate election on Tuesday, the red people voted for Roy Moore — a guy who said the slavery era was the last time America was “great.” I stayed up late on Tuesday, excited by exit polls showing that some 30 percent of the Alabamians going to the polls were black, a higher percentage than in either of the presidential elections Barack Obama won. Mr. Jones rode to a one-and-a-half-point victory in one of the reddest states in America thanks to black voters. That was his only real path to the Senate: Whites in Alabama have a longstanding preference for Republicans, and blacks, 27 percent of the state’s population, make up a large chunk of Democratic voters there. Most of Alabama’s white voters did choose Mr. Moore, either despite or because of his support for slavery, the allegations that he had sexually assaulted girls as young as 14 and the fact that he was twice removed as a justice on the Alabama Supreme Court for disobeying federal court orders. Alabama’s black voters overwhelmingly chose Mr. Jones, and turned out in force despite numerous obstacles placed in front of them. The state’s voter ID law — passed in 2011 to undermine “the black power structure,” as a legislator had described it — has an outsize impact on black and Latino voters because they are less likely to have the financial resources (for transportation and a fee) and get time off from work to get an ID. On Tuesday some black voters reportedly received text messages that told them to report to the wrong polling places. Others found that they had erroneously been marked “inactive,” so they had to fill out a form and update their address before they could vote. "
"President Trump’s nominee to oversee the Environmental Protection Agency’s chemical safety division on Wednesday withdrew his name from consideration for the post in the face of mounting opposition. The nominee, Michael L. Dourson, a longtime researcher whose studies often bolstered safety claims by manufacturers of pesticides, flame retardants and other products under federal scrutiny as possible public health hazards, had been working as an adviser to the agency while awaiting confirmation. But the Senate never scheduled a confirmation vote for Mr. Dourson, who resigned from his job at the University of Cincinnati in October. And in recent weeks, two Republican senators came forward to say they would not support him. Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware and a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, had pushed his colleagues to reject Mr. Dourson. He said Wednesday that his objections were not partisan. “I sincerely believe he is the wrong person to hold this important position, and it’s become clear that, even with a Republican majority in the Senate, he could not be confirmed,” Mr. Carper said in a statement. “Dr. Dourson, an individual who has spent most of his career promoting less protective chemical safety standards, had no business overseeing our nation’s chemical safety laws.” Mr. Dourson notified the White House late on Wednesday of his decision to withdraw his name, according to a Senate aide, adding that Mr. Dourson would not remain at the agency.

"In 1995, Drew Dixon was working her dream job as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, helping to oversee a chart-topping album and a ubiquitous single by Method Man and Mary J. Blige. But as her star rose, Ms. Dixon, then 24, was spiraling into depression, she said, because of prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, Russell Simmons, the rap mogul and co-founder of the label. On work calls, he would talk graphically about how she aroused him. At a staff meeting, he asked her to sit on his lap. He regularly exposed his erect penis to her. Late that year, Mr. Simmons raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment, Ms. Dixon said. She quit Def Jam soon after. “I was broken,” she said. In recent interviews, four women spoke on the record about a pattern of violent sexual behavior by Mr. Simmons, disclosing incidents from 1988 to 2014. Three of the women say that he raped them. In each case, numerous friends and associates said they were told of the incidents at the time. The women said they were inspired to come forward in the aftermath of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, as victims’ stories have been newly elevated and more often believed. Told in detail about the rape accusations and other misconduct, Mr. Simmons, 60, said in a statement: “I vehemently deny all these allegations. These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual.” "
"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — As supporters of Roy S. Moore on Wednesday sifted the results of his stunning loss in Alabama, one number jumped out: About 22,800 write-in votes were cast, more than the gap separating Mr. Moore, the scandal-plagued Republican, from the victorious Doug Jones, the first Democratic senator elected in the state in a quarter-century. Many of the votes are thought to have been cast by Republicans displeased by Mr. Moore but unwilling to cross party lines, and who wanted to register a protest. “I would bet strongly it was good Republican voters who couldn’t stomach voting for Roy Moore, but didn’t want to stay home,’’ said Brent Buchanan, a Republican strategist in Alabama. “It was a protest vote.’’ One was Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Republican dean of Alabama’s congressional delegation, who said over the weekend that he could not vote for Mr. Moore and had written in the name of “a distinguished Republican’’ whom he declined to identify. Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former White House adviser, said on Monday at a Moore rally that there was “a special place in hell” for Republicans like Mr. Shelby. An array of factors fueled Mr. Jones’s upset win in a deeply conservative state, including a surge in black turnout and pervasive frustration with Mr. Moore among well-heeled suburban residents who ordinarily push Republicans to victory. Some strategists suggested that the write-in votes also tipped the race, depriving Mr. Moore, who was accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls, of the support that a less-compromised Republican would have garnered. “Those are people who value democracy and intellectual consistency and conservative ideals so much that they were still willing to go to the polls and vote,” said Collier Tynes, a Republican who was chief of staff to Dianne Bentley when she was first lady of Alabama. But they are unwilling, she said, “to compromise human decency and conservative ideals.” "
"In the fall of 1987, a Nashville woman named Teresa Harris decided she’d had enough of her boss’s harassment and quit. Ms. Harris was one of just two female managers at Forklift Systems, a construction equipment supplier, and for two years, she had endured leers, propositions and vulgar “jokes” from the company’s owner, Charles Hardy. (Mr. Hardy had a fondness for jingling change in his front pants pocket and asking Ms. Harris to fish quarters out.) But the final straw came when Ms. Harris told Mr. Hardy she had landed a big client. “What did you do, Teresa?” Mr. Hardy responded, according to testimony. “Promise the guy some bugger on Saturday night?” As Ms. Harris later testified in the sexual harassment case she brought against the company, it was this penchant for trivializing her business acumen, not Mr. Hardy’s pocket change habits, that cut the deepest. “The comments about my ability to do my job and that I was stupid and I was dumb devastated me,” she said. “I hated walking in there.” President Trump’s tweet on Tuesday insinuating that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York used sex to extract campaign contributions brought this distinctly demeaning form of harassment into sharp relief. Rather than objectify its target as alluring, it dismisses her as incompetent. It tells the woman, and everyone else in her workplace, that she can succeed only if she trades on her sexuality and not because she is smart, savvy or resourceful. There’s a reason a powerful woman so often gets smeared as having “slept her way to the top.” Of course, harassment that manifests as desire (however brutal or twisted) conveys, too, that a woman is valuable at work only insofar as she provides sexual amusement. But suggesting that a woman’s sexuality is responsible for her demonstrable achievements — such as, say, winning election to the United States Senate — is an insult precisely because it implicates her in the harasser’s own low opinion of women’s abilities. Slurs like Mr. Trump’s reinforce the idea that without sex to offer, women are worthless, in the same way harassers do when they demand that women fork over sexual favors to have the chance to achieve with their legitimate labors what their male colleagues do. "
"ALBANY — Amid the ongoing national reckoning over sexual harassment, New York’s junior senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, has been front and center in the debate, denouncing the unsavory actions of powerful men in all walks of life, from President Trump to fellow Democratic senators like Al Franken. And so it was on Wednesday that New York’s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, was asked about his response to sexual harassment in state government. The exchange did not go smoothly. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat seeking a third term next year, was asked about allegations against Sam Hoyt, a former senior aide, and what he could have done differently to address such behavior. The governor tried to turn the question — posited by a public radio reporter, Karen DeWitt — into a broader discussion of sexual harassment in journalism and other fields. “When you say it’s state government, you do a disservice to women, with all due respect, even though you’re a woman,” the governor said, during an impromptu news conference here. “It’s not government, it’s society,” he added. “It’s not just one person in one area.” But the assertion that Ms. DeWitt was doing a disservice, rather than doing her job, was met with a shock in some quarters, and a scramble by the governor’s own aides to clarify his remarks. Melissa DeRosa, the secretary to the governor, responded to one comment on Twitter by reiterating that the governor was saying that it “is a disservice to limit the problem to state government.” “Must be dealt with across the board,” said Ms. DeRosa, who was appointed in April, by Mr. Cuomo, as the first woman to serve as secretary, the top unelected position in the state. “It exists everywhere in society and must be addressed holistically.” She later added, “Limiting the problem to one man, political party or profession misses the whole point of the #MeToo moment.” "

arlier this week, I experienced a bit of local media whiplash. On Saturday, on the front page of The Australian, there was an article declaring that Australia’s spy agency had identified 10 local and state political candidates with ties to Chinese intelligence, part of China’s plans to interfere in Australian democracy. The politicians were not named and the sources were anonymous, but the tone was clear: Be afraid, China is not your friend. The next day in The Australian, also out front, there was an article on why that fear might be misguided. The chairman of the Australia China Business Council, John Brumby, among others, encouraged Australians to remember that their 26 years without a recession could not have happened without China’s rise. This time, the message — China is good for Australia — was just as loud and clear. So which is it? Should Australia treat China as an enemy, or focus on the relationship’s economic benefits? Is the country Australia’s friend, or foe? This, of course, is what Australia is trying to figure out. Legislation targeting foreign interference that was introduced last week by the prime minister is both a reflection of that struggle and a trigger for more debate — all of which I’ll explore in detail in a coming article.

"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — For Janet Maycock, Tuesday’s election of the Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama was personal. The allegations of sexual misconduct against teenage girls by Mr. Jones’s opponent, Roy S. Moore, the conservative former judge, had stoked Ms. Maycock’s own memories of being molested by an older employee in the restaurant where she worked when she was 17, and of feeling like she could never speak up about it. “It made me more adamant to keep a man like that out of the Senate,” said Ms. Maycock, 67, who is black and was among numerous women celebrating at Mr. Jones’s victory party. She wanted, she said, “to make a stand for women who have the courage to speak out.” Depending on one’s point of view, Tuesday’s election was a referendum on decency, a test of the credibility of the news media, or a rallying cry against outside interference in Alabama politics. But it was also the first election in the #MeToo era and a measure of the deep divide among women over personal issues like sexual harassment, religion and race. Exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool suggested a majority of women, 57 percent, backed Mr. Jones, compared with 42 percent of men. But the polls also showed women as sharply divided by race, with about 98 percent of black women supporting Mr. Jones, mobilizing heavily to carry out a long tradition of supporting Democrats here.

"The political winds are shifting with all the subtlety of a hurricane. Doug Jones’s defeat of Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate special election is yet the latest signal that the accommodators of Donald Trump, those who have normalized and bolstered him, the gutless, schismatic conservatives who abandoned principle to follow a pariah, will have hell to pay in 2018. Yes, Roy Moore was defeated, but it can never be fully erased from history or memory that he was endorsed by this president and supported by the Republican National Committee. All of Roy Moore’s sins are their sins, and they will wear that scarlet R straight into the midterms. We should also note that Jones didn’t win by a landslide. The margin was thin as a rail. Moore still won the Republican vote and the white vote and, yes, the “white born-again Christian” vote. These people contorted their faith to support a man accused of unthinkable transgressions. They made a mockery of Christian faith and moral fidelity. But as the Apostle Paul wrote in Galatians, “God is not mocked.” The Resistance is marching on, emboldened, with a strategy and proof that the strategy can work. The Alabama election has demonstrated once again that resisters aren’t just angry; they are motivated and insistent that the past will not defeat the future. It demonstrated once again that black voters, particularly black women, have been summoned to save America from its worst impulses and to establish that they are the most loyal and crucial constituency of a Democratic Party that still doesn’t grant them enough respect or deference, instead often pleading in the final hours after efforts to win more white voters fall short.

"After a Democrat prevailed in a special Senate election in Alabama, a ruby-red Republican state, President Trump offered on Wednesday a truncated and misleading account of his role in the race. Mr. Trump had endorsed Roy S. Moore, the Republican who was accused of sexual misconduct by several women and was narrowly defeated on Tuesday night by Doug Jones, a Democrat and former prosecutor. By early Wednesday morning, the president sought to distance himself from the loss by reminding his Twitter followers that he had doubts about Mr. Moore months ago. Back then, Mr. Trump supported Luther Strange, the Republican who was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. “The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post. “I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!” But that is a highly amended account of the president’s efforts in the Alabama race. Mr. Trump officially endorsed Mr. Strange on Aug. 8 as he ran against Mr. Moore and several other Republicans in the primary election a week later. "
"Stemming the tide of rising economic insecurity for service workers, a major union has won significant job protection and increased pay for about 20,000 AT&T wireless employees, as well as a commitment to bring work back from overseas. The deal, struck Wednesday, comes as President Trump has made clear his desire to keep low- and middle-skilled jobs in this country. The union, for its part, offered to help make the case for AT&T’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which the Trump administration has opposed. The support of a union representing hundreds of thousands of working-class voters may have proved compelling to AT&T as it faces off against the White House. “We tried to emphasize to the company that we could help you or hurt you,” said Dennis G. Trainor, a vice president of the Communications Workers of America, which represents the employees. The union called in mid-November for approval of the acquisition. Service industries provide by far the largest share of American jobs. But in many service fields — notably the traditional retail sector — workers have found it difficult to gain traction on issues like low pay, high turnover and unpredictable scheduling. The AT&T wireless workers had been without a long-term contract since February and staged a strike in May that lasted less than three days. "
"In late 2008, at a meeting with academics at the London School of Economics, Queen Elizabeth II  asked why no one seemed to have anticipated the world’s worst financial crisis in the postwar period. The so-called Great Recession, which had begun in late 2008 and would run until mid-2009, was set off by the sudden collapse of sky-high prices for housing and other assets — something that is obvious in retrospect but that, nevertheless, no one seemed to see coming. Are we about to make the same mistake? All too likely, yes. Certainly, the American economy is doing well, and emerging economies are picking up steam. But global asset prices are once again rising rapidly above their underlying value — in other words, they are in a bubble. Considering the virtual silence among economists about the danger they pose, one has to wonder whether in a year or two, when those bubbles eventually burst, the queen will not be asking the same sort of question. This silence is all the more surprising considering how much more pervasive bubbles are today than they were 10 years ago. While in 2008 bubbles were largely confined to the American housing and credit markets, they are now to be found in almost every corner of the world economy. As the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan recently warned, years of highly unorthodox monetary policy by the world’s major central banks has created a global government bond bubble, with long-term interest rates plumbing historically low levels. He might have added that this bubble has hardly been confined to the sovereign bond market. Indeed, stock values are at lofty heights that have been reached only three times in the last century. At the same time, housing bubbles are all too evident in countries like Australia, Britain, Canada and China, while interest rates have been driven down to unusually low levels for high-yield debt and emerging-market corporate debt.

"Health care, Social Security, Medicare and other social programs are all on the chopping block as the Republican-led Congress scrambles to make up for the revenue lost to its planned tax cuts. The Pentagon, however, remains a sacred cow, destined to receive yet more money. The military budget is now $643 billion. The actual and potential threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Islamic extremists are all serious, but giving the Pentagon another huge increase defies common sense. The Pentagon already wastes about one in five of the taxpayer dollars it receives, according to a Pentagon-commissioned study. And the United States, which has plenty of other urgent needs, already spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined. The opening bid for the 2018 defense budget came from President Trump, who in May proposed $677 billion. That was $54 billion above a budget cap set by Congress in 2011, after the 2008 financial crisis led to demands for fiscal restraint. Then last month, Congress upped his ante by passing a 2018 military authorization bill that would increase spending to around $700 billion, some $85 billion above the legal cap. Mr. Trump signed that bill into law on Tuesday. For the moment, that increase is a fiction. Before it can occur, Congress must remove the 2011 caps and appropriate the money. That is the focus of the present budget battle on Capitol Hill. Republican leaders reportedly want to increase military spending by at least Mr. Trump’s original figure of $54 billion and nonmilitary spending by $37 billion. Democratic leaders are insisting on equal increases for both categories. What’s not clear is that the Pentagon needs any increase until it can get a handle on waste, which a 2015 study estimated at $125 billion, about one-fifth of its budget. The Pentagon had a virtual blank check after the Sept. 11 attacks, as it went after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and then turned its attention to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Military spending in 2017 is already as high as during the armed forces buildup of the 1980s. The proposed increase, coming after the United States has withdrawn thousands of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, would take it even higher. Mr. Trump, bedazzled by men in uniform and enthralled by displays of weaponry, says more money is needed to build bigger and better forces. And senior commanders have lobbied hard for a big increase to upgrade a military they say lacks readiness, meaning the training and equipment needed to fight. "

"WASHINGTON — House and Senate Republicans faced a new round of uncertainty on Thursday about the fate of their $1.5 trillion tax bill with the possible defection of a Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, amid continuing questions about how the bill will be paid for and how much of the benefits will flow to low- and middle-income people versus corporations. Republicans, who reached agreement Wednesday on a merged version of the House and Senate tax plans, expect to unveil the final bill on Friday and vote on the legislation early next week so that it can be sent to President Trump before Christmas. But those plans were thrown into some disarray on Thursday when Mr. Rubio said that he would vote no on the bill unless it included a greater expansion of the child tax credit, which he and another Republican senator, Mike Lee of Utah, have been pushing for to benefit lower-income individuals. “I think my requests have been pretty reasonable and consistent and direct,” Mr. Rubio said. A spokesman for Mr. Lee said he was undecided on the bill. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Lee have been pressing Republican leaders to bolster the child tax credit to make it more generous for low-income families. That change would further drive up the cost of the tax bill, which can add no more than $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over a decade if the bill is to pass without Democrat support. In a tweet on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Rubio needled Republican leadership, saying, “Tax negotiators didn’t have much trouble finding a way to lower” the top tax bracket and to have the corporate tax cut take effect a year early.

"We don’t know what exactly Omarosa Manigault Newman did at the White House, but we do know the number one skill she brought to the table — being fired. Donald Trump has now axed her four times: on “The Apprentice” in 2004, on “The Celebrity Apprentice” in 2011 and 2013 and on Tuesday evening. She is really, really good at getting canned. Maybe her true purpose was to remind America of the time when Mr. Trump was popular because he fired people like her, including her. The Trump administration clearly looked at Doug Jones’s victory in Alabama on Tuesday and decided to reach out to black female voters by firing one. This is consistent with Mr. Trump’s previous attempts to bond with black voters by not allowing them to live in his apartment buildings, coming up with new ways to suppress the black vote, and threatening to send the National Guard to the South Side of Chicago. In fact, Mr. Trump is probably sitting around right now drinking Diet Coke, watching TV, and dreaming up a plan to make Jeff Sessions hold every black voter’s hand in the voting booth while whispering sweet nothings about the Ku Klux Klan. When Steve Bannon got fired, people cheered. When Anthony Scaramucci got fired, people laughed, because most of us have had bouts of flu that lasted longer than he did. But now the Trump administration is giving me a chance to relax during the stressful holiday season by firing someone I can feel neutral about. "

ecause she didn’t know what to tell her children, she tried not to tell them anything. When they asked where their father was, she gave flimsy excuses: Yes, he came home last night, but he left while you were still asleep. He’s working late, he’s working early, he just stepped out, he’ll be back soon. “You just missed him,” she found herself repeating. The strategy worked, for a few days at least, with the youngest three. They were all under 5 and were used to the world going about its strange business without them. But then there was Kelly. She was 8 and sharp-eyed, a good student who preferred English to Spanish and wanted to someday be a doctor, or maybe a gymnast, and who had watched a presidential candidate on television say he wanted to send people back to Mexico, where both her parents grew up. Kelly came home from school one day in October last year and demanded to know where her father was. Because his construction job started so early in the morning, Javier was usually the first home. That was part of how he and Kelly’s mother, T., fell in love. They boarded in the same house more than a decade ago, when she was 19 and freshly arrived in South Florida, having followed her sister from their small village in southern Mexico. T., who is being identified by her first initial to shield her identity, quit school after sixth grade. She helped her parents plant corn and beans but dreamed of something better for herself and her infant son; she decided to leave him in her mother’s care and support him from afar. Javier was from the same region, and because he finished work early, he cooked for her while she was still out in the Florida sun. The food was delicious and tasted like home. Soon they were a couple, and then Kelly was born, and her father, who fainted with anxiety in the birthing room, adored her, and she adored him back. “He’s late from work,” T. told her daughter. But Kelly wasn’t having it. Before heading to school that morning, she saw uniformed men come to the door and ask her mother for her father’s passport; she heard her mother on the phone, asking what had happened, what to do. “Don’t lie to me,” Kelly said, and started to cry. “Where did they take him? What did he do?” By now T. knew. One of her first phone calls was to an immigrant advocate and former refugee named Nora Sándigo, who, in this poor area south of Miami, was the most powerful person in many people’s worlds: She knew lawyers, county commissioners, even members of Congress. After T. called her, Sándigo quickly discovered that Javier had been detained by the Department of Homeland Security. T. didn’t tell Kelly the details she had learned from Sándigo, or from Javier, when he was finally able to make a brief call. That they arrested him just a few yards away from their home, as he stood waiting for his ride to work. That now he was on the edge of the Everglades, in a gray-and-tan detention center adjacent to a state prison, a half-hour’s drive away, a distance that, for T., had suddenly become unbridgeable. “He was arrested,” she told Kelly, simply. “We have no papers to be here, like you do.” “Will they take me, too?” Kelly asked. She didn’t know what papers her mother was talking about, what this thing was that she had and her parents didn’t. "

"MOSCOW — With an eye to his presidential candidacy, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promoted his domestic record throughout his annual national news conference on Thursday. But he did save a few jabs for the United States on election meddling and Olympic doping — at one point asking members of Congress, “Are you normal at all?” This was Mr. Putin’s 13th such news conference, and the formula has become so worn that it is sometimes compared to the movie “Groundhog Day,” in which the hero relives the same moment repeatedly. The nearly four-hour marathon, broadcast live nationwide, started with a broad query about why Mr. Putin was running for re-election in March 2018. This gave him an opening to unleash a welter of positive economic data, seemingly with the intent of reminding Russians how much the country has improved since he first became president, in 2000. The questions drifted along on domestic matters for a while, until a couple of foreign correspondents, usually planted in advance, switched the topic briefly to possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and to North Korea. On the collusion question, Mr. Putin essentially echoed President Trump, saying the accusations were an invention of enemies who wanted to reverse the election results. Any contacts with Russian diplomats or other officials were normal, he said, and suggesting otherwise is “spy hysteria.” “This is all made up by people who oppose Trump to make his work look illegitimate,” Mr. Putin said, adding that there is a “deep state” in the United States that fosters hostility toward Moscow: “Do they want to ban all contact?” "

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to dismantle rules regulating the businesses that connect consumers to the internet, granting broadband companies the power to potentially reshape Americans’ online experiences. The agency scrapped the so-called net neutrality regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or certain content. The federal government will also no longer regulate high-speed internet delivery as if it were a utility, like phone service. The action reversed the agency’s 2015 decision, during the Obama administration, to have stronger oversight over broadband providers as Americans have migrated to the internet for most communications. It reflected the view of the Trump administration and the new F.C.C. chairman that unregulated business will eventually yield innovation and help the economy. It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, so consumers will not see any of the potential changes right away. But the political and legal fight started immediately. Numerous Democrats on Capitol Hill called for a bill that would reestablish the rules, and several Democratic state attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, said they would file a suit to stop the change. Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action. The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, vigorously defended the repeal before the vote. He said the rollback of the rules would eventually benefit consumers because broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast could offer them a wider variety of service options. His two fellow Republican commissioners also supported the change, giving them a 3-to-2 majority. "
"DECATUR, Ala. — One evening last fall, an informant for the Morgan County sheriff entered the office of a small construction business near this old river town and, he said, secretly installed spyware on a company computer. He had no warrant. The sheriff, Ana Franklin, wanted to know who was leaking information about her to a blogger known as the Morgan County Whistleblower. The blogger had been zeroing in on the sheriff’s finances, specifically $150,000 that by law should have gone toward feeding inmates in the county jail. Instead it had been invested in a now-bankrupt used-car dealership run by a convicted bank swindler. Now the sheriff has become ensnared, along with others, in a wide-ranging government investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking at her stewardship of taxpayer money, as well as the dealership and its financial links to prominent people in town, including several state law enforcement agents, according to more than a half-dozen people who say they have spoken to the F.B.I. Government divers recently searched the bottom of a creek for evidence. What, if anything, investigators have uncovered is not known. But The New York Times found that since taking office in 2011, Sheriff Franklin has failed to comply with court orders, has threatened critics with legal action and has not publicly accounted for tens of thousands of dollars raised through charity events. Her activities point to questions about the broad powers afforded America’s county sheriffs, newly emboldened in the era of President Trump. Unlike appointed municipal police chiefs, sheriffs answer only to voters, giving them often-unfettered dominion not just over county law enforcement but over the jail and the lucrative service contracts that go with it.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Thursday that his administration was answering “a call to action” by rolling back regulations on environmental protections, health care, financial services and other industries as he made a push to showcase his accomplishments near the end of his first year in office. The remarks highlighted an area where Mr. Trump has perhaps done more to change the policies of his predecessor than any other, with regulatory shifts that have affected wide sections of the economy. “We are just getting started,” Mr. Trump said, speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. He described progress so far as the “most far-reaching regulatory reform” in United States history, a claim he did not back up. “We have decades of excess regulation to remove,” he added. “To help launch the next phase of growth, prosperity and freedom, I am challenging my cabinet to find and remove every single outdated, unlawful and excessive regulation currently on the books.” Echoing his days as a real estate developer with the flair of a groundbreaking, Mr. Trump used an oversize pair of scissors to cut a ribbon his staff had set up in front of two piles of paper, representing government regulations in 1960 (20,000 pages, he said), and today — a pile that was about six feet tall (said to be 185,000 pages). His efforts — his staff said that the rules already rolled back had saved $8.1 billion in regulatory costs over their lifetime, or a total of an estimated $570 million a year — have brought cheers from the business community, most notably from companies that will benefit from the rollbacks.

"HONG KONG — With some investors in its bonds running for the exits and foreign banks increasingly skeptical about its prospects, HNA Group tried this week to reassure markets that it has access to the money it needs. At the same time, HNA, a vast but troubled Chinese conglomerate, is continuing the drive that helped cause its difficulties in the first place: completing billions of dollars in foreign deals. The competing efforts by a company that has symbolized China’s growing wealth and global ambitions are a problem for the country’s leaders. They want to end wasteful overseas spending by debt-laden Chinese companies, which in the case of HNA and some others have drawn growing regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe. China has yet to let one of its big conglomerates fail, and HNA is unlikely to be an exception. But it is testing how effectively China can curb such behavior, and how the country may deal with some companies that have gone too far. HNA said late Wednesday that it had talked to eight Chinese banks, including powerful and politically connected lenders like China Development Bank and China Construction Bank, about extending the conglomerate’s credit lines next year. HNA said several of the banks planned to increase the amount of money it could borrow if needed. Bank officials believe “HNA is the best-quality client of banks,” according to a statement posted on HNA’s website. An HNA spokesman said the company had no further comment. "
"The wide halls, regal rooms and wrought-iron arches of the Park Avenue Armory have glorified military might since its founding during the Gilded Age. Now these same spaces will be the site of a 10-hour “convening” on Sunday by Carrie Mae Weems with the help of more than 50 artistic all-stars, centered on “interrogating the deep structures and multiple dimensions of violence, and how artists and thinkers respond to it,” she said. Ms. Weems is a renowned photographer and installation artist, but her appearance at the armory is not a starring vehicle. Rather, it is ”sort of a wonderful way of bringing a larger idea forward,” she explained during a series of conversations. “I have been dealing with this idea of being a socially engaged and motivated artist since the very, very beginning of my career and very little has changed,” she said, her voice low and stentorian, yet warm. “Presidents have come and gone.” The violence that concerns Ms. Weems “didn’t only come with the Trump presidency, but it certainly has intensified since the Trump presidency,” she said, pointing to the brutal attacks at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August, which left a counterprotester dead and many injured. The program on Sunday is the culmination of her yearlong artistic residency at the armory, which began just as people around the country were knitting “pussy hats” and preparing to protest the presidential inauguration. “My chief preoccupation has been really grappling with and trying to understand in some small way the influence and the meaning of power,” she said. “This is a difficult and extraordinary political moment for the U.S.” To that end, Ms. Weems, 64, has invited luminaries from the visual and performing arts (including MacArthur Foundation “geniuses,” like herself, and several Pulitzer Prize-winners) along with writers, professors and activists, to address violence of all kinds: domestic, political, racist, sexual, verbal, physical and environmental.

"At this time last year, the Democratic path to Senate control seemed impossible: Hold all of the Democratic seats, flip Arizona and Nevada, then hope for a miracle. The Democrats got the political version of a miracle on Tuesday. Doug Jones’s victory in Alabama means Democrats have accomplished the most difficult item on their checklist in pursuit of the Senate. A Democratic path is now obvious, and the race for control is basically a tossup,  perhaps with a Republican advantage. It is hard to overstate how surprising this would have seemed a year ago. Democrats needed three states to flip control of the Senate, but they entered the cycle defending 25 seats (two of them independents) to the G.O.P.’s eight. Of those Democratic seats, a staggering 10 of them were in states that chose Donald J. Trump for president, including five that he carried by at least 18 percentage points. Only one Republican, Dean Heller, represented a state (Nevada) won by Hillary Clinton. Jeff Flake’s seat in Arizona was also plausibly competitive after Mr. Trump’s tepid 3.5-point win in the state, but it was hard to find the third Democratic seat. Perhaps the next best Democratic opportunity was against Ted Cruz in Texas — a long shot at best. But the Republican position has steadily deteriorated throughout the year. Most obviously, Mr. Trump’s weak approval ratings have  decidedly shifted the national political environment. The party’s two most vulnerable seats — those held by Mr. Heller and Mr. Flake —  became much more vulnerable. Mr. Flake said he wouldn’t run for re-election, while Mr. Heller came out of the health care debate badly damaged and facing a primary challenge. "
"STOCKHOLM — This past Saturday, a Hanukkah party at a synagogue in Goteborg, Sweden, was abruptly interrupted by Molotov cocktails. They were hurled by a gang of men in masks at the Jews, mostly teenagers, who had gathered to celebrate the holiday. Two days later, two fire bombs were discovered outside the Jewish burial chapel in the southern Swedish city of Malmo. Who knows what tomorrow may bring? For Sweden’s 18,000 Jews, sadly, none of this comes as a surprise. They are by now used to anti-Semitic threats and attacks — especially during periods of unrest in the Middle East, which provide cover to those whose actual goal has little to do with Israel and much to do with harming Jews. Both of these recent attacks followed days of incitement against Jews. Last Friday, 200 people protested in Malmo against President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The protesters called for an intifada and promised “we will shoot the Jews.” A day later, during a demonstration in Stockholm, a speaker called Jews “apes and pigs.” There were promises of martyrdom. Malmo’s sole Hasidic rabbi has reported being the victim of more than 100 incidents of hostility ranging from hate speech to physical assault. In response to such attacks, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel warning in 2010 advising “extreme caution when visiting southern Sweden” because of officials’ failure to act against the “serial harassment” of Jews in Malmo. Today, entering a synagogue anywhere in Sweden usually requires going through security checks, including airport-like questioning. At times of high alert, police officers with machine guns guard Jewish schools. Children at the Jewish kindergarten in Malmo play behind bulletproof glass. Not even funerals are safe from harassment.

"LONDON — The leaders of a British far-right group, which had gained notoriety after President Trump recirculated unverified anti-Muslim videos it had posted on social media, were arrested on Thursday. Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First, was detained in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the group said, where he was accompanying his deputy, Jayda Fransen, to her court hearing on earlier charges related to using “threatening, abusive, insulting words or behavior” during an anti-Islam speech in August that prosecutors said could qualify as incitement to racial hatred. She has denied the charges. Shortly after her court appearance, British news media said she was arrested again, this time as part of a police investigation into “an incident at a peace wall” in Belfast on Wednesday. Earlier, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said on Twitter that detectives investigating speeches made at the Northern Ireland Against Terrorism Rally on Aug. 6 “have arrested a 35-year-old man in the Belfast area today.” The post did not identify Mr. Golding or the offense. Ms. Fransen, in a video posted on Twitter, said that the man was Mr. Golding, and that he had been detained on “trumped-up charges.” A spokesman for Britain First confirmed the arrest. According to British news reports, a video recorded earlier this week in Belfast and in which Ms. Fransen spoke of the “Islamification of the mainland,” had been posted on the group’s Facebook page. She also described the Belfast Islamic Center as a “den of iniquity.” "
"WASHINGTON — Thousands of the Interior Department’s employees reported that they had experienced harassment or intimidation at work, a department-wide survey conducted earlier this year and released Thursday found. Of the nearly 30,000 employees who reported on their experiences, about 35 percent said they felt some form of harassment and intimidation, often related to their age or gender. More than 85 percent of those employees said they had to continue to interact with the person responsible for the mistreatment. “This is a breach of public trust,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in an interview, adding that he had personally fired four people over accusations of harassment. “Harassment — intimidation — is a cancer that can destroy even the best organizations.” In the survey, 8 percent of employees reported sexual harassment, 20 percent reported negative treatment based on their age and 16 percent based on their sex. About 44 percent of the department’s 70,000 employees responded to the survey. “It has to start from the top,” Mr. Zinke said. “But we have to remove this cancer immediately because it is distracting from our ability to successfully carry out our mission.” Department officials are working to strengthen the policies on harassment based on the survey results, and have trained about 100 employees on how to conduct investigations into allegations.

"Not long ago, Democratic power brokers and political strategists in both parties spoke about Kirsten Gillibrand’s seemingly inevitable presidential candidacy with a shrug of the shoulders or a roll of the eyes. She was eager all right, but that didn’t mean that she was ready, and they felt that too much of her brand was invested in a fight against sexual assault and abuse. Now they rave: What a fierce warrior she is! How ahead of the curve! While that’s a testament to her savvy and persistence, it’s also thanks to Donald Trump. His presence in the White House amplifies her signature issue, and he’s the best tormentor that an ambitious Democrat could have. In trying to demean her, he merely makes her more important. He also fuels chatter that the first female president will, after all, be a senator from New York. His administration devours the reputations of the people who join it. They mortify themselves. But there are exceptions, and one stands out. Her name is Nikki Haley, and her time in Trump’s service, as our ambassador to the United Nations, has only elevated her standing among Republicans — even those who detest him. In her they see someone somehow respectful enough of Trump to hold onto her job but defiant enough to hold onto her dignity. Meanwhile, she’s adding serious foreign-policy experience to her two terms as the Indian-American governor of the deep-red state of South Carolina. Could she, in fact, be our first female president? Watching her go hard after Iran and North Korea at the United Nations, many impressed conservatives are asking that question. Perhaps I’m just scribbling in my silver linings playbook, but I find myself contemplating an absurdly delicious irony. It goes like this: An unabashed misogynist helps to sire the very milestone for women that his pummeling of Hillary Clinton postponed. He advances women just as surely as he has objectified and trivialized them. "
"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. Daoud Hanania was born in West Jerusalem in 1934, the grandchild of an Arab Greek Orthodox priest. But his family left Jerusalem in 1951, in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. “Not a day goes by that I don’t think about Jerusalem,” he wrote to The New York Times last week. Mr. Hanania’s story is one of almost 600 we received from readers last week, after we asked you to tell us about your personal experiences with Jerusalem, either as residents, visitors or refugees. In the wake of President Trump’s announcement that the United States now formally recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, we wanted to hear from you. Here are some of the most evocative responses, condensed and edited for clarity. Louly Hanania, 75, lives in Amman, Jordan. She was born in West Jerusalem in 1942 and lived there until she was 6. Susan H. Sachs, 75, lives in Beit Shemesh, Israel, and has been a resident of Israel since 1987. Dedi Firestone, 69, lives in West Hempstead, N.Y. "
"WASHINGTON — As a group of progressive activists and constituents prepared for a 15-minute meeting on Wednesday with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, they sat in the lobby of her office and developed a last-ditch strategy to persuade her to vote against the $1.5 trillion tax bill barreling through Congress: tears. “If Senator Collins actually saw you as a human, saw me as a human, then she wouldn’t pass any of this,” said Ady Barkan, a member of the Center for Popular Democracy, who recently learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., and uses a wheelchair. Ms. Collins, after weeks of wavering, cut several deals with Republican leaders in exchange for going along with the tax overhaul that passed the Senate this month and is on track to be sent to President Trump by Christmas. Among other things, the Senate version of the bill would repeal the Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. Among the provisions she secured was support for bipartisan health care legislation to stabilize the Affordable Care Act’s insurance markets, whose prices could increase if the mandate repeal is enacted. She also claims to have a commitment from Republican leaders to prevent automatic Medicare spending cuts that could occur as a result of arcane budget rules that would kick in after the tax cut is passed. Those trade-offs still seem to to be in place as far as Ms. Collins is concerned. But because Ms. Collins is one of the few Republican senators who sometimes votes against her party, the pressure from opponents of the tax plan to flip her vote is rising as the bill inches closer to final passage, possibly as early as next week.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. A day after Doug Jones became the first Democrat to win a Senate race in Alabama since 1992, late-night hosts poked fun at Roy Moore, his vanquished opponent. Mr. Moore has been accused by various women of sexual misconduct with them when they were teenagers. Dennis Rodman sat down with Mr. Colbert to discuss his many visits to North Korea. “For some reason, he likes me,” Mr. Rodman said, referring to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Samantha Bee traveled to Mexico to learn about La Brigada Feminista. “As a black woman, I just have two things I want to say about last night’s election: You’re. Welcome.” Adam Driver, who plays the villain Kylo Ren in the new Star Wars movie, will visit “The Late Show” on Thursday. Russell Simmons, the powerful hip-hop mogul, has been accused of rape by three women. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • With House and Senate negotiators reaching an agreement on a final version of their rewrite of the tax code, the party is closing in on its first major legislative achievement since assuming political control this year. Final votes on the revised legislation, whose overall cost remains unclear, could come next week. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve predicted that the measure would modestly increase economic growth for the next few years without stoking inflation. • One thing the debate over the tax overhaul has shown: the peril Americans face in making financial decisions based on the tax code. • We’re still sifting through the once-unimaginable Republican defeat in Tuesday’s special Senate election in Alabama. These maps compare the turnout with that of the 2016 presidential election. Roy Moore’s loss again pointed to divisions between the party’s establishment and its populist wing, led by Stephen Bannon.

"Take a walk with me, dear reader, into the yard, down the street — anywhere, really, just so that we can step outside of our house of outrage. It’s a roomy house, with space for everyone from woke progressives to disillusioned conservatives. It’s a good house, filled with people united in a just and defiant cause. It’s a harmonious house, thrumming with the sound of people agreeing vigorously. And lately, we’ve started to believe we’re … winning. We breathed relief Tuesday night when Roy Moore went down to his well-earned political death, like Jack Nicholson’s Joker at the end of Batman. We roared when Robert Mueller extracted a guilty plea from a cooperative Michael Flynn, and the investigative noose seemed to tighten around Donald Trump’s neck. We cheered when Democrat Ralph Northam trounced Ed Gillespie after the Republican took the low road with anti-immigrant demagogy. It’s all lining up. Democrats have an 11-point edge over Republicans in the generic congressional ballot. The president’s approval rating is barely scraping 37 percent. Nearly six in 10 Americans say the United States is on the “wrong track.” Isn’t revenge in 2018 starting to taste sweet — and 2020 even sweeter? Don’t bet on it. Democrats are making the same mistakes Republicans made when they inhabited their own house of outrage, back in 1998. You remember. The year of the wagged finger and the stained blue dress. Of a president who abused women, lied about it, and used his power to bomb other countries so he could distract from his personal messes. Of a special prosecutor whose investigation overstepped its original bounds. Of half the country in a moral fever to impeach. Of the other half determined to dismiss sexual improprieties, defend a democratically elected leader and move on with the business of the country. Oh, also the year in which the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 16 percent, the unemployment rate fell to a 28-year low, and Democrats gained seats in Congress. Bill Clinton, as we all know, survived impeachment and left office with a strong economic record and a 66-percent approval rating. "
"LOS ANGELES — Pharrell Williams remembers the exact moment when he realized he was ready to return to N.E.R.D, his long-running side project with Chad Hugo and Shae Haley. In the beginning of 2016, he dyed his hair green: “The minute I looked in the mirror, I was like, ‘Oh, starting N.E.R.D now.’” He had just left Nashville, where he’d been producing and writing on “Wanderlust,” an album by the unflinchingly smooth country group Little Big Town. And he was coming off the peak of his career as a recording artist: “Blurred Lines,” his limber collaboration with Robin Thicke, and “Get Lucky,” his disco revival with Daft Punk, held No. 1 and 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a time in 2013; the next year, the pop-gospel hymn “Happy” became his first No. 1 as a lead artist, and the song that vaulted him into the stratosphere. He wore an artfully goofy hat to the Grammys. He joined “The Voice” as a coach. He sat for an interview with Oprah, and cried. For someone who’d spent much of his career making others sound good as a producer and songwriter, it was a belated, and extremely loud, splash into the brightest spot of the limelight. The world changed, though, and with it, Mr. Williams. The version of him that appears on the new N.E.R.D album, “No_One Ever Really Dies,” is anti-“Happy,” and anti-happy. He is exasperated by the police shootings of unarmed black Americans. The election of Donald J. Trump stymies him. “We’re gonna climb your wall,” he sings on “Deep Down Body Thurst,” continuing, “It’d be worth the fall/I sure hope you’re just talking man, and that’s all.” On the 11 tracks on the new album, due Friday, he is frantically waving for attention, as if hoping to stave off more trauma. “I spoke up because I saw this coming,” he said last month, discussing politics in his dedicated room at Chalice Recording Studio here, while footage of NASA lectures played on a television screen above the recording booth. (Mr. Williams was a producer of “Hidden Figures,” the 2016 film about black female NASA mathematicians, and wrote music for it as well.) "
"The issue of sexual misconduct has emerged as a centerpiece of Democratic strategy for taking on President Trump and the Republican Party. That strategy paid off on Tuesday with the defeat of Roy Moore. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s decision to bring to center stage charges of sexual harassment leveled by more than a dozen women against Trump has forced the White House onto the defensive. The story so far: On Sunday, Nikki Haley, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, broke ranks with the administration, telling John Dickerson on “Face the Nation” that Trump’s accusers “should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with.” Haley added that she is “incredibly proud of the women who have come forward” in all the recent cases of alleged harassment. On Monday, three of Trump’s accusers appeared on NBC Today with Megyn Kelly, following the publication of articles further chronicling Trump’s alleged misconduct in People, The New Yorker, The Atlantic and New York magazine. The liberal filmmaker, Robert Greenwald, released a documentary, “16 Women and Donald Trump: Hear Their Stories.” All of these developments are taking place against the backdrop of a pending defamation lawsuit against Trump, who awaits the decision of Jennifer G. Schecter — a New York state judge — who is considering a motion to require Trump to testify under oath in a lawsuit brought by Summer Zervos, a former “Apprentice” contestant. Zervos, who is represented by Gloria Allred, claims that in 2007 Trump “kissed her on the mouth repeatedly, touched her breast and pressed his genitals against her,” without her consent. Zervos contends that she was defamed when Trump dismissed her claims during the campaign as “lies” and “nonsense.” "
"Update: The F.C.C. voted on Thursday to repeal net neutrality rules. HONG KONG — To taste a future without net neutrality, try browsing the web in Beijing. China’s internet, provided through telecom giants aligned with the Communist Party, is a digital dystopia, filtered by the vast censorship apparatus known as China’s Great Firewall. Some sites load with soul-withering slowness, or not at all. Others appear instantly. Content vanishes without warning or explanation. The culprit is rarely knowable. A faulty Wi-Fi router? A neighborhood power failure? Commercial sabotage? A clampdown on political dissent? To most Chinese netizens, the reason matters little. They simply gravitate to the few sites that aren’t slowed or blocked entirely: the Chinese counterparts of Facebook, Google, and Twitter. But these Chinese platforms come with heavy government surveillance and censorship by corporate and party apparatchiks. For the Communist Party and its commercial allies, this is win-win, cementing respective monopolies on political markets and consumer power. The Trump administration’s plan to dismantle net neutrality regulations has brought this nightmare scenario to America’s digital doorstep. With the Federal Communications Commission scheduled to vote on the issue today, the threatened rollback not only imperils fair play and free speech; it will also empower foreign entities with substantial market-making power, like China’s government, to meddle in American public discourse on a scale dwarfing Russia’s recent cyber-chicanery. Worse, abolishing net neutrality gives American corporations the means, motive and opportunity to become accomplices in selling out our freedom of speech. Net neutrality is called the First Amendment of the internet for a good reason. Obama-era net neutrality rules classed telecom giants, such as AT&T, as “common carriers,” de facto public utilities like water and electricity companies. This status prohibits corporate bosses from abusing control over network infrastructure to stifle rivals or favor subsidiaries. Under net neutrality rules, a company like Comcast, which owns NBC, cannot throttle data flows carrying Netflix’s competing TV shows, any more than General Electric, once a majority stakeholder in NBC and corporate parent to Jay Leno’s “Tonight Show,” could have cut the power to David Letterman’s “Late Show” studios at CBS. These content-neutral safeguards apply to political speech as much as to “Orange Is the New Black.” They enshrine a basic American value: that diverse opinions, from diverse sources, are a pillar of public welfare. Eliminating net neutrality allows corporations to tamper with data flows on their networks without public oversight or accountability. If a connection is slow for MSNBC but not for Fox News, you may never learn why. Beijing, meanwhile, is not shy about using its political and economic heft to blot out dissent beyond China’s borders, employing tactics that blend politics and commerce. The process starts at home: Foreign media firms seeking access to China’s enormous markets face intense pressure from Communist Party gatekeepers to make odious concessions on content control and privacy. Then, the chilling effects spread overseas. This has already happened in Hollywood: If you can’t distribute a film like “Seven Years in Tibet” in China’s giant market, why bother making it at all? (That 1997 project would never be greenlit today.) Facebook, long locked out of the Chinese market, is flirting with censorship in a likely bid to gain entry. After the Facebook page of Guo Wengui, a prominent regime critic living in exile, vanished last spring, Facebook blamed a systems error. As a private corporation, it is under no obligation to provide more detail. As the incentives and opportunities to self-censor accumulate, content providers will gravitate to producing and promoting whatever reaches the most customers worldwide, even if that means pleasing Chinese cyber-commissars who control access to a billion of them. Content providers — companies like Facebook and LinkedIn — are not, after all, common carriers. They do not control the pipes, or carry a unique public trust in the eyes of the government. As private businesses, they are not bound by the First Amendment. Self-censorship is simply good business. "
"LOS ANGELES — In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion. While the agreement is subject to the approval of antitrust regulators — and the Justice Department recently moved to block a big media company, AT&T, from becoming even bigger — Disney is acknowledging that the future of television and movie viewing is online. The acquisition, which would make Disney a colossus unlike anything Hollywood has ever seen, is the biggest counterattack from a traditional media company against the tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business. Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video. “The pace of disruption has only hastened,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. “This will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority.” At the same time, the agreement means that one of moviedom’s most celebrated studios, 20th Century Fox, will be downsized, with some operations folded into Walt Disney Studios or refocused to make films for online distribution. Founded in 1935, the Fox studio championed Marilyn Monroe, produced classics like “The Sound of Music,” released the first “Star Wars” movie and, more recently, turned “Avatar” into the biggest ticket-seller of all time. But lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content — namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch’s sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood. "
"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The F.C.C. formally voted to overturn Obama-era net neutrality regulations. • How does the Disney deal affect Fox’s efforts to buy control of Sky? • The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney. • Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together. • Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers.

She said that Mr. Trump thinks that today’s deal could be “a great thing” for jobs. There’s a problem. Here’s what Disney’s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning: As Andrew reminded earlier this week, “synergies” is a code word for “layoffs.” And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.

"For a while, Rupert Murdoch seemed invincible. First, the mogul emerged relatively unscathed from a 2011 phone hacking scandal involving his British tabloids that threatened to upend his empire. Then, he installed his sons, Lachlan and James, in leadership roles at 21st Century Fox. And, last year, the thrice-divorced Mr. Murdoch married Jerry Hall, a former supermodel 25 years his junior. But even Mr. Murdoch, a self-made billionaire whose range of media assets wield enormous political influence on three continents, was no match for Silicon Valley. Like King Lear confronting his mortality, Mr. Murdoch, 86, is preparing to divide up a lifetime of spoils. And as he moves to sell off wide swaths of his media and entertainment business, he is also throwing into confusion the line of succession and testing the ties that bind the family-run fief. The Walt Disney Company announced on Thursday it had reached a deal to acquire most of 21st Century Fox Inc., the Murdoch-owned company that includes the storied movie and television studio, national cable networks like FX and National Geographic, 22 regional cable channels dedicated to sports and a 39 percent stake in Britain’s pay TV service, Sky. The $52.4 billion deal — which would not include Fox News, the Fox broadcast network or the FS1 sports cable channel, which will be spun off into a newly listed company — has come about as part of the consolidation sweeping over traditional media companies as they try to fight off threats from Amazon, Apple and Netflix. It also represents a remarkable shift for Mr. Murdoch, a visionary businessman who has long lived by a single credo: Buy, buy, buy. After all, Mr. Murdoch didn’t grow a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, into a $100 billion media business by selling. “Rupert has always been a collector, a builder,” said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. This summer, after my colleagues and I published our attempt at the definitive list of President Trump’s lies, I went on Jacob Weisberg’s podcast to talk about it. Jacob asked about the reaction from readers, and I mentioned a common one from Trump supporters: They didn’t doubt that he sometimes bent the truth. But they thought he was no worse than other recent presidents, and they challenged The Times to do the same exercise for a president other than Trump. Today, we’re publishing the results of that challenge. We analyzed every statement of President Barack Obama’s that had been challenged by fact-checkers (the same methodology we’d used for Trump) and applied the same standard. We were looking for demonstrably untrue statements, defensible under no reasonable interpretation of the facts. In Obama’s case, his demonstrably untrue statements include his infamous lines about a “red line” for Syria and about Americans being able to keep their health insurance if they liked it. They also include lesser-known statements on the high-school dropout rate, American exports and the size of the country’s Muslim population. I encourage you to check out the piece — or, if nothing else, the chart at the top — but here’s one headline number: Obama averaged a little more than two blatant, distinct falsehoods per year during his presidency. Trump is on pace for 124 a year. We have also done something that many newsletter readers have been asking for: An updated version of the definitive list of Trump’s lies, which includes repeated lies. The tax deal. The House and Senate have reached a compromise that bridges the gap between their separate tax bills. The differences were modest, in the big picture. Both bills — and the final deal — will cut taxes deeply for the wealthy, increase the deficit and ultimately hurt the middle class. The final deal, in fact, will cut the top marginal tax rate more than either original House or Senate bill. (Some compromise!) It also seems likely to reject Marco Rubio’s pleas for a larger child-tax credit that would help low-income families. A remarkable part of the deal: It appears to ignore many priorities of swing senators, like Rubio, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and John McCain. Are all of those senators going to fold and vote for the bill anyway? Elsewhere. “Congress needs to be clear now that firing Mueller is unacceptable and un-American — we’re a nation of laws, laws that no one is above,” Max Bergmann and Max Boot write in The Guardian about the special counsel, Robert Mueller. “Failing to protect Mueller is not just moral cowardice, it’s also leaving America’s national security exposed.” Salma Hayek. There’s a good chance you have already read her op-ed on Harvey Weinstein. It drew a gigantic audience yesterday. If you haven’t read it, I recommend it. "

"The editor in chief of Christianity Today did not have to wait for the votes to be counted to publish his essay on Tuesday bemoaning what the Alabama Senate race had wrought. Whoever wins, “there is already one loser: Christian faith,” wrote Mark Galli, whose publication, the flagship of American evangelicalism, was founded 61 years ago by the Rev. Billy Graham. “No one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation. Christianity’s integrity is severely tarnished.” The sight of white evangelical voters in Alabama giving their overwhelming support to Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate, despite accusations of racial and religious bigotry, misogyny and assaults on teenage girls, has deeply troubled many conservative Christians, who fear that association with the likes of Mr. Moore is giving their faith a bad name. The angst has grown so deep, Mr. Galli said, that he knows of “many card-carrying evangelicals” who are ready to disavow the label. The evangelical brand “is definitely tarnished” by politicization from whatever side, Mr. Galli said on Wednesday. “No question about it.” He said that his readers seemed to agree with the thrust of his essay. The main criticism he received, he said, was one he agreed with: that he should have made it clearer that he was referring not to all Christians, but to evangelicals in particular. The bloc that has marched under the banner of the “Moral Majority” and “values voters” has now been tagged as the most reliable base of support for both Mr. Moore and President Trump, two politicians who are known for fanning racial and religious prejudices and who stand accused of sexual harassment by numerous women — accusations that each man denies. White evangelicals across the country delivered 81 percent of their votes to Mr. Trump last year, according to exit poll data, and backed Mr. Moore in Alabama by the same proportion on Tuesday. "
