"Here is an official translation of a statement released by the Korean Central News Agency of North Korea on Wednesday. Kim Kye Gwan, the first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK, made public the following press statement on Wednesday: Kim Jong Un, the chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, made a strategic decision to put an end to the unpleasant steps for peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the world. In response to the noble intention of Chairman Kim Jong Un, President Trump stated his position for terminating the historically deep-rooted hostility and improving the relations between DPRK and the U.S. I appreciated the position positively with an expectation that upcoming DPRK-U.S. summit would be a big step forward for catalyzing detente on the Korean peninsula and building a great future. But now prior to the DPRK-U.S. summit, unbridled remarks provoking the other side of dialogue are recklessly made in the U.S. and I am totally disappointed as these constitute extremely unjust behavior. High-ranking officials of the White House and the Department of State including Bolton, White House national security adviser, are letting loose the assertions of so-called Libya mode of nuclear abandonment, “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” “total decommissioning of nuclear weapons, missiles and biochemical weapons” etc. while talking about formula of “abandoning nuclear weapons first, compensating afterwards.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Damage control for Europe, a loss for democracy in Hungary and an unexpected baguette champion in France. Here’s the latest: • The United States’ European allies once worked overtime to please President Trump and preserve the trans-Atlantic alliance. On Tuesday, they met with Iran’s foreign minister to try to preserve the nuclear deal, above, while criticizing the bloodshed surrounding the U.S. Embassy’s move to Jerusalem. But even as European officials scramble to protect their own interests and contain the geopolitical damage from Mr. Trump’s policies, our chief correspondent in Europe writes, American power leaves them with few viable options. Meanwhile, in a new strain on trans-Atlantic trade relations, the World Trade Organization ruled that Europe had improperly subsidized Airbus to the detriment of Boeing, opening the door for the Trump administration to impose billions of dollars in retaliatory sanctions on European imports. _____ • “We don’t want peaceful protests, we want rockets fired.” That was the chant in Gaza, the scene of funerals for protesters killed along the fence bordering Israel, and frenzied work treating the thousands of wounded. The protests resumed, above, but on a smaller scale, and were met with tear gas. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House official had a startling assertion: He thought he had received an email in the first half of 2016 alerting the Trump campaign that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Testifying behind closed doors on Capitol Hill in late March, the official, John K. Mashburn, said he remembered the email coming from George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign who was approached by a Russian agent, sometime before the party conventions — and well before WikiLeaks began publishing messages stolen in hackings from Democrats. Such an email could have proved explosive, providing evidence that at least one high-ranking Trump campaign official was alerted to Russia’s meddling, raising questions about which advisers knew and undercutting President Trump’s denials of collusion. But two months after Mr. Mashburn testified, investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee have not found any such message. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was also searching for similar emails, according to a person familiar with a request for documents that his investigators sent to the Trump campaign. The campaign, which has examined its emails and other documents, also cannot find the message, and officials do not believe it exists. Mr. Mashburn offered a tantalizing prospect for Senate Judiciary Committee investigators, who sifted through a tranche of emails from Mr. Papadopoulos. But the search that he inspired demonstrates the difficulty investigators for Congress and Mr. Mueller face nearly two years after the F.B.I. began looking into ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. Counterintelligence experts say that uncovering what occurred during an event like the 2016 election could take years, if not decades, to understand. Witnesses have turned over more than one million documents. Hundreds of individuals have been interviewed and dozens have testified before grand juries. Yet basic questions about the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia remain unanswered, including the central question of whether officials or Trump associates coordinated with the election interference.

"A state representative, an Air Force veteran and two high-powered lawyers — all women — won Democratic House primaries on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, where a record number of women ran for House seats in a year of intense political enthusiasm among female Democrats. It was a night of victories for at least seven Democratic women running for the House in a state that has an all-male congressional delegation of 20 and a Statehouse dominated by male politicians. Female candidates showed strength in nearly every region of Pennsylvania, from the Philadelphia suburbs to the conservative southwest. Madeleine Dean, the state House member; Chrissy Houlahan, the veteran; and Mary Gay Scanlon, one of the lawyers, each won in Philadelphia suburban districts that they are now favored to carry in November, according to results from The Associated Press. Their primary victories raise the likelihood of women cracking the state’s all-male congressional delegation. Susan Wild, the other lawyer, won a competitive primary in the Lehigh Valley but now faces a tough general election race in a district with many blue-collar voters. The women won in districts that were redrawn to replace a gerrymandered Republican map that the State Supreme Court ruled illegal in January. The new map of the state’s 18 House districts — and the ebullience it set off among Democrats hoping to capture the House of Representatives in the midterms — put Pennsylvania front-and-center among four states that held primaries on Tuesday. President Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016 and Democrats, seeking to tap into grass-roots rejection of the president, badly want a version of a do-over in the midterm elections. And the state will be critical to determining whether Republicans or Democrats win control of the House in November. "
"The White House eliminated the position of cybersecurity coordinator on the National Security Council on Tuesday, doing away with a post central to developing policy to defend against increasingly sophisticated digital attacks and the use of offensive cyber weapons. A memorandum circulated by an aide to the new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said the post was no longer considered necessary because lower-level officials had already made cybersecurity issues a “core function” of the president’s national security team. Cybersecurity experts and members of Congress said they were mystified by the move, though some suggested Mr. Bolton did not want any competitive power centers emerging inside the national security apparatus. The decision was criticized by Mark R. Warner, a senator from Virginia and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I don’t see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the White House does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats,” he wrote on Twitter. It was the latest in a series of steps that appeared to run counter to the prevailing view in Washington of cybersecurity’s importance. Two years ago, a commission established by President Barack Obama urged elevating the cybersecurity coordinator job and turning the position into an assistant to the president, on par to the assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security — a reflection that various federal agencies did not have clear lines of authority or clear strategies in cybersecurity. "
"As American and Chinese officials meet this week in Washington to defuse trade tensions, both sides are trying to find common ground. It won’t be easy. The Trump administration has pressed hard for China to make major changes to its trade practices and limit the state’s role in the economy — an agenda that comes in conflict with Beijing’s desire to protect its industries and build new ones. It all traces back to the style and speed of China’s growth. Over the past 40 years, Western countries have struggled to find the right recipe of incentives and agreements to get China to play fair. Trading partners often complain that China flouts the rules to get ahead. And none have voiced those concerns more virulently than President Trump, who has said it was a mistake to let China into the World Trade Organization in the first place. The president stoked fears of a trade war earlier this year, when he announced tariffs first on washing machines and solar panels, and then steel and aluminum. And the Trump administration hit China again in April, blocking exports of microchips and software to the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, before seeming to rethink the aggressive move in a tweet saying that he and the Chinese leader are “working together.” So how did a poor, developing country that still has a gross domestic product per capita of less than $10,000 come to rival, and even challenge, the existing economic order? "
"For more than a month now, the investigation of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, has been a spectacle, a garish pageant of money, sex and politics unfolding both in court and in the court of public opinion. And if anyone can be thought of as the ringmaster in this noisy legal circus, it is Mr. Cohen’s chief nemesis, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for the pornographic film star Stephanie Clifford. After all, it was Mr. Avenatti who sent Ms. Clifford — better known as Stormy Daniels — into a courtroom in Manhattan last month to sit (in her pink blazer) within sight of Mr. Cohen as part of a publicity stunt that largely seemed designed to needle and unnerve him. It was also Mr. Avenatti who set off a frenzy in the media last week by releasing a report that showed how Mr. Cohen had taken more than $1 million from a firm linked to a wealthy Russian oligarch and from several major companies, including AT&T. As federal prosecutors in Manhattan continue to investigate whether Mr. Cohen broke the law by paying Ms. Clifford to stay silent about an affair she says she had with Mr. Trump, Mr. Avenatti has never once shut up about the case. In a guerrilla-style campaign, he has been on Twitter daily — sometimes almost hourly — talking of Mr. Cohen and has appeared so frequently on television that some have joked that he sleeps at CNN. But while his voluble tactics have won him plaudits among members of the left, many of whom seem to believe that his efforts in the Cohen case might take down Mr. Trump, some legal experts said that his barrage of Trump-like tweets and his all-but-constant media appearances might not be doing Ms. Clifford any favors. “Lawyers do speak publicly to defend their clients, but it’s ordinarily very limited and there’s a good reason for that,” said Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at the New York University School of Law. “I don’t think Avenatti is truly representing Clifford in his media blitz. It’s not quite legal representation — it’s political representation.” "
"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Twenty years ago, burning from his dismissal as deputy prime minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim unleashed a protest movement against his mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, calling him insane, senile and unfit to lead the nation. Today, the two men, after years of bad blood and the imprisonment of Mr. Anwar, have retaken their places at the top of Malaysian politics: Mr. Mahathir is prime minister once again, at age 92, and Mr. Anwar, newly pardoned by the country’s king on Wednesday, is waiting to inherit the leadership. This time, they have done it under the banner of what had been Malaysia’s opposition, the Alliance of Hope, which decisively swept away the government of Najib Razak in national elections last week by accusing him of epic corruption and vowing reform — and the reinstatement of Mr. Anwar’s political career. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Anwar, 70, newly free after five years of detention, vowed that ending the influence of politics over the country’s justice system would be a priority. “We must stop this once and for all,” he said. “The most significant lesson one can learn from prison life is the value of freedom.” He has twice been deprived of his freedom, both times in what was widely seen as political manipulation coming from the leadership of the governing party, the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, which at one point included Mr. Mahathir, Mr. Anwar and Mr. Najib among its top ranks.

"President Trump’s rejection of the Iran nuclear deal has unleashed a rare fury in Europe. Following his withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, his tariffs on imported steel, the move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the rewriting of international trade agreements and all the other signs of disdain for the priorities of America’s traditional allies, many Europeans are furiously proclaiming the trans-Atlantic relationship dead. However palpable the frustration, the question once again is whether Europeans are prepared to, or even able to, stand up to the bully across the sea. Certainly this is what many Europeans would dearly love to do. Europe must not accept being the “vassals” of the United States, declared the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, whose boss, President Emmanuel Macron, so recently kissed and hugged Mr. Trump in a futile effort to influence him. “We have to stop being wimps,” said Nathalie Tocci, a senior adviser to the European Union. The cover of the German weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel reflected a common sentiment in its depiction of Mr. Trump as a middle finger proclaiming, “Goodbye, Europe!” The fiery editorial inside called for “resistance against America.” “The West as we once knew it no longer exists,” Der Spiegel’s editors wrote. “Our relationship to the United States cannot currently be called a friendship and can hardly be referred to as a partnership. President Trump has adopted a tone that ignores 70 years of trust.” Then there are the hard facts. Europe’s trade with the United States is incomparably larger than its trade with Iran, and even if Britain, France and Germany — co-signers of the Iran accord, along with China, the European Union, Russia and the United States — try to maintain the Iran deal and support their companies against so-called secondary sanctions by Washington, many European banks and industries would be wary of defying America’s enormous economic clout, and especially the reach of its banking system. "
"WASHINGTON — When presidents make the trip to Capitol Hill from the White House to address lawmakers, they usually have a request to make, a policy proposal to sell or an overarching message to deliver. That did not appear to be the case on Tuesday, when President Trump held forth for close to an hour during a closed-door lunch with Republican senators in a monologue that was part political update, part celebration and part comedy routine, according to several people present and others briefed on the meeting. Mr. Trump steered clear of contentious topics, like an aide’s controversial remark about Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has brain cancer — and no senators asked him about it. He did not address his abrupt decision this week, announced on Twitter, to reconsider penalties against the Chinese electronics maker ZTE, which was punished for violating United States sanctions and is suspected of being a surveillance risk. And he did not browbeat senators in person, as he has on Twitter, about changing their rules to make it easier to push through legislation along party lines or about scrapping their summer vacation to work on his agenda. Instead, Mr. Trump talked about his accomplishments — including the surging economy; the decisions to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and to pursue nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea; and the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem, which he said had saved American taxpayers a substantial amount of money — and about his optimism over Republicans’ chances in the fall midterm elections.

"Four states held primary elections on Tuesday, but one loomed the largest by far: Pennsylvania. In a state that has emerged as one of the most important battlegrounds of 2018, Democrats settled a cluster of chaotic nomination fights — and Republicans, despite being on the defensive, sent a signal of strong support for President Trump. Democrats nominated an eclectic group of candidates, including liberals and moderates, military veterans and lawyers, political newcomers and seasoned politicians. But most of their nominees in important races have one thing in common: They are women. [Read more about the women who won here.] In four congressional districts ringing Philadelphia, Democrats selected female nominees: Madeleine Dean, Chrissy Houlahan, Mary Gay Scanlon and Susan Wild. At least two of them — Ms. Dean and Ms. Houlahan — are overwhelmingly likely to win the general election under Pennsylvania’s new congressional map, which had its first test on Tuesday night. That would represent a breakthrough in Pennsylvania, which has sent only men to Congress since 2015. [Read about the surge of women running for Congress this year.] And Democratic women triumphed beyond Pennsylvania: In an Omaha-based congressional district, Kara Eastman, a liberal insurgent, won the Democratic nomination in an upset against former Representative Brad Ashford. And in the race for governor of Idaho, Paulette Jordan, a state legislator who would be the country’s first Native American governor, defeated a wealthy businessman in the Democratic primary. In the lone key Pennsylvania primary where a Democratic woman fell short, it was against a man strongly backed by party leaders. In the district held by Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, Scott Wallace, a wealthy investor, defeated a female primary opponent, Rachel Reddick, after national Democrats lobbied for him to join the race.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Stephen Colbert is taking President Trump to task over his support of a Chinese telecom, ZTE. As new information trickles in, Colbert has said that he’s starting to get even more suspicious. On Monday, he went after Trump for saying in a tweet that he would work with the Chinese government to help ZTE — a reversal that has puzzled policy experts. Colbert returned to the topic on Tuesday with new information: It turns out Trump’s tweet arrived just three days after the Chinese government agreed to invest half a billion dollars in a project involving a Trump-branded resort. Colbert joked that he couldn’t see why the resort — which also includes a theme park — would want to associate itself with Trump anyway. Ryan Reynolds crashed Colbert’s monologue halfway through, decked out in the regalia of Deadpool, the superhero he plays in the new film “Deadpool 2.” He read off some of the night’s funniest political punchlines. Trevor Noah said he was surprised to hear Melania Trump had been hospitalized for an operation. He looked at a picture of her next to her husband, and marveled at the difference. Noah also made fun of the White House for its difficulty containing leaks to the news media. In a tweet on Monday, the president minimized the idea that leakers presented a serious problem — but at the same time, he threatened to confront them. That seemed contradictory to Noah. "
"Ramadan is here. By now, many Americans know the basics. It’s the holy month during which healthy and able Muslims are commanded to abstain from food, drink (Not even water? Nope, not even water) and sex from sunrise to sunset and invest in intense prayer, charity and spiritual discipline. In recent years, Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, has become part of mainstream American society. It is frequently cited in hip-hop and even made an appearance in Eminem’s epic freestyle takedown of President Trump at the BET Awards. In keeping with the tradition started by Thomas Jefferson, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama hosted community leaders and dignitaries at Ramadan dinners featuring a variety of exquisite halal meats. (Mr. Trump eliminated that beautiful gathering. That’s not surprising given his belief that “Islam hates us.”) The holy month is now even linked to the most sacred American tradition, consumerism: Party City has introduced a line of Ramadan decorations featuring mosques, stars and crescent symbols. But I want more. This Ramadan, I’m in search of something substantive that nurtures my soul and truly transforms America, which is wounded, suffering from a resurgence in open expressions of hate against racial and religious minorities, and politicians who seek to profit off the divides. I know the solution will start at home, so this month, I aspire to evolve into an overweight, middle-aged superhero without a cape, disciplined and mindful, grateful for my privileges, spiritually aware and more compassionate. I’ll try praying for enemies, friends, frenemies and Kanye West. I must, however, make a confession (I hope the Catholic priests who taught me in high school would approve): I usually end up hangry, drained from juggling work and chasing my two hyper toddlers. It’s exhausting. As I do every year, I’ll probably find myself musing: “You know, Buddhism is looking pretty good. It worked out well for the Beastie Boys.” Yes, intermittent fasting may improve health, but there’s a famous saying that it’s possible to fast the entire month of Ramadan only to end up with nothing more than empty stomachs and thirst. After all, even if you’re not eating or drinking, it’s hard to focus on spirituality when there’s so much in the real world to steal our attention: Will the Supreme Court rule for a Muslim travel ban that will separate millions of people from their families? Will Mr. Trump’s early-morning tweets one day start a war? "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s planned summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea is in doubt after Pyongyang threatened today to withdraw if Washington insisted on “unilateral nuclear abandonment.” Rejecting the Trump administration’s demand that it quickly dismantle its nuclear program, as Libya did 15 years ago, North Korea singled out John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, saying in a statement, “We do not hide our feelings of repugnance towards him.” Read a transcript of the North Korean statement here. The announcement came hours after state media in Pyongyang warned that the meeting might be canceled to protest the joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea that began this week. • The State Department said that planning for the June 12 meeting in Singapore remained on track, but the news from North Korea reflected a pattern by the unpredictable regime: diplomatic outreach, followed by erratic behavior. Here’s a look at previous instances. • At least seven women running for the House won Democratic primaries on Tuesday in the state, which currently has an all-male congressional delegation. They won in districts that were redrawn after Pennsylvania’s congressional map was found to unfairly favor Republicans. Helped by the new map, Democrats have a shot at flipping at least three, and possibly as many as six, House seats in the state, which President Trump narrowly won in 2016. "
"The first modern German empire was announced by Otto von Bismarck at Versailles in 1871; it died on the Western Front in 1918. The second German empire was forged in a swift march of annexations and blitzkriegs; it lasted seven terrible years, from the Anschluss to the bunker, and died with Hitler and his cult. The third German empire is a different animal altogether. Repudiating both militarism and racist mysticism, it has been built slowly and painstakingly across three generations, in cooperation with other powers (including its old enemies the French), using a mix of democratic and bureaucratic means. Today Germany bestrides its Continent, but German power is wielded softly, indirectly, implicitly — and when the fist is required, it takes the form of fiscal ultimatums, not military bluster or racial irredentism. But still the system is effectively imperial in many ways, with power brokers in Berlin and Brussels wielding not-exactly-democratic authority over a polyglot, multiethnic, multireligious sprawl of semi-sovereign nation-states. And thinking about the European Union this way, as a Germanic empire as well as a liberal-cosmopolitan project, is a helpful way of understanding how it might ultimately fall. The possibility of such a fall has been haunting the Continent since the Great Recession, as the sense of crisis, the threat of dissolution, has spread from the Balkan periphery to an increasingly nationalist Eastern Europe and a Brexit-chasing Britain. Now with the near-takeover of Italy’s government by a populist coalition, it has reached the original European Union project’s core. As this crisis has developed and encompassed grievances beyond the economic — immigration and national identity above all — it has been covered more and more as a clash between liberalism and illiberalism, between freedom and authoritarianism. In the wave of liberalism-in-peril books written since Donald Trump’s election, the European and American experiences tend to get folded together into a story of democratic values threatened by ethnic chauvinism and would-be strongmen — by Putin imitators, to borrow a common trope, who want to use the democratic part of liberal democracy as a ladder up to power and then burn away the liberal part. This story has some truth to it. There are ideological affinities as well as funding streams linking Moscow and many of the nationalists to Russia’s west, and the most empowered populist within the European Union, Hungary’s Viktor Orban, is explicit about his intent to replace liberal democracy with a form of “Christian democracy” that looks suspiciously like de facto one-party rule.

"The major networks are unveiling their latest wares to ad buyers in Manhattan this week at a series of events known as the Upfront presentations. It’s a longtime tradition made more urgent, these days, by the exodus of advertisers over the last few years from television to Facebook and Google. Two New York Times reporters who cover the media — John Koblin (television) and Sapna Maheshwari (advertising) — assess what they saw during the ABC presentation at Lincoln Center’s David Geffen Hall on Tuesday. JOHN That was quite the “Roseanne” show, wasn’t it? SAPNA She was clearly the star of the show. JOHN A year ago, Roseanne Barr and the cast of her eponymous sitcom were carted out before the Lincoln Center crowd, and the reaction was dead silence. This year, Ms. Barr opened the proceedings to huge cheers. The revival of her show has been a ratings blockbuster — and although she rated nary a mention during a recent Disney earnings call, perhaps because of her inconvenient politics, the ABC-TV executive Ben Sherwood played up her contribution to the network’s recent turn in fortune before the audience of advertisers and members of the press. “If anyone came to play a drinking game for the number of times we mention Roseanne,” he said from the stage, “you’re welcome.” SAPNA The network also managed to make time for “American Idol,” which it stole away from Fox, “Good Morning America” and a few of its shows from Freeform — Disney’s dedicated cable network for millennials. JOHN Here is one statistic I had never heard at an upfront before: Freeform bragging that the premiere of “Siren” got one million “starts.” I’m pretty sure that means a million people clicked on it and may or may not have finished it. SAPNA You know “Sirens” is for millennials because it’s about mermaids, not grizzled detectives. JOHN Tell me about it. "
"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate panel on Wednesday that one of his employees had worked without pay on her personal time to find him a place to live, a service that Democrats said amounted to a violation of federal law. He also confirmed that he had established a legal defense fund to defray the costs of defending himself against 12 federal investigations into his spending and management decisions. The acknowledgments came amid increasing allegations of legal and ethical misconduct by Mr. Pruitt that have led some lawmakers, including in his own party, to call for his resignation. They were part of testimony before the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the environment, the third congressional hearing Mr. Pruitt has faced in less than a month. While President Trump has said he continues to support his embattled E.P.A. chief, senior members of the White House staff have opened a renewed push to persuade their boss to fire Mr. Pruitt. Democrats said Wednesday that Mr. Pruitt’s testimony appeared to have opened up new lines of legal scrutiny. They also accused Mr. Pruitt of lying when he asserted that he had never requested that his security detail use lights and sirens to speed through Washington on non-urgent trips, producing a document that they said proved he had.

"THINGS THAT MAKE WHITE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE
By Michael Bennett and Dave Zirin
220 pp. Haymarket Books. $24.95. Part of the mythology of sports, according to Michael Bennett, the Super Bowl champion defensive end, is that sports make society more equal. “That’s miseducation,” he writes in “Things That Make White People Uncomfortable.” “The only thing that’s going to make us equal isn’t sports. It’s going to be people realizing we’re all human.” One of the raging debates of our times centers on social justice — and, in particular, the political views of athletes in the age of President Trump. Near its epicenter is Bennett, now a Philadelphia Eagle, who as a Seattle Seahawk sat during the national anthem last season to protest systemic inequalities. He is now fighting assault charges after being accused, unjustly he argues, of injuring an elderly woman while rushing through the crowd after last year’s Super Bowl to congratulate his twin brother, Martellus, on the Patriots’ win. Bennett’s worldview and understanding of race has been intensified by experiences like these. Wasting few words and fewer emotions in this memoir (written with Dave Zirin, sports editor of The Nation), he starts by examining the brutal realities of both collegiate and professional football. The former Texas A&M Aggie includes poignant descriptions of his undergraduate years, noting that racism was at the center of his college experience. He also explains how post-traumatic stress disorder triggered in high school and college can follow athletes long after the stadium crowds stop roaring. As an Aggie, Bennett explains, he was “half god, half property,” subject to so many restrictions that he was socked with a one-game suspension for leaving campus to attend his 2-year-old daughter’s birthday party. Bennett still resents going undrafted in 2009, the result, he believes, of his inability to live by the advice given to athletes: “Stick to sports.” "
"Yes, even dictators get cold feet. Wednesday’s news that North Korea was considering calling off Kim Jong-un’s planned June meeting with President Trump reflected a pattern by the unpredictable regime: diplomatic outreach, followed by erratic behavior and, in many cases, an outright rejection of peace overtures. Here’s a look at some other times when the North did a sudden about-face: After its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, North Korea agreed to take part in six-party talks with the United States and regional powers, and pledged in 2005 to “abandon nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.” But the following year it conducted its first nuclear test. By 2009, after months of provocative behavior, Pyongyang said it would permanently pull out of nuclear disarmament talks and restart its nuclear program, and it expelled United Nations inspectors from the country. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush declared North Korea, along with Iraq and Iran, part of an “axis of evil,” but toward the end of his term his advisers softened that approach. In 2008, Washington dropped North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and agreed to send the North economic aid in return for Pyongyang disclosing and disabling its nuclear facilities. But by December that agreement had collapsed, after North Korea refused to allow for a system of verifying its compliance with the deal. President Barack Obama’s approach to North Korea included steadily tightening economic pressure, while allowing American diplomats to quietly meet with their North Korean counterparts. "
"When North Korea first threw the fate of a historic summit meeting with the United States into question last week, it cited — five times — the fate of another country and another leader, half a world away, as an example of why no one should trust American efforts to disarm another nation. The country was Libya, and the leader was Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who made a bad bet that he could swap his nascent nuclear program for economic integration with the West. That deal, executed by the Bush administration nearly 15 years ago, is a footnote to American histories of that era. But Libya has always loomed large for the North Koreans. Mentions of the Libya deal as a model for North Korea’s own denuclearization — first by Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and then by Vice President Mike Pence — were enough to draw two threats of withdrawal from the talks by North Korea. After the second threat, President Trump announced unexpectedly on Thursday that he had decided to withdraw from the planned June 12 meeting. Whether Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, will ever meet — a move disarmament advocates saw as an opportunity to end decades of animosity between the nations — remains an open question. So what exactly is the “Libya model” and how has it become a sticking point in a meeting between President Trump and Mr. Kim? "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a White House meeting on Wednesday, warning in front of news cameras that dangerous people were clamoring to breach the country’s borders and branding such people “animals.” Mr. Trump’s comments came during a round-table discussion with state and local leaders on California’s so-called sanctuary laws, which strictly limit communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, and which the Trump administration is suing to invalidate. It was hardly the first time the president has spoken in racially fraught terms about immigrants, but it underscored his anger about unchecked immigration — the animating issue of his campaign and his tenure so far — and his frustration that he has not been able to do more to seal the nation’s borders. As he has in numerous private meetings with his advisers at the White House, Mr. Trump used the session to vent about the nation’s immigration laws, calling them “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world.” He exhorted his administration to “do much better” in keeping out undesirable people, including members of transnational gangs like MS-13. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we’re stopping a lot of them,” Mr. Trump said in the Cabinet Room during an hourlong meeting that reporters were allowed to document. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people, these are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.” Mr. Trump’s remarks came as the local officials invited for the event took turns praising his immigration policies and lamenting California’s law, arguing that it was making it more difficult for their communities to find and deport criminals. Sheriff Margaret Mims of Fresno County said the statute barred Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities from using her databases “to find the bad guys,” or from entering prisons to locate people who might be in the country illegally.

"Updated, 7:34 a.m. Good Wednesday morning. It’s damp and gray outside. Metro-North riders should expect scattered delays and some canceled trains after yesterday’s storm. Expect limited service between Southeast and North White Plains on the Harlem Line and service remains suspended between Wassaic and Southeast. Riders should expect normal commutes on the subway, Long Island Rail Road, Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. It’s just you and a friend, a ball and a wall. One of our city’s most enduring warm-weather pastimes, handball, is also one of the simplest. And as with so many of life’s great pleasures, New York City played a central role in its development. While humans have been slapping balls against walls for thousands of years — in Egypt, the Roman baths and specially designed courts in the pre-Columbian Americas — the modern predecessor of handball was developed around a millennium ago in Ireland. In the late 19th century, Irish immigrants brought the sport to New York City, where Irish priests taught it to students in the city’s parochial schools. An Irish immigrant handball star, Phil Casey, built the first walled handball court in Brooklyn in 1886. New York’s outdoor version of the sport, which used one wall instead of three, gained popularity in the early 1900s, when it was played against wooden jetties in Coney Island and Brighton Beach. When the tide was low, players drew courts in the sand. During the Depression, hundreds of courts were constructed in the city — mostly because they were cheap. "
"In Fayetteville, Ark., this March, volunteers were on their way to set up an apartment, cars loaded with linens, lamps, crockery and canned food, when they were abruptly told to turn around. The refugee family from the Democratic Republic of Congo would not be coming. In Columbus, Ohio, a 14-passenger white van that would take refugees to medical appointments sits unused. In the rare instance a newcomer or two needs transport, they travel in a fuel-efficient economy car. And in southwest Houston, a 1,500-square-foot storage room is loaded to the ceiling with furniture, toys, bedding and other items donated for refugee families, all collecting dust. The flow of refugees to the United States has slowed nearly to a halt, demonstrating that what President Trump’s administration could not achieve by executive order, it is accomplishing by bureaucracy. The administration has cut the staff that conducts clearance interviews overseas, intensified the screening process for refugees, and for those people it characterizes as high-risk, doubled the number who need to be screened. As a result, if the trickle of refugees admitted continues at its current pace, just 20,000 are projected to enter the United States by the end of this year, the lowest figure since the resettlement program was created with passage of the Refugee Act in 1980.

"WASHINGTON — The White House brushed aside threats by North Korea on Wednesday to cancel an upcoming summit meeting between President Trump and the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, saying it was still “hopeful” the meeting will happen — but that Mr. Trump would be fine if it did not. “The president is ready if the meeting takes place,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told Fox News on Wednesday. “And if it doesn’t, we will continue the maximum pressure campaign that has been ongoing.” White House officials said they were taking North Korea’s latest warnings in stride, in part because Mr. Kim, not Mr. Trump, had sought the meeting. They said they expected the North to maneuver for tactical advantage in the run-up to the meeting, which is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore. When Mr. Trump was asked on Wednesday about the prospects for the summit to go off as planned, he was noncommittal, telling reporters in the Oval Office, “We’ll have to see.” Mr. Trump said he would still insist on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in the talks. In its warning on Wednesday, North Korea said Mr. Kim could withdraw from the meeting over Washington’s demand that it unilaterally abandon its nuclear arsenal. "
"WASHINGTON — In a veiled rebuke of President Trump, former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson warned on Wednesday that American democracy was threatened by a growing “crisis of ethics and integrity.” “If our leaders seek to conceal the truth, or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a pathway to relinquishing our freedom,” he said in a commencement address at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Va. Even small falsehoods and exaggerations are problematic, Mr. Tillerson said. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name, although the president is prone to both. “When we as people, a free people, go wobbly on the truth even on what may seem the most trivial matters, we go wobbly on America,” he said. Mr. Tillerson arrived in Washington after running Exxon Mobil, one of the world’s largest corporations, backed by business leaders and some foreign policy experts as a man who could bring experience and ballast to an untested administration. But as the nation’s top diplomat, he soon found himself at odds with the president over a variety of issues, including negotiating with North Korea and extending the Iran nuclear deal, and privately humiliated until he was fired by a tweet.

"Novartis’s top lawyer is to retire from the company over payments made by the pharmaceutical giant to President Trump’s personal lawyer Michael D. Cohen, the Swiss drug maker said on Wednesday. In a statement, Novartis said that Felix R. Ehrat, the group general counsel, would be replaced by Shannon Thyme Klinger, who is currently the company’s top ethics officer, at the beginning of June. Mr. Ehrat was stepping down “in the context of discussions surrounding Novartis’s former agreement with Essential Consultants, owned by Michael Cohen,” the pharmaceutical company said. “Although the contract was legally in order, it was an error,” Mr. Ehrat said. “As a cosignatory with our former C.E.O., I take personal responsibility to bring the public debate on this matter to an end.” Mr. Ehrat, a practicing lawyer in Switzerland, has been the group general counsel at Novartis since 2011. Novartis has said that its former chief executive, Joe Jimenez, entered into the agreement with Mr. Cohen as part of an effort to gain insight into the approach the new administration would take on topics of interest to Novartis, particularly health care. The company said that, after an initial meeting with Mr. Cohen last March, it concluded that he did not have the expertise they had hoped for and decided not to go forward with the arrangement. But it said it learned the contract could only be canceled for cause and allowed it to expire in February. Since revelations about the relationship last Tuesday, Novartis has sought to distance its new chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, from the controversy, saying that the decision to hire Mr. Cohen had been made by Mr. Jimenez and that Mr. Narasimhan had played no role. Mr. Jimenez retired from the company in January. "
"WASHINGTON — Cory Booker. Sherrod Brown. Kirsten Gillibrand. Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren. The former secretary of housing and urban Development Julián Castro. And Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. All luminaries in the Democratic Party, all on the progressive side of the spectrum. And all potential presidential candidates who were road-testing their pitches on Tuesday at the Center for American Progress’s Ideas Conference in Washington. Since its founding in 2003, the center has been seen as thoroughly establishment. Its founding president, John D. Podesta, was President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman, and its current president, Neera Tanden, is also a Clinton loyalist. But like some Democrats, the center has shifted leftward lately, for example by advocating a jobs guarantee, a nominally left-wing proposal that several prominent Democrats have embraced. While presidential ambitions provided the subtext for the gathering, a few outward themes emerged: President Trump was discussed, of course, especially in a panel on “Democracy and the Rule of Law” featuring Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Representative Ted Lieu of California and the former acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates. But in contrast to last year’s conference — when Mr. Trump’s recent firing of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey dominated the conversation — speakers seemed focused less on opposing the president and more on espousing affirmative policy proposals. "
"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats narrowly won a vote on Wednesday to save so-called net neutrality rules that ensure unobstructed access to the internet. The Senate passed a resolution in a 52-47 vote to overturn a decision last December by the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle Obama-era rules that prevented broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast from blocking or speeding up streams and downloads of web content in exchange for extra fees. The commission’s repeal of net neutrality is set to take effect in a few weeks. The rare victory for Democrats is sure to be short-lived, with a similar resolution expected to die in the House, where Republicans have a larger majority. Only three Republican senators voted in support of the resolution. But that’s beyond the point. The effort to stop the repeal of net neutrality rules is part of a broader political strategy by Democrats to rally young voters in the November elections. “Contact your Republican senator,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said in a speech before the vote. “See who votes for net neutrality and who votes against. And let them know how you feel about the way they voted.” For Democrats, net neutrality is part of a three-legged stool — internet access, gun control and marijuana legalization — they are leaning on to entice young voters to engage in the midterm elections. Such voters broadly side with Democrats, even though they are notoriously complacent in nonpresidential election years. "
"JERUSALEM — During my years in the international press here in Israel, long before the bloody events of this week, I came to respect Hamas for its keen ability to tell a story. At the end of 2008 I was a desk editor, a local hire in The Associated Press’s Jerusalem bureau, during the first serious round of violence in Gaza after Hamas took it over the year before. That conflict was grimly similar to the American campaign in Iraq, in which a modern military fought in crowded urban confines against fighters concealed among civilians. Hamas understood early that the civilian death toll was driving international outrage at Israel, and that this, not I.E.D.s or ambushes, was the most important weapon in its arsenal. Early in that war, I complied with Hamas censorship in the form of a threat to one of our Gaza reporters and cut a key detail from an article: that Hamas fighters were disguised as civilians and were being counted as civilians in the death toll. The bureau chief later wrote that printing the truth after the threat to the reporter would have meant “jeopardizing his life.” Nonetheless, we used that same casualty toll throughout the conflict and never mentioned the manipulation. Hamas understood that Western news outlets wanted a simple story about villains and victims and would stick to that script, whether because of ideological sympathy, coercion or ignorance. The press could be trusted to present dead human beings not as victims of the terrorist group that controls their lives, or of a tragic confluence of events, but of an unwarranted Israeli slaughter. The willingness of reporters to cooperate with that script gave Hamas the incentive to keep using it. The next step in the evolution of this tactic was visible in Monday’s awful events. If the most effective weapon in a military campaign is pictures of civilian casualties, Hamas seems to have concluded, there’s no need for a campaign at all. All you need to do is get people killed on camera. The way to do this in Gaza, in the absence of any Israeli soldiers inside the territory, is to try to cross the Israeli border, which everyone understands is defended with lethal force and is easy to film. About 40,000 people answered a call to show up. Many of them, some armed, rushed the border fence. Many Israelis, myself included, were horrified to see the number of fatalities reach 60. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The North Korea meeting in limbo, a Malaysian opposition leader’s return and Indian elections. Here’s what you need to know: • The White House brushed aside North Korea’s threats to cancel the summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un next month, saying the U.S. was “hopeful” it would happen but would be fine if it did not. After objecting to military exercises, North Korea also rejected Washington’s demand that it quickly dismantle its nuclear program. And it singled out John Bolton, above right, Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, for criticism: “We do not hide our feelings of repugnance towards him.” The State Department said it would continue planning for the meeting in Singapore, but the news was a familiar pattern from Pyongyang: diplomatic outreach, followed by erratic behavior. And in an apparent rebuke of Mr. Trump, former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson warned in a commencement address on Wednesday that American democracy was threatened by a “growing crisis in ethics and integrity.” _____ • “We must cast aside illusions and rely on ourselves,” President Xi Jinping of China said last month.

"WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee released on Wednesday thousands of page of transcripts and other documents related to a 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, attended the meeting, as did Paul Manafort, then the campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. Much of what occurred that day is already publicly known, such as who attended the meeting, why it was set up and what everyone says was discussed. But the newly released documents offer the most detailed, firsthand account of what transpired before, during and after the June 9 meeting. The following are some of the key findings from the documents, and why they are important. Well before Rob Goldstone, a publicist, set up the June 2016 meeting, he tried to position himself as a man with important Russian connections. Almost a year earlier, Mr. Goldstone emailed Mr. Trump’s longtime assistant with an invitation to come to Moscow for a birthday party that fall. The assistant emailed back a few days later saying it would be difficult for Mr. Trump to make the party because of his nascent presidential campaign. Mr. Goldstone responded that same day with the invitation to meet Mr. Putin. Before the June 2016 meeting, another participant, Irakly Kaveladze, said he called a man who worked with Mr. Goldstone, Roman Beniaminov. Mr. Kaveladze asked Mr. Beniaminov about the meeting with Mr. Manafort and others and whether they intended to discuss the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that imposed sanctions against Russia for human rights abuses.

"To the Editor: Re “Abrupt Demand by North Korea Threatens Talks” (front page, May 16): Kim Jong-un and President Trump understand each other perfectly. Walking away from the Iran deal was, among other things, a public message from Mr. Trump to Mr. Kim that we can act just as aggressively and disingenuously as he can, and that he, Mr. Kim, is now negotiating with realists. And isn’t it interesting that Mr. Trump is helping his pal Xi Jinping, president of China, avoid the bankruptcy of ZTE in exchange for what? Perhaps more pressure from China on North Korea? Mr. Kim’s response was that he can be just as unpredictable as Mr. Trump. This is all standard preliminaries before the big event. GEORGE SPENCER
KINDERHOOK, N.Y. To the Editor: Of course North Korea is threatening to cancel the summit meeting with President Trump because the United States and South Korea are carrying out typical joint drills on the peninsula. Did we really expect anything else? North Korea is working closely with the Chinese to foster an outcome that results in a United States withdrawal from South Korea, while giving up as little of its nuclear program as possible. Meanwhile, 300,000 Chinese troops reportedly were sent to the North Korean border, ready to uphold their treaty obligation to respond if the United States strikes North Korea. Don’t be fooled, folks. Kim Jong-un has no intention of relinquishing his nuclear arsenal, and given China’s role, it has a much stronger hand than most imagine. Mr. Trump should cancel the summit, sending a strong signal to Mr. Kim that if he isn’t ready to give up his arsenal, the United States isn’t ready to talk. DAN SMITH, DETROIT "

"Senator John McCain has sustained a long political career by seeming to have it both ways: praised as a fiery maverick when times are bland, and as a bipartisan consensus-seeker when they’re not. This isn’t so much an accusation as an observation — one that McCain himself repeatedly alludes to in “The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations,” his latest collaboration with his former chief-of-staff Mark Salter. The ailing McCain, who learned last year that he had brain cancer, makes clear it might also be their last. The tough-guy titles of their previous books — “Worth the Fighting For,” “Character Is Destiny” and “Hard Call,” among them — spoke to McCain’s obstinate, martial side. They also exhibited an adamant righteousness that “The Restless Wave,” with its rolling title, occasionally strives for but fails to convey. You can see McCain in this book struggling to reconcile himself to what his Republican Party has largely become, even if he declines to come right out and say so; aside from a pointed rebuke of the Iowa Republican Steve King for his “ethnocentrism” and “crude insults,” McCain mostly resorts to the gentle politicking of the blind item. “To refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is unpatriotic,” he writes in his preface, a scolding he directs at no one in particular. One of the striking aspects of this new book is how often McCain — who says his dire medical prognosis leaves him “freer” to speak his mind and vote his conscience “without worry” — insists on playing it safe. The six-term senator from Arizona slips in a few careful mentions of Donald J. Trump, and expresses concern about the rancor that has overtaken the country, but he generally stops short of calling out the president or his cabinet, issuing just a brief eyeroll at the “thoughtless America First ideology” now ascendant in the White House. Blink and you might miss his critique. "
"To the Editor: Re “Tom Wolfe, 1930-2018: ‘New Journalist’ With Electric Style and Acid Pen” (front page, May 16): A hyperbolic New Journalism was Tom Wolfe’s signature style and method, as your fine obituary makes clear. But his ultimate intent was far more political. Mr. Wolfe’s most consistent topic was satirizing what he saw as the hypocrisy of liberals, especially status-obsessed elites, whether the self-indulgent innocents of Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters or the Leonard Bernstein set naïvely hosting the violent Black Panthers. The result was often wickedly funny and revealing, but always had a biting political undercurrent that helped set an example for more damaging and misleading caricatures of “limousine liberals” and “welfare queens” by figures like Ronald Reagan. Thus William F. Buckley writes approvingly of Mr. Wolfe, and Norman Mailer disparagingly. Each seemed to intuit that Mr. Wolfe’s carefully stage-managed assaults on liberals were the precursors to much larger attacks against progressive values, attacks arguably reaching an apotheosis in the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Fox News today. PAUL BLEDSOE, ARLINGTON, VA. The writer is a strategic adviser and energy fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute. To the Editor: There was no one better than Tom Wolfe at exploding pretension and hypocrisy and showing the bitter and often funny ironies in American society.

"BEIJING — The economic relationship between China and the United States has defined the modern era. It helped lift hundreds of millions of people in China out of poverty. It gave affordable iPhones and other gadgets to American consumers, handed big profits to American companies and delivered 1.3 billion hungry customers to American farmers. Now some people in both countries want to tear it apart. As a top Chinese economic policymaker meets with the Trump administration this week in hopes of heading off a potential trade war, some officials in both countries are planning for a time when the world’s two biggest economies do not need each other quite so much any more. They are seeking nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of a trade relationship that encompasses more than $700 billion in goods and services that flow between the countries every year. Full disengagement is impossible, leaders on both sides acknowledge. But the plans being developed in Beijing and Washington anticipate a time when the economic engines of China and the United States are not so closely linked, particularly in high-tech industries. “In the next step of tackling technology, we must cast aside illusions and rely on ourselves,” President Xi Jinping of China said last month after visiting a new computer microchip factory in the country’s center. Beijing has Made in China 2025, a plan that calls for the country to become largely self-sufficient and globally competitive in 10 advanced manufacturing sectors now dominated by the West. These include commercial aircraft, robotics, 5G mobile phone communications and computer microchips. China currently depends on the United States and its allies for those elements of a high-tech future. Washington showed that last month with its move to deny American-made components to ZTE, bringing the Chinese company’s factories to a halt. "

"President Trump’s financial disclosure, released on Wednesday, included for the first time repayment of more than $100,000 to his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, in 2017, raising questions about whether Mr. Trump’s sworn filing from a year ago improperly omitted the debt. In a highly unusual letter, the Office of Government Ethics alerted the Justice Department on Wednesday to the omission, telling Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, that the ethics office had determined “the payment made by Mr. Cohen is required to be reported as a liability.” Mr. Trump’s financial disclosure, released by the Office of Government Ethics, did not specify the purpose of the payment. However, Mr. Cohen has paid $130,000 to a pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen has said he made the payment shortly before the 2016 election as hush money for Ms. Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels. Mr. Trump repaid Mr. Cohen $100,001 to $250,000 in 2017, according to a footnote in the filing. David J. Apol, the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, sent Mr. Rosenstein a copy of Mr. Trump’s current and previous financial form, noting in his letter that “you may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing regarding the president’s prior report that was signed on June 14, 2017.” The letter is not an official referral and does not constitute a finding of wrongdoing, according to lawyers. The hush payment has been a source of controversy for Mr. Trump, who initially said on Air Force One that he was unaware of the payment to Ms. Clifford before acknowledging its existence in a series of Twitter posts this month. Mr. Trump said that he repaid a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Clifford just days before the presidential election in 2016 and suggested that the payment by Mr. Cohen to the actress could not be considered a campaign contribution.

"Mr. Mueller is investigating Russia’s efforts to influence the presidential race and sow discord by spreading inflammatory messages on social media and stealing emails from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee, which were then strategically released to undermine the Clinton campaign. Investigators are examining what Mr. Trump’s aides and associates knew about Russia’s meddling, particularly the release of thousands of stolen Democratic emails, and whether any of them aided Moscow’s effort. Mr. Mueller is investigating an array of the president’s actions — including the firing of the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey — to determine whether Mr. Trump sought to impede the investigation into Russia’s actions.

"In an earlier Twitter post, on Sunday, President Trump announced that he was considering easing restrictions on ZTE, a major Chinese telecommunications company. The restrictions — which block ZTE for seven years from using components made in the United States  — were imposed last month by Mr. Trump’s Commerce Department. The company has long been considered a threat to American national security: ZTE agreed to pay $1.19 billion last year in fines for violating sanctions and selling electronics to Iran and North Korea. In another Twitter post, on Monday, Mr. Trump characterized his reconsideration of the sanctions as “reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China.” But his top economic aides have maintained that any decision on ZTE should not be linked to trade talks. “Our position has been that that’s an enforcement action, separate from trade,” Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said on Monday. “ZTE did do some inappropriate things. They’ve admitted to that. The question is: Are there alternative remedies to the one that we had originally put forward?” Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, echoed that sentiment in a Tuesday interview with Axios. “This is principally an enforcement issue, by the way. It’s really divorced from the trade story,” Mr. Kudlow said, according to Reuters. Raj Shah, a White House deputy press secretary, was asked on Monday whether the White House agreed with Mr. Ross that whatever might happen with ZTE had nothing to do with trade negotiations. “I think Secretary Ross speaks for the U.S. government on this matter. And the president has asked him to look into it,” Mr. Shah said.  “I haven’t seen those remarks, and I’m sure there will be some follow-up conversation, but he does reflect our view.” "
"WASHINGTON — Within hours of opening an investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia in the summer of 2016, the F.B.I. dispatched a pair of agents to London on a mission so secretive that all but a handful of officials were kept in the dark. Their assignment, which has not been previously reported, was to meet the Australian ambassador, who had evidence that one of Donald J. Trump’s advisers knew in advance about Russian election meddling. After tense deliberations between Washington and Canberra, top Australian officials broke with diplomatic protocol and allowed the ambassador, Alexander Downer, to sit for an F.B.I. interview to describe his meeting with the campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos. The agents summarized their highly unusual interview and sent word to Washington on Aug. 2, 2016, two days after the investigation was opened. Their report helped provide the foundation for a case that, a year ago Thursday, became the special counsel investigation. But at the time, a small group of F.B.I. officials knew it by its code name: Crossfire Hurricane. The name, a reference to the Rolling Stones lyric “I was born in a crossfire hurricane,” was an apt prediction of a political storm that continues to tear shingles off the bureau. Days after they closed their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, agents began scrutinizing the campaign of her Republican rival. The two cases have become inextricably linked in one of the most consequential periods in the history of the F.B.I. [Read our briefing on secret government code names] This month, the Justice Department inspector general is expected to release the findings of its lengthy review of the F.B.I.’s conduct in the Clinton case. The results are certain to renew debate over decisions by the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, to publicly chastise Mrs. Clinton in a news conference, and then announce the reopening of the investigation days before Election Day. Mrs. Clinton has said those actions buried her presidential hopes. Those decisions stand in contrast to the F.B.I.’s handling of Crossfire Hurricane. Not only did agents in that case fall back to their typical policy of silence, but interviews with a dozen current and former government officials and a review of documents show that the F.B.I. was even more circumspect in that case than has been previously known. Many of the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. "
"Early in “Fahrenheit 451,” Montag (Michael B. Jordan) readies himself in front of his bathroom mirror, which doubles as a supersize smart screen, pulsating with news updates and a never-ending river of responses from his social-media followers. Am I a bad person if my first response was, “Wow, if I had one of those, I would never have to worry about dropping my iPhone in the sink again”? Probably. Even if you are not familiar with the Ray Bradbury source novel, “Fahrenheit” makes it quickly, hammeringly clear that it is a cautionary tale. You’ll get that from the urban-noir aesthetic, the school-indoctrination sessions and the fact that Montag’s job as a “fireman” involves not fighting fires but starting them — burning humanity’s last remaining books as well as their digital reproductions, all of which have been outlawed. Electronic media change, but the anxiety about them remains. In Mr. Bradbury’s day, it was the sudden rise of TV as America’s pastime; today it’s the ubiquitous screens that have us checking Twitter during our morning ablutions. (I know, I know, I’m trying to quit.) But the dystopia of the new “Fahrenheit 451,” airing Saturday on HBO, is generic, its critique muddled and its tone as subtle as a flamethrower. Mr. Bradbury’s novel, published in 1953, required some technological and conceptual updating. Some of its concerns are timeless, others specifically 1950s. It worries about postwar social conformity, anti-intellectualism, McCarthyism and the homogenizing power of the new medium of TV to flatten out differences in thought and make its audience placid. "
"“With friends like that, who needs enemies.” That was how Donald Tusk, one of the European Union’s top officials, took President Trump to task on Wednesday, offering the latest look at how the Continent’s leaders are trying to come to terms with the United States’ shifting policy on issues like the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Tusk, president of the European Council, which represents the European Union’s heads of government, used 280 characters on Twitter not only to rebuke Mr. Trump’s head-snapping policy decisions but also to reaffirm the bloc’s commitment to its own agenda. “We realize that if you need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of your arm,” Mr. Tusk wrote. The sentiment behind Mr. Tusk’s tweet is not exactly new. It is an echo of remarks by other European leaders, like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who have long criticized Mr. Trump’s moves on the world stage as detrimental to the trans-Atlantic alliance. Ms. Merkel has for months openly disagreed with Mr. Trump on issues like trade tariffs. During a speech on Wednesday to the German Parliament, she also said it would be wrong to cancel the nuclear agreement with Iran and called the decision to pull out of the accord “troubling news.” Mr. Tusk’s tweet, however, was one of the more notable, public denunciations of Mr. Trump’s decision making by a European leader, as a series of moves on trade, Israel and other issues has increasingly put traditional allies at odds with the administration in Washington. [Read more about how President Trump’s decisions have put Europe into damage control mode.] Mr. Trump’s decision last week to abandon the Iran nuclear deal — negotiated by Iran and the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — left Europe scrambling to preserve the agreement. Mr. Tusk called on the European leaders of the countries that signed the agreement — like Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Ms. Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who tried but failed to talk Mr. Trump into not scrapping the deal — to reconfirm their commitment to the accord. European leaders were also unable to persuade Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, a failure that weakens efforts to combat global warming. And Mr. Trump’s decisions to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move the United States Embassy to the holy city were made despite European opposition. A day earlier, Mr. Tusk wrote an open letter to the members of the European Council, calling for the body to “reflect on recent global developments.” He noted in particular “President Trump’s announcements on Iran and trade as well as the latest, dramatic events in Gaza.” The opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem coincided with Palestinian demonstrations in which Israeli soldiers killed 60 protesters and wounded thousands of others — the bloodiest day in the Gaza Strip since 2014.

"A recently adopted equal pay law has put New Jersey at the forefront of national efforts to narrow the gender wage gap. The state’s new automatic voter registration law ranks among the most sweeping in the country, while its funding of Planned Parenthood, package of gun control laws, renewable energy legislation and a measure to provide state financial aid to immigrants who came to the United States as children are all part of the progressive playbook. In a state whose political profile has been marked by scandal and dominated most recently by a bellicose Republican governor, the first few months of Gov. Philip D. Murphy’s Democratic tenure have seen an abrupt ideological makeover as New Jersey lurches to the left, joining the ranks of the most liberal states in the nation. His aggressive steering reflects the mandate Mr. Murphy believes he was given last year by his lopsided victory. But his policies have also left Republicans and even moderate Democrats with a case of whiplash and raised serious questions about how Mr. Murphy will pay for his agenda in a state saddled with severe financial difficulties. New Jersey owes its state-run pension system $119 billion, according to Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings, one of the largest debt obligations in the country, which has contributed to 11 credit downgrades in the past decade. The state also has the nation’s highest property taxes, with many residents facing higher bills under the recent federal tax overhaul, while it has consistently underfunded local school districts. At the same time, Mr. Murphy’s $37.4 billion budget comes with $2.7 billion in new spending, including proposals to make community colleges tuition-free for many families, to expand prekindergarten and to significantly increase funding for the state’s beleaguered public transit system. But to pay for all this, Mr. Murphy is counting on initiatives that so far have been coolly received by some leaders in the Democratic-controlled Legislature — notably $1.7 billion in new taxes, including a levy on the wealthy, and the legalization of recreational marijuana, which would also add to the state’s coffers. Mr. Murphy defended his blueprint, saying it was motivated not by politics but by a desire to make New Jersey a fairer state. “You can’t make economic progress without social progress, and social progress can’t be achieved without economic progress,” he said in an interview, adding, “I don’t wake up every day to be liberal for the sake of being liberal.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Liberal candidates last night had their best primary night of the year. In yesterday’s newsletter, I mentioned three competitive races to choose a Democratic nominee for a congressional seat. Two of the three included decidedly centrist candidates — a district attorney in a blue-collar Pennsylvania district who had spoken positively about President Trump and a compromise-praising former congressman in Nebraska. Both lost. The contrast between candidates in Nebraska was especially stark. In the district that includes Omaha, the former congressman Brad Ashford lost to Kara Eastman — a progressive community organizer who received scant support from the Democratic establishment, as Marie Solis of Newsweek reports. Eastman supports Medicare-for-all as well as “universal background checks, overturning Citizens United, raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and decriminalizing marijuana,” writes Vox’s Dylan Scott. But this may be the most interesting dynamic: Some Republicans were openly rooting for Eastman, believing that she represents less of a threat. The seat is currently held by a Republican, Don Bacon, who’s running for re-election. Republican operatives inserted themselves in the primary campaign, referring to Ashford as “flip-flop Brad.” Last night, after the results were coming in, some Republicans were clearly pulling for Eastman and exulted when she won. “This is a nightmare” for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Jack Pandol of the National Republican Congressional Committee, tweeted. Of course, the Republicans may ultimately rue their glee. If Eastman and others like her can win, the Democratic Party will move to the left. As I wrote yesterday, it’s still not clear in which circumstances moderate candidates are actually more electable than strongly liberal (or conservative) ones. Yet 2018 is going to offer a fascinating batch of evidence. In some competitive districts, the Democrats will have nominated proud progressives like Eastman. In others, they will have nominated moderates. Come November, it will be possible to compare the outcomes. Night of the woman. Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation currently includes zero women. “After last night there could be four Dem women from metro Philly alone,” writes Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. Garance Franke-Ruta of Yahoo News noted that their victories are, in an indirect way, Hillary Clinton’s “cracks in the glass ceiling.” Among the victories by women: ""Sara Innamorato and Summer Lee, both members of Pittsburgh’s chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, have defeated Dom and Paul Costa, both incumbent state representatives, in Pennsylvania’s Democratic primary,” reports Mother Jones. These are statehouse races, not congressional ones, but they’re still big wins for the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump welcomed President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan to the White House on Wednesday, calling the visit a “great honor” as he worked to begin what aides described as a new era of partnership with a country that is making its first fitful turns away from authoritarianism. Senior administration officials had said Mr. Trump planned to prod Mr. Mirziyoyev on lingering issues of human rights and press freedom during their meeting, but in public on Wednesday there was no hint of criticism or question in his remarks. “He’s a highly respected man in his country,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Mirziyoyev as the two sat in the Oval Office. “We’ve been working very closely together on different things, including trade.” Mr. Trump has rarely brought up human rights concerns either in public or in private during his face-to-face encounters with foreign leaders — a break with past American presidents of both parties who routinely raised the issue — even when his aides have said he planned to. He and his advisers view the issue as an impediment to trade and a barrier to warmer relations between the United States and potential strategic partners. In the case of Uzbekistan, administration officials said Mr. Trump wanted to forge an early alliance with a former Soviet state in a strategically vital location north of Afghanistan in order to encourage its recent moves toward greater political and economic openness. They said the United States had a window of opportunity to push Uzbekistan — a rare bright spot of change in a region rife with repression — toward greater progress and closer cooperation with the United States. And while Mr. Trump’s advisers concede that Uzbekistan still has a long way to go in improving its human rights record, they have privately praised Mr. Mirziyoyev for releasing some political prisoners, eliminating systematic child labor and loosening controls on the press. The changes are part of what some observers have called an Uzbek Spring, following the death in 2016 of the country’s iron-fisted leader, Islam Karimov. "

These two very different solos — one featuring appropriated photographs, the other oil paintings — have an unexpected synergy, especially regarding visual memory and associations. The New York sculptor Al Freeman fills the gallery’s smaller space with the first solo show of her uncanny Comparisons: each a collage of a famous work of art (Matisse, Bruegel and Bacon) and a photograph — usually culled from the internet’s underbelly — to which it bears a striking, often hilarious resemblance. A well-known photograph of Eva Hesse’s black sculptures seems nearly identical to the gear of a dominatrix, laid out like an eBay photograph. The nested squares of a Josef Albers painting are partnered with the locked arms of two wrestlers. Many collages feature drunken adolescents joking around (frequently unclothed) or pranking their passed-out buddies. One such young man, hanging from a clothes hanger inserted in his T-shirt, eerily echoes the flayed skin from Michelangelo’s “Last Judgment.” Ms. Freeman’s comparisons are more than funny; they’re full of feminist barbs and insights into the mind’s reflexive leaps — their pleasures, tells and revelations.

"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr. got straight to the point during the now-famous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016. “So I believe you have some information for us,” he said, directing his attention across a large conference table to the Russian lawyer who was there, he thought, to deliver incriminating information on Hillary Clinton. But if Mr. Trump expected a campaign-changing bombshell, he was quickly disappointed. The disparaging information about Mrs. Clinton amounted to no more than allegations of fraud in Russia by several obscure Democratic donors. The Trump campaign officials reacted with dissatisfaction, not eagerness. Both sides left disappointed. The chasm between expectation and reality surrounding the meeting was one of the dominant themes running through more than 2,500 pages of testimony and documents released by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. The committee has been conducting one of the investigations into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians, and the documents revealed new details about the run-up and the aftermath of what is thought to be one of the key episodes of the campaign’s interactions with Russia. The release came on the same day that another Senate panel, the Intelligence Committee, gave bipartisan validation to a more than year-old assessment by American intelligence agencies about the Russian effort, announcing that after careful review, it agreed that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered an influence campaign designed to sow discord, harm Mrs. Clinton and elevate Donald J. Trump’s candidacy. By contrast, the disclosures by the Judiciary Committee showed just how far Republicans and Democrats have diverged since they began the bipartisan inquiry last summer. "
"The investigation into President Trump’s campaign and its ties to Russia is best known today by the man who runs it,  Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. But the F.B.I. conducted the investigation for nearly a year before Mr. Mueller was appointed. To the agents, it was known by its internal code name: Crossfire Hurricane. The term is borrowed from the Rolling Stones song “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” which begins with Mick Jagger declaring, “I was born in a crossfire hurricane.” According to the author Victor Bockris, however, his fellow band member Keith Richards inspired the line. In his book “Keith Richards: The Biography,” Mr. Bockris wrote that Mr. Richards was born amid the bombing and air raid sirens of Dartford, England, in 1943 at the height of World War II. “I was born with those sirens,” he said. It varies. The C.I.A. randomly selects code names — called cryptonyms, or crypts — from a list of preapproved names. But C.I.A. officers can skip that process and pick their own. That is  most likely how the agency ended up with hacking tools named RickyBobby and EggsMayhem. Somewhere, there is a former classics scholar who can claim responsibility for choosing Anabasis, the epic Greek military tale, as the cryptonym for a C.I.A. operation in Iraq. Military operations get code names, too, and random selection has its downsides. When a blitz on Iraqi weapons sites was randomly given the name “Operation Bolton” by the British Ministry of Defense, the name divided residents of the town of Bolton. “Bolton is not an aggressive town,” one resident told The Independent.

"About a quarter of New York City speaks Spanish, but one man did not want to hear it from the staff making his lunch at a Midtown Manhattan spot on Tuesday. A video of his racist insults and assumptions, coupled with a threat to call immigration officials to have the Spanish speakers deported, went from viral to virulent on the internet Wednesday. The video shows a middle-aged, athletic-looking white man berating both customers and a manager at a cavernous fast-casual restaurant called Fresh Kitchen. “Your staff is speaking Spanish to customers when they should be speaking English,” he says. “It’s America.” He adds: “I will be following up, and my guess is they’re not documented. So my next call is to ICE to have each one of them kicked out of my country.” He said that he was paying for their “welfare.” Officials in New York, which as a so-called sanctuary city limits its cooperation with immigration enforcement officials, quickly denounced the man’s action. Mayor Bill de Blasio reminded people on Twitter that New York was a welcoming city, where 8.6 million residents speak more than 200 languages. The city’s Commission on Human Rights, which investigates discrimination and harassment, said in a statement that it was “aware of the matter.” And the city’s commissioner of immigrant affairs, Bitta Mostofi, said in an interview that incidents like this, “while horrifying, are not commonplace — they also don’t belong in our city.” Even the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, known as ICE, distanced itself from the man’s threat to call the office. But a spokeswoman acknowledged that all undocumented immigrants are subject to deportation. “ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line is solely for the purposes of making legitimate reports of suspected criminal activity. The Tip Line should not be used as an instrument to intimidate or harass,” said Rachael Yong Yow, the spokeswoman for the New York field office of ICE. "
"— President Trump, during a discussion on Wednesday about so-called sanctuary cities The latest data from Customs and Border Protection shows that illegal border crossings — which are usually measured as apprehensions on the southern border — actually increased during the last few months. The agency recorded 38,234 apprehensions on the southern border in April. That’s a 2 percent increase from March, and three times the number of crossings recorded in April 2017. (Experts typically recommend looking at year-to-year changes because border crossings fluctuate by season.) The latest April figures are marginally higher than, but roughly the same as, the number of crossings in April 2016, and about 30 percent higher than the number recorded in April 2015. When Mr. Trump has made various claims about a decline in illegal border crossings in the past, he has tended to selectively choose points of time that showed the most drastic drops. His claim on Wednesday about a 40 percent decline was no different. Border crossings did decline by 26 percent from the 2016 fiscal year to the 2017 fiscal year, and by 43 percent from the 2016 calendar year to the 2017 calendar year. Those figures, however, do not represent the current state of border crossings. The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Trump had berated Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, for what he saw as a failure to adequately protect the border.    "
"Letitia James, the New York City public advocate, declared her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for attorney general on Wednesday, ending a week filled with rumors and political machinations about whether she would be appointed to the office or run for it, and with which party’s backing. After the sudden resignation of Eric T. Schneiderman last week, Ms. James’s name immediately surfaced as a candidate to replace him, first as an interim appointment by the state Legislature. But as newspaper editorial boards urged lawmakers to keep the interim attorney general, Barbara Underwood, who had served for years as state solicitor general, in the job, Ms. James withdrew her name from consideration to fill out the last seven or so months of Mr. Schneiderman’s term. Instead, Ms. James said she wanted to place her candidacy before voters, saying that she would defend vulnerable communities and take on everything from corruption to crooked businesses, as well as the administration of President Trump. “New Yorkers deserve an attorney general who is unwavering in her fight to uphold and defend their most basic rights,” Ms. James said in a brief speech at the Brooklyn Historical Society, where she was surrounded by cheering supporters holding signs calling her “the people’s lawyer.” If elected, Ms. James, the first black woman in New York City to hold citywide elected office, would make history again by becoming the first black woman to win statewide elected office, a point that was echoed by supporters and former colleagues as especially significant in the era of #MeToo and the difficult racial dynamics playing out in the country.

"WASHINGTON — The Republican at the helm of the Senate’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election backed on Wednesday the assessment by American intelligence agencies that Moscow favored Donald J. Trump in the race, contradicting both the president and fellow Republicans in the House. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he saw “no reason to dispute” the intelligence assessment, which was delivered in the final weeks of the Obama administration. Mr. Burr’s statement, while indirect, offered a clear rebuke to Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters in the Republican Party and in the right-wing news media, who have sought to cast the assessment as the shoddy work of Obama loyalists bitter over Mr. Trump’s election victory. Russia’s only goal, those supporters have insisted, was to sow chaos, and thus it could not have colluded with a campaign it cared little about. The only logical conclusion, they contend, is the one that Mr. Trump has already reached: The investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, is a “witch hunt” cooked up by Democrats desperate to undermine a president they detest. American intelligence officials, including Mr. Trump’s own appointees, who now run the agencies that compiled the assessment, say otherwise. They have repeatedly backed the work of their predecessors and sought to shield Mr. Mueller’s investigation from political attacks. Asked at a Senate hearing on Wednesday if he stood by earlier statements that the special counsel’s investigation was not a witch hunt, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, did not hesitate: “Yes,” he said. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House on Wednesday brushed aside threats by North Korea to cancel a summit meeting between President Trump and its leader, Kim Jong-un, but the harsh words underscored the chasm that will separate the two leaders next month in Singapore over how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Mr. Trump struck a noncommittal tone about the status of the meeting — “We’ll have to see,” he told reporters — but said he still planned to demand that the North surrender its entire nuclear program. A top North Korean official said Mr. Kim would not tolerate attempts to “drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment.” While administration officials and outside experts said they believed the meeting would go off as planned, the clashing messages brought a diplomatic high-wire act temporarily back to earth, replacing the talk of history-making handshakes and Nobel Peace Prizes with the sober recognition that North Korea views disarmament very differently than the United States does. The reversal came after months in which Mr. Kim presented himself as a statesman, halting missile tests and freeing imprisoned Americans. Now, the North has reverted to its earlier hard-line stance on keeping its nuclear weapons and to a playbook that includes sudden shifts in tactics when negotiating with other nations. North Korea’s warning came as Mr. Trump faced pressure to settle an escalating trade dispute with the North’s principal economic patron, China. Mr. Kim has made two trips to China to seek its support since inviting Mr. Trump to meet. Some administration officials said they believed that China was exploiting its leverage over North Korea to pressure Mr. Trump into a deal on trade. "
"As a public service, today we are going to discuss the latest primary elections. And I promise there will be some sex scandals. But first — wow, women are on the move. The big election story on Tuesday was in Pennsylvania, whose 18-member delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives is currently composed of 18 men. (Well, O.K., 16 men and two vacancies due to men who abruptly left town. As we will see, Pennsylvania is having some trouble hanging on to its representatives.) Next year there could conceivably be seven women. In the past, if I told you the Democrats had nominated seven women for Congress you might have cynically assumed Pennsylvania had seven districts where the party was so outnumbered the Republicans would triumph if they nominated a collie. But no, four of these are likely Democratic wins. And whatever happens, the state is guaranteed to get at least one congresswoman — there’s a Philadelphia area district with female nominees on both sides. Meanwhile, incumbent Republicans are falling like flies. Representative Patrick Meehan resigned recently after he used taxpayer money to pay off a former aide who accused him of sexual harassment. He claimed he was a faithful husband who simply regarded the staffer as a “soul mate.” Pick your response: A) Interesting job title. B) First rule of the #MeToo movement is that bosses do not get to be soul mates with their underlings. C) Hahahahahaha Meehan was the second Pennsylvania Republican House member to fall to the forces of testosterone recently. You may remember that Tim Murphy, an avid anti-abortion crusader, had to resign from his seat after word got out that he’d urged his former mistress to consider terminating a possible pregnancy. When the ex-lover complained about his lack of consistency, she got a text from Murphy’s cellphone saying: “I get what you say about my March for Life messages. I’ve never written them. Staff does them.” "

"WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will not indict President Trump if he finds wrongdoing in his investigation of Trump campaign links to Russia, according to the president’s lawyers. They said Wednesday that Mr. Mueller’s investigators told them that he would adhere to the Justice Department’s view that the Constitution bars prosecuting sitting presidents. The disclosure provides the greatest clarity to date about how Mr. Mueller, who is also investigating whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the inquiry itself, may proceed. If he concludes that he has evidence that the president broke the law, experts say, he now has only two main options while Mr. Trump remains in office: He could write a report about the president’s conduct that Congress might use as part of any impeachment proceedings, or he could deem the president as an unindicted co-conspirator in court documents. Mr. Mueller’s stance could serve as political relief for Mr. Trump, whose presidency has been under the cloud of the investigation. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called it a “witch hunt.” A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about how the president reacted to Mr. Mueller’s viewpoint on indictment. On Thursday morning, the president noted the anniversary of the special counsel investigation. “Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History,” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post. But the question of whether the president can be indicted is unsettled. Many legal experts and current and former Justice Department officials believed that Mr. Mueller would follow the conclusions of Justice Department lawyers, who argued during both the Nixon and Clinton administrations that an indictment would interfere with the president’s constitutional responsibilities and powers to run the executive branch.

"When Republicans look at what they’ve gotten out of their current moment of unified government, they can point to cutting corporate taxes, some judicial appointments and … not much else. Beyond that, they claim that they’ve teed up the economy for explosive growth through the magic of “deregulation.” But deregulation is a term that should be banned from the nation’s policy lexicon, mixing as it does equal parts wholesome and foul — in this administration, almost exclusively foul. The wholesome justification for deregulation arises when government uses its power in ways that gum up the dynamic power of markets. In the long run, our nation’s wealth and the opportunity it provides for improving quality of life depend on the forces of creative destruction. In competitive, open markets, incumbent actors cannot prevent challenges from more nimble competitors, armed with new products or more efficient ways of organizing the production process. This process can be stifled when government acts in ways that stymie or distort competition. Our economy is, increasingly, plagued by these kinds of constraints. The growth of patent and copyright protection over the past few decades has made it harder for new companies to recombine existing technologies in new ways, thus shielding the entertainment industry, tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers from challenges. Byzantine regulation of housing construction at the local level has made the cost of living prohibitively expensive in many high-growth areas and blocked millions of workers from moving to high-paying jobs. The growth of company-specific tax subsidies (like those offered by places in competition for Amazon’s HQ2) has shoveled resources toward large businesses that can effectively lobby for government largess. The list could go on, but the point is simple — in all these areas, there are huge opportunities for growth that are being hamstrung by rules that protect existing companies at the expense of new ones. A bonfire of regulations like this would be entirely wholesome for the American economy and also help to eat away at some of the hyper-inequality that is generated by these forms of crony capitalism. Unfortunately, this is not the kind of regulation that the Trump administration has been attacking. Instead, it has been sharpening its knives for precisely the kinds of regulation that, far from distorting markets, help to improve them. In particular, regulation is often necessary to a properly functioning market when, in its absence, businesses can make a profit by pushing costs onto others, in effect forcing others to subsidize their bottom line. In two areas, the environment and finance, these are exactly the sorts of market-improving regulation that the administration has put in its cross hairs, with the effect of increasing profits via freeloading.

"WASHINGTON — As female candidates crash the barricades of the Democratic Party and predict a “blue wave” of women in Congress, a string of high-profile departures of prominent Republican women threatens to leave the House with fewer Republican women next year. A new and unusually large crop of female Republican candidates — many of whom have embraced President Trump as fervently as Democrat candidates have rejected him — hope to replenish the ranks, or come close. But the political headwinds facing Republicans and the districts that women are running in make that math daunting. “We have all this energy around female candidates, and yet Republicans could wind up with fewer women in Congress when all is said and done,” said Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican strategist. Of the 23 Republican women in the House, six — about one-quarter — are retiring or seeking higher office. They include a former Budget Committee chairwoman, Diane Black, running for governor of Tennessee; a firebrand who led the Republican inquiry into Planned Parenthood, Marsha Blackburn, running for Senate in Tennessee; another former member of the Republican leadership, Lynn Jenkins of Kansas, and a former Foreign Affairs chairwoman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who are retiring; and another former member of leadership, Kristi Noem of South Dakota, running for governor. The highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, is firmly in the Democrats’ cross hairs for November. And other Republicans, such as Representative Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Claudia Tenney of New York and Mimi Walters of California, are considered vulnerable in what is shaping up to be a challenging year for their party. The result, analysts say, could be a widening gap between Republican and Democratic women in the House. Democrats already have about three times as many women in the chamber as Republicans, including Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. And while the number of women running has surged in both parties, Democrats are fielding about three times as many female candidates as Republicans this year. "
"IT’S TIME TO FIGHT DIRTY
How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics
By David Faris
178 pp. Melville House. $24.99. When you have a president who plays footsie with white supremacists and openly yearns to undermine the rule of law, it’s easy to lose sight of something: Before Donald Trump ever ran for the White House, a combination of Republican tactical nihilism and design flaws in the Constitution had already led to an alarming breakdown in the mechanics of American democracy — leaving the game systematically rigged against Democrats. Ruthless gerrymandering has handed Republicans significantly more seats in the House and in state legislatures than their vote share deserves — an advantage that after 2020 could become semipermanent. The Senate, with its small-state bias, looks set to favor the G.O.P. for the foreseeable future, too. Voting restrictions targeting racial minorities and the young, and the evisceration of campaign finance laws, have skewed election and policy outcomes at all levels even further. Throw in Republicans’ theft of a Supreme Court seat, and you’ve got a government that’s far more conservative across the board than voters appear to want — and that’s without even mentioning the Electoral College. Little wonder fewer than half of Democratic voters say they have faith in American democracy, according to a recent poll. If the G.O.P. were a normal right-of-center party, this unequal playing field would already qualify as an urgent problem for progressives. But given its current incarnation as a conglomerate of right-wing nationalists, Randian zealots and Christian fundamentalists all laser-focused on repealing different aspects of the 20th century while consigning our children to spend their golden years in a fiery hellscape, the situation starts to look potentially cataclysmic. A New Zealand diplomat posted to Washington summed it up in a recent tweet, telling Democrats in rather undiplomatic language to get it together “or we will all die.” So it’s not surprising that people are starting to think about ways to break out. In his short, bracing book, “It’s Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics,” David Faris, an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University, argues that Democrats should immediately use every lever they have to gum up the works in Washington, to ensure they win full control of government in 2020.

"WASHINGTON — The big daily meeting that past administrations have used to keep the White House on message has been scrapped in favor of something smaller. West Wing aides are instructed to drop their personal phones into small storage lockers when they come to work, periodically checked up on by a scanning device that detects nongovernment phones. And in the Oval Office, there is President Trump, who is prone to erupt about his communications team as ineffective and leak-ridden, complaining he has the biggest team and yet he gets “the worst press.” Working in the Trump White House, current and former West Wing aides say, has always meant navigating the personality of a mercurial president who has an inherent sense of paranoia — one extended even to those who have worked with him closely — that has been honed over decades. “There is a certain advantage to having a certain degree of paranoia,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with the BBC in 1998. “You can be a little bit careful. You watch what’s happening behind your back.” But in recent months, Mr. Trump, who has never been convinced that his aides have his best interests at heart, has felt increasingly aggrieved. He blames his staff for not delivering better headlines on key initiatives, like tax cuts or a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea. And he sees leaks as a cause of the distractions that have helped deprive him of those headlines, according to interviews with several current and former White House officials, all who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe internal discussions. The president’s irritation with his staff over bad media attention reached a new level last week after a morbid joke a junior aide made about Senator John McCain having brain cancer was leaked to news outlets. The off-the-cuff comments by Kelly Sadler, a communications aide, minimized the effect of Mr. McCain’s opposition to Mr. Trump’s nominee for C.I.A. director because “he’s dying anyway.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Gina Haspel on Thursday to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, elevating a woman to the directorship for the first time despite bipartisan misgivings about her role in the agency’s brutal detention and interrogation programs in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Ms. Haspel, the current deputy director and a career clandestine officer, takes the helm at a time of shifting alliances and intelligence threats from Iran to North Korea to Russia, and after President Trump tried to cast doubt on the intelligence community’s judgment as part of his broader attack on the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. But it was Ms. Haspel’s past that transfixed senators — if only for a few weeks — as they grappled anew with the aggressive interrogation policies of the George W. Bush administration in the years after the terrorist attacks. Ms. Haspel supervised a secret prison in Thailand in 2002 when a Qaeda suspect was waterboarded there, and senators raised fresh questions about her role in the agency’s destruction of videotapes of interrogation sessions in 2005. Democrats and a handful of Republicans pressed Ms. Haspel to repudiate the program and sought assurances that torture would not be revisited under her watch. Ms. Haspel told senators during her confirmation hearing that her moral compass was strong and that she would not revisit such a program. And on Tuesday, under intense pressure, she went further, writing that the program “did damage to our officers and our standing in the world.” In the end, those assurances were enough to win over a handful of skeptical senators. Two Republican no votes — and opposition from Senator John McCain of Arizona, the victim of torture in Vietnam who was not present for the vote — were more than offset by six Democrats, most of whom represent states that Mr. Trump won in 2016. Ms. Haspel also won over Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who had led the interrogation of her record. She was confirmed 54 to 45. Ms. Haspel is now set to take over a spy agency that has managed to keep a low profile under Mr. Trump in recent months. He was sharply critical of America’s intelligence agencies before taking office, even comparing them to Nazis at one point. But Ms. Haspel’s predecessor, Mike Pompeo, who is now the secretary of state, built a warm rapport with the president. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Rants on Unauthorized Migrants: ‘These Aren’t People, These Are Animals’ ” (news article, May 17): “Animals,” “losers,” “crazy,” “psycho”: The list goes on, and nothing President Trump says is a surprise anymore, but it continues to draw our attention. Meanwhile, what goes largely unnoticed are the funding cuts in such needed areas as education, infrastructure, conservation and early childhood programs, and that list also goes on.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trade talks with China, a cease-fire in Kashmir and royal wedding fever. Here’s what you need to know: • “A splash of cold water.” North Korea’s apparent about-face on nuclear disarmament has brought a diplomatic high-wire act temporarily back to earth, and has put the chief matchmaker, the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, in a difficult position. The sudden turn is also a reminder that North Korea views disarmament very differently from the United States. One issue weighing heavily is the fate of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader who voluntarily gave up his nuclear weapons program in 2003. Less than 10 years later, the U.S. and its allies bombed his government. For now, officials in Washington say President Trump’s June 12 meeting with Kim Jong-un is still on. _____ • China’s chief trade negotiator, Liu He, is in Washington, where he’ll meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Trump in hopes of defusing a potential trade war.

"The attorney general of New Jersey said on Thursday that federal education officials had stopped cooperating on issues involving fraudulent activities at for-profit colleges, and requested that the Education Department renew its investigations into the institutions or hand them over to the state. Gurbir S. Grewal, who became attorney general in January, expressed frustration with the officials in a letter to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. Mr. Grewal said they had ignored requests from New Jersey to work with the state on behalf of students who were defrauded by Corinthian Colleges, a bankrupt for-profit chain. And he raised concerns about the status of investigations by the Education Department into large for-profit institutions like the DeVry Education Group, which paid $100 million in 2016 to settle a lawsuit alleging that it misled prospective students with ads about employment and salaries after graduation. In an article this week, The New York Times reported that a special investigations team at the Education Department created in the final year of the Obama administration had been unwound under the Trump administration, effectively killing inquiries into DeVry and other schools where top hires of Ms. DeVos previously worked. “If the federal government continues to pursue these investigations, let us partner with you,” Mr. Grewal wrote, citing The Times’s article. “If the federal government will not pursue these investigations wherever the facts and law take them, let us pick up where you leave off.” "
"President Trump’s complaints of unjust persecution are a matter of opinion — or, at the very least, a premature conclusion. But by quantifiable measures, the investigation of Russian election meddling to benefit Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign is not the longest, least fruitful or most harmful inquisition in American history. The largest literal witch hunt in American history was, of course, the trials and persecutions of people accused of witchcraft in Salem, Mass., from 1692 to 1693, said Robert Thurston, a historian who wrote the book “The Witch Hunts.” The Trump-Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, “is nothing like a real witch hunt,” Mr. Thurston said. “No, no, no. Twenty people were executed at Salem. Nobody’s been executed in Mueller. It’s all hot air.” The Salem trials and witch hunts became popular metaphors for unjust political persecution in the 1930s, during industry purges in the Soviet Union and accusations of communism in the United States. When Senator Joseph R. McCarthy rose to prominence in 1950, the Wisconsin Republican claimed in his “Enemies From Within” speech that he had obtained a list of 205 communists who were working in the State Department. His ensuing campaign lasted four years, and he “had not been able to produce even one identified Communist Party member in the State Department,” The New York Times wrote when Mr. McCarthy died.    By comparison, the Russia investigation has so far spanned one year and yielded five guilty pleas. Overall, the McCarthyism campaign touched 12,000 to 13,000 people. It forced employees from their jobs in 100 cases, said Ellen Schrecker, a historian. In that sense, the Russia investigation is “not a witch hunt,” said Ms. Schrecker, who for decades has researched the era of McCarthyism. She said the Russia investigation that had enraged Mr. Trump was opened “because of what his campaign did, not because of his political beliefs.” The White House did not respond to a request for evidence backing up Mr. Trump’s claim that he has led “the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history.” But in the past, the president has noted the number of bills he has signed, deregulation and the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court to prove this point. Seventeen months into his presidency, Mr. Trump has signed the second-fewest bills among the last 10 presidents, said Joshua Tauberer, the creator of GovTrack, a web tool for tracking legislation. (President Barack Obama had signed the fewest by this point in his first term.) Qualitatively, Mr. Trump has enacted tax cuts and veterans’ benefits. But he has largely been unable to achieve some of his top campaign promises, like repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or building a border wall. Like Mr. Trump, a Supreme Court justice was confirmed in the first years of the presidencies of Mr. Obama, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower. "
"A television show featuring Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who is suing President Trump on behalf of a pornographic film actress, and the former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was pitched to two cable networks in recent weeks, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday. The prominent television agent Jay Sures discussed with executives at CNN and MSNBC the concept of a program where the two men would square off, according to three people briefed on the issue. Both have become frequent cable network guests — Mr. Avenatti as one of Mr. Trump’s greatest antagonists, and Mr. Scaramucci as a loyalist to the president even after flaming out after less than two weeks at the White House. Representatives for MSNBC and CNN declined to comment, as did Mr. Sures and Mr. Scaramucci. “I have no interest in television right now,” Mr. Avenatti said. “I enjoy my law practice and look forward to prevailing on behalf of my client Stormy Daniels,” he added, using the stage name of the actress, Stephanie Clifford. He did not respond to a question about why Mr. Sures made such a pitch involving him. Mr. Avenatti has appeared on both CNN and MSNBC repeatedly in recent weeks, often several times a day on both networks. The appearances are one part of an aggressive public relations campaign he has waged on behalf of Ms. Clifford, earning him criticism that he is leveraging his position to both undermine Mr. Trump and promote himself. He has set off news media frenzies by sending Ms. Clifford into the courtroom where the president’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, was appearing to fight the F.B.I.’s seizure of documents in a raid. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to keep Ms. Clifford from going public before the 2016 election about an affair she says she had with the president, who denies her claim. "
"Did the president of the United States just betray the nation’s security in return for a bribe from the Chinese government? Don’t say that this suggestion is ridiculous: Given everything we know about Donald Trump, it’s well within the bounds of possibility, even plausibility. Don’t say there’s no proof: We’re not talking about a court of law, where the accused are presumed innocent until proved guilty. Where the behavior of high officials is concerned, the standard is very nearly the opposite: They’re supposed to avoid situations in which there is even a hint that their actions might be motivated by personal gain. Oh, and don’t say that it doesn’t matter one way or the other, because the Republicans who control Congress won’t do anything about it. That in itself is a key part of the story: An entire political party — a party that has historically wrapped itself in the flag and questioned the patriotism of its opponents — has become entirely complaisant in the possibility of raw corruption, even if it involves payoffs from hostile foreign powers.

"In a tantrum last week, President Trump raged against Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, in part because she had not done enough to break up families who crossed the southern border illegally. Mr. Trump thinks such callousness will deter families from illegally crossing over from Mexico, often to seek asylum from gangs and political violence. Ms. Nielsen apparently took offense at Mr. Trump’s abuse, but her department is still in line with his “security-focused agenda,” making plans to use military bases to hold children separated from their parents by the Border Patrol, according to The Washington Post. That is likely to become necessary since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that his prosecutors will file criminal charges against anyone crossing the border without authorization, rather than releasing them to await deportation. That legal escalation will tear apart more families with children, which now constitute 40 percent of people detained by American border agents, Ms. Nielsen told the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. That families constitute so great a proportion of illegal border crossers undercuts Mr. Trump’s contention that he is cracking down on immigration to keep out rapists and criminals. “These aren’t people, these are animals,” he snarled on Wednesday, in a stunningly dehumanizing reference to deported gang members. But his administration’s policies are not calculated to deal with the specific threat of violence, but rather to immiserate people whose only crime is wanting safety or opportunity. Migration north to the United States is largely what it has always been, an act of desperation by those fleeing violence, and of hope by those seeking new opportunity. Cracking down on the most vulnerable immigrants, though, is the goal of several measures the administration is undertaking. The White House, raising the specter of gang violence, has called on Congress to amend child trafficking laws so that more children who cross the border on their own can be deported directly, rather than placed in foster care or with relatives. This new measure is particularly extreme considering that the federal agency that oversees such minors says only 1.6 percent are affiliated with gangs. The Department of Homeland Security is reducing or revoking a special status for immigrant children who say they have been abused, neglected or abandoned. And the State Department has canceled a program that makes it easier for children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to gain asylum by letting them apply before heading to the border. "
"SOFIA, Bulgaria — Venting anger at President Trump, European leaders said Thursday they would take steps aimed at blunting the effects of the American sanctions he restored on Iran, which could penalize European companies doing business there. At a European Union summit meeting in Sofia, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said it would begin a legal process to prohibit companies based in the 28-member union from complying with the American sanctions. “We should know that the effects of the announced American sanctions will not remain without consequences,” Mr. Juncker said. “We have a duty to protect our European companies.” The meeting, with leaders of western Balkan countries, came barely a week after Mr. Trump quit the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and leading world powers, which has eased sanctions in exchange for verifiable curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. Leaders of Britain, France and Germany had implored Mr. Trump in vain to honor the accord, which he has long described as a disastrous giveaway. The other parties to the agreement, including Iran, China and Russia, have said they want the agreement to survive. At the same time, Iran has hinted that it may no longer honor the agreement if the promised economic benefits do not begin flowing to the nation of 80 million. "
"HOUSTON — President Trump faces a difficult juggling act as he tries to persuade China, India and other countries to join in oil sanctions against Iran while also pressuring Venezuela. Since the two oil-producing giants compete for the same markets, squeezing one may end up helping the other. Squeezing both may send oil prices soaring. A Venezuelan election is scheduled on Sunday that President Nicolás Maduro is almost certain to win because the main opposition is boycotting the vote, calling it a sham. To protest election abuses and human rights violations, Trump administration officials have warned that Venezuela could face tighter financial sanctions, including measures making it harder to export oil. The administration is also working to reduce Iran’s oil exports now that it has removed the United States from the nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration. Unless Iran and the other countries that signed the 2015 nuclear pact can reach a compromise, Washington plans in the coming months to press a number of punishing measures, like sanctions on banks in countries that do not reduce Iranian oil imports. Simultaneous moves against the Iranian and Venezuelan governments would amount to a complicated geopolitical game, with energy-hungry countries likely to look for ways to dodge sanctions and adversaries likely to seek ways to take advantage. “There’s a lot of pinball action,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s difficult for the United States to employ two sets of sanctions at once and not disturb the oil markets when they are as tight as they are.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. China is looking to make a deal with the U.S. Chinese economic officials are meeting with their American counterparts this week. And they’re preparing to offer a quick fix to the trade deficit: a promise to buy as much as $200 billion worth of American goods. Above, a port in Shandong Province. That would allow President Trump to claim a major victory in his campaign to rebalance America’s trade relationship with its biggest economic rival. But economists say the offer is simply not practical. The U.S. economy is already near its full productive capacity and probably couldn’t produce enough to meet that kind of demand. ____ 2. Some tidbits involving the Trump administration: It’s been exactly one year since Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel for the Russia inquiry. President Trump noted the anniversary with a series of Twitter posts reminding his 52 million followers of his belief that the investigation is a witch hunt. The Senate confirmed Gina Haspel as the first female director of the C.I.A., despite questions about her role in the agency’s use of torture. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday defended his use of the word “animals” to describe dangerous criminals trying to cross into the United States illegally, saying that he had been referring to members of the brutal transnational gang MS-13 when he used language critics called inappropriate. “I’m referring, and you know I’m referring, to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in,” Mr. Trump told a reporter who asked him about the remark, a day after using the term during a White House meeting about immigration. “We have laws that are laughed at on immigration. So when the MS-13 comes in, when the other gang members come into our country, I refer to them as animals. And guess what — I always will.” The president was doubling down on a statement he made on Wednesday at a round-table discussion with state and local officials from California, at which Mr. Trump and his guests criticized the state’s so-called sanctuary laws, which restrict communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. He used the word as one of the officials argued that the state laws made it more difficult for her to share information with immigration authorities about dangerous criminals, including MS-13 members. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we’re stopping a lot of them,” Mr. Trump said in response, during a session where he complained that the United States has “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world.” “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are,” the president added. “These aren’t people, these are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.” Here is the full video: "
"On Tuesday, the ride-hailing company Uber announced that it would no longer require its employees, drivers or passengers to submit to arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and assault. The decision followed dozens of accusations of abuse by female passengers and employees, and a promise by Uber’s new chief executive to “do the right thing, period.” Uber isn’t alone in making an exception for sexual harassment claims; Microsoft and Lyft have enacted a similar carve-out for their employees. But none of these companies have done away with arbitration for other types of claims, such as race discrimination, nor have they agreed to drop companion clauses that prohibit class-action lawsuits or other group claims. For decades, the spread of forced arbitration and its twin demon, the class-action waiver, have slowly eroded Americans’ civil rights. Sixty million employees in the United States — at places from Buffalo Wild Wings to Facebook to Goldman Sachs — are now bound by mandatory-arbitration agreements, and of those, 25 million are bound by class-action bans. Arbitration is an informal proceeding, in which an arbitrator, usually someone who works frequently with the same employer, decides on an employee’s claim. It’s a poor substitute for a court of law, with lopsided, inconsistent rules of evidence. When coupled with a ban on group activity, mandatory arbitration can deter aggrieved workers from coming forward in the first place. The technicalities of arbitration rules are dreary, which is why it has taken the #MeToo movement to highlight why they are so unfair to employees. Survivors of sexual harassment and assault have rightly demanded an end to the practice, in which the proceedings are kept secret. High-profile employers are responding to this criticism cynically, at best, by agreeing to eliminate mandatory arbitration only for #MeToo-type claims. "
"To the Editor: Re “Tillerson, in Swipe at President, Says ‘Crisis of Ethics’ Infects U.S.” (front page, May 17): To anyone who embraces common sense and plain evidence, Rex Tillerson’s remarks in his commencement address at Virginia Military Institute are intelligent and welcomed. But they are also profoundly disappointing in their timing, as they are susceptible to being disregarded as the rantings of a disgruntled former employee. Where were these principled notions when Mr. Tillerson was secretary of state? Until a critical mass of current members of the president’s own party and administration publicly reject his undemocratic behavior and disregard for the rule of law, nothing will change.

"In recent years, the United States has been something of a beacon of hope for women fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries. In 2014, in a giant step forward, immigration courts explicitly determined that a person fleeing severe domestic violence may be granted asylum here if the violence rises to the level of persecution, if the government in the victim’s home country cannot or will not punish her abuser and if various other criteria are met. It’s a high bar but one that, sadly, women from many countries can clear. Now their last chance at protection may be under threat. The case that established that certain victims of domestic violence are eligible for asylum was decided in a landmark ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest court in our immigration judicial system. The survivor in the case, a Guatemalan named Aminta Cifuentes, was a victim of severe physical and sexual abuse. Ms. Cifuentes had endured 10 years of unrelenting violence at the hands of her spouse, who burned her with acid, beat and kicked her, broke her nose and punched her in the stomach with such force when she was eight months pregnant that the baby was born prematurely and with bruises. Her husband told her it would be pointless to call the police, because “even the police and judges beat their wives.” The ruling that granted her protection was a transformative one, not just for Ms. Cifuentes but for our country, too. At last, the United States stood firmly in opposition to violence against women and recognized that we can and should offer hope to survivors. In March, however, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an unusual move, suddenly and inexplicably stepped into this seemingly settled matter to assign a similar petition for asylum, known as the Matter of A-B-, to himself for reconsideration.

"The company controlled by the family of the White House adviser Jared Kushner is close to receiving a bailout of its troubled flagship building by a company with financial ties to the government of Qatar, according to executives briefed on the deal. Charles Kushner, head of the Kushner Companies, is in advanced talks with Brookfield Asset Management over a partnership to take control of the 41-story aluminum-clad tower in Midtown Manhattan, 666 Fifth Avenue, according to two real estate executives who have been briefed on the pending deal but were not authorized to discuss it. Brookfield is a publicly traded company, and its real estate arm, Brookfield Property Partners, is partly owned by the Qatari government, through the Qatar Investment Authority. Charles Kushner and his son Jared, President Trump’s son-in-law and one of his key advisers, bought the office tower, which is between 52nd and 53rd Streets, 11 years ago for a record-setting $1.8 billion. But the building today only generates about half its annual mortgage payment, and 30 percent of the 41-story tower is vacant. The Kushner family had been searching the globe for a partner for the building, including meeting as recently as last year with a billionaire from Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani, the country’s former prime minister. The Kushner Companies declined to comment. Both Brookfield and the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign fund of the oil-rich Middle Eastern emirate, said the Investment Authority had no knowledge of the deal. A spokesman for the Investment Authority said the fund “has no involvement whatsoever in this deal.” But the Qatar Investment Authority is the second-biggest investor in Brookfield Property Partners, Brookfield’s real estate arm.

"This is a moment of speaking out and freaking out. Today’s off-the-cuff comment is tomorrow’s outrage, and in a world where everyone is a brand, one of the weapons of choice has become the consumer boycott. Recently Kanye West spurred calls for a boycott of Adidas, his sneaker partner, when he announced in an interview that 400 years of slavery “sounds like a choice.” When Donna Karan put her foot in it on the red carpet after the Weinstein sexual harassment revelations by wondering if women were “asking” for trouble because of how they dressed, a petition was circulated on Care2 for Nordstrom and Macy’s to drop DKNY (even though Ms. Karan had not been associated with the brand since 2015). Calls to boycott the Ivanka Trump brand by the group #GrabYourWallet began after Donald Trump’s leaked comments about grabbing women in a sexually aggressive manner and continued after Mr. Trump became president (even though Ms. Trump had also stepped away from her brand, after the election). Dolce & Gabbana even made it an official meta-trend by creating #BoycottDolce&Gabbana T-shirts after a movement had begun to — yes, boycott the brand thanks to its relationship with Melania Trump, the first lady. And yet there is an exception to the rule. Karl Lagerfeld, the longtime creative director of Chanel and Fendi and founder of a namesake brand, is known to be “the greatest talker in Paris since Oscar Wilde,” or so said Godfrey Deeny, the global editor of the Fashion Network. But while he can be terrifically quotable and entertaining, he also has a tendency to utter outrageous things. And lately, that type of comment seems to be escalating. Last week, Mr. Lagerfeld gave an interview to the French newspaper Le Point in which he said he was considering renouncing his German citizenship because of the one million Muslim immigrants that Angela Merkel, the chancellor, had accepted into Germany, a decision he linked to the rise of neo-Nazism in the country.

"I cry. I am a crier. Crying releases the anger and frustration. Crying gets the sad out, and it humbles me in a good way. In the aftermath of crying, I experience clarity of thought and a burst of productivity. When I was much younger and needed a cry, I turned to books. “Beaches,” by Iris Rainer Dart, was a reliable go-to, as was “Where the Red Fern Grows.” There are plenty of people who rely on books for this kind of emotional release, and Goodreads is filled with recommendations in its “Listopia” section. “Causes of Ugly Crying” supplies more than 1,200 book suggestions, like “The Fault in Our Stars,” “Wonder” and “Little Women,” which I really should reread because chopping onions in an airless room cannot compete with the tear-duct trigger of (spoiler alert) Beth’s death. But now when I need to cry, I grab my phone. For the quickest, surest, most fulsome cry, I open my Twitter app and search for “military homecoming videos.” These are homemade smartphone clips, sometimes elaborately staged, that capture a raw moment of surprise experienced by an American who does not know that a family member who is in the military and  stationed away from home is returning for a visit. If  so-called promposals are merely touching, military homecomings pack a wallop. “They’re the old Hallmark commercials of today,” said Mary Connelly, an executive producer of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” in its 15th year an old hand at the crying game. “There is nothing better than those, they’re money in the bank.” My current favorite homecoming was posted last Christmas Eve. It shows a mother opening a wrapped Christmas gift, held up by one family member while others instruct her to pull the paper off from top to bottom. The gift is revealed to be a full-length mirror, but the real gift is that standing behind the couch, unbeknown to the mother, is a young servicewoman dressed in military fatigues. "
"The events of recent days in Malaysia have been dizzying. A former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, 92, returned to power last week after a stunning upset vote, defeating not just his former protégé, but the very party he helped create. Motivated by a desire to oust Prime Minister Najib Razak, the scion of a political family who was embroiled in a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, Malaysians voted in record numbers. Now, Mr. Mahathir must stitch together a governing coalition that includes followers of Anwar Ibrahim, his onetime nemesis, who was released from prison after serving five years on charges that were widely seen as politically motivated. Here is our guide to the people and events that led to Mr. Mahathir’s return to power and Mr. Najib’s fall from grace.

"WASHINGTON — In 2011, Michael B. Brennan, then a lawyer in Milwaukee, vigorously defended the right of Wisconsin’s Republican senator to single-handedly block an Obama administration nominee for a federal bench seat in the state. Last week, Mr. Brennan was confirmed as a Trump administration nominee to that very same seat despite vigorous objections by the state’s Democratic senator. That incongruity is at the heart of what is fast becoming one of the most significant questions on Capitol Hill: How far will Republican senators go in pushing through President Trump’s judicial nominees over the objections of Democrats from states where the potential new judges will preside? The answer: pretty far. Mr. Brennan was the second federal appellate court nominee confirmed despite a refusal by one home-state Democrat to consent to the nomination through the longstanding Senate tradition of signing and returning a blue-tinted form — known universally as the blue slip — demonstrating acquiescence in the presidential appointment. Now the Senate Judiciary Committee could send to the floor a disputed nominee from Oregon who is opposed by both of that state’s senators, a major break with Senate custom. According to the Congressional Research Service, it would be the first time since at least 1979 that a federal judge could be confirmed over the objections of both home-state senators. Democrats believe it could be the first time ever. But Republicans are making it very clear they are willing to push the institutional envelope while exulting in what they have accomplished to date when it comes to remaking the federal judiciary. “One-eighth — one-eighth — of the circuit judges in America have been appointed by Donald Trump and confirmed by this Republican Senate,” a triumphant Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Tuesday after the Senate approved its 21st Trump appeals court judge.

"CAROLINA, P.R. — Senator Bill Nelson of Florida stepped out of an official-looking S.U.V., briefcase in hand, ready to survey a still-unfinished public housing development funded by the federal government — not in his home state but more than 1,000 miles away, in Puerto Rico. “¡Hola! Un placer,” — a pleasure, he said in Spanish, shaking the hands of the cadre of local officials greeting him under the stinging morning sun. The purpose of Mr. Nelson’s visit was to inquire about the recovery from Hurricane Maria, specifically, where Washington continued to be deficient. With any luck, Mr. Nelson, a Democrat facing his toughest re-election race yet, might also grab a headline back home. “Are you from the Sentinel?” Mr. Nelson asked a notebook-wielding journalist, referring to the weekly Spanish-language newspaper in Orlando, which had indeed sent a reporter. Mr. Nelson smiled. Holding political office in Florida increasingly requires trekking to Puerto Rico, the former home of a growing number of Florida residents. More than a million Puerto Ricans already lived in the state before the hurricane, and another 56,000 joined them in the first six months after Maria, according to an estimate by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York. Perhaps not all of them will stay, much less vote: Puerto Ricans have tended to cast ballots less reliably than other Florida Hispanics. But if they do — perhaps driven by the slow response to Hurricane Maria — they could emerge as a significant political force, and not just for Democrats. Though Puerto Ricans tend to lean left, many have also registered as Florida voters without party affiliation, giving Republicans an opening to make a play for their support. If Republicans are successful, they could grow their Hispanic conservative base beyond Cuban Americans. "
"WASHINGTON — The Transportation Security Administration has created a new secret watch list to monitor people who may be targeted as potential threats at airport checkpoints simply because they have swatted away security screeners’ hands or otherwise appeared unruly. A five-page directive obtained by The New York Times said actions that pose physical danger to security screeners — or other contact that the agency described as “offensive and without legal justification” — could land travelers on the watch list, which was created in February and is also known as a “95 list.” “An intent to injure or cause physical pain is not required, nor is an actual physical injury,” according to the directive that was issued in March by Darby LaJoye, the agency’s assistant administrator for security operations. According to the directive, people who loiter suspiciously near security checkpoints could be put on the watch list. So could those who present what the document vaguely described as “challenges to the safe and effective completion of screening.” But on its own, the watch list cannot be used to prevent passengers from boarding flights, nor can it impel extra screening at security checkpoints, according to the document. That has raised questions about whether it serves a legitimate security purpose, and has heightened civil liberty concerns over the added government surveillance. “If I’m running late, having a bad day and I’m rude to the screeners, do I get put on the list?” said Fred Burton, the chief security officer at Stratfor, a global intelligence company in Austin, Tex.

Here’s what you need to know: • It was known as Crossfire Hurricane, a code name for what, a year ago today, became the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling: In the summer of 2016, two agents interviewed the Australian ambassador to Britain, who had evidence that one of Donald Trump’s advisers knew about interference from Moscow.

If you haven’t been following the twists in the Russia investigation, here’s a quick catch-up. • On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages of documents about the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 at which the campaign was expecting incriminating information about Hillary Clinton. The documents produced few revelations, but here are five things they do tell us. • President Trump’s latest financial disclosure includes for the first time a repayment of more than $100,000 to his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in 2017. Mr. Cohen has said he paid $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election to the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president, who denies any such relationship with the actress, initially said he was unaware of the payment, but acknowledged its existence in a series of Twitter posts this month. • Critics of Mr. Trump seized on the transfer as proof that the president should have included it in last year’s financial statement.

"Donald Trump’s approval rating is rising. The Democratic advantage on survey questions about party preference for control of Congress is vanishing. Liberal anxiety about the fate of the midterms — and I would venture, the country itself — is rising. To all this, I say: Calm down. Not relax. Not rest easy. Not coast. But stay the course and don’t panic. Work hard, message well and bring your passion — and a few neighbors and friends — to the polls in November. If voters do that, as they have already done in special elections, signs are positive for a major realignment in Washington. As a CNN analysis last month said: “These results suggest that the Republican Party is in trouble heading into the midterm elections. If past trends hold, it is possible Democrats could see a double- digit swing in the average House district in 2018 compared with past elections.” The analysis continued: “The reason is fairly clear: The Democrats are outperforming their baseline far more often than they are underperforming it. The average swing across all elections has been +13 Democratic, signaling a national political environment is 13 points in the Democrats’ direction.” The report concluded: “The last time the average shift from the partisan baseline in federal elections looked anything like this cycle was in 2006. That year Democrats won the national House vote by eight percentage points and had net gain of 30 House seats. Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to take back the House this November. Like 2006, we shouldn’t expect Democrats to win the national House vote by nearly as much as they over-performed in the special elections.” "

The Trump administration does not on the whole view the nation’s biggest banks as wayward institutions that need to be reined in, yet it has to grapple with Wells Fargo and its string of scandals. Of course, Mr. Trump has singled out Wells for criticism over its run of misdeeds. Regulators have also taken action under his watch. Last month the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau required Wells Fargo to pay $1 billion to settle investigations into its mortgage and auto-lending practices. And the Federal Reserve earlier this year capped the bank’s growth while it attempts to fix its problems. But how might regulators now react to signs that there is more misconduct at Wells Fargo? The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that Wells Fargo employees improperly changed information in documents about clients of its business banking unit. Wells Fargo reported the activity to the O.C.C., the Journal reported. That could be evidence that Wells’s senior management is becoming more forthcoming about problems in its ranks. In a statement included in the Journal report, Wells Fargo said: “This matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.” But a bank doesn’t have to harm customers to get into trouble with its regulators. Much of what regulators do is aimed at ensuring banks have systems in place to make sure they are complying with regulations. As scandals have hit Wells Fargo over the past two years, regulators have been pressing the bank to tighten up its controls. But the missteps reported by the Journal occurred as recently as the early part of this year, suggesting Wells Fargo is still struggling to improve its compliance and its workplace culture. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — A week ago, things could not have been going better for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. He was successfully arranging a meeting between North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump. His approval ratings at home were soaring. The tone had changed so much that Mr. Trump had even called Mr. Kim “very honorable.” Now, the matchmaking role that has defined Mr. Moon’s presidency is in doubt. After months of unusual bonhomie, North Korea withdrew on Wednesday from talks with South Korea and threatened to cancel the planned June 12 summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, which Mr. Moon’s aides have spent months trying to set up. For Mr. Moon, the North’s reversal brought home the difficulties in playing matchmaker between his country’s most fearsome foe and its most important ally, two countries run by impulsive and often unpredictable leaders. It shows the extraordinarily difficult challenge that Mr. Moon confronts. He faces skepticism from both Pyongyang and Washington that he can be an honest broker. North Korea still considers South Korea an American stooge. In the United States, conservatives who have the president’s ear worry that progressive South Korean leaders like Mr. Moon will ease sanctions, breaking ranks with Washington in their eagerness to reconcile with the North. “A matchmaker can succeed when boy and girl like each other,” said Moon Seong-mook, a senior analyst at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul. “But the United States and North Korea have very different ideas on how to achieve denuclearization.” "
"PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron’s warm embrace of the American president, replete with hand-holding, hugs and dandruff dusting, has come back to haunt the young French leader and open him to searing criticism from political opponents at home. The lavish show of friendship with an American president who is deeply unpopular in France has cost Mr. Macron, whose support was already wobbling over perceptions that his policies have favored the rich. Mr. Macron’s unrequited pleas for policy shifts from Mr. Trump are perceived as failures, and more than half of those surveyed in a poll last weekend disapproved of his gushy performance, for which he got nothing in return. The price to Mr. Macron’s standing has now been compounded by Mr. Trump’s decision last week to withdraw from the Iran accord, after Mr. Macron went to Washington last month, in part to try to persuade the American president to preserve it. France “prostituted itself” and “humiliated itself in its relations with the U.S.,” Daniel Fasquelle, a member of Parliament from a center-right party in the opposition, told reporters in the halls of the Assemblée Nationale last week in the wake of Mr. Trump’s decision on Iran. Another lawmaker, Clémentine Autain, on the left, told the journalists, “France favors a partner which happens to be a dangerous partner for world peace.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Let’s connect four different news stories from the past 24 hours: 1. President Trump admitted in a filing that he did indeed reimburse his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for hush money paid to the porn actress Stormy Daniels. He had previously lied about the payment. 2. In testimony to Congress, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., tried to downplay his father’s role in various aspects of the Russia scandal. Trump Jr. has previously lied about these same issues. Given the Trump family’s repeated lying, no one should put much stock in these new claims. They may be true, or they may be false. 3. In a graduation speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state, took an obvious swipe at Trump, his former boss. “If our leaders seek to conceal the truth, or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a pathway to relinquishing our freedom,” Tillerson said. “A responsibility of every American citizen to each other is to preserve and protect our freedom by recognizing what truth is and is not, what a fact is and is not, and begin by holding ourselves accountable to truthfulness, and demand our pursuit of America’s future be fact-based.” It’s a nice — and important — sentiment. But given how often Tillerson stood by silently while other members of the Trump administration told blatant lies, his indirect criticism now isn’t nearly sufficient. He should be brave enough to acknowledge whom he’s really talking about. (For more on Tillerson’s outstanding debt to the country, read Michelle Goldberg.) "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) For decades, allegations of misconduct dogged the primary gynecologist in the student health center at the University of Southern California. There were reports that he inappropriately touched students during pelvic exams and made sexual comments about their bodies. Yet even after university officials suspended the doctor, George Tyndall, in 2016 and forced him to step down a year later, they did not report the accusations to the California Medical Board. When their internal investigation was complete, officials said that the findings were a personnel matter and that there was no legal obligation to notify the state oversight board, which investigates doctors accused of misconduct. Several medical experts and ethicists said Wednesday that, regardless of the law, the university failed to meet its ethical obligation. The Los Angeles Times first reported details of accusations against Dr. Tyndall in a lengthy investigation published this week. Under state law, hospitals and clinics are required to notify the medical board if they suspend or terminate physicians. The board receives nearly 10,000 complaints each year and last year opened more than 1,400 investigations. If it finds serious misconduct, it can revoke a license to practice. “If we receive a complaint from the member of the public or clinic or another doctor, we look into it,” said Carlos Villatoro, a spokesman for the board. “But the complaint has to come to us in the first place.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump asserted on Thursday that federal investigators attempted to infiltrate his 2016 campaign with a confidential informant — a scandalous overreach, he said, that would be “bigger than Watergate!” In some sense, many analysts have said, he is right: Efforts by a hostile foreign power to influence an American presidential election — with or without the assistance or knowledge of the winning candidate — may well be a scandal “bigger than Watergate!” The F.B.I. and a team of special prosecutors are investigating whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates were coordinating with Russia to help Mr. Trump defeat his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. And, since the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, the investigation has expanded to include inquiries into whether Mr. Trump has attempted to obstruct justice to bring an end to what he regularly calls a witch hunt. Thursday is the first anniversary of Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Since then, Mr. Trump has considered firing Mr. Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein — drawing parallels to the Watergate investigation more than four decades earlier, when Richard M. Nixon, ordered his attorney general and deputy attorney general to fire the special prosecutor investigating abuses in the 1972 presidential election. Both Justice Department officials resigned rather than carrying out the order. Mr. Trump marked the Mueller anniversary with a series of Twitter posts on Thursday morning, reminding his 52 million followers his belief that the investigation is a witch hunt. The president also praised his administration, calling it “the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history — by far!” In the first year of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, the special counsel’s team has brought dozens of criminal charges against former associates of Mr. Trump as well as Russians and Russian companies involved in the influence campaign. In one of his tweets, Mr. Trump also mentioned the use of a confidential informant. At least one government informant met several times with two of Mr. Trump’s former campaign aides, officials have said. "
"Minnesota prides itself on being “the Land of 10,000 Lakes.” At least 1,100 lie in the far northeastern part of the state, along the border with Canada, where more than a million acres of pristine waters and unspoiled woodlands are interspersed with canyons, steep cliffs and huge rock formations shaped by glaciers during the last ice age. Today this region, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, looks almost exactly as it appeared 10,000 years ago when Paleo-Indians lived there. Sigurd Olson, the naturalist and writer who guided there for three decades, called it “the most beautiful lake country on the continent.” Few who see it would disagree. Today it is the most visited wilderness area in the United States. But now this special place is at great risk. Late last year the Interior Department concluded that the two expired leases held by a Chilean-owned company, Twin Metals Minnesota, should be reinstated for copper and nickel mining near the border of the Boundary Waters. This reversed a decision made at the end of the Obama administration, which rejected the leases after the Forest Service concluded that a mine there “posed an inherent potential risk” that threatened “serious and irreplaceable harm” to the wilderness. Then, in January, the Trump administration scaled back a review of the impact of prohibiting mining on thousands of acres of Forest Service land near the wilderness. That was followed, this month, by the Interior Department reinstating those two expired Twin Metals leases. Now, the Trump administration says those leases must be renewed once terms and conditions are worked out. These actions are another chapter in President Trump’s continuing assault on the nation’s most precious natural and cultural lands. They are of a piece with the shrinking of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah by 85 percent to carve out areas believed to contain oil and gas reserves and large uranium deposits. By giving the extractive industries virtually everything they want in Utah, Alaska, Minnesota and elsewhere, this administration has sent an unambiguous message: There is no place on our public lands — or waters — that is inviolable if there are resources to be exploited. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing an economic war with China and a momentous meeting with North Korea, is considering a trade deal with Beijing that would soothe tensions and clear the way for his historic encounter with Kim Jong-un. But it would risk abandoning the president’s broader goal of punishing China for years of pressuring American companies to hand over sensitive technology. Chinese negotiators are preparing to offer the administration a deal to buy up to $200 billion worth of American goods, which would allow Mr. Trump to claim victory in his campaign to reduce the trade deficit with China and rebalance America’s trade relationship with its biggest economic rival, according to people briefed on the deliberations. But the Chinese promises would be largely illusory, economists cautioned, given the structural hurdles in China to buying more American exports and the sheer amount of goods the United States would have to produce to meet Beijing’s demand. Under the deal being discussed, China would pledge to buy substantially more American goods, including agricultural products like soybeans, as well as semiconductors and natural gas. That could theoretically reduce its trade surplus with the United States — which hit $372.5 billion last year — by up to $200 billion, though the real number would most likely be lower. In return, China is asking the United States to set aside tariffs and investment restrictions it has threatened against Chinese companies. That includes lifting sanctions on the telecommunications giant ZTE, which faced ruin after losing access to its American suppliers, and relaxing export controls that prevent American companies from selling sensitive technology to China. For Mr. Trump, his motive may be diplomatic as much as economic: He needs China to use its influence with Mr. Kim, who has suddenly thrown a cloud over his planned meeting with Mr. Trump in Singapore next month.

"JABALIYA CAMP, Gaza Strip — For the past seven weeks, every Friday morning a small group of teenagers had met at the corner of my street. They would exchange “Good mornings,” chat amicably for a while and then head east to the protests at the border with Israel. On Monday, they gathered again, this time to demonstrate against the opening of the new American embassy in Jerusalem. Tuesday was supposed to be the protests’ climax: It commemorated Nakba, the catastrophe, when Palestinians were expelled from our land by Israel in 1948. But somehow President Trump managed to add a day to our calendar of infamy, and it may be the crassest yet. I, too, headed to the border, east of Jabaliya, with four of my friends. We are all in our 40s, the generation of the First Intifada of 1987, and as we drove, we wondered whether it would be a big day. It was only midmorning when we arrived but already very hot over the dry clay land. The crowd was a mix of young and old, men and women, including some old ladies in traditional dress. It was fragmented, maybe even confused, with different groups moving different ways. The speaker who had the microphone at that moment — politicians and local leaders took turns — was spewing anger into the air, trying to provoke the people around him to march east, into Israel: If you are not here to cut the fence down and cross over to our own land, he said, you may as well not be here. I felt anger toward him. A small drone hovered in the distance, but in the other direction, deep into Gaza, well past the protesters amassed at the border. It dropped a dozen canisters of tear gas. Whoever was controlling it had finally understood the game. During the first few weeks of the marches, Israeli soldiers would torpedo the canisters directly into the crowd — only for the westerly wind to blow the gas back toward them. Since then, they had learned to deliberately overshoot west, so that the wind would deliver their gas to the crowds. To escape the fumes, my friends and I started to run, due north. But the wind was blowing the gas that way, too, and my eyes caught on fire. Three girls fell to the ground in front of us. Journalists with fancy-looking gas masks took photos, leisurely. We kept running. Fleeing protesters trampled acres of cucumber, okra and watermelon plants. What a season for the farmers. "
"In a prelude to an easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, Chinese officials ended a monthslong delay by approving Toshiba’s sale of a majority stake in its lucrative microchip unit to an American-led group. A lack of approval by Chinese regulators had held up the deal in what was widely seen as a signal from Beijing about how it might punish American businesses if the Trump administration acted on threats to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese-made goods. In a statement on Thursday, Toshiba said it had received “all required antitrust approvals” for the deal with a consortium led by the United States investment firm Bain Capital. Bain confirmed in its own statement that Chinese authorities had approved the deal. Chinese officials could not be reached for comment late Thursday, and the country’s official media and websites were silent on the matter. The reasons for the approval after the lengthy delay were not immediately clear. The approval was likely to be seen as a positive sign by the Trump administration, and it hinted at the two countries’ efforts to defuse tensions over trade issues. A senior Chinese government official, Liu He, is in Washington for trade talks this week. The approval of the Toshiba deal came just days after the White House appeared to make its own peace offering to Beijing. "
"Democratic Party officials, desperate to present a unified front in advance of the all-important 2018 midterms, are working to revamp their presidential nominating process and erase the final vestiges of the bitter 2016 presidential primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. The most significant, and divisive, step would involve reducing the role and power of superdelegates — the unpledged party insiders who are free to back any candidate regardless of how the public votes — ahead of the 2020 election. Their influence caused substantial tension two years ago when supporters of Mr. Sanders zeroed in on superdelegates as “undemocratic” and said they created an unfair and even rigged system favoring Mrs. Clinton. Now, party officials, including loyalists held over from both the Sanders and Clinton camps, are inching toward a compromise that would not only minimize the role of superdelegates but change the party’s operational structure as well. The ideas on the table range from eliminating superdelegates altogether to reducing their numbers significantly — from more than 700 currently to about 280. Some officials said they preferred a proposal in which only elected government officials, and not party leaders, retain their superdelegate status. The final agreement could be completed in late August, as party officials try to get their house in order and suppress talk of an continuing Clinton-Sanders divide within the Democratic National Committee. “People are getting to a decent place,” said David Pepper, a committee member and the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. “I think there’s an understanding that if we spend all our time in this internal discussion — so much so that it becomes our external message — then we’ve become off message with voters.” "
