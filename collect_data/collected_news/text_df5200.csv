"FRONT PAGE An article on Tuesday, about the differing goals that have emerged among women’s groups since the 2017 protests that followed President Trump’s inauguration, misspelled the surname of a sociology professor at Oakland University. She is Jo Reger, not Roger. • A map with an article on Sunday about uranium mining near the Bears Ears National Monument showed an incorrect location for the Daneros Mine. As the article correctly noted, the mine is outside the current boundaries of protected land, not inside. INTERNATIONAL An article on Sunday about Haitian migrants in Canada described incorrectly regulations on face veils in Quebec. While the government in 2017 barred people wearing face coverings from using public services or working in government jobs, it did not ban full-face veils in public spaces. NATIONAL An article on Monday about reaction among black churchgoers to President Trump’s disparaging comments on immigrants misidentified the church leader at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington who led worshipers in the song “We Shall Overcome.” It was the church’s music director, Marty Austin Lamar, not the pastor, the Rev. William H. Lamar IV (the two men are brothers). NEW YORK A Critic’s Notebook on Saturday about a review of public monuments misidentified the city where protesters pulled down a Confederate statue in the wake of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last August. It was in Durham, N.C., not Charlottesville. BUSINESS DAY An article on Jan. 10 about a memo to the Trump administration written by Robert E. Murray, the head of the country’s largest coal mining company, misstated the number of suggested actions in his memo. It had 16 recommendations, not 14. THE ARTS A theater review on Enda Walsh’s “Disco Pigs” gave the incorrect name for the setting of the play. It is Cork, not Park City; the characters in the play refer to it as Pork City.

"Over a three-day weekend at his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., President Trump showed little or no concern about the angry reaction set off by his use of obscenities to describe the third world countries he fears immigrants could come from under a new immigration bill. His base loved what he said, he told guests at the club, Mar-a-Lago, a refrain he repeated in phone calls over the holiday weekend. But back in Washington on Tuesday, his advisers and congressional allies have tried to limit the fallout from his remarks in an Oval Office meeting last week, insisting that he had never described the countries as “shitholes.” Some who had been in the meeting said they had not heard his descriptions. Others insisted in background conversations with reporters that they were told the word he had spoken was “shithouse,” a phrase that he often uses to describe physical structures that he finds unsavory. It was an unusual debate over words that until last Thursday had rarely, if ever, appeared in any mainstream news media. And if the argument seemed to amount to a distinction without a difference, neither the White House nor its allies have publicly acknowledged it, although some Trump aides have privately. There has also not been any acknowledgment that both words, as well as reports of Mr. Trump’s stated preference for immigrants from places like Norway, were offensive and many considered them racist. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, conceded to reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Trump “hasn’t said he didn’t use strong language.” “He’s passionate about it,” she said. “He’s not going to apologize for trying to fix our immigration system.” But the dispute among the president’s defenders about the vulgarity he actually used did nothing to allay critics. “I think it’s all the same,” said Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which Mr. Trump also mentioned dismissively during the Oval Office meeting, according to one participant.

"WASHINGTON — The commanding officers of two Naval destroyers that collided with commercial vessels in the western Pacific last year, killing a total of 17 American sailors, will face court-martial charges that could include negligent homicide, the Navy said on Tuesday. After the collisions, the commanding officers, Cmdr. Bryce Benson of the Fitzgerald, and Cmdr. Alfredo J. Sanchez of the John S. McCain, along with their second-in-commands, were relieved of their duties. In October, the Navy began looking into further disciplinary actions. Adm. Frank Caldwell, one of the lead officers assigned to the investigation, determined that the charges could include dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel and negligent homicide, the Navy said in a statement. In the coming weeks, the two commanding officers and three other sailors aboard the Fitzgerald will most likely be charged during a hearing that determines whether they will be taken to trial in a court-martial. If found guilty, they could face jail time. The announcement of a hearing and of court-martial charges “is not intended to and does not reflect a determination of guilt or innocence related to any offenses,” the statement said. A chief petty officer from the John S. McCain has already been referred to court-martial on suspicion of dereliction of duty; eight other crew members, four from each ship, face administrative actions. Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the head of the Seventh Fleet, the Navy’s largest overseas, and other senior officers were also relieved last year after the collisions. In November, the Navy released reports about the June 17 collision between the Fitzgerald and a commercial ship that killed seven sailors off Japan and the Aug. 21 collision between the John S. McCain and another commercial vessel that left 10 dead near Singapore. The Navy concluded that both collisions resulted from a chain of errors, missed warnings and poor training. “The collisions were avoidable,” Adm. John M. Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said in a summary of the reports, released in November. Admiral Richardson and the secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer, are set to appear in front of two subcommittees of the House Armed Services on Thursday, focusing extensively on naval operations.

"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — The majority of members of the National Parks System Advisory Board, which advises the federal government on management of the country’s national parks, have jointly resigned to protest Trump administration policies that the board members say have ignored science, squelched efforts to address climate change and undermined environmental protections. The advisory board was established in 1935 to advise the secretary of the interior, who oversees management of the country’s national parks and monuments. Since taking office last year, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has come under criticism from environmental advocates for promoting President Trump’s agenda of opening up the nation’s public lands and waters to fossil-fuel exploration, and for reducing the protection of public monuments. This month Mr. Zinke announced a plan to open up the majority of the nation’s coastlines to offshore drilling. And in December, the administration reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, by some two million acres, the largest rollback of federal land protection in the nation’s history. “From all of the events of this past year I have a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our National Parks has been set aside,” wrote Tony Knowles, the head of the advisory board, in a resignation letter dated Monday that was co-signed by eight other members of the 12-member panel. The Washington Post first reported the letter. “We resigned because we were deeply disappointed with the department and we were concerned,” Mr. Knowles said in an interview. Mr. Zinke, he said, “appears to have no interest in continuing the agenda of science, the effect of climate change, pursuing the protection of the ecosystem.” Mr. Knowles said that Mr. Zinke has refused to meet with his board during his tenure. Phil Francis, chairman of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, an advocacy group of current and former national park employees, said Tuesday evening, “This discourteous and disrespectful treatment of the Board is inexcusable and, unfortunately, consistent with a decidedly anti-park pattern demonstrated by Secretary Zinke’s department.” An Interior Department spokeswoman did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Mr. Zinke has sought to portray himself as a champion of national parks and has compared himself to Theodore Roosevelt, the founder of the national parks system. The resignations come amid growing concern by scientists that their voices are being suppressed by the Trump administration. Last May, the Environmental Protection Agency dismissed several members of its Board of Scientific Counselors in a move that Trump administration officials said was designed to give greater voice to industry interests in the agency.

"WASHINGTON — American troops will remain in Syria long after their fight against the Islamic State to ensure that neither Iran nor President Bashar al-Assad of Syria take over areas that have been newly liberated with help from the United States, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Wednesday. Staying in Syria, Mr. Tillerson said, will help ensure that the Trump administration does not repeat what he described as the mistakes of former President Barack Obama, who withdrew troops from Iraq before the extremist threat was doused and failed to stabilize Libya after NATO airstrikes that led to the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. “We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria,” Mr. Tillerson said during a speech at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University near San Francisco. “ISIS has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.” ISIS is another name for the Islamic State. There were roughly 2,000 American troops in Syria last month, a mix of engineering units that build fortifications and Special Operations units that fight and train with local militias. Additionally, American military contractors in Syria help demine recaptured areas as the Islamic State is pushed back. Mr. Tillerson’s comments were the first time a senior Trump administration official pledged to keep American troops in Syria well after the current battle ends. They also marked another step in President Trump’s gradual evolution from a populist firebrand who promised to extricate the United States from foreign military entanglements to one who is grudgingly accepting many of the national security strategies he once derided. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that “at some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/world/middleeast/tillerson-troops-syria-islamic-state.html?searchResultPosition=74
"COLUMBUS, Ohio — Four weeks before delegates meet to elect the next president of the United States Soccer Federation, Eric Wynalda was in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday to address the state of soccer in a town hall before about 100 angry fans of the local Major League Soccer team. It was unlikely that anybody in attendance had a vote in the election, but that did not matter to Wynalda. In a crowded field of eight candidates, Wynalda, 48, has positioned himself as the voice of the frustrated American soccer fan, a surging demographic since the men’s national team failed to qualify for this summer’s World Cup. But in that populist role, he has challenged the very pillars upon which soccer in this country has been painstakingly built over the past three decades. His candidacy has been called Trump-like. Wynalda rejects the label, but he also has spent months eviscerating the very organization he hopes to soon lead, and he has insisted that he alone has the skills to run an organization with more than $125 million in annual revenues most effectively, even though he spent part of the last decade warding off creditors during a period of personal financial turbulence revealed by public records and not previously reported. Except for having a bit of a temper — Wynalda was shown a red card in his first World Cup game — his soccer credentials are unimpeachable. Wynalda played in three World Cups, and for professional teams in Germany’s Bundesliga and Major League Soccer, before he became television analyst and lower-division manager. It is the rest of the résumé his detractors say is lacking. Wynalda’s critics point out his campaign is being financed in part by a minor-league owner who is locked in a legal battle with U.S. Soccer, and they say he has little experience to prepare him for the task of running an organization with more than 170 employees and multi-million-dollar contracts with some of the biggest entities in sports, including Nike and ESPN. According to public records, Wynalda filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009, and subsequently had significant liens placed against his assets as recently as three years ago. He said the liens were filed in error and were discharged without his having to pay any additional taxes or penalties.

"HONG KONG — North and South Korea agreed on Wednesday to march their athletes together under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month and to field a joint women’s ice hockey team. It was the most dramatic gesture of reconciliation between them in a decade. South Korea, host of the games, has said it hopes such a partnership in sports could contribute to a political thaw after years of high tensions. It came even as the prospect of war over the North’s nuclear and missile tests has grown especially acute. The Games will begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the women’s ice-hockey squad will be the first combined Korean team for the Olympics, and the first unified team since their athletes played together for an international table-tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991. The two countries’ delegations will march at the opening ceremony behind a “unified Korea” flag that shows an undivided Korean Peninsula, negotiators from both sides said in a joint news release after talks at the border village of Panmunjom. The North will send 230 supporters to the Games, and negotiators agreed that supporters of both Koreas would root together for athletes from both countries. The prospect of North and South Koreans cheering together offers a stunning contrast to the bombastic rhetoric of possible war from North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un and President Trump of the United States, South Korea’s main ally. Mr. Trump has threatened the North with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” should it put the security of Americans and their allies at risk. Mr. Kim has called Mr. Trump a lunatic.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. I’m going to take a break from All Things Trump this morning to talk about two important misperceptions in American life: The Flu. If you’re like most American adults, you haven’t gotten a flu vaccine this year. Maybe you think you don’t need one, because you’re not elderly or a child. Or maybe you think it’s too late. But none of that is correct. You should get a flu vaccine every year — for your own sake and for the sake of public health — and it’s not too late to get one this year. Flu season remains near its peak through February, and the flu remains a risk well after that, as Aaron Carroll, an Indiana University medical professor, told me yesterday. Carroll has written two recent Times pieces making the case for taking the flu seriously. It’s the country’s eighth-leading cause of death. And getting a vaccine is easy: “You can get a flu shot at most doctors’ offices and clinics, health departments, many pharmacies, health centers, and often at your work or school,” Carroll says. “The C.D.C. has a vaccine locator tool.” College Costs. Many people believe that college costs more than it actually does. Average net tuition at community colleges is less than zero — seriously — once financial aid is taken into account. Average in-state tuition at public colleges will be just $4,140 this year. And many elite private colleges cover much of their sky-high list-price tuition through scholarships. Yet many middle-class and low-income families believe tuition will cost them tens of thousands of dollars a year. This misperception has a serious downside. It keeps some people from attending college, even though the financial (and nonfinancial) benefits of a degree are enormous. Fortunately, a growing number of colleges are starting to take tuition misperceptions seriously. Sixteen top colleges are announcing this morning that they’re joining an effort called MyIntuition — an online calculator that lets people answer just a few questions, anonymously, and receive an estimate of how much attending each college would cost. The 16 include Boston College, Brown, Davidson, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, St. Olaf and Yale. They’ve joined 15 others that already participate. The calculator was created by Phillip Levine, an economist at Wellesley College. The Boston Globe named the calculator one of 2017’s “bold new ideas,” and administrators at Dartmouth say it has helped them attract more low-income applicants. I’ve written about it before, with more details here and here. The calculator is remarkably easy to use, far easier than other financial-aid tools. If you have a child nearing college age, or you’re simply curious, give it a whirl — with real or hypothetical information.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s chief of staff privately told a group of Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had not been “fully informed” when promising voters a wall along the Mexican border last year, and said that he had persuaded the president it was not necessary. He also expressed optimism that a bipartisan immigration deal could eventually be reached. John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general credited with bringing a measure of discipline to Mr. Trump’s chaotic White House during his six months as chief of staff, told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that he had educated the president about the issue of immigration, adding that Mr. Trump had “evolved” on the wall. But President Trump directly contradicted the chief of staff on Thursday, saying his position on building the wall had not “evolved.” In an early-morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump said, “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.” He added in a second tweet, “The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.” The comments Mr. Kelly made Wednesday were an unusual instance of a White House chief of staff seeming to undercut public statements made by the president, in the process contradicting the central message of “Build the wall” that defined Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. The president has recently begun to temper his own statements about the wall, telling a group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House last week that a 2,000-mile structure would not be needed because parts of the border would be impassable. But in telling lawmakers that Mr. Trump had essentially erred from the start in promoting a wall and by claiming credit for dissuading him, Mr. Kelly appeared to be voicing a sentiment some in the West Wing have heard him express privately — that it is his job to tutor a sometimes ill-informed president who has never served in public office before.

"WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to castigate President Trump for his “assaults” on American media and to compare the president’s words to those of a former Soviet dictator who slaughtered millions of his own citizens in a reign of terror. “It is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies,” Mr. Flake said, referring to the former Soviet dictator who regularly used the phrase “enemy of the people,” which Mr. Trump has borrowed. “When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him ‘fake news,’ it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press,” Mr. Flake said. Mr. Flake had promised to speak out against Mr. Trump’s “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior when he announced in October that he would retire at the end of the year. True to his word, Mr. Flake delivered his remarks on the day the president had said he would issue “Fake News Awards” to “the most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media.” As of late morning on Wednesday, there was nothing on the president’s public schedule for such an event. Mr. Trump had initially scheduled these awards for earlier this month, but announced in a Twitter post that they would be postponed. Mr. Flake and the president have not disguised their dislike of one another. Mr. Flake has been a target of the president’s tweets and has written a book denouncing Mr. Trump. He is among a small group of Republican senators that has criticized the president, with others including Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is also retiring, and John McCain of Arizona, who is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Tuesday, Mr. McCain joined his fellow Arizonan in calling for the president to stop attacking the news media, and he encouraged Congress to embrace a free press in ways Mr. Trump won’t. “We cannot afford to abdicate America’s longstanding role as the defender of human rights and democratic principles throughout the world. Without strong leadership in the White House, Congress must commit to protecting independent journalism, preserving an open and free media environment, and defending the fundamental right to freedom of opinion and expression,” Mr. McCain wrote. Both Mr. Flake and Mr. McCain warned that the president’s sustained attacks on American news media put journalists around the world in danger and set a poor example for countries led by authoritarians and dictators. “No longer can we turn a blind eye or deaf ear to those assaults on our institutions and, Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism, who must constantly deflect and distort and distract, who must find someone else to blame, is charting a very dangerous path,” Mr. Flake said. “And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to that danger.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/us/politics/flake-mccain-trump-freedom-of-the-press.html?searchResultPosition=83
"WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, will be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel in the Russia investigation instead of testifying before a grand jury, according to a person familiar with the matter, a sign that Mr. Bannon is cooperating with the inquiry. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had subpoenaed Mr. Bannon to appear before a grand jury this week. But Mr. Bannon has agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller’s investigation and will be interviewed in the less formal setting of the special counsel’s offices in downtown Washington. It was not clear why Mr. Mueller subpoenaed Mr. Bannon and did not first ask him to sit for an interview, as Mr. Mueller had done with more than a dozen current and former White House officials who were questioned in recent months. Mr. Mueller could still call Mr. Bannon to appear before a grand jury after he meets with investigators. Legal experts have said the subpoena could be a sign that the investigation was accelerating, while others said it may have simply been a negotiating tactic to force Mr. Bannon to quickly agree to be interviewed. The subpoena was served after Mr. Bannon was quoted in the new book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” criticizing the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. and predicting that Mr. Mueller’s investigation will ultimately center on money laundering. Mr. Bannon is still under subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee, which took the unusual step of subpoenaing him as he was being interviewed by its members on Tuesday. He had refused to answer several questions about Mr. Trump, saying the White House had told him to assert executive privilege. Committee members of both parties were angered by Mr. Bannon’s lack of cooperation during his 10 hours of testimony, and Democrats said that the White House had used executive privilege as a “gag order” to stop Mr. Bannon from talking about the president. The lawmakers would like Mr. Bannon to return to Capitol Hill on Thursday to respond to the questions he refused to answer. But Mr. Bannon’s lawyer told the committee that Mr. Bannon would not be appearing before the panel this week because there is not enough time to work out executive privilege issues with the White House. CNN first reported on Wednesday that Mr. Mueller would forgo Mr. Bannon’s grand jury appearance. Also on Wednesday, a status hearing for George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., was postponed for up to 90 days. Mr. Papadopoulos is cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s inquiry while awaiting sentencing.

"A Wisconsin Democrat won a State Senate seat on Tuesday night that had been held by a Republican for 17 years, setting off a flurry of political predictions across a state that President Trump won. Republicans warned that it was a “wake up” call for their party as elections loom in the fall, while Democrats cheered the upset victory as a sign of hope that Wisconsin was back in contention. In the state’s first special election of 2018, Patty Schachtner, a Democrat and the St. Croix County medical examiner, beat Representative Adam Jarchow, a Republican member of the State Assembly, by 11 percentage points, according to preliminary election returns, decisively taking the seat in a rural western region near the Minnesota border. “Everything is in play now,” Melanie Conklin, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said on Wednesday. “This is a district that has been a very red district for a long time, and the numbers last night were very blue.” The election comes at a tense political moment for the state, with a governor’s race and United States Senate seat at stake in the fall; questions about gerrymandering of state political maps in the courts; and with political observers around the nation watching all sorts of local and state races for signs of what 2018 races may bring for both parties. In Wisconsin, political analysts and others by Wednesday were weighing how much to make of the outcome here: Should this be seen as merely meaningful as a local election with issues unique to a single district, or as a larger sign of what Republicans should expect ahead? Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who won election in 2010 and is seeking re-election in November, took to Twitter on Tuesday night with a somewhat ominous assessment: “Senate District 10 special election win by a Democrat is a wake up call for Republicans in Wisconsin,” he wrote. “Can’t presume that voters know we are getting positive things done in Wisconsin.

"It’s not every day that a book garners glowing blurbs from both Rod Dreher of The American Conservative (“clarifying”) and the socialist scholar Cornel West (“courageous”), but then these aren’t ordinary times. Patrick J. Deneen’s “Why Liberalism Failed” speaks to a profound discontent with the political establishment. During the 2016 election, “They’re all the same” was a line heard from Americans disgusted with both parties. Judging from this book, Deneen would agree. Liberalism, as he defines it, encompasses the orthodoxy of political elites, whether they lean to the left or the right. It was conceived some 500 years ago and was the founding creed of the United States. It prescribes autonomy for individuals to “fashion and pursue for themselves their own version of the good life.” It advises government to get out of the way in the realm of markets (a Republican priority) and personal morality (a Democratic one). It has been an unmitigated disaster. That, at least, is Deneen’s argument. “Why Liberalism Failed” is a book that reads like an attempt to enunciate a primal scream, a deeply exasperating volume that nevertheless articulates something important in this age of disillusionment. (David Brooks and Ross Douthat have both written Op-Ed columns about the book for The Times.) Deneen, a professor of political science at Notre Dame, may not admire President Trump, but he understands his appeal. “Today’s widespread yearning for a strong leader, one with the will to take back popular control over liberalism’s forms of bureaucratized government and globalized economy, comes after decades of liberal dismantling of cultural norms and political habits essential to self-governance,” Deneen writes. His critique in this slender volume is impressively capacious. Ruthless economic liberalization has left many people materially insecure; relentless cultural liberalization has left them unmoored. Communal ties are discouraged in order to encourage a mobile force of workers. Freedom becomes something for an increasingly powerful government to grant or withhold. Mere tinkering won’t alleviate the deep rot in the liberal project, Deneen insists. He says we need to envision a future after liberalism, where local, preferably religious communities tend to the land and look after their own. These groups would cultivate “cultures of community, care, self-sacrifice and small-scale democracy.” Readers of all political stripes can probably find something in this book that rings true, even if it’s followed by the rude awakening of a record scratch. His thoughts on the environment sound like they came out of a Greenpeace brochure — “Short-term exploitation of the earth’s bounty,” he writes, “forces our children to deal with shortages of such resources as topsoil and potable water” — while his musings on women, when he deigns to mention women, sound like they came out of an especially cranky episode of “The 700 Club.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/books/review-why-liberalism-failed-patrick-deneen.html?searchResultPosition=79
"SAN FRANCISCO — Apple, which had long deferred paying taxes on its foreign earnings and had become synonymous with hoarding money overseas, unveiled plans on Wednesday that would bring back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it held abroad and said it would make a sizable investment in the United States. With the moves, Apple took advantage of the new tax code that President Trump signed into law last month. A provision allows for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple, which has 94 percent of its total cash of $269 billion outside the United States, said it would make a one-time tax payment of $38 billion on the repatriated cash. For years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple’s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration. In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending. “I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-tax-bill-repatriate-cash.html?searchResultPosition=78
"WASHINGTON — Cardiologists not associated with the White House said Wednesday that President Trump’s physical exam revealed serious heart concerns, including very high levels of so-called bad cholesterol, which raises the risk that Mr. Trump could have a heart attack while in office. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral and the White House physician, said Tuesday in his report on the president’s medical condition that Mr. Trump was in “excellent” cardiac health despite having an LDL cholesterol level of 143, well above the desired level of 100 or less. Dr. David Maron, the director of preventive cardiology at Stanford University’s medical school, said Wednesday that it was alarming that the president’s LDL levels remain above 140 even though he is taking 10 milligrams of Crestor, a powerful drug that is used to lower cholesterol levels to well below 100. Dr. Maron said he would “definitely” be worried about Mr. Trump’s risk for having a heart attack if the president were one of his patients. Asked if Mr. Trump is in perfect health, Dr. Maron offered a blunt reply: “God, no.” Other cardiologists also disputed Dr. Jackson’s rosy assessment of the president’s heart health. Several said Mr. Trump’s goal should be to get his LDL below 100, or even under 70. He has a real risk of having a heart attack or stroke, especially considering his weight and lack of exercise, they said. Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Scripps Research Institute, said that it is impossible to ignore the dangers of the president’s elevated cholesterol levels when providing an overall assessment of Mr. Trump’s health.

"Lawyers for the Uzbek man charged in the truck attack on a crowded Manhattan bike path that killed eight people on Halloween said on Wednesday that their client would plead guilty and accept life imprisonment without parole if prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. The proposal came in an exchange of letters to Judge Vernon S. Broderick of Federal District Court in Manhattan, in which prosecutors were seeking a firm trial date for the defendant, Sayfullo Saipov, arguing that victims and witnesses needed closure, and Mr. Saipov’s lawyer said the best way to obtain closure was through such a plea deal. The government has not yet said whether it would seek the death penalty for Mr. Saipov, 29, who was indicted on eight capital counts and other charges in the Oct. 31 attack, the deadliest terror attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Saipov has pleaded not guilty. In the days immediately after the attack, President Trump posted messages on Twitter declaring “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” and “Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY.” On Tuesday, the office of Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, wrote to Judge Broderick, describing the process that occurs before a decision on the death penalty is reached: Mr. Berman’s office would make a recommendation to Attorney General Jeff Sessions; the defense may make its own submission; a special Justice Department capital case unit conducts a review; and Mr. Sessions makes the ultimate determination. The prosecutors asked the judge for a firm trial date around April 2019. “Of critical importance,” they wrote, “the victims in the United States and abroad have a strong desire for closure.” In the defense’s letter on Wednesday, David E. Patton, one of Mr. Saipov’s federal public defenders, said, ""The most straightforward way to achieve closure would be for the government to accept a plea of guilty and a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.” That outcome would obviate the need for victims’ families to prepare for and participate in a trial and, in the event of a death sentence, prevent years of appeals, Mr. Patton noted. Such a decision would “bring immediate closure to the case without the need for the public and victims to repeatedly relive the terrible events of Oct. 31, 2017,” Mr. Patton added. “We hope to convince the government of that view in our submissions.” Neither Mr. Patton nor Mr. Berman’s office would comment. Mr. Saipov is accused of driving a pickup truck down a bike path along the Hudson River in Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 11 before being shot by a police officer in the abdomen.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump — who gleefully questioned President Barack Obama’s birthplace for years without evidence, long insisted on the guilt of the Central Park Five despite exonerating proof and claimed that millions of illegal ballots cost him the popular vote in 2016 — wanted to have a word with the American public about accuracy in reporting. On Wednesday, after weeks of shifting deadlines, and cryptic clues, Mr. Trump released his long-promised “Fake News Awards,” an anti-media project that had alarmed advocates of press freedom and heartened his political base. “And the FAKE NEWS winners are …,” he wrote on Twitter at 8 p.m. The message linked, at first, to a malfunctioning page on GOP.com, the Republican National Committee website. An error screen read: “The site is temporarily offline, we are working to bring it back up. Please try back later.” When the page came back online less than an hour later, it resembled a Republican Party news release. Headlined “The Highly Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards” and attributed to “Team GOP,” it included a list of Trump administration accomplishments and jabs at news organizations presented in the form of an 11-point list. The “winners” were CNN, mentioned four times; The New York Times, with two mentions; and ABC, The Washington Post, Time and Newsweek, with one mention apiece. Taken as a whole, Mr. Trump’s examples of grievances came as no surprise to anyone who has read his complaints about the media on Twitter.

"KANDEL, Germany — It happened between neatly stacked rows of shampoo and organic baby food: A teenage boy walked up to his ex-girlfriend in the local drugstore, pulled out a kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade and stabbed her in the heart. The death in Kandel, in southwestern Germany, on Dec. 27 has traumatized this sleepy town of barely 10,000 inhabitants, not just because both the suspect and the victim were only 15 years old and went to the local school, but also because the boy is an Afghan migrant and the girl was German. From the moment Germany opened its doors to more than a million migrants two years ago, prominent episodes like the Berlin Christmas market attack and the New Year’s molestation and rapes in Cologne have stoked German insecurities. But the case of the two teenagers, Abdul D. and Mia V., has struck a special nerve because the killing happened in such a quiet and provincial setting and the two people involved were so young. It became national news, was debated over dinner tables, on talk shows and on social media sites, and reinforced fears that Germany is becoming ever less safe. Yet perceptions are one thing, and statistics are another. Reported crimes have edged up over the past two years, but over all, violent crimes have been trending downward for a decade in Germany, which remains one of the safest countries in Europe. Nevertheless, each crime involving a migrant or asylum seeker has become a fresh occasion for national hand-wringing.

"“Fire and Fury” could be coming to the small screen. Or maybe even the big one. Endeavor Content has acquired the rights to Michael Wolff’s No. 1 best-selling book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” and plans to develop it into a TV show or a feature film. No TV network or film studio has been attached to the project. A “Fire and Fury” adaptation could be the first major dramatic portrayal of the Trump White House. HBO had plans to develop a show from a book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the final days of the 2016 campaign, but that project was canceled after Mr. Halperin was accused of sexual misconduct. News about the rights to Mr. Wolff’s book being acquired was reported by The Hollywood Reporter, and was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Endeavor Content. Mr. Wolff was expected to be the executive producer of the project, and would be joined by the British television executive Michael Jackson. There is heated competition in television these days for major projects, and “Fire and Fury” will most likely attract a lot of interest. Since its publication less than two weeks ago, Mr. Wolff’s book has raised questions about Mr. Trump’s fitness for office, and helped lead to the banishment of the former chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon from the president’s circle of advisers. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/business/media/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-trump.html?searchResultPosition=71
"Despite President Trump’s reported call to reject immigrants from “shithole countries,” people from these countries actually have plenty to teach us. Let’s start with a quiz: Which country was the first in the world to ban government discrimination against gays in its constitution? A) Norway B) New Zealand C) South Africa Answer: It’s the so-called s-hole country, South Africa. It also bans discrimination based on gender and disability. Someday all the world will be so enlightened. Here are other examples we can learn from: 1. Sierra Leone’s president has committed the country to providing free health care for children under 5 and for pregnant women, including prenatal care and deliveries, although care still lags. Meanwhile, in America the issue doesn’t get such high-level attention, so American women die in childbirth at five times the rate of British women. 2. Kenya is way ahead of the U.S. in mobile money. It’s easy in Kenya to transfer money by cellphone and to use a phone as a bank account. Nearly everyone has a mobile phone, and 88 percent of Kenyan mobile phone users also have mobile money accounts. Kenyans don’t understand why Americans are so backward in telecommunications. 3. Rwanda may eliminate cervical cancer before America, for Rwanda vaccinates virtually all girls against the human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer. By also employing screenings for older women who were not vaccinated, it aims to eliminate cervical cancer by 2020. In contrast, only 65 percent of American girls get vaccinated for HPV, and a woman dies every two hours in the U.S. from cervical cancer.

"WASHINGTON — It was a made-for-TV moment, perfect for a presidential campaign advertisement. His fists clenched and his voice rising, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, delivered a 10-minute verbal thrashing to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen this week, recalling his “tears of rage” when he learned that President Trump had used vulgarities to describe African nations. Not to be outdone, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, who was seated next to Mr. Booker, also skewered Ms. Nielsen, suggesting that Americans could draw a “reasonable inference” that she is racist. The next presidential election is nearly three years away, but in the Capitol the race is already unfolding, with no fewer than six senators — Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — eyeing the Democratic nomination in 2020, with each angling to get to the left of the others. That is not making life easy for the 10 Democratic senators who must run for re-election this year in states carried by President Trump — so much so that one of them, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, lamented openly in a recent interview that her colleagues running for president were “all trying to find their base.” The fissure between 2018 and 2020 has been on display in the Capitol this week, as Washington barrels toward a possible government shutdown that can be averted only if lawmakers approve a stopgap spending measure by Friday. For that to happen, at least nine Democratic senators need to vote for it. Five of the six presidential hopefuls have long said they would not vote for any spending bill that does not include protection for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, who have been shielded from deportation by an Obama-era program that Mr. Trump rescinded.

"In April 2016, Donald Trump stood in front of supporters in Pittsburgh and declared he would bring the country’s steel jobs back. On Thursday, he returns to western Pennsylvania as a president yet to deliver on that promise. While America will never again see mills like those that dotted the river valleys of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia 50 years ago, President Trump now has a chance to help stabilize a reeling steel industry and revive some of the employment it once offered. The wheels are in motion. Three months into his presidency, Mr. Trump invoked a rarely used authority — Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president, after a review, to block imports that threaten national security — and promised decisive action in favor of the domestic steel industry by the end of June. The summer instead passed without progress on the prerequisite review from the Commerce Department. Finally, with a deadline looming, late last week the Commerce Department announced it had completed its investigation and sent recommendations to the White House. The administration must announce a decision based on the report’s findings within 90 days. With the report in hand, Mr. Trump has broad license to apply tariffs, quotas or both to steel imports. And he can do it safely: While there has been speculation about potential retaliation against the United States if it raises import restrictions, an exception in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permits them for security purposes. Mr. Trump should make use of his authority in this case. Even in this digital age, steel undergirds our military power, not to mention critical infrastructure. Tanks, aircraft carriers and the energy grid all rely on high-strength, lightweight steel. That steel has been made in America for generations.

"JERUSALEM — In the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza, Mahmoud Ferwana, 59, huddled beneath a flimsy nylon-and-sheet-metal roof while rain drenched the rest of his squalid home’s sandy floor. He earns money collecting broken stones; his children scavenge for copper. But none of it amounts to a living. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency is what reliably puts food in their mouths. If that aid were to stop, Mr. Ferwana said on Wednesday, “I and my children will die.” That aid, to Mr. Ferwana and more than five million other Palestinians living in refugee camps across the Middle East, is now endangered by what the agency’s leaders are calling the worst financial crisis in its seven-decade history. The United States, its biggest donor, announced this week that it was withholding $65 million from a scheduled payment of $120 million. The Trump administration said it was pressing for unspecified reforms from the agency, while also seeking to get Arab countries to contribute more. In response, the relief agency said on Wednesday that it would begin a fund-raising campaign to try to close the gap before it is forced to cut vital safety-net services. “We’re reaching out to official donors, obviously, but also to the Arab world, to untraditional donors in emerging markets and to individuals, in the hope that we can rapidly upscale the amounts they give to us,” said Chris Gunness, the agency’s chief spokesman.

"Two years ago, Merrill Garbus decided to learn how to D.J. The Oakland, Calif.-based indie-pop musician, known for her pan-global rhythmic loops and frank lyrics in Tune-Yards, had little experience behind turntables but she dived in headfirst, booking a Tuesday night residency at a bar near the studio where she records. “I hadn’t been in charge of an evening like that before,” said Ms. Garbus, 38. “What does the audience want to dance to? How do you know what they want before they say so? It taught me a lot.” You can hear the lessons of the dance floor in the music she and her bandmate, Nate Brenner, made for Tune-Yards’ fourth album, “I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,” due Jan. 19. A sleek, radical evolution from the clattering collages that first earned Tune-Yards an audience (notably on the 2011 album “Whokill,” which won that year’s Village Voice critics’ poll), the new LP is full of insistent beats, catchy hooks and pointed questions about modern society. “I ask myself, what should I do?/But all I know is white centrality,” Ms. Garbus sings on the bubbly single “ABC 123.” Amid preparations for a tour that begins in Sacramento on Feb. 15, she spoke with The New York Times from her home. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You participated in a six-month workshop on race at the East Bay Meditation Center while you were working on this album. What was the most surprising thing you learned there? The whole thing was surprising. We met twice a month, looking at Buddhist principles and our roles as white folks in the community, with readings and videos. A lot of it — learning about a concept like white fragility, for instance — was like, “Oh my God. There’s a word for this?” Instead of walking through the world with this huge amount of defensiveness, [thinking], “I will not be racist,” to say, “Merrill, you are racist, simply by being brought up white in this society. So how does that feel? And let’s move from there.” You’ve said that you felt “a wall of shame bubble up” when you recorded the line “I use my white woman’s voice to tell stories of travels with African men,” from your new song “Colonizer.” How has it felt to sing those words in concert? The first time, my heart jumped out of my chest. A lot of my feeling about growing up white in this country is about not knowing how to talk about whiteness. I think that’s part of how white supremacy works: There isn’t language for it. I’m finding the same thing with singing. What expression do I use when I’m singing those lines? Am I looking straight ahead? Am I looking down? These very subtle performance choices contextualize completely differently.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Less than 20 miles down the coast from where emergency workers in Montecito are searching for victims of last week’s mudslides is the tiny beach town of La Conchita, where grief and vigilance are permanently intertwined. With about 330 inhabitants, La Conchita offers a scale model of the delights of living in California — and of the risks: the fires, rising sea levels, mudslides and earthquakes. The beach is only steps away. Lemons and avocados grow willingly in the abundant sunshine. Yet residents live in fear of the loose soil above them. In 1995 part of the steep hillside behind the town collapsed, sending a river of mud into the streets and damaging a dozen houses. Engineers built a wall, sinking steel I-beams, the type you might use to build a skyscraper, deep into the ground. Ten years later, after heavy rainfall, the hillside gave way again. Mud surged down the slope and deflected off the wall meant to protect the town, according to Mike Bell, a board member of the La Conchita Community Organization, which serves as a de facto local government. Ten people were killed in that January 2005 mudslide. Their bodies were recovered but parts of their homes are still buried under a giant mound of soil, a monument to the town’s suffering and lingering fears. “Every day we think about what happened in 2005,” Mr. Bell said on Tuesday. “We know what Montecito is going through because we lived through exactly the same thing. It was a mud flow, it was rapid-moving, it buried people.” A number of articles have been published recently about people pondering the wisdom of living in California, fire-prone and seismically volatile as it is, not to mention bank-account-emptying expensive.

Do you miss the early seasons when some dude would show up with something he duct-taped together in his garage? No. I think the platform has evolved. It can take an idea and turn it into a real business, and it can also accelerate an existing business. You take a company, their story comes on “Shark Tank” and all of a sudden they become No. 1 in America, and their customer-acquisition cost is zero. Is any of the drama on the show manufactured? Is there a producer in your ear going “get in a beef with Mark Cuban right now”? You don’t need anybody to tell you to get into a beef with Cuban. That just happens. “Shark Tank” airs updates for its successful businesses, but viewers don’t hear about all the businesses that fail. Is there a danger in glamorizing entrepreneurship? No. Even in the updates you see how brutal people’s lives are. Entrepreneurship is a personal sacrifice for a long period of time. I never saw my kids grow up — they just went from zero to teenagers when I was traveling the world selling software, and yet today they enjoy certain freedoms that I could never have afforded had I not been successful.

"Early in January, an activist group called Resistance SF projected a sign onto Twitter headquarters in San Francisco that read: “@jack is #complicit.” @jack, of course, is Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and C.E.O., and “complicit” is what we call those seen as letting power get away with something bad. In this case, it was the way Twitter had enabled Donald Trump to troll the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un about the size of his “Nuclear Button,” causing cortisol levels to spike worldwide. Resistance SF was accusing Dorsey of abetting this kind of behavior by allowing the president an unmediated platform. Its condemnation was unequivocal, if rather anticlimactically structured: Dorsey “endangers the world,” it said, “and allows Trump to break his company’s own terms of service to do it.” The range of behaviors “complicit” encompasses is vast. Senator Chuck Schumer recently denounced Trump’s behavior on the world stage as “puerile” and accused Republicans who fail to speak out against him of “complicity in the degradation of the presidency,” but most people see no need to specify such details. It’s already understood that some unspeakable abuse or deception has been abetted or let slide, whether out of self-interest or self-preservation, ignorance or fear. “Complicit” came bounding back into the lexicon last year largely because of Trump, a figure whose rise to power was seen by many as so threatening to democratic institutions that they started to talk about “putting country before party” and “joining the resistance,” as if we all had suddenly been teleported into a Humphrey Bogart movie. The language harks back to World War II, when the citizens of occupied nations were sorted by their moral records — the heroes who fought with the resistance versus the Nazis’ “collaborators.” It also channeled the Cold War: In an op-ed in The Washington Post, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona invoked Joseph Welch, the chief counsel for the Army who famously confronted Joseph McCarthy, in denouncing fellow Republicans who defend President Trump. “Complicit” signaled a challenge to the ethos that all is fair in love and war and business and politics. “I have children and grandchildren to answer to,” Flake said in October, announcing his retirement (and thus his willingness to speak frankly). “I will not be complicit or silent.” A month later, an exposé on Harvey Weinstein in The New York Times described how he conscripted others to enable his abuse: “Harvey Weinstein built his complicity machine out of the witting, the unwitting and those in between.” What’s become clear is that there is a lot of “in between.” It takes a lot of fixers and enablers, a lot of toadies and apologists and attack dogs, to create an atmosphere in which people can mistreat others with impunity. That is precisely the kind of apparatus that is, lately, under sustained attack — not just the villain but anyone who can be said to have cleared the villain’s path. The broad brush of complicity can be used in an attempt to tar almost anyone — just ask any public figure unfortunate enough to have been photographed smiling next to Weinstein. It can even be used maliciously: Late last year, right-wing street artists placed posters around L.A. featuring an image of Weinstein with Meryl Streep, along with the words “She knew.” But the point is that complicity is systemic. It doesn’t just describe individual bad actors; it indicts the whole production. “Complicit” traces back to the French complice (a partner or associate), which derives from the Latin complex — which means “folded together,” as in the ingredients of a cake. It also means “complex.” There are so many ways to be complicit that you could make trading cards and never collect them all. You can be complicit through action or inaction, speech or silence, association or omission. You can engage in outright collusion, aiding in wrongdoing and lying your way through the cover-up. You can take advantage of an immoral situation to promote your book or your brand. But you can also feel coerced into complicity, intimidated or brainwashed. You can look the other way because you fear for your job or your reputation, or because you refuse to feel responsible for the systems around you.

"WASHINGTON — He may be fit to be president, but he could be in better shape. President Trump received a glowing and extremely public assessment on Tuesday from Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician, who stressed that the president’s health was basically excellent: “It’s called genetics,” the doctor said as he explained Mr. Trump’s physical and cognitive health to reporters. Mr. Trump’s four to five hours of sleep each night? Probably one of the reasons he has been successful, Dr. Jackson said. The president’s less than stellar diet? Actually pretty healthy lately — minus the desserts — Dr. Jackson said. An increase in the president’s weight coupled with a high-carb-high-fat diet and an apparent lack of interest in physical fitness were of particular interest to Mr. Trump’s doctor. Yet even on that point, Dr. Jackson had a positive, almost Trumpian-sounding prognosis: “The good part is that, you know, we can build on that pretty easily.” The next challenge for Dr. Jackson and members of the first family will be convincing Mr. Trump — a dedicated homebody, know-it-all and creature of habit — that a new fitness routine will be crucial to helping him shed a recommended 10 to 15 pounds this year. (Mr. Trump’s current weight, 239 pounds on a 6-foot-3 frame, lingers at the brink of obesity on the body mass index, Dr. Jackson acknowledged.) Mr. Trump will be encouraged to lower the fat and carbohydrate content of his diet, and will be encouraged by his wife, Melania Trump; his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump; and his doctor to get moving.

"The people who commute into and around New York City are experiencing a harsh reality: After seven years of rapid employment growth, the city is facing multiple, potentially crippling transit problems. Record numbers of commuters are squeezing on to crowded trains on antiquated rail networks faltering after decades of underinvestment, traveling through tunnels seriously damaged by Hurricane Sandy flooding in 2012. Instead of working with the region to fix the problem, in late December the Trump administration backpedaled on one of the big projects planned to address it, a new set of tunnels under the Hudson River. In response, officials and transportation agencies should consider going it alone and not waiting for federal funding. Here’s the background: The tunnels leading into Penn Station were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy and are believed to have only 10 to 15 years of useful life left. The Hudson Tunnel Project, the first phase of a larger plan called Gateway, would build two rail tunnels under the Hudson River and allow the reconstruction of the existing rail tunnels while maintaining service. It is co-sponsored by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. In the second phase of the Gateway plan, additional platforms would be built south of Penn Station near 31st Street, expanding the station’s capacity and easing congestion. Given the long lead time needed for a project of this magnitude, the railroads fear that, with no replacement, service could be severely disrupted in an emergency, damaging the entire Northeast Corridor economy. A recent estimate for the cost of the first phase of the project is about $12.7 billion. An understanding set up during the Obama administration called for costs to be split, with the federal government paying half and the states each contributing 25 percent. However, in a letter in December, a Federal Transit Administration official, K. Jane Williams, denied that such an understanding existed, and questioned the role of the federal government in financing a “local project where nine out of 10 passengers are local transit riders.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/opinion/trump-new-york-jersey-tunnels-penn-station.html?searchResultPosition=89
"WASHINGTON — Even as he is embroiled in an immigration policy debate that has focused on whether he used vulgar language to describe Haiti and African countries, President Trump is claiming that he is delivering for black Americans — and that they are repaying him with their support. In a Twitter post on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said that “unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded” and “Trump approval ratings with black Americans has doubled.” He appeared to credit the comments to a segment on “Fox & Friends,” the morning program on Fox News. The tweet — half misleading and half downright false — demonstrates how inaccurate information can trickle to the president’s social media, which is then is viewed by millions of people on Twitter and Facebook. “Believe it or not, through all this negative coverage, they did a survey of 600,000 people about how black America views this president. His numbers have actually doubled,” Brian Kilmeade, a “Fox & Friends” host, said during the segment that was broadcast Tuesday morning.

"Hundreds of immigrants hoping to escape violence in Yemen and join their families in the United States received an official notice last year from the State Department that started with a long-anticipated message: “Your visa is approved.” But those turned out to be just words. After the third version of the Trump administration’s travel ban took effect on Dec. 8, their approvals abruptly turned to rejections, in what lawyers, family members and immigration activists said was a display of bad faith. The rejections of Yemeni citizens, many of them women and children, seeking travel documents from the small United States Embassy in Djibouti, in East Africa, occurred even though the State Department had said it would not revoke any visas when carrying out the president’s proclamation imposing the new restrictions on immigration. Many of those rejected had been told by the embassy that their visas were approved as early as last July, after being interviewed by the State Department. The approval notices, on a half-size piece of paper in English and Arabic, also said: “We cannot guarantee how long it will take to print it and have your passport ready for pickup. You should check the status of your visa online.” Julie Goldberg, a lawyer in Djibouti, said hundreds of people had come to her doorstep since mid-December. She estimated that more than 300 Yemeni nationals had been rejected so far. “There’s no explanation for getting denied — everybody’s getting denied,” she said in a telephone interview from her home there, which serves as a legal clinic. “It’s complete hopelessness.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • It was one of the U.S. intelligence service’s worst failures in years: China dismantled American spying operations and killed or imprisoned more than a dozen C.I.A. informants since 2010. Now, an American is suspected of having helped Beijing by identifying informants. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, who left the C.I.A. in 2007, was apprehended at Kennedy Airport this week. Read the affidavit supporting charges against him. • Officials are concerned that the case could represent a pattern of Chinese intelligence targeting former agency employees. • Republicans hoping to stave off a government shutdown this weekend are pairing a stopgap spending measure with long-term funding for the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, effectively daring Democrats to vote no. The bill would not address the future of the so-called Dreamers, the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.

"Suppose that you were asked to assess the state of American society under Donald Trump, the essence of our problems and divisions, without any access to the president’s own words or the media coverage thereof. Suppose, instead, that you had to cobble together your assessment based only on the way the electorate and the culture has responded to his ascent and presidency — by looking at the changes wrought in our partisan landscape, the new sociological and political fissures that have opened, and the protests and mass movements, social trends and cultural expressions have defined his strange first year in office. I suspect this exercise might lead to the conclusion that both race and class, the two tangled areas that so many commentators — myself included — have written about endlessly for the last two years, are less important to our moment than the scale of the media attention paid to them suggests, and that divisions and anxieties around sex and gender are where the essential cultural action of the Trump era really lies. This possibility seems like a deliberate provocation in a week when Trump’s outburst about countries that resemble outhouses has made the president’s racism a headline topic for the umpteenth time. And I’m not denying the reality of that racism, which has been apparent since Trump embraced birtherism and which plainly informs his views on immigration more than the commitment to merit-based migration policy that his minders and managers have been trying to advance. But the same week that reminded us of Trump’s bigotry also brought a striking analysis of how Americans are reacting to his presidency, generated by a large and deep survey conducted by Survey Monkey and written up for The Atlantic by Ron Brownstein. To some extent the survey shows what smaller polls have also shown: Trump’s coalition depends on working-class whites, evangelicals and older white men; he’s opposed by minorities and women and the young; and he has lost ground just about everywhere since his election last November. But the way he’s lost ground is interesting. The press coverage often makes it seem as if Trump is using racial provocations to hold his white blue-collar base while assuming the minorities will never vote for him, and indeed I suspect that — to the extent his provocations have any cunning behind them — he may think about them in those terms. Yet racial polarization in the electorate hasn’t actually increased over the last year: Relative to where he stood last November, Trump has lost white support, including working-class-white support, while either holding his own or actually gaining ground with blacks and Hispanics. His lost support has been heavily concentrated among the female of the species: “From February through December,” writes Brownstein, “Trump’s approval rating fell more with middle-aged blue-collar white women than any other group.” Meanwhile among minorities he’s made gains or held his own by appealing primarily to men, while remaining extraordinarily unpopular with black and Hispanic women. “In every age group,” Brownstein notes, “and at every level of education, about twice as many African-American men as women gave Trump positive marks,” and “among Hispanic men older than 50, Trump’s approval — strikingly — exceeded 40 percent.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/opinion/trump-women-race.html?searchResultPosition=95
"The Times editorial board has been sharply critical of the Trump presidency, on grounds of policy and personal conduct. Not all readers have been persuaded. In the spirit of open debate, and in hopes of helping readers who agree with us better understand the views of those who don’t, we wanted to let Mr. Trump’s supporters make their best case for him as the first year of his presidency approaches its close. We have also published some letters from readers who voted for Mr. Trump but are now disillusioned, and from those reacting to these letters and our decision to provide Trump voters this platform. To the Editor: Donald Trump has succeeded where Barack Obama failed. The economy is up, foreign tyrants are afraid, ISIS has lost most of its territory, our embassy will be moved to Jerusalem and tax reform is accomplished.

Yes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated ISIS in Iraq, has named a number of solid conservative judges, has prioritized American citizens over illegal immigrants, has gotten us out of several bad international agreements, has removed a number of wasteful regulations, is putting real pressure on North Korea and Iran, has reined in a number of out-of-control agencies, and so on and so on. I loved George W. Bush, but he failed on policy over and over again. If it takes putting up with Mr. Trump’s brash ways to see things get done, that is a deal I’m willing to accept.

"Two reports this week offered more details about what they described as a sexual relationship between Donald J. Trump and Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film actress who was reportedly paid $130,000 in hush money shortly before the 2016 election. In Touch magazine published excerpts on Wednesday from its 2011 interview with Ms. Clifford, 38, known as Stormy Daniels. In them, she said she had had an affair with Mr. Trump that started in 2006 and continued on and off for a few years. A Slate article published on Tuesday by Jacob Weisberg, editor in chief of the Slate Group, expanded on what he told The New York Times on Friday. Slate detailed his communications with Ms. Clifford from August to October 2016. Her account is similar to that published by In Touch. Ms. Clifford told Mr. Weisberg that her lawyer Keith Davidson, who has represented a number of pornographic-film stars and models, had negotiated the $130,000 deal with Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s lawyer. Mr. Weisberg said that she was sharing these details because Mr. Trump had not yet paid her or finalized the confidentiality agreement. The Wall Street Journal published an article on Friday reporting that the payment had been made. Mr. Davidson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Mr. Cohen again denied that there had been any sexual relationship between Mr. Trump and Ms. Clifford. In an emailed statement on Wednesday, he said: “This is not breaking news.

"SEOUL, South Korea — North and South Korea reached an agreement Wednesday for their athletes to march together under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month, a powerful gesture of reconciliation that further complicates President Trump’s strategy for dealing with the nuclear-armed regime of Kim Jong-un. South Korea, the host of the games, said it hoped a partnership in sports could contribute to a political thaw after years of high tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It came even as the prospect of war over the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests has loomed large. For the White House, however, the budding détente scrambles its strategy of pressuring the North, with sanctions and threats of military action, to give up its nuclear arsenal. This latest gesture of unity, the most dramatic in a decade, could add to fears in Washington that Pyongyang is making progress on a more far-reaching agenda. White House officials warn that the ultimate goal of Mr. Kim is to evict American troops from the Korean Peninsula and to reunify the two Koreas under a single flag. They have cited that long-held goal to buttress their argument that Mr. Kim cannot be deterred peacefully as the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. While a onetime Olympics ceremony is hardly a step toward reunification, the image of athletes marching behind a “unified Korea” flag is a symbolic manifestation of what worries Mr. Trump’s aides. And the prospect of crowds from North and South Korea cheering together would be a striking contrast to the threats of war from Mr. Trump. The White House this week welcomed the announcement but played down its significance, noting that it was not the first time that athletes from the two Koreas had competed together.

"People correctly direct their ire about Donald Trump’s hostile, racist, anti-immigrant policies at Trump himself because, after all, this starts at the top. But there is someone else in the administration, behind the scenes and in the shadows, who deserves more scrutiny and more condemnation for this administration’s approach to immigration: Chief of Staff John Kelly. Kelly is often referred to as the man who was brought to the West Wing to impose must-needed discipline on a chaotic White House. He was the access granter and mood regulator for Trump. He was the adult to Trump’s child. He was the former general who had honorably served his country, now brought in to save it. In the most recent kerfuffle over Trump’s torpedoing of a bipartisan DACA deal, in which he made a racist attack against immigrants from African countries and Haiti, it became increasingly clear that Kelly was instrumental in influencing Trump to flip from a stance of openness and compromise back to a celestial alignment with immigration hard-liners. As The Associated Press reported this week, after Trump requested a briefing on a bipartisan immigration deal sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham, a Republican, and Dick Durbin, a Democrat: “Chief of staff John Kelly phoned Trump from Capitol Hill to advise him against accepting the proposal, and the president summoned conservative Republican negotiators to help build a united front against the plan, which would have provided some border security funding as well as protection from deportation for immigrants brought to the country as children and now here illegally.” Graham was not happy about the ambush or the reversal and pointed out who he believed to be the source of the problem, telling reporters, “I think somebody on his staff gave him really bad advice between 10 o’clock to 12 o’clock on Thursday.” Graham went on to say that Kelly is “a fine man, but he’s part of the staff.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/opinion/john-kelly-deportation-ice.html?searchResultPosition=61

New York, along with the rest of the country, is seeing an uptick in cases of the flu this winter. “Every year, it’s a big problem,” Dr. Salvatore said, “but this year one of the reasons people are getting worried is because the strain circulating is one of the H3N2 family, a virus that compared to the H1N1 is known to be more severe and less responsive to the vaccine.” “It’s too late to get the vaccine.” False. “The flu season can last through April,” Dr. Miao said, “so we are still encouraging people to get it.” Keep in mind it takes about two weeks to become immunized so sooner, better.

"As a psychiatrist for the United States Air Force, one of my responsibilities was evaluating the mental stability of airmen who handled nuclear weapons, using the standards laid out in what is called the Nuclear Personnel Reliability Program. There is no need to justify why our military would take every precaution necessary to ensure that the men and women in uniform handling nuclear weapons were fit to do so, whether they were in charge of a missile silo or loading nuclear bombs onto aircraft — or giving the orders to them, on up the chain of command. Strangely, the commander-in-chief, the one who would decide when and how to use those weapons, is the only individual in the chain who is not subject to the ongoing certification under the program. According to the program, or P.R.P., personnel who handle nuclear weapons are held to higher standards of physical and mental readiness than other personnel, and rightfully so. The Department of Defense Directive 5210.42 states: “Only those personnel who have demonstrated the highest degree of individual reliability for allegiance, trustworthiness, conduct, behavior, and responsibility shall be allowed to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons, and they shall be continuously evaluated for adherence to P.R.P. standards.” On Tuesday the White House physician, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, gave the president a clean bill of health. And no doubt, by many standards, Mr. Trump is in decent shape. But the standards for a person’s physical and mental health are a different matter from his fitness to oversee our nuclear arsenal. What if President Trump were, instead, Airman Trump, and was to be assessed under the program’s guidelines; would I certify him as “P.R.P. ready” to work in the vicinity of nuclear weapons? I have not had the opportunity to examine the president personally, but warning signs abound. What if I had reliable outside information that Airman Trump displayed erratic emotions? That I saw very clearly that he was engaging in cyberbullying on Twitter? That he had repeatedly made untruthful or highly distorted statements? That his language implied he engaged in sexually abusive behavior? That he appeared paranoid about being surveilled or persecuted by others, that he frequently disregarded or violated the rights of others? These are the sorts of things that set off alarms for Air Force psychiatrists. I certainly could not certify him as “P.R.P. ready” without more extensive psychological evaluation.

"AMHERST, Mass. — Evangelical churches today can be found in almost every neighborhood in Latin America — and they are transforming politics like no other force. They are giving conservative causes, and especially political parties, new strength and new constituencies. In Latin America, Christianity used to be associated with Roman Catholicism. The church held a near monopoly on religion until the 1980s. The only challenge to Catholicism was anticlericalism and atheism. There has never been another religion. Until now. Evangelicals today account for almost 20 percent of the population in Latin America, up from 3 percent three decades ago. In a few Central American countries, evangelicals are near majorities. Evangelical pastors embrace varied ideologies, but when it comes to gender and sexuality, their values are typically conservative, patriarchal and homophobic. They expect women to be completely submissive to their evangelical husbands. And in every country in the region, they have taken the strongest stands against gay rights. The rise of evangelicalism is politically worrisome. Evangelicals are fueling a new form of populism. They are supplying conservative parties with nonelite voters, which is good for democracy, but these voters tend to be intransigent on issues of sexuality, which feeds cultural polarization. Intolerant inclusion, which is the classic Latin American populist formula, is being reinvented by evangelical pastors. Brazil is a prime example of the rising evangelical power in Latin America. The 90 or so evangelical members of Congress have thwarted L.G.B.T.-oriented legislative actions, played a role in impeaching the leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, and shut down museum shows. An evangelical pastor has been elected mayor of Rio de Janeiro, one of the world’s most gay-friendly cities. So grand are their successes that evangelical pastors elsewhere say they want to imitate “the Brazilian model.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/opinion/evangelicals-politics-latin-america.html?searchResultPosition=94
"WASHINGTON — Republicans are scrambling to save a heavily conservative House seat in western Pennsylvania, dispatching President Trump to the district on Thursday while preparing a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign to stave off another embarrassing special election defeat in a district that was gerrymandered to stay Republican. When Representative Tim Murphy was pushed out of the House last year after the revelation that he encouraged a mistress to have an abortion, Republican leaders gave scant thought to his successor. The odd-shaped district in the southwestern corner of the state was drawn to skirt Democratic Pittsburgh and concentrate conservative-leaning, steel and coal country voters. But since then, Democratic enthusiasm has surged, especially after the improbable Senate victory of Doug Jones last month in Alabama, and Republicans continue to lose lower-profile special elections in friendly districts — the latest in a Wisconsin State Senate race on Tuesday. That has raised alarms in the White House and among Republican leaders anxiously eyeing the House special election on March 13. Holding just a 24-seat majority, with retirements of veteran lawmakers piling up, House Republicans can scarcely allow Democrats to snatch a seat they have not even competed for in recent elections. And Mr. Trump is loath to suffer another electoral humiliation, particularly in a district that he carried by 19 percentage points in 2016. So a constellation of conservative groups are planning an extensive intervention to carry the Republican nominee, Rick Saccone, a state representative and former Air Force officer, across the line in a House seat that has been in the party’s hands for 16 years, but where internal polls from both parties now reveal a single-digit race.

"Donald Trump has passed his mental test. This may come as either a relief or a shock. The results of the president’s physical exam came out this week. This is normally not a big deal — when Obama and Bush got their reports, it was barely a yawn. But on Tuesday White House physician Ronny Jackson had to answer questions from the media for almost an hour. There was a little curiosity about how anybody who eats so many cheeseburgers could be in good health. (“Genes.”) Skeptics pointed out that the report’s enthusiastic descriptions of the president’s tiptop condition seemed inconsistent with some of the statistics on his weight, cholesterol and plaque buildup in the arteries. If the doctor had simply said “good for an overweight 71-year-old guy,” everybody probably could have nodded and moved forward. But the big news was the mental test. Trump took something called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and got a perfect score. Not perhaps the highest bar possible, unless you were concerned about whether he can identify pictures of animals and draw hands on a clock. But the test can be useful if there is, for some reason, concern that the subject is suffering from … um, dementia. Jackson told reporters that he has talked with Trump many times over the past year and found him “very sharp.” This is hardly surprising. When the doctor has a conversation with the president, the subject is probably always Donald Trump, a topic upon which our current chief executive is always able to focus like a laser. “Amazing report, cognitive & otherwise,” cheered Donald Trump Jr. Have we ever before had a First Child rallying the troops around the president passing a mental test? We will refrain from saying anything mean about Junior because, after all, he was the one who grew up in a home where he broke his leg due to an inattentive babysitter and found his nanny dying in the basement.

"To the Editor: Re “Trump Voters, One Year In” (letters, Jan. 18): As one who does think of President Trump’s supporters as among the “deplorables” — people who are racist and xenophobic, people who fear the world, people who blame others for all their challenges and woes, people who hate the very idea of government as a force for good — I was fascinated to read the letters from Trump voters. I thought it was a wise and striking decision on The Times’s part to run them in its own editorial board’s space. Indeed, that’s the space they deserved to maximize their impact. Thanks to these letters, I do have a better understanding now of what these writers see happening under Mr. Trump: an end to pussyfooted, mealy-mouthed weakness and to regulatory overreach; a return to forcefulness and certainty on the world stage and unleashed optimism at home. But then I stop and think about what it is they’re really so happy about: reckless threats and pointless insults passing for diplomacy; a rejection of fact, science and even the notions of decency, humanity and justice; a litany of lies and myths as the foundation of policy; and historic levels of incompetence and self-dealing across the agencies of government from the White House on down. Mr. Trump’s more educated supporters don’t seem to see the primordial muck on which everything Trumpian is based. PETER BOODY, SAG HARBOR, N.Y. The writer is a former newspaper editor. To the Editor: How depressing. These Trump supporters have had a year to assess a man who has spent his presidency — when he isn’t reclining in bed watching cable TV while wolfing down cheeseburgers and tweeting mean nicknames — lying, bullying and obstructing to cover up possible crimes against our democracy. Despite this, they’ve yet to wise up. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/opinion/trump-voters.html?searchResultPosition=21
"Members of Utah’s congressional caucus, not content with eviscerating two national monuments in the state, have unleashed a new assault on public lands, proposing legislation that hides an agenda of deregulation behind the shield of the National Park Service and the beloved park system it oversees. On Dec. 6, two days after President Trump radically reduced the size of the Grand Staircase Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments by some two million acres, the largest reversion of federal land protections in the nation’s history, Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah, introduced legislation to establish the Escalante Canyons National Park and Preserve. On its face, the bill might seem like something for advocates of preserving iconic Western landscapes to embrace in the face of Mr. Trump’s rollback. The new park would incorporate a small portion of the original 1.9-million-acre Grand Staircase area that the president’s proclamation fractured. The other three members of the state’s House delegation, all Republicans, signed on as co-sponsors. But a reading of the bill, H.R. 4558, reveals it as a Trojan horse, appearing as a gift to the public while eroding federal environmental protections on public lands. If it becomes law, the bill could set a precedent with enormous consequences nationally, all of them bad for the national parks and the park service, which celebrates its 102nd birthday this August. It is, in fact, a model for the piecemeal unraveling of the more than 400 national parks, monuments, battlefields, historic sites, recreation areas and other places in the park system. Start with the proposed management hierarchy. The park would be run under the flag of the park service, but control would be vested in a “management council” that would be unlike any other bureaucracy overseeing any national park today. The council would consist of two presidential appointees, one from the Interior Department and the other, an at-large representative, along with four Utah county commissioners, two each from the two counties within which the park would be located, and one Utah state representative.

"A year into the Trump administration, Americans have a pretty good idea what the president has been watching on TV during his time in office, largely thanks to his active Twitter feed. But if you look closely, Twitter gives us a sense of what President Trump may be reading as well. Indeed, here are the books that seem to have sat on the White House nightstand this year. Forty-two days after taking office, Trump wrote his first book-related tweet as president. In a 4.a.m. comment on March 3, he announced that “Green Card Warrior: My Quest for Legal Immigration in an Illegals’ System,” a book by Nick Adams, a conservative commentator from Australia seeking permanent-resident status in the United States, was a “must read.” Forty-five days later at 5:13 in the morning, he called “Reasons to Vote for Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide,” by Michael J. Knowles, an American actor and conservative columnist, “a great book for your reading enjoyment.” The book consists entirely of blank pages. In August, his Twitter followers were treated to a presidential rave about David Clarke Jr.’s “Cop Under Fire: Moving Beyond Hashtags of Race, Crime and Politics for a Better America.” “Highly recommended!” Trump declared. (That endorsement came four days before the Milwaukee Country sheriff, a Trump backer, resigned.) At the beginning of October, during the year’s busiest literary season, there was a tweet about Daily Caller News Foundation editor in chief, Christopher Bedford’s “The Art of the Donald: Lessons From America’s Philosopher-in-Chief.” Trump’s review? “Really good!” And a few weeks later, the president pronounced Southern Baptist pastor, Robert Jeffress, “a wonderful man,” whose book, “A Place Called Heaven: 10 Surprising Truths About Your Eternal Home,” was “great.” In November, Democratic political strategist Donna Brazile’s “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House” was on the president’s mind. He said the “real story on Collusion” during the 2016 presidential race was in this book. On Dec. 7, he encouraged his followers to go get “Andrew Jackson and the Miracle of New Orleans,” by Brian Kilmeade, of Fox News, and journalist, Don Yaeger, a book he described as “really good.” Finally, the book that seemed to merit the most attention from Trump, with a series of tweets, was the current best-seller, journalist Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury. The president called Wolff a “total loser” and described the book as “really boring and untruthful.” Clearly the “Trump bump” has an effect on book sales as well.

"WASHINGTON — Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had gathered last spring to consider a resolution calling on the university to divest in companies and countries that abuse human rights, profit from the “military-industrial complex” and promote fossil fuels when the debate jumped the rails. Soon, the students were in a full-scale battle over whether the resolution should cover Israel, with charges of anti-Semitism and racism rattling the room. A student representative who was Jewish said that the last-minute inclusion of Israel “crossed the line from legitimate conversation to a point where I consider it malicious.” The student government chairwoman, who is black, suggested the opposition to the resolution amounted to “white supremacy,” which she condemned with a four-letter expletive. In the aftermath, Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, decided to enter the fray, writing to university administrators to denounce calls for divestment from Israel as anti-Semitic, and to assail the meeting as hostile toward Jewish students. He urged that the black student leader be disciplined. On Thursday, Mr. Marcus received the approval of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to be President Trump’s assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department, a prestigious post known more for policing racial bias and sexual violence in schools than refereeing the battles over Israel and Palestinian rights on the nation’s university campuses. Mr. Marcus’s support for Jewish students has earned him praise in some quarters as an ardent defender of civil liberties with an acumen for the rule of law. On campus after campus, the B.D.S. movement — Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel — has driven a wedge between Jewish students and students of color, challenging university administrations and straining the traditional bonds between Jews and other minorities. And Mr. Marcus has not been shy in choosing sides. Critics see him as a biased crusader whose singular focus on what he believes to be rising anti-Semitism on the campus left will further impede the Education Department’s already tentative efforts to enforce civil rights protections for marginalized groups of students.

"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s acting director, Mick Mulvaney, intensified his efforts this week to curb an agency he has denounced as a regulator run amok. His latest tactic: starve it of cash. The consumer bureau is funded directly by the Federal Reserve and sends the central bank a request each quarter for money for its operations. On Wednesday, Mr. Mulvaney sent a letter requesting $0 for the current quarter, which runs through March. The bureau has been sitting on a $177.1 million reserve fund, Mr. Mulvaney said in his letter. He plans to use that to cover the bureau’s projected quarterly expenses of $145 million. “I see no practical reason for such a large reserve,” Mr. Mulvaney wrote. “It is my intent to spend down the reserve until it is of a much smaller size.” The move is largely symbolic — the bureau has enough of a cash cushion to continue its usual operations for the rest of the quarter. It follows other recent moves by Mr. Mulvaney to spotlight the Trump administration’s desire to shift the consumer bureau’s trajectory. On Tuesday, Mr. Mulvaney announced that the agency would reconsider a rule it adopted last year that would tightly limit short-term payday loans. But unwinding or significantly altering the rule, which took the bureau five years to develop, requires a lengthy administrative process, which the bureau has not yet formally begun.

"In contrast to letters from Trump voters that we ran earlier, now we hear from two readers disappointed that their hopes didn’t pan out. To the Editor: I voted for Donald Trump, and I regret it. I thought he would change his divisive rhetoric from the campaign trail and never imagined he would divide this country with lies and racism, bigotry and hate. I see a man working to destroy democracy with the help of Vladimir Putin by using disinformation to frustrate and confuse everyone as they weaken America’s standing in the world. I fear for my children’s future and see a president and his family profiting off the office just as in authoritarian countries, with zero pushback from the Republican Party. Democracy will die if they continue. SYDNEY COHAN, WESTWOOD, N.J. To the Editor: Admittedly, my vote for Donald Trump was less for him than it was against his opponent. However, when he won I felt he was in a unique situation to unite the country by showing what an outsider could accomplish if given the chance. I now feel that he’s squandered it.

Here’s what you need to know: • North and South Korea’s sudden solidarity over the Winter Olympics has complicated the longstanding White House strategy of pressuring the North with sanctions and threats of military action. And it comes as the world’s confidence in America’s leadership has hit a new low. Just 30 percent of people interviewed in 134 countries last year approved of U.S. leadership, a drop of nearly 20 percentage points since President Obama’s final year. The U.S. is now behind China, and barely ahead of Russia. The survey concluded that Mr. Trump’s foreign policy and his words “have sowed doubt about the U.S. commitment to its partners abroad.” Above, President Moon Jae-in with the South Korean ice hockey teams. _____ • President Trump upset a Republican plan to keep the government open past Friday when he said an extension of the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program should not be part of a stopgap spending bill.

"In the eight years since its publication, “The New Jim Crow,” a book by Michelle Alexander that explores the phenomenon of mass incarceration, has sold well over a million copies, been compared to the work of W.E.B. Du Bois, been cited in the legal decisions to end stop-and-frisk and sentencing laws, and been quoted passionately on stage at the Academy Awards. But for the more than 130,000 adults in prison in North Carolina and Florida, the book is strictly off-limits. And prisoners around the country often have trouble obtaining copies of the book, which points to the vast racial disparities in sentencing policy, and the way that mass incarceration has ravaged the African-American population. This month, after protests, New Jersey revoked a ban some of its prisons had placed on the book, while New York quickly scrapped a program that would have limited its inmates’ ability to receive books at all. Ms. Alexander, a civil rights lawyer and former clerk on the Supreme Court, said the barriers to reading the book are no accident. “Some prison officials are determined to keep the people they lock in cages as ignorant as possible about the racial, social and political forces that have made the United States the most punitive nation on earth,” she said. “Perhaps they worry the truth might actually set the captives free.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/new-jim-crow-book-ban-prison.html?searchResultPosition=29
"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday voted to extend by six years a law that authorizes the National Security Agency’s warrantless surveillance program, essentially ending a cycle of debate over wiretapping and privacy that began with the leaks in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden, a former intelligence contractor. The vote, 65 to 34, approved sending to President Trump a bill to keep through 2023 an activity that traces back to a once-secret program created by the George W. Bush administration following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Congress first legalized it in 2008 by enacting a law called Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. Under Section 702, the government, without a warrant, may collect from American companies, like AT&T and Google, the emails, texts, phone calls and other private messages of foreigners abroad — even when those targets communicate with Americans. Congress last extended that law without changes in 2012. But after Mr. Snowden’s leaks in 2013, a bipartisan coalition of civil-liberties-minded lawmakers pushed to impose far more sweeping warrant requirements on queries for Americans’ information that was swept in by government surveillance. With Thursday’s final vote, that effort failed. Complicating matters, the bill does impose a limited new warrant requirement for F.B.I. agents to read any emails of an American who is already the subject of an open criminal investigation. But that requirement is so narrowly written that it would not apply to the overwhelming majority of such searches, including national-security investigations and assessments of criminal tips before an investigation is opened. The House approved the bill last week after voting down an amendment that would have imposed a far more sweeping warrant requirement. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, then used a procedural maneuver to prevent similar amendments that proposed reform from being put to a vote in the Senate. The Senate approved Mr. McConnell’s move on Tuesday, clearing the path for the bill’s final passage on Thursday. In the House, 55 Democrats had joined 178 Republicans in rejecting the reform amendment. In the Senate, 19 members of the Democratic caucus joined 41 Republicans in approving Mr. McConnell’s move. “We need our armed forces and intelligence community to protect us, and they need us to give them the tools to do it,” Mr. McConnell said on Thursday. But Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said passing the bill without amendments was “a dereliction of duty by a Congress that has a responsibility to protect Americans’ freedoms, as well as our country’s security.” He vowed to keep fighting “to protect Americans from unnecessary government spying.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics/surveillance-congress-snowden-privacy.html?searchResultPosition=22

"Among our recommended works of fiction this week is Ali Smith’s “Winter,” an “insubordinate folk tale” that continues her projected quartet tied to the seasons. Two classic novels, Nella Larsen’s “Passing” (1929) and George S. Schuyler’s “Black No More” (1931), have been reissued in time for Black History Month. Ruby Namdar’s “The Ruined House” is an intense novel about Jewish life that won Israel’s most lucrative literary award. And Laszlo Krasznahorkai’s “The World Goes On” is full of the sprawling sentences for which the Hungarian writer has become known. In nonfiction, a wide array of subjects: threats to democracy, ancient crafts, strategy during the Vietnam War, Ezra Pound in confinement and the Nobel Prize winner J. M. Coetzee’s literary criticism. John Williams
Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer WINTER, by Ali Smith. (Pantheon, $25.95.) The second novel in Smith’s projected seasonal cycle is an insubordinate folk tale, with echoes of the fiction of Iris Murdoch and Angela Carter. In it, four characters gather in a big rambling house and have at each other. Our critic Dwight Garner says that the book’s elastic structure, like that of the previous novel, “Autumn,” “allows Smith the freedom to write as if improvising a bedtime story. The combination of dreaminess and acuity is what gives these books their tang.” PASSING, by Nella Larsen. (Penguin Classics, $14.) BLACK NO MORE, by George S. Schuyler. (Penguin Classics, $16.) Racial passing is the central concern of both of these influential, if woefully under-read, American classics, which have been reissued in handsome new editions in time for Black History Month. “For their wildly differing approaches, the novels are both curious about what it means to feel, as well as be, truly free, and how freedom and safety might be at odds,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “They are derisive about fantasies of racial purity, black or white. They are unsparing on the madness of racial classification but frank, and very beautiful, on the lure of racial belonging.” HOW DEMOCRACIES DIE, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. (Crown, $26.) In this “lucid and essential” guide, two political scientists write about the norms that have sustained American democracy, and argue that President Trump has tried to eviscerate more than one of those norms. Our critic Jennifer Szalai, summarizing the book’s circumspect conclusion, writes: “There is no democratic paradise, no easy way out. Democracy, when it functions properly, is hard, grinding work. This message may not be as loud and as lurid as what passes for politics these days, but it might be the one we need to hear.” CRAEFT: An Inquiry Into the Origins and True Meaning of Traditional Crafts, by Alexander Langlands. (Norton, $26.95.) Langlands is a sort of method archaeologist, unearthing the various ways that humans used their hands for thousands of years and taking it upon himself to do things like cutting hay, building a drystone wall and making a skep for beekeeping. Our reviewer Michael Bierut writes: “Langlands, surprisingly unsentimental for someone who made his fame doing historical re-enactments, resists the pull of nostalgia. Yet he makes a persuasive case that the surrender of our lives to machines represents a regression.” THE RUINED HOUSE, by Ruby Namdar. (Harper, $29.99.) An award-winning novelist in Hebrew, Namdar likes to infuse the ancient and biblical into our contemporary world, creating a story that brims with blood and incense. Our reviewer Josh Lambert says “The Ruined House” is “a masterpiece of modern religious literature, exactly as deep, disturbing and unresolved as is necessary to remind us, habituated as we are to the shallows of contemporary Jewish life, what still lurks beneath — primitive, raw and exacting.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/books/review/10-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html?searchResultPosition=19

But then I thought, ‘Forget it, I didn’t leak to him,’” Ms. Coulter said, but using a different F-word.

"KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — The two ships met in daylight in the middle of the East China Sea. One was an 11,253-ton oil tanker, the Lighthouse Winmore, supposedly heading to Taiwan. The other, an aging freighter, was emblazoned with the red, white and blue flag of North Korea. In an illicit high-seas exchange captured in photographs taken by an American spy plane, the Lighthouse Winmore offloaded what officials later said was 600 tons of oil to the North Korean vessel in violation of United Nations sanctions. With those sanctions constricting its trade, including the import of refined petroleum, North Korea has increasingly turned to illegal clandestine shipments to acquire the fuel it needs, according to diplomatic officials and documents obtained by The New York Times. Trafficking on the high seas has become what these officials regard as a pernicious subversion of the sanctions. Though the frequency of smuggling is difficult to estimate, they fear it is undermining efforts to thwart the nuclear weapons ambitions of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, through economic pressure. The trafficking has also strained relations between the United States and North Korea’s two largest trading partners, China and Russia. Last month, the United States tried to persuade other members of the United Nations Security Council to blacklist 10 ships that it said were involved in smuggling oil and coal. In addition to the Lighthouse Winmore, this list, obtained by The New York Times, included four North Korean-flagged vessels, as well as ships linked to South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.

"LONDON — Well, it’s official. He isn’t crazy. “I’ve found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the rear admiral who conducted President Trump’s physical, said this week. That comes as no surprise to me. Because if you observe him through the filter of class, rather than the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders frame, you can reach some very different — and I think more apposite — conclusions. Donald Trump is a man of his class — the nouveau-riche, country-club class. Louder and more obnoxious, certainly, but of that class. It’s a class I know well. My father was a prominent physician, and I grew up in comfortable circumstances at the Jewish end of Philadelphia’s Main Line. My friends’ parents ran midsize family businesses; had seats on the stock exchange; were lawyers and doctors, senior corporate executives and entrepreneurs who rode the postwar economic boom to wealth. We were a very specific class in America’s allegedly classless society. In high school, I got to know people who were several classes above us — living on the remains of Gilded Age fortunes. One way social sorting among the various classes took place was via country clubs. The Jews had their country clubs, the Catholics had theirs, and the fallen-on-hard-times WASPs had theirs, whose thresholds we Jews were not allowed to cross. This confession is my way of establishing bona fides for what I am about to tell you: What Mr. Trump said about certain African countries and about immigrants from Haiti is exactly what you might hear at any country club: in the locker room, or at the 19th-hole bar, or around a big family table with friends and their kids having the Sunday all-you-can-eat buffet.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is facing a significant change in leadership that goes beyond the installation of a new chairman. It is also awaiting the appointment of two other top officials who will play a crucial role in shaping Fed policy. President Trump, who has already nominated Jerome H. Powell as the Fed’s next chairman, also gets to pick a new vice chairman. But the other open position, the presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is not Mr. Trump’s choice to make. The New York Fed chooses its own president, a position that is often described as the second-most powerful at the Fed. The regional bank is responsible for implementing the Fed’s monetary policy decisions — raising or lowering interest rates through the purchase and sale of financial assets — and it oversees many of the nation’s largest financial institutions. Some of Mr. Trump’s political opponents see an opportunity to fill that opening with a counterweight to the president’s economic agenda. “The appointment of the next New York Fed president is the most powerful appointment in America that Donald Trump doesn’t control,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which lobbies in favor of strong regulation. “Our job is making sure everyone knows the stakes of this appointment, and making sure their interests as working people are protected.” It is unusual for the Fed’s top three jobs to change hands at the same time. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, plans to step down at the end of her term in early February, pending the confirmation of Mr. Powell. The Senate Banking Committee, which approved his nomination last session, did so again on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote.

"ALBANY — It read like a maddening instruction manual for a do-it-yourself piece of furniture, with page after page of bare-bones guidance — and plenty of room for confusion. If taxpayers and lawmakers were expecting that a new 37-page report would provide a definitive road map of how New York State might sidestep the effects of President Trump’s new federal tax plan and its sharp reduction in the deductibility of state and local taxes, they instead got a view of just how complicated this is. The report, released this week, laid out at least a half-dozen ways New York could rewrite its tax code, with no indication of which option legislators might pursue. There was a potpourri of progressive rates, wage credits and tax-withholding schemes, with officials cautioning that all the options would require further study. No bills have been drafted. The possibilities included completely replacing the state income tax with an employer-side payroll tax; introducing a new progressive payroll tax in addition to the existing income tax, with tax credits to make up the difference; or designing a payroll tax only for wage earners above a certain income threshold — the taxpayers most likely to be hurt by the federal tax plan in the first place. Some versions would be mandatory. Others would be opt-in. More than anything, the report illustrated how difficult it may be to turn academic theory into real policy, serving as a cautionary guide to other states contemplating similar options. And it underscored the political challenges that lie ahead for Gov. Andrew M.

"MIAMI — When Jacques Despinosse lost a primary for the Florida House of Representatives in the 1990s, he chalked up his drubbing to the skepticism many voters had for candidates from what was then a relatively small Haitian diaspora. But since then, Haitian-American politicians have made one electoral stride after another in the state, winning commission seats in the counties encompassing greater Miami, representation in the Legislature, the mayoralty of the city of North Miami and coveted judgeships. Mr. Despinosse, 72, now a local eminence in Democratic politics, eventually won a seat on North Miami’s city council and served two terms. So after President Trump was reported describing Haiti and unspecified African countries as “shitholes,” Mr. Despinosse couldn’t help but smile a little. “Trump’s racism is a rallying cry for us Haitians,” said Mr. Despinosse, who focuses on persuading Haitian immigrants to obtain United States citizenship and vote. “He’s sorely mistaken if he thinks he’s toying with some uneducated refugees.” Mr. Trump’s comments may have horrified many Americans, but for Haitians in South Florida, they were yet another reminder of the stigma they have faced since they began arriving decades ago in large numbers. They have had to refute claims that they are carriers of disease, struggle to find their footing in a society where Latinos have long been ascendant, and face ostracism from some of their African-American neighbors. Still, the presidential insult is also serving among Haitians here as a reminder of their capacity to overcome such hurdles. And their Democratic-leaning leaders are now vowing to use the episode to bolster citizenship drives and turnout in a state where the outcome of presidential elections can turn on a handful of votes.

"On Monday, Mathilde Krim died. She was a biologist who spoke five languages; who contributed, in her 20s and 30s, to more than a dozen papers on cancer and virology; ran the interferon lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering; served on a team that developed a method for determining sex in utero; smuggled guns to opponents of British rule in Palestine; threw John F. Kennedy’s 45th-birthday party at her East Side townhouse; married twice, had a daughter and later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her historic work in AIDS research and advocacy. At the news of her death, the internet paid relatively little attention. Instead, by the next morning, the leading conversation among women whose voices are prominent on social media revolved around the story of a young photographer who had a demoralizing sexual encounter with Aziz Ansari, after going out for lobster rolls with him a few months ago. The woman, who used the alias “Grace,” recalled the events of the evening, which began with drinks at Mr. Ansari’s downtown apartment and ended with recycled jokes and Uber and sorrow, to a writer for an online publication, Babe. We are meant to infer that the comedian’s self-regarding erotic misbehavior began the moment he gave his guest a glass of white wine when she wanted red — there’s no place for speculating that maybe he just ran out of Syrah. Grace came to view what happened as assault, even if the facts she presents do not warrant the charge. Mr. Ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual. He continued, he said, to support the essential movement toward sexual equilibrium that was upending the old order, and the world appeared willing to let him do it — few people seeming to demand that his distasteful persistence leave him expelled from public life. But the conversation had its own momentum. Writing for the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan, whose interrogations of gender are as welcome by young feminists as hymnals are by atheists, was the first to wonder why Grace, pushed beyond her point of interest, had not simply gone home. The reprisals were numerous. Maisha Z. Johnson, a writer and editor whose website highlights her professional commitment “to the power of digital media for social change and healing,’’ for instance, alerted her Facebook followers that Ms. Flanagan was not trustworthy, offering as evidence a piece that appeared in Bitch Media, several years ago, titled: “Douchebag Decree: Caitlin Flanagan, Our First Douchebag All-Star!” The irony trumped the incivility. The piece attacked Ms. Flanagan, in part, for denouncing Helen Gurley Brown, the Cosmopolitan founder, who at the time of the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991 jovially said, in response to a question about whether anyone on her staff had ever been sexually harassed: “I certainly hope so.” A counterargument to the idea that young women ought to just extricate themselves from sexual situations in which they aren’t having any fun soon circulated, maintaining that the culture conditions them to acquiesce, to prioritize the needs of others before their own. “It feels paralyzing to assert ourselves,’’ Jill Filipovic wrote in The Guardian in reaction to all of this. And yet when I look around at millennial women, problems with inhibition or the ability to hang on to a healthy sense of entitlement are not the ones I am quickest to identify.

"A year ago, with an impressive roster of Goldman Sachs alumni on their way to top White House positions, the return of “Government Sachs” was in full swing. The newly inaugurated President Trump tapped Steven T. Mnuchin as treasury secretary, Gary D. Cohn as director of the National Economic Council and Dina Powell as White House adviser. Ms. Powell later served as both deputy national security adviser for strategy and senior counselor for economic initiatives. Anthony Scaramucci, another Goldman alumnus, was on the transition team en route to the post of White House communications director months later. Outranking them all was Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist, who worked at the bank early in his career and who reported directly to the president. Depending on one’s point of view, this was either a sellout to Wall Street by a president who had railed against Goldman during the campaign, or a welcome check on some of Mr. Trump’s more radical tendencies. As the Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich put it last year, “It would be interesting to see to what degree the New York liberals change Trump and to what degree Trump changes the New York liberals.” Now, the verdict would appear to be in: Mr. Trump remains the impulsive, freewheeling provocateur in chief, and much of the Goldman contingent has been banished or is leaving the White House.

"Last Thursday, I found myself in the back of an ambulance with my handcuffed husband, Ravi Ragbir, two E.M.T.s and an agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As the ambulance inched its way out of 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, I caught glimpses of the chaos outside. Faces of friends swam in and out of view. We could hear the shouts and wails of the hundreds of supporters surrounding us who knew Ravi had been arrested, feared he was being “disappeared” and were attempting, nonviolently, with their bodies, to protect him. Ravi’s arrest is the latest in a series that makes clear that ICE is singling out immigrant activists and leaders for detention and deportation. In the past week alone we have learned of three other leaders who have been deported, detained or placed into deportation proceedings. Each of these leaders has been outspoken about his or her own immigration case and has worked toward a more just system for all. Ravi is an immigrant from Trinidad and the executive director of the New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City, a network of faith groups that works to reform detention and deportation practices. Eighteen years ago, he served time for a wire fraud conviction; after he finished his sentence, ICE detained him. He had been a legal permanent resident, but his green card was taken away, and he has been fighting a deportation order since 2006. Ravi and I met through our mutual work on immigrant rights and married in 2010. Even though I am an American citizen, Ravi continues to face deportation because of his conviction years ago. As he fights his own deportation, he works with other immigrants in New York, accompanying them to their ICE check-ins, developing a legal support clinic and organizing churches and synagogues to fight deportation.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it was expanding religious freedom protections for doctors, nurses and other health care workers who object to performing procedures like abortion and gender reassignment surgery, satisfying religious conservatives who have pushed for legal sanctuary from the federal government. The new steps, which include the creation of an oversight entity within the Department of Health and Human Services called the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, are the latest efforts by President Trump to meet the demands of one of his most loyal constituencies. They coincide with Mr. Trump’s planned address on Friday to abortion opponents at the annual March for Life in Washington. For religious conservatives, the new protections address long-held concerns that religious people could be forced to comply with laws and regulations that violate their religious beliefs. Roger Severino, the director of the office for civil rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, promised that he and his staff would investigate every complaint of a violation of “conscience rights” protected by federal law. But civil rights, gay rights and abortion rights groups, as well as some medical organizations, expressed alarm at a move they described as part of a systematic effort by the Trump administration to legitimize discrimination. Their concern is not limited to the executive branch. Mr. Trump has appointed judges to powerful appellate courts at a rate faster than any new president since Richard M. Nixon, and the Republican-controlled Senate is working to speed the approval of Mr. Trump’s lower-level district court nominees. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, said the administration was using the civil rights office as “a tool to restrict access to health care for people who are transgender and women.” Eric D. Hargan, the acting secretary of health and human services, said that the creation of the new civil rights unit carried out an executive order issued last year by Mr. Trump, who said that religious people would no longer be “bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/health-care-office-abortion-contraception.html?searchResultPosition=33

"Two releases this month have put the relationship between the press and the Oval Office on display: “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” by Michael Wolff, which caused a media whirlwind and was denounced by President Donald Trump, and “The Post,” the Steven Spielberg film that highlights The Washington Post’s standoff with the White House over the publishing of the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s. Here are three books that examine the historical dynamic between the presidency and the fourth estate. THE BULLY PULPIT
Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism
By Doris Kearns Goodwin
910 pages. Simon & Schuster. (2013) In this biography, Goodwin examines Theodore Roosevelt through his relationship with the press, arguing that his “complex and sometimes contentious partnerships” with investigative journalists helped him speak directly to the public to push his political agenda and expose corruption like “the human and economic costs of unchecked industrial growth.” He “tested his ideas on reporters,” frequently exchanged correspondence with his favorites and invited them to luncheons that could last until midnight. His policy was sometimes even informed by reporting: After reading Upton Sinclair’s 1906 “The Jungle,” which exposed the deplorable conditions of the meatpacking industry in Chicago, Roosevelt quickly moved to pass meat inspection legislation. Michiko Kakutani wrote that Goodwin “prompts us to reconsider the ways political dynamics have, and have not, changed.” THE MAKING OF FDR
The Story of Stephen T. Early, America’s First Modern Press Secretary
By Linda Lotridge Levin
500 pp. Prometheus Books. (2008) If you’re wondering how an appearance like Barack Obama’s on “Between Two Ferns” with Zach Galifianakis became acceptable, you might turn to this biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s press secretary, a man who fundamentally altered the way the presidency interacts with the press. Stephen T. Early discouraged Roosevelt from calling media sources directly, having him instead deliver a single message in news conferences held twice a week. Early expanded the mediums through which the president communicated to include radio and newsreels. He also helped create “Fireside Chats,” the series of evening radio addresses given by Roosevelt through the Great Depression. ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN
By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward
349 pp. Simon & Schuster. (1974) Written by the reporters responsible for breaking the Watergate scandal for The Washington Post, this book turns the ordeal into “a fast-moving mystery, a whodunit written with ease,” wrote our reviewer. In addition to showing how Bernstein and Woodward investigated the scandal, the book also reveals the inner workings of a newsroom, including the role editors play in determining the stories that are printed and the risks publications take in printing and reporting stories. Bernstein and Woodward describe their high stakes reporting through anecdotes like a 3 a.m. meeting on an editor’s lawn (they were afraid of being bugged) or clandestine encounters with Deep Throat, Woodward’s deeply connected anonymous source, that are “superbly and suspensefully described.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/books/on-the-presidencys-fraught-relationship-with-the-press.html?searchResultPosition=35
"I
took the eastern route from Idaho, on a day of freezing rain, over the Strawberry Mountains, into the broad John Day River Basin, in Oregon. I was used to empty places. Most of my childhood was spent in this region of eastern Oregon, in remote areas of the sagebrush desert or in the volcanic mountains with their jagged peaks and old-growth forests. My family moved away just before I entered high school, and I never returned; I’ve felt in romantic exile ever since. This part of America that had once belonged to my childhood became the spotlight of national news in the winter of 2016, when the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge — an old childhood haunt — became the scene of a cowboy takeover. The takeover began as a protest in the town of Burns after two ranchers were sentenced to prison for arsons on federal land. The ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, caught the attention of the Nevada rancher Ammon Bundy, who thought the punishment unfair. Bundy and a crowd of nearly 300 marchers paraded through Burns, and a splinter group eventually took over the Malheur headquarters. For 41 days, they refused to leave, protesting federal ownership of public lands, which they considered unlawful and abusive. I didn’t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry. The ground was snow-covered when I visited John Day last winter and the temperature below freezing. I was there to attend a meeting organized by Jeanette Finicum, the widow of LaVoy Finicum, an Arizona rancher who was shot and killed by government agents a year earlier. LaVoy was a leader of the Malheur occupation. He left the refuge for a speaking engagement in John Day with plans to return, but he was shot three times at an F.B.I. roadblock. For that reason, his widow was calling this event “The Meeting That NEVER Happened.” The town of John Day isn’t much more than a two-lane road through end-of-frontier brick buildings and is barely two square miles in size. A “closed” sign hung from the Ranch and Rodeo Museum, and the only vacancy was at a motel called Dreamers Lodge. Just west of town, off the Journey Through Time Scenic Byway, were the John Day fossil beds, where the remains of saber-toothed tigers and small horses were dug up from 30-million-year-old volcanic ash. To the east, replicas of covered wagons stood on the side of the road. I pulled up next to a minivan in the parking lot of Americas Best Value Inn. Three women stepped out. The driver wore American flag earrings and a Christmas sweater, her hair piled on her head. She was a candy-company representative in Boise and had driven to John Day with a trunk full of Mentos. “What’s going on with the media is absolute crap,” the driver said. We walked down the street, to the Outpost restaurant, and over lunch, she described what was happening in eastern Oregon as a “truth insurrection.” One of her companions, a delicate, elderly lady with long white hair, told me that she attended protests during the federal siege at Ruby Ridge, followed the killings at Waco and took an interest in the Bundys during the occupation. All three believed the government could come to their homes anytime and shoot them. “Someone please needs to get this story right,” the elderly lady said. When I showed her my tape recorder, she gave me a high five. She figured I couldn’t twist her words now. “Sometimes it happens,” she said. “The truth will end up in The New York Times. But your editors will probably mess it up.” I asked what truth she had in mind. “Well, for one thing,” she said, “LaVoy was not ‘killed’; he was ‘murdered.’ ” The meeting was up the road at the Grant County Fairgrounds, in a building called the Trowbridge Pavilion, where every summer local residents gathered to show prizewinning livestock. The parking lot was crowded with pickup trucks mounted with Don’t Tread on Me flags and decorated in stickers that read, “LaVoy” or “Not Guilty.” The crowd was all white, a mix of ranchers, farmers, loggers, miners, firefighters and hard-right Mormons from Idaho, Utah and Arizona. There were as many women as men, lots of families and children. People wore T-shirts that read #libertyrevolution. A few dozen self-proclaimed militia members, mostly representatives from the Oath Keepers and the Oregon Three Percenters, were there, as well as members of the Finicum family and the Bundy family. I recognized occupiers from their mug shots. A few people carried guns to show their support of the Second Amendment. Many had traveled from out of state, and some had driven through the night, on bad roads and through dangerous weather, and spent money on hotels and food they could not really afford, they said. Why? They told me their livelihood was at stake. A long line formed to get in the door, and I started a conversation with Robin Olson and her 18-year-old daughter, Emily. Robin had long hair and bangs that brushed against the frame of her glasses. The Olsons lived in Powell Butte, a town of less than 2,000 people in central Oregon, not far from where I grew up. “This is the West,” she told me. “This is the real West. If only everyone could see it.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/magazine/fear-of-the-federal-government-in-the-ranchlands-of-oregon.html?searchResultPosition=56
"In 2003, Washington State was facing a budget crisis and wanted to reduce spending on Medicaid. Instead of requiring people to establish their eligibility annually, the legislature began requiring them to do so twice a year, and added some paperwork. It worked: Enrollment in the health insurance program fell by more than 40,000 children in a year. In the early 2000s, Louisiana wanted to maximize the number of eligible children who signed up for coverage, so officials simplified the sign-up process. It also worked: Enrollment surged, and the number of administrative cancellations fell by 20 percentage points. In 2006, Congress asked states to verify the citizenship of beneficiaries by seeking their birth certificates. Across the country, children’s Medicaid enrollment dropped, despite scant evidence that ineligible children had been signed up. That policy was reversed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The Trump administration’s decision to approve a first-of-its-kind work requirement for Kentucky’s Medicaid program last week has inspired concern that the program will leave behind Medicaid beneficiaries who are unable to find or keep work. But a large body of social science suggests that the mere requirement of documenting work hours is likely to cause many eligible people to lose coverage, too. “Without being tremendously well organized, it can be easy to fail,” said Donald Moynihan, a professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is writing a book on the effects of administrative burdens. Researchers have studied the ways complexity can reduce sign-ups for workplace pension plans, participation in food stamps and turnout in elections, he noted. “These sorts of little barriers are ways in which humans get tripped up all the time when they’re trying to do something that might benefit them.” Anyone who has ever forgotten to pay a bill on time, or struggled to assemble all the necessary forms of identification before heading to the D.M.V., is likely to sympathize with how administrative hurdles can stymie someone. But these may be especially daunting for the poor, who tend to have less stable work schedules and less access to resources that can simplify compliance: reliable transportation, a bank account, internet access.  There is also a lot of research about the Medicaid program, specifically, that shows that sign-ups fall when states make their program more complicated.

The public conversation around sexual misconduct has grown more nuanced recently, particularly in the wake of an article alleging that the actor and comedian Aziz Ansari — who wore a “Time’s Up” pin at this month’s Golden Globe Awards — behaved coercively during a sexual encounter last year. Samantha Bee dove into the discussion on Wednesday, saying that even if he did nothing that qualifies as sexual assault or rape, it was still important to acknowledge that the actions he is accused of are not acceptable. “We know the difference between a rapist, a workplace harasser and an Aziz Ansari,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we have to be happy about any of them.” Ms. Bee said Mr. Ansari — the author of a book called “Modern Romance: An Investigation” — should have been able to recognize when his advances were making his date feel uncomfortable. “If you don’t want to tune into your partner’s feelings throughout sex,” she said, maybe Mr. Ansari shouldn’t be engaging in sexual activity with a woman at all. “May I suggest a coin purse?

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Build that wall!” — a rallying cry to physically protect the U.S. border with Mexico — was a central message of President Trump’s campaign. But his promise to do so was not “fully informed,” the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, privately told members of Congress on Wednesday. Mr. Trump turned to Twitter this morning to contradict his  chief of staff. “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,” he wrote, conceding that it would not be necessary on all 2,000 miles of the border, as parts are impassable. • At a meeting with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Mr. Kelly also expressed confidence that a deal could eventually be reached to preserve protections for the immigrants known as Dreamers. • It was a life-or-death call. In 2013, federal agents took a calculated risk and allowed a former C.I.A. officer with classified information in his luggage to return to Hong Kong.

"“We live in trying times,” Chelsea Manning says in a video released over the weekend announcing her candidacy for the Senate, taking on Benjamin Cardin of Maryland in the Democratic primary. “Times of fear. Times of suppression.” Her unsettling spot is replete with footage of white supremacists executing Nazi salutes, police in riot gear carrying off protesters — all the atrocities of the Trump era in which we are now mired. These alternate with shots of a leather-clad Ms. Manning walking determinedly in the nation’s capital, a red rose in her hand. She is poised, but she is angry and ready for a fight (starting with the Democratic Party, of which Senator Cardin is one of its most powerful figures). It’s impossible to look at that video without thinking of the civil rights and antiwar movements 50 years ago. So many of its images remind me of ones I’ve seen before — police attacking black people with fire hoses, marches on Washington, a young person gently putting a flower in the muzzle of a soldier’s gun. Then, as now, it was unclear whether the best way to confront our enemies was to fight them or forgive them. Then, as now, it was unclear whether the best way to bring about social change was through violence or love. For me, Ms. Manning’s candidacy — in fact, her whole career in the public eye — brings that confusion to a sharp point. When I came out as transgender in 2001, advocates in the generation before mine frequently told me: “The only way to survive your life as a public advocate is to never let people see your rage or your tears. You have to be above reproach. You have to be Jackie Robinson.” I tried, in my own meager way, to follow the example of Brooklyn’s 42. As I embarked on my own career as a public person, I too tried to be above reproach, smiling forgivingly as a student at a university in Ohio attempted to compliment me by saying, “You know, Professor, before I heard your lecture, I used to think people like you should be, you know, exterminated.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/opinion/chelsea-manning-senate.html?searchResultPosition=52
"President Trump didn’t include El Salvador on his vulgar list of deplorables. But his forthcoming expulsion of nearly 200,000 Salvadorans will inflict more harm on that poor and violent country of 6.3 million people than any verbal assault. Actions speak louder than words. Haiti and the continent of Africa got off easy. Although I usually devote this space to the Supreme Court and legal issues, this column is an exception. There is no legal issue, as far as I can tell, with the president’s cancellation of the “temporary protected status” that the George W. Bush administration granted the Salvadorans in 2001 after two devastating earthquakes. The shelter extended under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which currently covers citizens of 10 countries, is meant to be temporary, and the president can decide the time is up for any particular group. But in the 10 days since President Trump announced his decision, I’ve been obsessed not with its legality but with its cruelty and self-defeating stupidity. I’ve seen the story fade under the crush of a relentless news cycle, where every “Have you heard the latest?” invites another scary excursion into the land of disbelief. So I will temporarily leave the Supreme Court to whatever mysterious inner struggles have limited the justices to deciding only one argued case since the current term began on Oct. 2. That solitary decision, a unanimous opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on an obscure question of jurisdiction, was issued on Nov. 8. No court-watcher alive can recall such a slow start to a Supreme Court term, and it has become the subject of much head-scratching. The gates will burst open eventually, at which point the mystery may or may not be solved. Expulsions on the scale the Trump administration envisions are hardly unknown to history. Even modern countries, within memory, have sought to rid themselves of entire populations. It tends neither to turn out well nor reflect well on the expelling country. Two hundred thousand people may not sound like a huge number on a historic scale. But the population of San Salvador, El Salvador’s capital, is only 280,000. Money sent home by Salvadorans living abroad, most in the United States, where protected status conveys work authorization, amounts to 17 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the country’s central bank. The destabilizing effect of cutting off this flow of capital is obvious. The potential economic effects in this country are less obvious, but real. Contrary to what President Trump might think, the Salvadoran community is highly productive. According to the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank in New York affiliated with a Catholic group, the Congregation of the Missionaries of St. Charles, 88 percent of Salvadorans participate in the labor force (the construction and food service industries are their biggest employers), compared with 63 percent of Americans as a whole. They pay taxes and own homes. Since individuals with protected status are ineligible for welfare and other social benefits, this is a group that contributes to the country while taking little.

"Until his dying day, my dad’s Uncle Bern was a communist sympathizer. I remember him as an affable old man with a gracious wife who made a modest living selling antique lace. He probably wouldn’t have hurt a fly. Yet he found much to admire in the most murderous ideology of the 20th century, responsible for tens of millions of deaths from the killing fields of Cambodia to the gulags of Murmansk. If you’re Jewish in America, chances are there’s at least one Uncle Bern somewhere in your family tree. As the scholar Ruth Wisse noted last year in Tablet magazine, Jewish intellectual life in the 1930s and 40s was largely defined by one’s stance toward one thing: The Party. Historians reckon that Jews accounted for nearly half the Communist Party’s total membership in those years, while many other Jews were close fellow travelers. Most of these people, like my great-uncle, were deeply misguided idealists who otherwise led quiet and decent lives. A tiny handful of others — including atomic spies Julius Rosenberg, David Greenglass, Harry Gold and Morton Sobell — betrayed America’s most important military secrets to Stalinist Russia and did incalculable damage to the country and the world. Here’s a thought experiment: Would the United States have been better off if it had banned Jewish immigration sometime in the late 19th century, so that the immigrant parents of Rosenberg and Sobell had never set foot here? The question is worth asking, because so many of the same arguments made against African, Latin-American and Muslim immigrants today might have easily been applied to Jews just over a century ago. Consider some of the parallels. Crime? In 1908, the New York City police commissioner, Theodore Bingham, caused a public uproar (for which he later apologized) when he claimed that half the city’s criminals were Jews. The truth was closer to the opposite: Jewish crime rates, at about 16 percent, were considerably lower than their roughly 25 percent share of New York’s overall population. The same goes today, when, contrary to much Trumpian propaganda, incarceration rates for immigrants are nearly half what they are for native-born Americans. Racial desirability? Just as Donald Trump wants more Norwegian immigrants and none from “s-hole countries,” the early 20th-century eugenicist, conservationist and immigration restrictionist Madison Grant was obsessed with protecting the “Nordic” races against those he termed “social discards” — including “the Slovak, the Italian, the Syrian and the Jew.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/opinion/jews-immigration-america.html?searchResultPosition=50
"Updated, 11:14 a.m. Good morning on this bright Thursday. Here’s something you might not expect to find at a farmers’ market or street parade: philosophy. For nearly two years, Ian Olasov, a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and the founder of Brooklyn Public Philosophers, has set up an “Ask-a-Philosopher” booth in places like Union Square. There, he and fellow philosophers help passers-by with questions tougher than how to get where they are going. The most common question they get (not surprisingly, he said) concerns the meaning of life. “But there are other questions of pressing popular concern that people might not recognize as philosophical,” said Mr. Olasov, 31. “‘What does it mean to say that race or gender are socially constructed?’ ‘What is money?’ ‘What makes Bitcoin money?’” During this volatile time in our country, the conversation has also shifted considerably, he added. “One thing that strikes me is how much public talk there is about how we can ‘know’ things or how the institutions that create and disseminate knowledge should be organized — like the press,” Mr. Olasov told us. “Or the role of experts in a democracy. Or what makes scientific institutions trustworthy?” One way to join the discussion: the Night of Philosophy and Ideas. The overnight philosophy marathon on Jan. 27, from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. at the Brooklyn Public Library, will bring philosophers and the public together for debate, performances and more. (It’s free, and you can see the schedule here.) Last year’s event, which took place a week after President Trump’s inauguration and hours after the first travel ban was announced, drew thousands of attendees. Mr. Olasov remembered the message of the opening address: “We’re at a place where all across the world, people are dissatisfied with the basic structure of society — somehow, liberalism and capitalism and globalization are failing people — and we need to think about it.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/nyregion/new-york-today-philosophers-in-nyc.html?searchResultPosition=49
"Since its founding nearly 13 years ago, The Huffington Post has relied heavily on unpaid contributors, whose ranks included aspiring writers, citizen journalists and celebrities from the Rolodex of the site’s co-founder Arianna Huffington. An early example of the unfiltered amateur journalism that propagated on the internet, the contributor pages were a mix of reported pieces and personal essays, and even generated national news. In 2008, Mayhill Fowler, a woman who said she had sold her car to fund travel on the campaign trail, set off a firestorm when she quoted Barack Obama at a fund-raiser saying that working-class voters “cling to guns or religion.” But the site’s days of encouraging everyday citizens to report on the news are over. On Thursday, it said it was immediately dissolving its self-publishing contributors platform — which has mushroomed to include 100,000 writers — in what is perhaps the most significant break from the past under its editor in chief, Lydia Polgreen, who joined the news site, which is now called HuffPost, a year ago. The decision was rooted as much in a move to declutter the site as in Ms. Polgreen’s desire to focus on quality reporting and minimize unvetted stories at a time when there is so much misinformation online. The site’s everyone-is-welcome ethos was once seen as a democratizing force in news. But Ms. Polgreen said in an interview that unfiltered platforms had devolved into “cacophonous, messy, hard-to-hear places where voices get drowned out and where the loudest shouting voice prevails.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/business/media/huffpost-unpaid-contributors.html?searchResultPosition=48
"Ben Sinclair needed to get the R.V. upstate for the winter. The R.V. is a 1977 Dodge Sportsman Travco painted white with black trim. There’s room to sleep four, a kitchen and a shower in back, and burnt-orange shag carpet that has seen a few miles. One morning last month, the R.V. was parked on a gritty street in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, near Mr. Sinclair’s office. The plan was to drive north and stash it in his buddy’s backyard near Germantown, N.Y., leaving time enough to smoke a joint before catching the 1:51 Amtrak back to the city. Mr. Sinclair bought the motor home in July for $5,000 and spent part of the summer at another buddy’s country place upstate, chilling inside. “I put this on the coolest part of their property, next to a swimming hole,” he said, buckling the lap belt (no shoulder harness, no airbags) and easing into city traffic. “I hung out all day with my shirt off, wrote, went swimming. We’d meet at sundown to have a beer.” It sounds like the sort of freewheelin’ lifestyle move you might expect from “The Guy,” the laid-back, luxuriously bearded, unnamed Brooklyn weed dealer Mr. Sinclair plays on HBO’s “High Maintenance.” The series, which he created with his wife and writing partner, Katja Blichfeld, began as a no-budget web show in 2012, garnered a cult following for its empathic look inside the lives (and apartments) of New Yorkers and was upgraded to premium cable two years ago. Indeed, Mr. Sinclair wrote the R.V. into The Guy’s story arc for Season 2, which will have its premiere on Jan 19. But whenever men in middle age or approaching it (Mr. Sinclair is 33) make bold vehicle purchases, experience tells us it’s rarely about engines. Months before he answered a Craigslist ad for a family motor home, Mr. Sinclair began divorce proceedings. He and Ms. Blichfeld made the decision to end their six-year marriage on Election Day of 2016, a fluke of timing that had a benefit.

"Many think the issue of sexual harassment — embodied in the #MeToo movement — will work to the advantage of Democrats in upcoming elections. A mid-December NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey gave the party a three to one advantage over Republicans on the matter. But it is hardly guaranteed to do so. Views of sexual harassment and of gender issues generally differ sharply by age, sex and partisan allegiance — all of which create substantial unpredictability. The issue has the potential to accelerate the growing discontent among well-educated white women with the Republican Party. But it could also intensify hostility to the liberal agenda among conservatives, particularly white men, many of whom view women’s complaints of discrimination as “an attempt to gain advantage” in the workplace. This complex dynamic is illuminated, for example, in the work of Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, a psychologist at Tufts, who recently reported a growing divergence on gender issues between male and female voters under the age of 30. In her paper, “How Gender Mattered to Millennials in the 2016 Election and Beyond,” Kawashima-Ginsberg found that in an election in which allegations of harassment and abuse against Donald Trump were central, support for the Democratic nominee dropped by 15 points from 2008 to 2016 among all young men between the ages of 18 to 29 (from 62 to 47 percent) and by 6 points among all women (from 69 to 63 percent). At the same time, turnout among young white men, many of whom supported Trump, shot up significantly. “2016 saw the greatest number of votes cast by young white men in the past 12 years — markedly higher than their female counterparts,” Kawashima-Ginsberg wrote. Emily Ekins, director of polling at the libertarian Cato Institute, also sees pitfalls for Democrats. In an email, she noted that the #MeToo movement and accompanying protests have the potential to make gender issues more important than economics in 2018 and 2020.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump directly contradicted his own chief of staff on Thursday and said his position on building a wall between the United States and Mexico had not “evolved.” Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, told some Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had “evolved” on the issue of the wall, and that the president was not “fully informed” when he promised to build such a barrier last year. In an early-morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump took the unusual step of publicly pushing back against his own White House, signaling a disconnect between the president and his staff at a critical time of negotiations with Congress to avoid a government shutdown. Mr. Kelly’s comments on Wednesday, which he made at a meeting with members of the Hispanic Caucus, were unusual as well. It is rare to see a White House chief of staff undercut a president’s public statements. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. Such a wall is estimated to cost billions of dollars. In one of his Twitter posts on Thursday, Mr. Trump restated his intention that Mexico would foot the bill.

"Access isn’t everything. For “The Final Year,” the director Greg Barker and his crew were able to follow four vital members of Barack Obama’s administration as they worked to keep the United States out of war, promote better relations with Cuba and deter Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons program. Secretary of State John Kerry; the ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power; the national security adviser Susan Rice; and the deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes are all seen up close and personal as they globe trot in pursuit of what they see as noble aims. For much of its first hour, this movie is tepid and self-congratulatory, a quick-cutting advertisement for itself. Why Mr. Barker thought it worth preserving Mr. Kerry’s “I’ve been very blessed to be able to go through a progression of experiences which underscore the value of experience” sound bite is a mystery. There’s some juice in Mr. Rhodes’s reaction, more bruised than angry, to a profile in The New York Times Magazine, in which he is portrayed as finding the Washington press corps both ignorant and credulous. Current events arguably place some of Mr. Rhodes’s statements in an interesting perspective. In the final half-hour, things start picking up, not just because of the impending surprise victory of Donald J. Trump and the way these players react to it. The team comes to the realization that it misread Vladimir Putin in its dealings with Russia, and that Mr. Putin is in fact out only for himself. “The Final Year” may make viewers miss President Obama’s people.

"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats are questioning the Trump administration’s latest salvo in its push for strict immigration enforcement: possible criminal charges for local politicians in so-called sanctuary cities. The Justice Department is exploring “what avenues might be available” to criminally charge state and local officials who enact laws or guidelines limiting cooperation with federal immigration policies, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen confirmed during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this week. She said the request had come from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, both Democrats of California and members of the committee, asked the Justice Department on Wednesday why it was looking into the matter. “We ask for the legal and factual bases for this request, and information about the consideration of this request,” they wrote in a letter to both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and to Ms. Nielsen. It was not clear how seriously the Justice Department was considering the question or whether it had begun investigating any politicians. A spokesman said only that the Justice Department was working with ICE to explore all options for holding sanctuary cities accountable.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The politics of soda has changed pretty radically. Just a decade ago, virtually no countries or cities had a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Then Mexico enacted a substantial tax in 2014, and it started a trend. Soda taxes now exist in India, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. A tax will go into effect this year or next year in South Africa, Britain and Ireland. In the United States, Philadelphia, Oakland, San Francisco and Seattle are among the cities that have such a tax. The argument for these taxes is compelling. Sweetened beverages are the single largest contributor to the obesity epidemic, scientists say, and that epidemic exacts a big toll, in both health problems and medical costs. Soda taxes are modeled on tobacco taxes, which have been hugely successful in reducing smoking and improving public health. But even tobacco taxes are still not high enough, as the economist Robert H. Frank explained recently. And taxes on soda could do far more good if they were higher and more widespread. Today, Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, and Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, are announcing a new global group to advocate for these kinds of taxes. I think of them as “health taxes,” and they can also cover alcohol and forms of sugar beyond soda. The group includes the president of Uruguay and the former prime minister of New Zealand, as well as leaders from Britain, China and Nigeria.

"Three Jersey boys packed into Walter Kerr Theater in Times Square Wednesday night: a rock star, a former governor (as of Tuesday) and this reporter. What follows is what I saw, with apologies to Bruce Springsteen purists. Well they kicked the old governor out of Trenton last night. Kicked him out of the mansion, too. But down on Broadway, he was getting ready for a night. Seems like the Boss can carry him through. He drove in on his own from out of state; no troopers or cops for relief. There were a few who noticed him slink in tonight, and none who wanted to give him any grief. Every term ends, Jersey. That’s a fact. And after two terms, you just can’t come back. So he put that gray sweater on and came into the city. On stage was Springsteen, in the audience Chris Christie. Since before he entered public life, Mr. Christie, a Republican, has idolized his local hero, Mr. Springsteen, but the love has often been one-sided. Though they have no ties that bind them beyond a shared home state, they both were, at least at one time, the pre-eminent icons of working-life Jersey, and two of its most famous citizens. Now, one is fetching many hundreds of dollars per seat on Broadway, wrote a critically-acclaimed memoir and shows no signs of slowing down. The other has just ended eight years as governor of New Jersey, following a failed push for the presidency and has a murky future.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Brian P. Kelly, the head of California’s State Transportation Agency, was appointed this week to run the state’s High-Speed Rail Authority, the organization charged with overseeing construction of what would be America’s first high-speed train system. This week a consultant to the authority reported that the cost of the first segment under construction, a 119-mile span in the Central Valley, has risen to $84 million per mile from $66 million per mile. Mr. Kelly spoke to us on Wednesday. (Our chat has been edited and condensed below.) Q. You’re going from what appeared to be a secure and prominent role at the State Transportation Agency to the head of an organization that faces a lot skepticism from the general public and fierce opposition from Republicans. Why did you take the job? A. In 23 years of doing transportation policy in California I have never seen a single project that would have such a transformative impact as this one. You are right. This project has mammoth opposition. I’d rather get in the fight than stand on the sidelines. Q. The High-Speed Rail Authority was established 23 years ago. During that time China has built 16,000 miles of high-speed rail. We are still working on the first 119 miles. What are we doing wrong? A. It’s not that we’re doing it wrong. To be fair, the voters of the State of California did not pass a bond bill dedicating any money until 2008. We are in a position today where there is enough dedicated for the project. We have construction underway. Q. Can you look California in the eye and tell us that this train is going to leave the station some day?

"WASHINGTON — The House approved a stopgap spending bill on Thursday night to keep the government open past Friday, but Senate Democrats — angered by President Trump’s vulgar aspersions and a lack of progress on a broader budget and immigration deal — appeared ready to block the measure. The House approved the measure 230 to 197, despite conflicting signals by President Trump sent throughout the day and a threatened rebellion from conservatives that ended up fizzling. But the bill, which would keep the government open through Feb. 16, provided only a faint glimmer of hope that a crisis could be averted before funding expires at midnight on Friday. In the Senate, at least about a dozen Democratic votes would be needed to approve the measure, and there was little chance that those would materialize. Democrats are intent on securing concessions that would, among other things, protect from deportation young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, increase domestic spending, aid Puerto Rico and bolster the government’s response to the opioid crisis. The Senate held only a procedural vote on the stopgap bill late Thursday night, leaving for Friday a more consequential vote when Democrats are expected to block the measure. In addition to keeping the government open, the bill would provide funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years, and it would delay or suspend a handful of taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act. The weeks-old standoff on immigration and spending only grew more charged last week after Mr. Trump referred to African nations as “shithole countries.” By Thursday, talks on those matters had produced little visible progress, and prominent House Democrats were introducing a resolution to censure the president for his words.

"WASHINGTON — Much of the world has soured on American leadership since President Trump took office, a loss of faith that has opened up opportunities for other countries like China, Russia and Germany to assert themselves on the international stage, according to an extensive new survey of people living around the globe. Just 30 percent of people interviewed in 134 countries last year approved of American leadership under Mr. Trump, a drop of nearly 20 percentage points since President Barack Obama’s final year and the lowest finding since the Gallup polling organization began asking the question overseas more than a decade ago. The decline was especially steep in Latin America, Europe and Canada. The findings of the survey come just a week before Mr. Trump plans to go to Europe to attend the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a traditional gathering of political and economic elites. Mr. Trump has alienated many other countries, including longtime American allies, by pulling back from international agreements and organizations, not to mention by issuing derogatory remarks like those last week denigrating Africa and Haiti. “It makes it more challenging to lead when people are this down on your leadership,” said Jon Clifton, Gallup’s global managing partner. “But on the other hand, if we were sitting with President Trump and his leadership team, they would say these results are understandable because we’re making tough decisions.” Among those decisions has been abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and the Paris climate change accord, undercutting the multinational nuclear deal with Iran, assailing NATO allies for not spending more on their militaries and threatening to scrap free-trade pacts with Mexico, Canada, South Korea and others. The survey showed that approval of American leadership has fallen 10 points or more in 65 of the 134 countries since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, while it increased by that much or more in just four countries: Belarus, Israel, Liberia and Macedonia. It fell by 40 percentage points in Canada (from 60 percent in 2016 to 20 percent in 2017) and 28 percentage points in Mexico (from 44 to 16 percent).

"LONDON — Agreements on defense, security and the treatment of migrants were reached by President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Thursday, as the two leaders sought to protect critical areas of cooperation while Britain prepares to withdraw from the European Union. Anglo-French summit meetings are regular events, but with Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc in March next year, this one has a particular resonance. The British withdrawal, known as Brexit, will bring to an end more than four decades of European integration, and 2018 will see tough negotiations on the future trading relationship between Britain and the remaining 27 nations of the bloc — talks in which France will wield considerable influence. In a significant good-will gesture, Mr. Macron announced that the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the Norman Conquest of England, would be lent to Britain for display, allowing it to leave France for the first time in 950 years. That, Mr. Macron told a news conference, was part of an effort to deepen cultural ties and help the two nations make “a new tapestry together,” even as Brexit introduces new uncertainty into their relationship. For her part, Mrs. May agreed to pay an additional $62 million to help reinforce security around the French port city of Calais, which has been a gathering point for migrants seeking to enter Britain. That money will be spent on fencing, CCTV cameras and infrared detection technology. The payment has rankled some members of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, who believe costs should be borne by France. But Mrs. May defended the policy on Thursday, saying that it was in Britain’s “national interest” to secure one of its frontiers. During his election campaign, Mr. Macron suggested renegotiating or scrapping the 2003 Le Touquet agreement that established British border controls in Calais, but that question has receded for now. On Thursday the two leaders reached an additional accord that aims to reduce the time spent by migrants in Calais, particularly unaccompanied minors. Britain is under pressure to accept more of them, though Mrs. May’s statement made no mention of the numbers that could be admitted.
