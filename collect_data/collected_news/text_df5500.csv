"When the Houston Astros visit the White House this season to commemorate their World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, Carlos Beltran will not be with them. Beltran said on Tuesday President Trump did not have anything to do with his decision, but he added that he was “disappointed” with the government’s response to the damage Hurricane Maria inflicted on Puerto Rico, Beltran’s home island. Beltran, speaking at the Thurman Munson Awards Dinner in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, cited his desire to spend that time with his family at their New York City home as a reason for his decision. “I’m retired so I’m not really part of the team anymore,” he said. “My family is my team now.” He stopped short of criticizing President Trump specifically over the response to the hurricane damage in Puerto Rico, some parts of which are still without electrical power more than four months later. “I mean, he’s the President of the United States,” Beltran said. “Sometimes we don’t like what he does, or we like the things that he does, but at the end of the day, he’s the president. It’s got nothing to do with that.” But Beltran, who announced his retirement after finally earning a championship ring in his 20th major-league season, noted the difference in the government’s response to the damage in Puerto Rico compared with the reaction to Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston in August. “One thing that really impressed me a lot was how fast that city was able to get back on its feet,” Beltran said. “But the situation in Puerto Rico has been different.” He added: “We’re very disappointed in the government that we haven’t gotten the same benefits. Being a part of the United States, you expect at least to be treated the same way when tragedies like this happen.” Beltran and his wife, Jessica, donated $1 million to relief efforts in Puerto Rico in September, and he said his foundation was in the process of rebuilding 200 houses on the island. White House visits by sports champions have become more politically fraught since President Trump took office. The Golden State Warriors, the 2016-17 N.B.A. champions, said they did not want to make the traditional trip, and then the president withdrew their invitation. Some members of the Philadelphia Eagles, who won the Super Bowl on Sunday, have already said they would not go to the White House. No date has been set for the Astros’ visit to the White House. Generally, championship baseball teams visit the White House during a road trip to Baltimore. But since the Astros do not visit the Orioles until late September, the team might make the trip during spring training. “I’m not going to go, but I wish those guys the best,” Beltran said. “I hope they have a great time and enjoy their visit to the White House.” "
"New York Times reporters and editors are highlighting great stories from around the web. You can receive What We’re Reading by email, and let us know how you like it at wwr@nytimes.com. From The New Yorker: If you are a fan of David Grann, the publication of a new article is a cause for celebration. This latest, about the Antarctic obsession of explorer Henry Worsley, a modern-day Shackleton, is moving, disturbing and ultimately heartbreaking. Worsley found himself caught between two ideas. There was Shackleton’s comment to his wife after he gave up and turned around, saving his men: “A live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn’t it?” And then the unofficial motto of Worsley’s old commando unit: “Always a little further.” — John Schwartz, climate change reporter _____ From The New York Times: The fallout from the Nunes memo has continued to steer the conversation among political commentators of all ideologies. From the right come arguments that the Trump administration’s criticism of the F.B.I. doesn’t mean it’s “at war” with the bureau; from the left, accusations that Speaker Paul Ryan is abandoning his oath to protect the Constitution. One former C.I.A. agent describes how the treatment of Christopher Steele, the author of the now-infamous dossier, may discourage international sources from cooperating with U.S. intelligence agencies. — Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist _____ "
"On Monday night, Carter Page was finally ready for his Fox News close-up. It had been nearly a year since he began his one-man public-relations offensive to rebut accusations that, as a Trump campaign adviser, he colluded with Russia. He had appeared numerous times on CNN, MSNBC and the networks, typically opposite their star anchors. Unlike almost everyone else caught up in the Trump-Russia scandal, Page was not only willing to submit to public questions; he would even answer them. Though he didn’t bring much clarity to his role, the appearances did make for great, albeit surreal, television. Like the time he insisted to Anderson Cooper that his conversation with the Russian ambassador during the Republican National Convention was not actually a “meeting.” “Anderson,” Page explained, “a great analogy is you and I were members of the same health club here in New York previously. And I remember walking by you, even though we didn’t know each other, and I said, ‘Hi, Anderson,’ and you said hello, and we, you know, had a nice little exchange for half a second. Now, does that to you constitute a meeting?” But for all the media stardom these and other interviews brought Page, he had been essentially given a cold shoulder by Fox News; he hadn’t appeared on the network since a few cameos in March and April. When I met with Page late last year for a story for the magazine, his absence from Fox’s airwaves seemed to gnaw at him even more than the considerable distance that Trump’s advisers had sought to put between him and the president. After all, Page understood why Trump wouldn’t want to be associated with him: Page viewed himself, as he put it last year, “the biggest embarrassment surrounding the campaign.” But Fox was another matter. Considering how roughly he was treated by the mainstream media, he assumed that Fox would have come to his aid. Besides, Page’s father was a devoted Fox viewer, and it would have been nice if he could have watched his son on his favorite shows. So it was understandable why Page’s wide, goofy smile was even wider and goofier than usual on Monday night when he appeared on Laura Ingraham’s prime-time show on Fox News. Page was there to give his first interview since House Republicans, three days earlier, released a memo, written by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee, alleging that the F.B.I. had improperly spied on Page in an attempt to harm Trump’s presidential campaign. “Carter, it’s good to see you tonight,” Ingraham told Page, teeing up a softball. “I know you have not spoken out about this House Intel memo yet or the reaction to it. What is your reaction?” Page swung away: “Well, my first reaction, Laura, when I saw it was, there was a lot of details that kept dripping out, and it sounded really bad. And when I actually saw it, it was even worse than I could’ve possibly imagined.” Ingraham nodded sympathetically. As she later said on her show, “I feel sorry for Carter Page.” Another of Ingraham’s guests, Mollie Hemingway, a writer for the conservative website The Federalist, proclaimed: “If the civil rights and civil liberties of Carter Page can be violated, they can be violated for anyone.” For Page, the cavalry has finally arrived. Until now, his fight had been a lonely one. Indeed, the reason that Page, unlike others ensnared in the Russia scandal, has been so ubiquitous is because no one would argue for him on his behalf. Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn each have teams of high-priced lawyers; Page has a “chief strategic legal adviser” to give him occasional counsel, but Page says he’s representing himself. George Papadopoulos has his fiancée to defend his honor; Page, who is single, refused to put me in touch with any of his friends for fear of entangling them in his own problems. "
"The driver was drunk, the police said, his blood alcohol content nearly three times the legal limit. One of his victims was an N.F.L. linebacker who was just reaching his prime. But on Tuesday, two days after the crash, it was the driver’s immigration status that moved President Trump to post his first tweet of the morning. Decades of research have shown that immigrants are less prone to commit crimes and to be incarcerated than people born in the United States. But more and more lately, Mr. Trump has been using individual criminal cases to advance an argument that illegal immigration, as well as many forms of legal immigration, is dangerous to Americans and must be curbed. Now the White House, along with some Republicans in Congress, is arguing that any deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation must include provisions to tighten border security and roll back some types of legal immigration. Here’s how a linebacker’s death became part of that debate. Edwin Jackson, a linebacker from Atlanta, was the Colts’ third-leading tackler of the 2016 season before sitting out 2017 with an injury. He was riding in an Uber car driven by the crash’s second victim, Jeffrey Monroe, who was from nearby Avon, Ind. "

"WASHINGTON — State and local law enforcement officials are fighting a Trump administration proposal to move oversight of a $275 million drug prevention program to the Justice Department, fearing that such a move would steer the country’s drug-fighting strategy toward federal legal crackdowns and away from years of holistic, community-based approaches. A draft budget plan by the Office of Management and Budget would place federal law enforcement officers in charge of the drug trafficking grants rather than the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which has served as the White House’s clearinghouse for drug strategy across the government and as a neutral arbiter in the historically territorial relationship between federal, state and local authorities. The move would also effectively gut the drug office, whose influence has waned since President Trump took office. The office manages the grants, known as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, sending millions of federal dollars to 28 task forces across the country, composed of state, local and federal law enforcement officers, who use the money to combat drug trafficking in their communities. Directors of the grant program have descended on Capitol Hill this week to try to bolster support from Congress, which would need to approve any White House changes to the drug office or the program. Lawmakers have shown little appetite to alter a federal initiative that benefits state and local authorities and constituents. “In the middle of this huge epidemic, is now the time to start rearranging the deck chairs?” said Chauncey Parker, the director of the program task force in New York City and a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office. “O.N.D.C.P. are the experts and the professionals on this issue, and they’re the best ones from a holistic standpoint to be able to take a look at all of this.” The proposal has sent confusing signals to law enforcement officials who saw an ally in Mr. Trump given that he campaigned as a “law and order” candidate and courted state and local police in his election bid. In justifying potential changes to the grant program, the White House’s budget office has in recent months said privately that it believes federal authorities should be leading the charge on drug enforcement, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

"WASHINGTON — A week ago, President Trump stood before Congress as an improbable unifier. “Tonight,” he declared, “I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.” This week, Mr. Trump is back to being a disrupter. After accusing Democrats of being un-American and even treasonous for refusing to applaud during his State of the Union speech, he said on Tuesday that he would welcome a government shutdown if he cannot reach a spending deal with Congress that tightens immigration laws. A week ago, Mr. Trump called for a grand compromise with Democrats on the legal status of the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers — a deal, he said, “where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.” After all, the president added, “Americans are dreamers too.” On Tuesday, his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, said that many Dreamers failed to register for protected status with the government because they were “were too afraid to sign up” or were “too lazy to get off their asses.” He said he doubted Mr. Trump would extend the March 5 deadline that shields them from deportation. Mr. Trump’s threat of a shutdown seemed to have little effect on the delicate negotiations on Capitol Hill to raise spending caps on military and nonmilitary spending — an agreement that, if passed by both houses of Congress, would pave the way for long-term deal to fund the government.

"He grabs pussies. He kisses females without concern for the revulsion and horror they feel for him. Does he ever experience rejection? He does not. “Most men would get discouraged,” he says, referring to those he comes on to. “Fortunately for her, I am not most men.” He is Pepé Le Pew. Does he remind us of anyone else? In advance of Valentine’s Day, and to better understand the inner workings of a man who appears to have no inner workings, I bypassed last week’s State of the Union address and spent the evening watching all 17 Pepé Le Pew cartoons, from his 1945 debut in “Odor-able Kitty” to 1962’s “Louvre Come Back to Me!” And I can now share what I have learned — about love, the French, narcissistic personality disorder, men, women, the president of the United States and the smell of Limburger cheese. But first, for younger readers: Pepé Le Pew is a Warner Bros. cartoon character, part of the Looney Tunes stable during the golden age of American animation, alongside Bugs Bunny, the Road Runner, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. He was never a marquee star of the same magnitude of, say, Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner. He appeared in just 17 stand-alone cartoons, virtually all of them directed by Chuck Jones. Still, he made a fragrant impression: “For Scent-imental Reasons” (1949) won the Academy Award for best animated short film. If it seems surprising that there were only 17 Pepé Le Pew cartoons, it may be because they seem so similar. Each begins with a cat, usually but (interestingly) not always female, getting a stripe of white paint on its back, usually (but not always) by accident. This makes our hero, Pepé, mistake the cat for one of his own kind — and his response to those of his own kind is always deep and passionate love. He has a curious way of expressing it, though. Even though he is French (which in the Looney Tunes world is shorthand for relentless amour), his terrible smell repulses the objects of his affection, who struggle valiantly to get away, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. “Odor-able Kitty” ends with Pepé with a chain around his ankle. “Now we are inseparable, are we not, darling?” he says. The shot follows the chain across the room to the cat, whose leg is also bound. The last we see of the pussy, she is desperately hacking away at the chain, trying to get free. "
"JUBA, South Sudan — Demonstrations in South Sudan’s capital turned violent on Tuesday as people took to the streets to protest the United States’ new ban on supplying weapons to the country. On Friday, the United States imposed a unilateral arms embargo on South Sudan, which is embroiled in a civil war. The State Department said it was “appalled” by the continuing violence perpetrated by both sides in the conflict. The civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. On Tuesday, hundreds of people gathered outside the United States Embassy in the capital, Juba, and the nearby United Nations base to show their anger. Demonstrators held up posters that included the slogans “Down Down Mr. Trump” and “Don’t weaken our nation Mr. Trump.” The protesters delivered a petition to the embassy, an embassy spokesman confirmed. The petition cited the demonstrators’ anger over the arms embargo and accused the United States of supporting the rebels through the United Nations mission to South Sudan and neighboring countries, according to a copy seen by The Associated Press. Although the protest began peacefully, it turned violent and the crowd harassed and physically assaulted three journalists. None were seriously injured. South Sudan’s government would not comment on the embargo but condemned the violence. “If violence took place it was individuals taking the law into their own hands,” said a government spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny.

"After finding that the engineers in two recent commuter train crashes in the New York metropolitan area suffered from sleep apnea, federal investigators questioned the Trump administration’s reversal on requiring tests for the disorder. At a hearing in Washington on Tuesday, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said he was “mystified” by the withdrawal last year of a proposed federal rule on screening train crews for sleep apnea. The safety board officially concluded that the engineers’ fatigue and their employers’ failure to screen for sleep apnea caused the two similar crashes — one in Hoboken in late 2016 that killed one person and another in Brooklyn three months later. “The public deserves alert operators,” said the chairman, Robert L. Sumwalt. “That’s not too much to ask.” Mr. Sumwalt, who led the three-member board through the hearing in Washington, had just returned from the scene of Sunday’s Amtrak crash in South Carolina that killed an engineer and a conductor. The cause of that crash appeared to be the unexpected diversion of the Amtrak train onto a portion of track known as siding, where it ran headlong into a parked freight train. The crashes in Hoboken and Brooklyn — both involving trains that ran off the end of a track — were just two of many examples of crashes the board investigated that involved driver fatigue, Dr. Nicholas Webster, the board’s medical officer, said. Screening crew members for obstructive sleep apnea, which disrupts breathing during sleep and causes drowsiness, is simple and inexpensive, Dr. Webster said. But many railroads have not routinely screened their workers and the Federal Railroad Administration has not ordered them to do so. The agency had proposed mandating screenings for sleep apnea, but withdrew that proposal in August 2017 as part of the administration’s effort to reduce regulations. "
"The global financial markets are not in crisis. Though some pundits stoked panic with their coverage of several days of market plunges before Tuesday’s leap, stock prices are still near their record highs, the economy is creating jobs and many workers are finally getting decent raises after years of stagnant wages. Which doesn’t mean that there’s nothing to worry about. In recent months, time after time, both the current administration and its allies in Congress have called into question their credibility and competence to manage the economy or handle a financial crisis if one were to occur. President Trump has repeatedly patted himself on the back for a surging stock market, seemingly unaware that stocks can go down, not just up. His Treasury Department in December released a one-page analysis that made outlandish economic assumptions to justify giant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy families. Republican lawmakers in Congress went even further, attacking the Congressional Budget Office and Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, both nonpartisan, because those analysts had the temerity to warn that the tax law would add to the federal deficit. Mr. Trump wants everyone to know that his election delivered a booster shot to the economy and stocks. “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,” he told reporters in November. Truth is, the president was just lucky enough to have inherited a growing economy and a rising stock market. Though his tax cuts were an expensive gift to investors, he has not been in office long enough to have fundamentally changed that trajectory. But his erratic behavior and poor policy choices are clearly worrying the majority of Americans who disapprove of the president. One reason some investors have become nervous recently is they fear that the tax cuts, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers sold as a way to stimulate the economy, could end up hurting the economy in the not so distant future. The tax law and a push by the Trump administration to increase military spending will reduce federal revenue and force the Treasury to borrow more money when the economy is close to full employment. This could stoke inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. That, in turn, would slow the economy. The prospect of a recession or financial crisis on Mr. Trump’s watch is unnerving, because he is as confident in his own abilities as he is lacking in knowledge and sound judgment. When confronted with criticism, he lashes out like an intemperate child. On Monday, he said Democrats who did not applaud during his State of the Union address were un-American and treasonous. If the stock market falls further, will the president try to reassure the public, or will he launch a Twitter fusillade blaming the drop on, say, a conspiracy hatched by the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge fund manager who wants Mr. Trump impeached?

"TEL AVIV — It is hard to spend a week in Israel and not come away feeling that Israelis have the wind at their backs. They’ve built an awesome high-tech industry, and everyone’s kid seems to work for a start-up. Even Israeli Arabs have caught the bug — the number studying for B.A. degrees at Israeli universities rose 60 percent in the last seven years, to 47,000. Regionally, the Arabs and Palestinians have never been weaker, and under President Trump, Israel has never had a more unquestioningly friendly United States. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, asking Israel for nothing in return. The Arab states barely made a peep. Alas, though, all of this wind has whetted the appetite of Israel’s settlers and ruling Likud Party to go to extremes. Reuters reported on Dec. 31 that the “Likud Party unanimously urged legislators in a nonbinding resolution … to effectively annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, land that Palestinians want for a future state.” Sure, the world would scream “apartheid,” but Israeli rightists shrug that the world will get used to it. Nikki Haley will cover for Israel at the U.N. Sheldon Adelson will keep Trump and the G.O.P. in line. And the Arab regimes, which need Israel to counter Iran, will look the other away. It always plays out that way, and the settlers see that, so, they ask, why wait? They think they can annex the West Bank without giving Palestinians citizenship; they’ll just let the Palestinians vote in their own elections. And then it popped into my head: I’ve seen this play before. It was May 17, 1983 — the day Israel, a year after invading Lebanon, signed a peace accord with Beirut. “Signed” isn’t exactly right. Israel (backed by the U.S.) imposed virtually all its security demands on a weak Lebanese government, including a framework for normalizing trade and diplomacy. Back then, Israel also had a right-wing leader, Menachem Begin, embraced by a superfriendly President Ronald Reagan. Egypt had just signed a peace treaty and dropped out of the conflict, and another young Arab leader — Lebanese Christian warlord Bashir Gemayel — beckoned Israel to join him in crushing the Palestinians and remaking the Middle East together.

"Two leading Senate Republicans released a document late Tuesday that they said bolstered Republican allegations that the Justice Department relied heavily on a politically tainted dossier in seeking permission from a secret federal court to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide. The document, a letter sent last month to the F.B.I. and Justice Department by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, quoted from Justice Department requests to the court to spy in late 2016 and last year on the former aide, Carter Page. A classified Democratic memo seeks to rebut the Republican accusations of political bias. President Trump is expected to allow that memo to be made public, but is likely to redact parts of it, people close to the White House said. That decision is certain to anger Democratic lawmakers, who expressed concern on Tuesday that the president would edit the memo — not for national security reasons but to remove parts that he viewed as politically embarrassing or damaging. The Senate letter accuses the F.B.I. of relying largely on unverified information produced for the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign to convince a federal judge of the need to eavesdrop on Mr. Page as a possible Russian agent. The letter said the Justice Department’s initial application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to spy on Mr. Page, filed in October 2016 after he had left the Trump campaign, “appears to contain no additional information corroborating the dossier allegations” posed by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who had been working with a research firm paid by the Democrats. That court approved the surveillance for 90 days, and renewed it three times. "
"Whenever people talk about the icons of 20th-century men’s wear, there is a roster of names you can always rely on hearing. There is Cary Grant. There is Fred Astaire. There are Marlon Brando, James Dean, Robert Redford, Paul Newman and, at a slightly later date, the musicians Miles Davis, David Bowie and Bryan Ferry. Yet there is one influential figure who hardly ever gets his proper due for the abiding influence he has exerted on men’s fashion. That is Steve Urkel, the prototypical fictional nerd portrayed on the sitcom “Family Matters” by the actor Jaleel White. There are plenty of reasons Urkel should have lodged in the collective consciousness of an earlier era, not the least of these his catchphrases “Whoa, Mama!” and “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!” Yet it is the sartorially distinctive Urkel that concerns us here, he of the goggle-eyed glasses, the crisply ironed denim flood pants, the red suspenders and the grandpa cardigans. Knowingly or not, designers have been mining the Urkel style vocabulary for years — he is the geek that keeps on giving — Todd Snyder being just the latest. “I wanted to call the show ‘Jocks and Nerds,’” Mr. Snyder said backstage before his show at Pier 59 in Chelsea on Monday evening. “But then I felt the timing wasn’t right for it.” Instead he gave his show the anodyne title “Old (New) School” and then went right ahead and barreled into trigger-warning territory to exploit all the Urkel codes. There were shrunken sweaters paired with oversize denim trousers in the light blue dad wash that are catnip to millennial guys and a vague source of shame to the olds from the ’80s who wore them the first time around. There was a show-opening belted bathrobe coat in houndstooth checked wool, followed by a parade of wide-wale corduroy car coats paired with rib-hugging shirts adorned with floral patterns that screamed thrift shop dollar rack.

"WASHINGTON — As the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter is not a public figure, but he is responsible for paper flow to the president, a job of crucial importance in the Trump administration. He frequently travels with President Trump on Air Force One, and he helped write Mr. Trump’s first State of the Union address last month. But despite initial support from John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, and other West Wing staff aides, Mr. Porter announced his resignation on Wednesday, a day after his two former wives accused him in interviews of physical abuse when they were married to him. His troubles were not a complete secret at the White House: Two people close to the White House said that the allegations against him made by his former wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, had contributed to a delay in granting him a permanent security clearance. In a statement, Mr. Porter said that “these allegations are simply false,” even as details of the alleged abuse and photographs of one of his former wives with a black eye that she said he had given her were widely circulated. The White House’s initial response was consistent with the way both Mr. Trump and his aides have handled allegations of harassment or abuse against the president or his allies and advisers since the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump vigorously defended Roy S. Moore, the failed Alabama Republican Senate candidate, against allegations that included child molestation, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, has said that multiple women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct were lying. In the White House, Mr. Porter, 40, had been widely regarded as a rising star. A Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and former Senate aide, Mr. Porter was an ally of Mr. Kelly’s and a steady force in a West Wing populated by aides vying for face time with — and influence over — the president. But, a year into his job, Mr. Porter did not have the permanent security clearance that aides of his rank always have. "
"President Trump, who has taken credit for a rising stock market as a measure of his own success, complained on Twitter Wednesday that “good (great) news” in the economy led to an abrupt decline in stock prices, his first comments about the stock market since its sharp drop earlier this week. In the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the “old days,” stocks would rise on good economic news, saying “Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake.” The tweet did not elaborate on what he meant by the “old days” or explain further his analysis of why stocks plummeted on Friday and Monday. Until Wednesday’s tweet, the president had been unusually silent about the stock market, which has been rocked by volatility, including a decline in the Dow Jones industrial average of almost 7 percent over two days. At one point on Monday, the Dow was down almost 1,600 points, or about 6 percent of its total value, the markets plunging at the same moment as Mr. Trump was giving a speech in Blue Ash, Ohio. It closed that day down 1,175 points. Mr. Trump’s assertion that the fall was pegged to good economic news stems from Friday’s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment. Rising wages are good for those who receive them, and for the presidents who seek to stimulate them, but investors see them as a sign of possible inflation and higher interest rates. Analysts pegged the sell-off in stocks to the strong employment numbers as investors feared the Federal Reserve might quicken the pace of its interest rate hikes. White House officials had released only a terse statement after the market’s decline earlier this week. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement on Monday that “the President’s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers.” "
"LONDON — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada is known for pushing boundaries on how politicians deal with gender and the language surrounding it. And he appeared to have done it again recently when he told a woman she should use “peoplekind” instead of “mankind.” But on Wednesday, days after video footage of the exchange spurred accusations of sexism, Mr. Trudeau told reporters that he had made “a dumb joke.” “You all know that I don’t necessarily have the best of track records on jokes.” What was all the fuss about? Here’s a primer. The exchange occurred on Thursday in a town-hall-style meeting in Edmonton, Alberta. The unidentified woman complimented him for recognizing the “ability and power that women actually possess.” Then she said, “Maternal love is the love that’s going to change the future of mankind.” The prime minister interrupted her: “We like to say ‘peoplekind,’ not necessarily ‘mankind.’ It’s more inclusive.” "
"IN A LARGE, low-lit room is a triangle-shaped table arranged with 39 place settings, the site of a distinguished gathering. It is laid with plates that rise a few inches off the table, as if levitating, each one sumptuously painted with wings or petals or licks of flame emanating from a glowing center: variations on the vulva. As you move along the table, which is 48 feet long on each side, the plates become small sculptures, bulbous and gleaming. Beneath them are runners embroidered with elaborate designs and names in gold thread — women of accomplishment who are familiar and unfamiliar, mythical and rarely spoken of: Sappho, the ancient poet; Anna Maria van Schurman, the 17th-century artist, thinker and theologian; Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female physician in the United States. The whole assemblage stands on a floor of luminescent triangular tiles covered in more gold — 999 names of other heroic women written in curling letters. The room is like a temple — a holy place, distinct from the everyday. When Judy Chicago’s “The Dinner Party” opened on March 14, 1979, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, no one had ever seen anything like it. It was theatrical, audacious and definitively feminist: a work of stark symbolism and detailed scholarship, of elaborate ceramics and needlework that also nodded to the traditional amateurism of those forms, a communal project that was the realization of one woman’s uncompromisingly grand vision, inviting both awe and identification. It caused an immediate sensation. But that was only the beginning of its tumultuous life. One cold day in December, I met Judy Chicago, who is 78, at the Brooklyn Museum, where “The Dinner Party” is now permanently installed. Her style, like “The Dinner Party,” is flamboyant and groovy and uncategorizable. She wore jeans, a leopard-print silk shirt under a black vest embroidered with sequins and a double strand of gold beads. Her lipstick was purple, her curly hair dyed a reddish-pink, with tinted glasses to match, giving her a dreamy, psychedelic look. But the eyes peering out from behind those glasses were sharp and commanding. We walked into “The Dinner Party” accompanied by Chicago’s husband and constant companion, the photographer Donald Woodman, who that day played the part of a benign bodyguard. Chicago regarded her creation with the fierce and slightly bemused love of a parent for a grown child. The work is so thoroughly assimilated into art history that its authority feels like a given, but Chicago remains protective of it. She vividly remembers its difficult birth — the years of painstaking labor, the organizing, over five years, of a volunteer force of 400 to help her, the doubt about whether it would ever be finished and the eventual triumph of its debut. Chicago’s intention, she told me — with a mixture of self-deprecation and utter seriousness — had been to rededicate the history of Western civilization to the women who are often left out of it. She wanted to make a work so large that it could never be erased. When I asked her what it was like to be in the presence of the piece now, sadness crept into her voice. She said she felt relief. “From the beginning, you know, I was determined — it needed to be permanently housed, because if it hadn’t been, it would have simply reiterated the story of erasure it recounts. It just — I had no idea it was going to take this long.” WHEN “THE DINNER PARTY” was first shown in San Francisco, over 100,000 people came to see it in the three months it was on display. Chicago was feted in national magazines and interviewed on the radio. She received letters from women all over the country telling her how moved they were by the piece, how it had changed their lives. But a backlash was brewing.

"This awards season has been all about hitting the zeitgeist, or at least that’s what the media, present company included, has been telling itself and you. Best picture nominees ought to tap into the #MeToo moment or, failing that, anxieties born in the age of Trump. But is that narrative really true? And does it fully explain how a fairy tale about a janitor who hooks up with a fishman became the movie to beat? The film, “The Shape of Water,” stars Sally Hawkins as a cleaning lady who falls for a merman held captive in a government lab, and leads the race with 13 Oscar nominations, more than any other movie. It has also scooped up key precursor awards that often culminate in Oscar gold — last weekend, the Directors Guild of America gave the filmmaker Guillermo del Toro its top prize, two weeks after the Producers Guild of America did the same. That a fantasy film has made it this far is highly unusual. While some fantasy and sci-fi movies have been nominated for best picture (“Avatar,” “District 9,” “Inception” and “Mad Max: Fury Road”), with the exception of “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” it is hard to name one that has gone all the way. Meanwhile, should Mr. del Toro nab best director, which is expected, it will mark the fourth time a Mexican filmmaker has done so in the last five years. ¡Viva Mexico! The movie’s winning trajectory has had its bumps. “Shape” was not nominated for best ensemble performance at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and, as forecasters invariably note, no film since “Braveheart” (1995) has won the best picture Oscar without previously landing a SAG ensemble nomination. But while the winner of the SAG ensemble prize was “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” presumably making it the stiffest competition facing “Shape,” the “Three Billboards” filmmaker, Martin McDonagh, did not get an Oscar nomination for best director, while Mr. del Toro did. Advantage, fishman. "

"When Baquer Namazi, the oldest American known to be held in Iran, was released on medical leave Jan. 28 from Tehran’s infamous Evin Prison, it was an unexpected and unusual act of mercy. There was even some hope that Mr. Namazi, an 81-year-old former diplomat for Unicef, might be granted parole. On Tuesday, those hopes were dashed as the authorities ordered the ailing Mr. Namazi to return to jail, a decision so lacking in compassion that the Trump administration must intervene. “The powers that be have directed me to return to prison today despite the strong recommendation of Iran’s medical examiner and my physicians that my health cannot withstand further incarceration,” Mr. Namazi said in a note released by his American lawyer, Jared Genser. Mr. Namazi was rushed to the hospital on Jan. 15 after suffering a severe drop in blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. It was the fourth time he’d been hospitalized in the past year, including for emergency heart surgery in September to install a pacemaker. His doctors recommended a further three-month medical leave. Mr. Namazi’s family members are understandably concerned that returning to prison will jeopardize his life even more. “How can the Iranian authorities knowingly risk my father’s life, knowing it will end in a tragedy?” said Babak Namazi, one of Baquer’s sons. Another son, Siamak, 46, a businessman and dual citizen who had been an advocate for improved American-Iranian relations, remains imprisoned as well. Babak said his brother had been abused while in prison, including through electric shock. In a secretive October 2016 trial, the two men were convicted of collaborating with a hostile power — the United States. Their convictions and 10-year sentences were upheld last November on appeal. The details of the charges against them have never been fully explained. At least two other American citizens are known to be imprisoned in Iran: Xiyue Wang, a Princeton graduate student who was seized while working on his doctoral thesis, and Karan Vafadari, a Tehran art gallery owner. Another American, Robert Levinson, has been missing in Iran for more than 10 years. Other foreign citizens have also been detained, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a Briton of Iranian descent employed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, who was sentenced to five years. "
"To the Editor:  Senator Jeff Flake’s remarks denouncing President Trump’s comment regarding Democratic members of Congress who did not applaud during the State of the Union address stand in stark contrast to the silence emanating from the Senate and House leadership. These same leaders sat in silence on multiple occasions during President Obama’s State of the Union addresses, as was their privilege, and without concern that this right would be publicly characterized as “un-American” or “treasonous” by the president. Though Senator Flake and I likely differ on policy preferences, we, and many other Americans across the political spectrum, hopefully share core beliefs in the importance of civil liberties and discourse. Only through courageous stands such as Mr. Flake’s will we continue to overcome the threat to those beliefs. TIM BREWER, LOS ANGELES To the Editor: Some suggest that President Trump is diverting us from bad economic news by his preposterous claim of treason. Others have reminded us that in Stalin’s Soviet Union, refraining from applauding was in fact treasonous. And some see this as still more evidence that Mr. Trump has no idea what he is talking about. With the term “treasonous” having been uttered by Stephen Bannon (referring to a meeting involving Donald Trump Jr.), and with Robert Mueller’s investigation getting close to the president himself, I believe that Mr. Trump is purposely using the term in an offhand way so as to trivialize it, empty it of its gravity. “Somebody said treasonous. I mean, yeah, I guess, why not.” No one throws out the term “treason” quite that casually, unless he wants to turn it into nothing more than a mere insult. Fearing that it will most likely be applied to him, he wants to make us all gradually forget the weight of the accusation. EVA KITTAY, NEW YORK To the Editor: Re “Gulp. I’m Guilty of Treason,” by Frank Bruni (column, Feb. 7): In equating obsequious praise of himself with love of country, President Trump disturbingly mimics Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. Mr. Kim had his uncle Jang Song-thaek shot; his offenses included clapping only halfheartedly during Mr. Kim’s election as vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. Officially, Mr. Jang was found guilty of “treason.” Vladimir Putin, an autocrat whom Mr. Trump praises effusively, modified Russian treason laws to allow a crackdown on opposition parties, although many of Mr. Putin’s opponents seem to mysteriously vanish even without the aid of a treason prosecution. Mr. Bruni is dead on target in noting that Mr. Trump’s own actions more closely approach the true meaning of treason than those he degrades with his slurs. CARL MEZOFF, STAMFORD, CONN. "

"SEOUL, South Korea — In the run-up to the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, some South Koreans have been grumbling that this may as well be the “Pyongyang Games.” Since the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, announced on Jan. 1 that he was interested in sending a delegation to the Games, there has been a flurry of inter-Korean agreements. Twenty-two North Korean athletes will participate in the Olympics, and they will arrive with some 230 cheerleaders in tow. The two Koreas are fielding a joint women’s ice hockey team. And at the opening ceremony on Friday, they will march under a single flag, the Korean Unification Flag. The international news media has been buzzing about the new prospects for a secure peace on the Korean Peninsula, but not everyone in the South is happy about the welcome the North is receiving. And this time it’s not just the usual South Korean conservatives who are moaning. The idea that people in the South belong with their Northern brethren isn’t universal, especially among the young. The exigencies of daily life — jobs, housing, income inequality — are far more pressing than uniting with what may as well be an alien country. Unification increasingly sounds like an abstract ideal, taught only in school and repeated ad nauseam by the political class. President Moon Jae-in appears to be paying a heavy political price for the rapprochement. Engagement to foster peace is worth exploring. But pulling out all the stops to accommodate Pyongyang on the basis that the two Koreas are one “minjok” (nation) — as Mr. Moon seems to be suggesting — comes across as outdated and out of touch. "
"WASHINGTON — Senate leaders struck a far-reaching bipartisan agreement on Wednesday that would add hundreds of billions of dollars to military and domestic programs over the next two years while raising the federal debt limit, moving to end the cycle of fiscal showdowns that have roiled the Capitol. The accord between Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, his Democratic counterpart, would raise strict caps on military and domestic spending that were imposed in 2011 as part of a deal with President Barack Obama that was once seen as a key triumph for Republicans in Congress. The deal would raise the spending caps by about $300 billion over two years. The limit on military spending would be increased by $80 billion in the current fiscal year and $85 billion in the next year, which begins Oct. 1. The limit on nondefense spending would increase by $63 billion this year and $68 billion next year. But the accord was not without dramatics, and its passage in the House is not a foregone conclusion. As proof of that, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, took the House floor on Wednesday morning in opposition, protesting that the deal did nothing to bring lawmakers closer to protecting young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. She then delivered a record-breaking speech that tied up the House for the entire day and into the night. The budget agreement, coming a day after President Trump threatened to shut down the government, would effectively negate Mr. Trump’s demands to broadly reorder government with deep cuts to nondefense programs like environmental protection, foreign aid and health research that were to offset large increases in military spending. Mr. Trump is to release his second budget request on Monday, but the deal — championed by the top congressional leaders from his own party — amounts to an unequivocal rebuke of many of the budgetary demands he has put forth. The deal would give Mr. Trump military bragging rights. “The bottom line is that, thanks to President Trump, we can now have the strongest military we have ever had,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Wednesday.

"Journalists at The Los Angeles Times have repeatedly clashed with their Chicago-based parent company, Tronc. So when they heard that a local billionaire was closing in on a deal to buy the newspaper, many of them cheered. Someone even popped a bottle of champagne. On Wednesday, it was official: The Los Angeles Times was being sold to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a health care mogul and former surgeon, for $500 million. The deal includes The Times’s sibling paper, The San Diego Union-Tribune, and smaller publications in the California News Group. The deal, with Dr. Soon-Shiong’s private investment arm, Nant Capital, also includes the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. The agreement — which Tronc announced early on Wednesday, when many Times employees were still in bed — brings to a close a tumultuous period marked by the ouster of top leaders, the suspension of the newspaper’s publisher and a contentious unionization effort. In recent months, the frustration in the Times newsroom erupted into public view, as The New York Times, HuffPost and other news outlets published articles on the tensions between staff and management at the 136-year-old newspaper. With The Times receiving national attention for reasons having nothing to do with its exemplary coverage of sexual harassment in Hollywood or the natural disasters in its backyard, Tronc had a public-relations problem just as it was trying to develop new strategies for producing and distributing its journalism.

"Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier described as a Nazi by the Illinois Republican Party, is poised to win the Republican primary in the state’s Third Congressional District. He is running unopposed, all but guaranteeing he will soon be the official Republican candidate for the House of Representatives. “There’s no way in the world they can knock me off the ballot,” said Mr. Jones, 70, who has unsuccessfully sought the nomination five times. His campaign website has a section devoted to conspiracy theories about the Holocaust, which he called “nothing more than an international extortion racket.” The Republican primary in the district, a Democratic stronghold that includes part of Chicago and its southwestern suburbs, is on March 20. A spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said it had difficulty recruiting anyone to run against Mr. Jones because “it is a very Democratic district.” The final deadline for certifying primary candidates passed last month, but the spokesman said the party would consider lending its support to an independent or write-in candidate. That deadline is in June, according to the State Board of Elections. “The Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones,” the Illinois Republican Party chairman, Tim Schneider, said in a statement. “We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the Third Congressional District.” Besides Mr. Jones himself, few say he stands a chance of winning the general election in November. A Republican has not held the seat since 1975. "

In four Missouri state-legislature races last night, the Democrats ran an average of about 30 percentage points ahead of Hillary Clinton’s showing in those areas in 2016. The party also flipped one of those four seats in a major upset. “Democrats would be fools to not contest every district possible in 2018,” writes the political analyst G. Elliott Morris. “Sure, special elections are more favorable to large swings than House generals, but if there were ever a sign that some ‘Safe’ seats aren’t that safe…” Voting rights.

Both places offer a reminder that President Trump’s various attacks on democracy and the rule of law shouldn’t make anyone despondent.

First, Michigan: Voting-rights advocates there have announced that they hope to put a proposal on the ballot this year that would expand voter turnout. The proposal would allow voting by mail, as 30 other states already do — including virtually the entire western United States. The Michigan proposal would also make it easier for people to register by expanding voting hours. "

Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The headline numbers were okay: Tesla reported a loss of $3.04 per share, narrower than the $3.20 per share that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were forecasting. Tesla took in $3.29 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, more or less in line with the $3.28 billion that analysts were expecting. But a crucial measure of profitability disappointed. Tesla’s gross margin in its automotive business, which reveals the profitability of actually producing its cars, came in at 13.8 percent, below the “about 15 percent” that Tesla itself forecast when it reported third-quarter results. The culprit? The Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market car. Many of the costs associated with the Model 3 are being booked in the income statement but difficulties in producing the car mean sales are low. As a result, the gross margin on the Model 3 was negative and is expected to remain so in the first quarter of 2018, Tesla said. The company did not specify how negative the gross margin on the Model 3 was. "

"MEXICO CITY — Immigration has been on the United States-Mexico agenda for years. In recent times, three American attempts at comprehensive immigration reform, which included amnesty for undocumented Mexicans in the United States and a temporary-worker visa program, have failed. A bilateral effort between 2001 and 2003 also collapsed. Nothing affects Mexico more than United States immigration policy, and the centrality of the issue in American politics is more prominent than ever. The most urgent challenge is to find a way forward for the so-called Dreamers, the beneficiaries of President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Nearly 800,000 young people brought to the United States by their parents as children applied for and were given protected status by the Obama administration. Thanks to DACA, they no longer needed to fear deportation, were able to work legally and had realistic hopes that one day they would be on a path to citizenship in the only country they knew. More than three-fourths of the Dreamers are Mexican. That’s why people here follow their fate closely. President Trump rescinded Mr. Obama’s DACA policy. He has proposed a four-pillar overhaul of American immigration policy that most Democrats and Latinos in the United States detest. Strangely enough, however, it might benefit Mexico, especially if it is accompanied by additional changes in the issuance of temporary-worker visas, and in particular those known as H-2A and H-2B. The first pillar of Mr. Trump’s proposal — regularizing the status of the Dreamers and a million other young people who also could qualify for DACA status with a long and winding road to citizenship — works to Mexico’s advantage. Somewhere near 1.5 million of these young people are Mexican; that is roughly one-quarter of all undocumented Mexican citizens in the United States. Granting them the equivalent of amnesty, with the beacon of eventual citizenship, satisfies one of Mexico’s most crucial immigration demands. The second pillar — $25 billion for a border wall — is obviously offensive to Mexico, but the country’s lame-duck president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has been much more adamant in his opposition to paying for the wall than to its actual construction. Mr. Peña Nieto either doesn’t believe it will ever see the light of day or lacks the backbone to oppose it. But Mr. Trump’s wall is something Mexico can simultaneously reject and live with, particularly if it will take years to build and if it merely complements segments of fences erected by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. "
"To the Editor: Re “Lawyers Tell Trump to Refuse Mueller Interview” (front page, Feb. 6): So, Donald Trump’s attorneys do not want him to answer the special counsel’s questions pertaining to the Russia investigation because they fear that: 1) he will not tell the truth and thus could be charged with lying to investigators or 2) he will tell the truth and thus incriminate himself for crimes he may have committed or 3) both of the above. What a very sad state of affairs for this country when the president cannot be relied upon, or not permitted, to tell the truth. RICHARD M. CLAYTON
LEWISVILLE, N.C. To the Editor: The very idea of letting an unsupervised President Trump answer questions from Robert Mueller’s attorneys must be making Mr. Trump’s attorneys’ hair stand on end and their teeth start chattering.

"The border between the United States and Mexico is in the news every day, in ongoing debates about immigration and spending on security initiatives. But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; El Paso and Ciudad Juárez; Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales across the border in Mexico; San Diego and Tijuana; Big Bend National Park and Boquillas, Mexico. “You’ve arrived,” announced our obliviously cheerful GPS navigator, as my buddy and I stared, white-knuckled and slightly teary-eyed, at a padlocked gate barely illuminated by the headlights of our rented S.U.V. We’d already traversed 9.2 hair-raising miles of a twisty, sandy unpaved road that an early-December freeze had turned into icy slush, our tires shifting side to side, our high beams no match for the pitch-black darkness. And now we were wondering what it was going to be like to spend the night in the car, in a vast, sparsely populated patch of far West Texas. But, after a few deep breaths and a modicum of quarreling, we carefully reversed course and slipped and slid 9.2 miles back to the main road, taking comfort in the jackrabbits playfully crossing our path in a single bound and Don Williams serenading us with “I Believe in You” on the satellite radio (“I don’t believe … that right is right and left is wrong, and north and south can’t get along”). Back on blessed pavement, and this time following the explicit instructions I had confidently ignored, we made our way to Terlingua Ranch, a community nestled in the snow-dusted Christmas Mountains, to a gorgeous rental house (where, incidentally, the heat would malfunction and we’d sleep fully clothed in a 41-degree bedroom, blue with cold and tickled pink to be alive). It’s hard to convey how humbling it is to visit this little pocket of the United States-Mexico border, a place the National Park Service calls “one of the last remaining wild corners of the United States.” Boosters market Texas as a “whole other country,” but the land within and without Big Bend National Park really is. One of the least-visited of the federal park system, Big Bend is four hours by car from each of the nearest international airports, in El Paso and Midland. You have to really want to get here (or live here, which makes you a different breed altogether). And those who do, those inclined to make the long trek to the park and its attendant ghost towns (Lajitas, Study Butte, Terlingua), are seekers of a sort, not entirely unlike the homesteaders and fortune hunters drawn to these badlands long ago.

"WASHINGTON — Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, took the House floor at 10:04 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday, intent on speaking about the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. Eight hours and seven minutes later, she quit talking. Her marathon monologue — highly unusual for the House, which has no equivalent to the Senate filibuster — appears to have set the record for the longest continuous speech in the chamber, dating to at least 1909, according to the House historian. It tied up the House into the evening, delaying debate on a bill intended to spur competition in the mortgage market. It also demonstrated, yet again, why Ms. Pelosi, 77, of California, remains one of the most enduring — and to many, infuriating — figures in Washington. “I am reminded that there are members who come to this great chamber to make speeches, and there are those who come to make laws,” an irritated-sounding Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, said when Ms. Pelosi wrapped up. “When it comes to speeches, I would note that the Gettysburg Address came in at two minutes, and Americans may think it had greater eloquence.” Ms. Pelosi’s speech came as Republicans were scrambling to pass legislation to keep the government open. A short-term funding bill expires at midnight Thursday. "
"Recent political history has offered few spectacles more depressing than the acquiescence of leading Republican politicians to the rise of Donald Trump. The selection of a nominee for president is an act of moral gravity, and party elites have an obligation to resist and exclude figures who are ethically and temperamentally unfit to wield the presidency’s powers. That so many Republicans, while obviously believing Trump unfit on both counts, followed strategic failure with moral abdication and essentially shrugged at his ascent was an indictment of their leadership and a reason to root for their defeat. I am less persuaded, however, by the argument that what leading Republicans have done since Donald Trump was elected president has been somehow more disastrous and morally culpable than their original surrender, and that conservatives who declined to vote for Trump but otherwise still voted Republican in 2016 should look at what’s happened since and begin voting lock step for the Democrats. You hear this argument implied by liberals of all stripes, but it’s brought to a sharp point in The Atlantic this month by Ben Wittes and Jonathan Rauch, both writers who generally deserve the label “centrist.” Urging a “boycott” of the G.O.P., they write that “the Republican Party, as an institution, has become a danger to the rule of law and the integrity of our democracy,” and that it therefore makes sense not only for swing voters but even for principled conservatives to cast ballots for the Democrats at every level until the danger of Trumpist authoritarianism has passed. As a conservative who opposed Trump, attacked the party for nominating him, argued that he could reasonably be removed from office for unfitness, and generally regards the G.O.P. as a broken vehicle for serious policymaking, I am pretty close to the target audience for the Rauch and Wittes argument. So let me explain why — for now — I think their case falls short. Basically, Republican politicians who accommodated themselves to Trump during the 2016 campaign offered the following reassurance to their more Trump-wary voters: Vote for us, and we will contain him. Yes, the Republican nominee indulged in wildly irresponsible and authoritarian rhetoric; yes, if he followed through on many of his promises, various disasters could ensue. But vote for us, and we will contain him. There were good reasons to be skeptical of this promise. The presidency’s powers (over foreign policy especially) have waxed as Congress’s have waned, the bully pulpit belongs to the White House, and since Trump’s populist ideas on economics were more popular than the existing G.O.P. agenda, it was easy to see how he could roll over efforts at containment.

From reality TV to the White House and back again — it’s been quite a ride for Omarosa Manigault Newman, who left the Trump administration last month under disputed circumstances. She’ll go from being a communications director to being shut off from the outside world in the first American celebrity iteration of “Big Brother.” Eleven contestants, who also include the former basketball player Metta World Peace and Keshia Knight Pulliam of “The Cosby Show,” will make small talk, form friendships, bicker and betray one another under 24-hour surveillance; they compete for a $250,000 grand prize.

That marker means little, though, since she was on TV just last week in peak enraged form: She ripped into, among many things, the president’s State of the Union address, the Nunes memo, Paul Ryan’s morals, and workplace harassment. She also set aside her differences with the former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson in an interview about forced arbitration. This week will no doubt bring more sarcasm-laced tirades.

While the original series featured five gay men giving advice in New York, this new version will head deep into Trump territory in rural Georgia, where heavily bearded, working-class men will receive tips on fashion, eating habits, design and grooming. The show also ventures into political territory, including a discussion about police brutality. "
"Stocks fell Wednesday in a seesaw trading session, as markets sought direction after several tumultuous days of trading. After registering a 1.7 percent gain on Tuesday, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index spent much of Wednesday in positive territory, led by large industrial companies positioned to capitalize on global growth and investors hunting for potential bargains from recent selling. But slumping oil prices weighed on the energy stocks throughout the afternoon. Crude oil futures closed down 2.5 percent in New York. Exxon Mobil fell 1.8 percent, and Chevron dropped 1.6 percent. The energy sector, which fell 1.7 percent, helped pull the S.&P. 500 back into negative territory in the last hour of trading. The broad index fell 0.5 percent. Other indexes also dropped. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9 percent. "
"Last March, the Pentagon’s top general for Africa made a rare trip to Capitol Hill, bearing a sobering double-barreled warning. “The instability in Libya and North Africa may be the most significant near-term threat to U.S. and allies’ interests on the continent,” the general, Thomas D. Waldhauser, told lawmakers. But perhaps just as concerning, he indicated, were intelligence reports that Russia was helping a former Libyan general turned military strongman in a fight for control over the country’s government and vast oil resources. In fact, just two months earlier, in a brazen assertion of the Kremlin’s growing Middle East ambitions, Russia’s only aircraft carrier had entered Libyan waters and, with great fanfare, welcomed aboard the militia leader, Gen. Khalifa Haftar. During his campaign for president, Donald J. Trump made the United States-backed NATO operation that toppled Libya’s dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, a cornerstone of his critique of President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy. The 2011 intervention left Libya with dueling governments — one recognized by the United States and the international community, the other aligned with General Haftar. In the chaos, Libya also became a safe haven for the Islamic State. But despite a terrorist attack in Britain last spring whose Libyan roots offered a gruesome reminder that the Islamic State in Libya remains a deadly threat, the Trump administration has yet to arrive at a coherent policy for the country. On one hand, the president has said he sees no role for the United States in Libya; on the other, he has said the United States must fight the Islamic State there. The resulting policy vacuum, according to Libyan officials, American military commanders and intelligence analysts, has helped Russia spread its growing influence in one of the most dangerous parts of the world. For months, the questions around Mr. Trump and Russia have largely focused on a different issue: whether anyone in the president’s inner circle was complicit in Moscow’s effort to disrupt the 2016 election. But even as the president’s approach to Libya offers a case study of what critics say is the dysfunction that permeates his overall foreign policy, it also illustrates the curious dynamic that characterizes his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. "
"‘America first does not mean America alone,” President Trump declared last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This sudden burst of pragmatism from an avowed nationalist showed what a difference a year can make. Denouncing the “false song of globalism” during his presidential campaign, Trump, on his third full day in office, canceled the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade deal with Japan and 10 other countries. He then denounced Canada, Germany and South Korea for exporting more to the United States than they import. He promised to renegotiate trade pacts with Europe, Canada and Mexico and get a better deal for American workers. In Davos, however, he reached out with conciliatory words to the very free-trading and globalizing elites he has consistently maligned. Clearly, Trump’s views on trade and globalization have evolved since his insurgent campaign. This may well be because of the rapid gains in the past year of a country he did not mention by name. In fact, Trump chose in Davos to affirm that “America is open for business” because it was in these same Alpine heights, three days before Trump was inaugurated as president, that China seized the opportunity to claim leadership of the global economy. With the United States seemingly in a protectionist crouch, China had become, despite all its problems, indispensable. “In a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China,” Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, said last year while introducing his guest, the Chinese president and general secretary of China’s Communist Party, Xi Jinping. As the usual gaggle of hedge-funders, Silicon Valley executives and government officials looked on, Xi rose to defend free trade and globalization against the relentless attacks of Trump. “Some people blame economic globalization for the chaos in our world,” Xi said. “One should not retreat to the harbor when encountering a storm, for this will never get us to the other shore of the ocean.” Xi then confidently quoted Dickens. “ ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ These are the words used by the English writer Charles Dickens to describe the world after the Industrial Revolution. Today, we also live in a world of contradictions.” Never mind that Dickens was actually describing the world before the French Revolution. Xi’s claim of openness was, to say the least, riddled with contradictions of its own. It is increasingly difficult for foreign companies to do business in China; Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial policy aims to increase “indigenous innovation” and self-reliance. When Trump, a year later in Davos, denounced such “unfair economic practices” as “industrial subsidies and pervasive state-led economic planning,” there was little doubt which nation he had in mind. Yet Xi is entitled to some of his rhetorical point-scoring. The financial crisis of 2008 greatly weakened the American economy, but it left China relatively unscathed. More important, China, whose share of world trade in the mid-1970s was less than 0.5 percent, is today the world’s leading exporter — the hub of new and increasingly dense transcontinental trading networks that bypass the United States. “When the United States grows, so does the world,” Trump claimed in Davos. But America’s status as the linchpin of the global economic order is now endangered. The trading system China dominates has reduced the long dependency of Latin American and sub-Saharan African countries on American and European markets. China is now bringing to a close the first phase of globalization, begun by Europe and the United States in the 19th century. In the process, it is making East Asia the new center of the world economy. It has fallen upon Trump, as president of the United States, to respond to this momentous historic shift, and he has done so with his characteristic mix of threats, boasts and volte-faces. But to grasp China’s economic achievement, and its ramifications, it is imperative to ask: Why has a market economy directed by a Communist state become the world’s second-largest? Or, to rephrase the question: Why shouldn’t it have? Why shouldn’t China’s rise have happened the way it did, with state-led economic planning, industrial subsidies and little or no regard for the rules of “free trade”? "
"D
rew was 8 years old when he was flipping through TV channels at home and landed on “Girls Gone Wild.” A few years later, he came across HBO’s late-night soft-core pornography. Then in ninth grade, he found online porn sites on his phone. The videos were good for getting off, he said, but also sources for ideas for future sex positions with future girlfriends. From porn, he learned that guys need to be buff and dominant in bed, doing things like flipping girls over on their stomach during sex. Girls moan a lot and are turned on by pretty much everything a confident guy does. One particular porn scene stuck with him: A woman was bored by a man who approached sex gently but became ecstatic with a far more aggressive guy. But around 10th grade, it began bothering Drew, an honor-roll student who loves baseball and writing rap lyrics and still confides in his mom, that porn influenced how he thought about girls at school. Were their breasts, he wondered, like the ones in porn? Would girls look at him the way women do in porn when they had sex? Would they give him blow jobs and do the other stuff he saw? Drew, who asked me to use one of his nicknames, was a junior when I first met him in late 2016, and he told me some of this one Thursday afternoon, as we sat in a small conference room with several other high school boys, eating chips and drinking soda and waiting for an after-school program to begin. Next to Drew was Q., who asked me to identify him by the first initial of his nickname. He was 15, a good student and a baseball fan, too, and pretty perplexed about how porn translated into real life. Q. hadn’t had sex — he liked older, out-of-reach girls, and the last time he had a girlfriend was in sixth grade, and they just fooled around a bit. So he wasn’t exactly in a good position to ask girls directly what they liked. But as he told me over several conversations, it wasn’t just porn but rough images on Snapchat, Facebook and other social media that confused him. Like the GIF he saw of a man pushing a woman against a wall with a girl commenting: “I want a guy like this.” And the one Drew mentioned of the “pain room” in “Fifty Shades of Grey” with a caption by a girl: “This is awesome!” Watching porn also heightened Q.’s performance anxiety. “You are looking at an adult,” he told me. “The guys are built and dominant and have a big penis, and they last a long time.” And if you don’t do it like the guys in porn, Drew added, “you fear she’s not going to like you.” Leaning back in his chair, Drew said some girls acted as if they wanted some thug rather than a smart, sensitive guy. But was it true desire? Was it posturing? Was it what girls thought they were supposed to want? Neither Q. nor Drew knew. A couple of seats away, a sophomore who had been quiet until then added that maybe the girls didn’t know either. “I think social media makes girls think they want something,” he said, noting he hadn’t seen porn more than a handful of times and disliked it. “But I think some of the girls are afraid.” “It gets in your head,” Q. said. “If this girl wants it, then maybe the majority of girls want it.” He’d heard about the importance of consent in sex, but it felt pretty abstract, and it didn’t seem as if it would always be realistic in the heat of the moment. Out of nowhere was he supposed to say: Can I pull your hair? Or could he try something and see how a girl responded? He knew that there were certain things — “big things, like sex toys or anal” — that he would not try without asking. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — The only sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, will visit South Korea this week, the first immediate member of the North’s ruling family ever to set foot in the South, officials said on Wednesday. Kim Yo-jong, Mr. Kim’s younger sister and a key player in his secretive regime, will arrive in South Korea on Friday as part of North Korea’s 22-member government delegation that will attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics later that day. The North Korean delegation’s three-day itinerary includes a meeting with President Moon Jae-in of the South. Her bloodline gives her an unmatched status among North Korean elites. She is also considered Mr. Kim’s closest relative. The South Korean news media call her “Kim Jong-un’s Ivanka,” likening her influence with her brother to that of Ivanka Trump’s on her father, President Trump. The North’s state news media often shows top-ranking officials listening reverentially when Ms. Kim speaks. And she will be coming to a spectacle that is also drawing Vice President Mike Pence, who will be at the opening ceremony Friday, and Ms. Trump, who is expected at the closing ceremony. The gathering is prompting speculation about some previously unthinkable get-togethers. The North’s delegation is officially led by Kim Yong-nam, the 90-year-old president of the Presidium of the North’s Parliament and the country’s nominal head of state. But being a sister of Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “monolithic” leader, Ms. Kim will become the focus of intense attention. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Stephen Colbert tried Tuesday to convince President Trump that he should testify before the special counsel, Robert Mueller, something Trump’s lawyers are hoping to prevent. Colbert taunted Trump on “The Late Show,” calling him “chicken” for not agreeing to testify. In a speech on Monday, Trump seemed to suggest that Democrats who did not applaud during his State of the Union address had been committing “treason.” Trevor Noah was dismayed. Then Noah played a statement from the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said that Trump had been joking. Noah admitted that maybe she had a point: Trump’s speeches might play better on a stand-up comedy stage. He tested the theory with a computer-assisted simulation. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The wild market swings of the past few days can be traced to the positive U.S. jobs report on Friday, a sign of a strengthening economy in which workers are finally earning higher wages. But the report also raised fears of inflation and the possibility that the Federal Reserve would react by raising interest rates. Global markets lacked a decisive direction today. On Tuesday, a Times photographer visited Wall Street, which regained some of the losses from the sell-off a day before. We answered some readers’ questions about the market turmoil, and suggest six things to ask yourself before selling shares. • Here are the latest numbers from the U.S. and around the world. • What have stocks been telling us lately? In all likelihood, not much, our senior economics correspondent suggests. More important are other economic data and the bond markets, which are offering a brighter picture than share indexes. "
"BERLIN — After more than four months of tortuous negotiations, with her fate and Germany’s hanging in the balance, Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday announced a deal for a new government. But it was telling that Ms. Merkel, in power for 12 years, looked more weary than jubilant. The new deal with the same old coalition partners — her conservative alliance and the left-leaning Social Democrats — is precisely the government that Germans had voted against in inconclusive elections last September. It leaves the far-right Alternative for Germany as the country’s leading opposition party. And it comes at a high cost for Ms. Merkel, the incredible shrinking chancellor, who had to relinquish key ministries. But what is troubling for many Germans is not necessarily bad news for Europe, which for years has depended on stability in Berlin and has been waiting in limbo as Ms. Merkel stumbled toward a deal. The new arrangement must still be approved by the Social Democrats’ rank and file. But if endorsed, the coalition may provide France’s new president, Emmanuel Macron, with the partner he has been looking for to help buck up the European Union and move it away from the austerity policies that were identified with Ms. Merkel’s old team and often blamed for stifling growth. “Good news also for Europe!” tweeted Pierre Moscovici, the French finance commissioner of the European Union. In the new coalition, the powerful German Finance Ministry, once led by a hard-line Merkel ally, Wolfgang Schäuble, will be run by a Social Democrat. The party was critical of the government’s tightfisted policies and may prove more flexible. "

"It has been over six years since I last floated in zero gravity through the tunnel that connects the space shuttle to the International Space Station. I visited this orbiting laboratory on four occasions between 2001 and 2011. Every time I approached the station, I was in awe of its complexity and its beauty. But more than anything, I was in awe of the fact that we had the nerve to even attempt to build something of this magnitude. It was the United States that led the international coalition of 16 nations to build the space station. Constructing this outpost in outer space took dozens of missions spanning well over a decade to complete, and considerable money. It is clearly one of the more complicated engineering projects humans have undertaken. It’s not perfect and it’s not designed to last forever, but what the International Space Station offers humans and nations is remarkable: an important opportunity to collaborate on shared scientific goals, mostly free from politics and almost entirely free from the influences of our planet. In the years since I left NASA, the space station has started to experience a surge in commercial activity. Two companies, SpaceX and Orbital ATK, now regularly deliver cargo to the station. Just this week, SpaceX launched the Falcon 9 Heavy, a rocket powerful enough to lift 141,000-pound payloads. And after a few years’ hiatus, crew members will once again leave American soil for space and make their way to the space station as soon as next year, courtesy of Boeing and SpaceX. There’s more: The aerospace company Sierra Nevada is planning to deliver cargo in the near future. And Bigelow Aerospace has visions of private customers paying to visit the space station, staying overnight in an attached inflatable module built by the company — a hotel in space. The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, a nongovernmental organization, now manages commercial science for the space station. "
"An F.B.I. investigation into the mysterious death of a Border Patrol agent found unconscious off a remote West Texas highway in November has been unable to determine how he was injured, though the bureau said on Wednesday that it had found no evidence suggesting he had been attacked. In a statement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it could not find anyone who had witnessed the episode in which the agent, Rogelio Martinez, was killed besides his partner, Stephen Garland, who survived but has no recollection of what happened. “This investigation has not conclusively determined how Mr. Martinez and his partner ended up at the bottom of the culvert and no suspects have been linked to this incident,” the F.B.I. said. Just hours after the agents, who had been on duty, were found in a dark culvert off Interstate 10, about 100 miles east of El Paso, politicians seized on the news as a flash point in a broader debate about immigration and border security. President Trump called it an “attack” and further evidence that a wall was needed along the United States’ border with Mexico. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said it underscored the constant dangers of safeguarding often rugged and remote terrain. But the F.B.I. report makes clear that the authorities knew very little in the moments after the episode. There was, however, a faint clue: Disoriented and injured, Mr. Garland called a Border Patrol dispatcher for backup because they had both been injured. He also said something about running into a culvert, but the dispatcher could not make out exactly what he said. "
"A prominent Black Lives Matter activist was shot and killed while riding a bike in New Orleans early on Tuesday morning. The activist, Muhiyidin Moye, 32, is known for leaping across yellow police tape to snatch a Confederate battle flag from a demonstrator in Charleston, S.C., last year, an act that was captured on a live news broadcast. But Mr. Moye, who also went by the last name d’Baha, had spent years fighting for racial equality as an activist and protester. The police found Mr. Moye bleeding near a mountain bike on Bienville Street in New Orleans shortly after 1 a.m. on Tuesday. He had been shot in the leg, and the police report said officers followed a trail of blood that led them back to a bullet fragment a few blocks away from where Mr. Moye was found. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he died of his wounds, and the Orleans Parish Coroner’s Office called the death a homicide. It remains unclear whether Mr. Moye was intentionally targeted, and the police did not answer questions about whether any suspect had been identified. “The incident is the subject of an active and ongoing investigation,” said Beau Tidwell, a spokesman for the New Orleans Police Department. New Orleans has one of the highest murder rates in the United States, with 157 murders in 2017. "
"WASHINGTON — When the White House wants to gather evangelicals for one of its many issue-specific “listening sessions,” the Rev. Johnnie Moore is often one of the first to hear. It wasn’t always clear that Mr. Moore, a 34-year-old Southern Baptist minister who was a co-chairman of the Trump campaign’s evangelical advisory board, would be a frequent White House guest. Some critics, and even some evangelicals, wondered whether conservative Christians’ sometimes uneasy alliance with the Trump campaign was a marriage of convenience that would be abandoned after Inauguration Day. But one year in, conservative religious leaders are hailing the president’s actions in office. “This White House, the front door is open to evangelicals,” said Mr. Moore, who estimates that he has visited at least 20 times since Mr. Trump took office, averaging nearly once every other week. “It hasn’t been evangelicals reaching into the White House. It’s been the White House reaching out to evangelicals. Not a day goes by when there aren’t a dozen evangelical leaders in the White House for something.” This week will be a culmination of those ties. On Thursday, Mr. Moore will join what he calls the “Super Bowl for peacemakers” here: the annual National Prayer Breakfast, where around 3,000 clergy members, politicians and business leaders will eat, network and listen to speeches, including one from President Trump. Mr. Trump will stand before an audience that has cheered the president’s first-year agenda as its own: announcing that the American Embassy in Israel would move to Jerusalem, anointing a national “prayer Sunday,” appointing Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, signing anti-abortion legislation, opening a “conscience and religious freedom division” at the Department of Health and Human Services and fighting to end the Johnson Amendment, which threatens religious organizations with the loss of their tax-exempt status if they endorse political candidates. Many evangelicals did not see such a list of accomplishments as inevitable. Mr. Trump’s formal evangelical advisory board ended with the campaign. But his continued attention to evangelical causes is not a coincidence. Mr. Moore and others have helped remnants of the board remain active in the White House, providing the administration with a constellation of religious figures to lend its platform gravitas among evangelicals.

"Congress now appears likely to reach a budget deal to keep the government functioning without treating as bargaining chips hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children. It also appears, though, that President Trump will consider undoing his threat of deportation for these young “Dreamers” only if Congress considers the first deep cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s. The changes the president is demanding stem from a nativist, zero-sum view that what’s good for immigrants is bad for America. That view runs counter not just to the best of American tradition and principles, but to evidence of what’s best for the country. The programs targeted by Mr. Trump are designed to make legal immigration more diverse and humane. One is the lottery system that offers the chance for visas to people from countries that are underrepresented as sources of American immigrants; the other is family-based immigration, which offers visas to close relatives of citizens and legal residents. Mr. Trump, who has regularly smeared immigrants as terrorists and criminals, has lately been focusing his fear-mongering on the diversity visa program. Last month, his Department of Homeland Security released a report that dishonestly claimed that those who entered the country via the lottery were more likely to be tied to terrorist attacks. The Cato Institute found that lottery visa holders actually killed only eight of 3,037 Americans murdered by foreign-born terrorists since 1975. The immigrants chosen in the lottery, moreover, are not chosen “without any regard for skill, merit or the safety of our people,” as Mr. Trump said in his State of the Union address. They must have at least a high school education or two years of experience in skilled work, and they must also undergo criminal, national security and medical checks. The 50,000 recipients of the visas are not guaranteed permanent residence, only a chance at getting through the rest of the immigration process. Mr. Trump has said that the family reunification program — which he and other immigration opponents prefer to call “chain migration” — opens the floodgates to “virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.” In fact, relatives other than spouses, parents and minor children are subject to annual caps and country quotas, so that, today, the backlog is almost four million applicants, most of them facing many years of waiting to get a visa. Mr. Trump would allow no new applicants other than immediate family members, and even these would no longer include parents. Imposing these restrictions and ending the diversity visa lottery would cut in half the number of legal immigrants. "
"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence, dispatched to Asia to blunt a North Korean charm offensive at South Korea’s Olympic Games, said Wednesday that the United States planned to levy the toughest sanctions yet on the North over its nuclear and missile programs. Mr. Pence’s threat, delivered in Tokyo, came two days after he had signaled openness to meeting with North Korean officials at the Games, somewhat muddying the harsh message he had been sent to project. But in Japan, the vice president quickly reverted to form. Speaking alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr. Pence said he planned to “stand with our allies and remind the world that North Korea is the most tyrannical and oppressive regime on the planet.” “We will continue to intensify our maximum pressure campaign until North Korea takes concrete steps toward complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” Mr. Pence said. He did not detail the precise timing or content of the sanctions. Analysts said they could target Chinese firms that do business with North Korea. The Olympics, which open Friday in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang, are likely to showcase the diplomatic thaw between North and South, with the two teams marching together in the opening ceremony under a single flag and competing together in women’s ice hockey. On Friday, North Korea announced it would send the only sister of its leader, Kim Jong-un, to South Korea as a member of its official delegation. That sets up at least the possibility of a landmark meeting with Mr. Pence, though Mr. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, is under Treasury Department sanctions for her role in North Korea’s human rights abuses, which would make a meeting highly unlikely.

"Do you remember back when everybody thought John Kelly was going to calm down the Trump White House? Stop laughing. Although it has been another wow of a week, hasn’t it? We had one top administration official, Rob Porter, resigning over claims of domestic abuse regarding two ex-wives. Kelly defended Porter as “a friend, a confidant and a trusted professional” shortly before a picture popped up of one former Mrs. Porter sporting a black eye. This was a little bit after Kelly himself made headlines for suggesting that some young immigrants couldn’t qualify for federal help because they were just “too lazy to get off their asses” and file some paperwork. Meanwhile the president, apparently unsupervised, was calling for a government shutdown and lobbying enthusiastically for an expensive new military parade. Because he saw one in Paris and thought it was cool. A good chief of staff advises the president against doing things that will make the administration look stupid or crazy. So, are we all in agreement that Kelly, retired general turned Trump chief of staff, appears to be … a failure? And sort of a jerk in the bargain? When Kelly first came over to run the Trump team there was near-unanimous expectation that he’d be the adult in the room. And indeed the chain of command got more efficient and some problem employees were evicted. However, there’s a limit to how long you can live off your laurels for firing Omarosa and The Mooch. Kelly did nothing about the fact that the White House is loud and mean and generally unfathomable. Except make things even worse. This, after all, is the guy who’s intervened whenever Donald Trump is in his expansive give-me-an-immigration-bill-to-sign phase, and pushed him over to Haiti-is-a-shithole territory. "
"President Trump and Devin Nunes have been muddying the waters of the Russia investigation, so let’s try to clarify those waters so that they’re as clear as vodka. Here are a dozen things we know. 1. Russia interfered in the U.S. election. The U.S. intelligence community concluded that President Vladimir Putin had “a clear preference” for Trump and “ordered an influence campaign” to hurt Hillary Clinton. The Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states that Russian hackers (mostly unsuccessfully) had targeted their election systems before the 2016 election. Russia oversaw an online campaign using fake American accounts to spread anti-Clinton messages. Twitter found that 50,000 Russian accounts fired off 2.1 million election-related tweets in the fall of 2016, and in the final weeks around the election accounted for 4.25 percent of retweets of Trump’s own account. 2. Trump has longstanding business interests in Russia. The Times has explored these, beginning with a trip to Moscow in 1987 to try to build a hotel there. As recently as 2013 on another Moscow visit he was still optimistic, tweeting “TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next,” but the buildings have never come to fruition. More successfully, Trump has attracted murky investments from Russia, raising speculation that Russia might have gained some leverage over him. A Russian oligarch paid Trump an eyebrow-raising $95 million for one Florida property. A Reuters investigation found that people with Russian addresses or passports had invested nearly $100 million in seven Trump properties in southern Florida. “I know the Russians better than anybody,” Trump boasted in 2014. 3. Trump has consistently displayed a soft spot for Putin. At various times, Trump has described Putin as “so nice,” “so smart” and doing “an amazing job.” Trump defended Putin from allegations that he interfered in elections and killed journalists. “You think our country is so innocent?” he scoffed. Trump told another interviewer, “I think our country does plenty of killing also.” "
"WASHINGTON — Two weeks ago, the Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer could barely look at each other on the floor as Congress careened into a government shutdown. Their relationship was considered so badly frayed that a bipartisan group of lawmakers intervened to help them save face and temporarily end the impasse. Yet on Wednesday, the two happily linked arms and delivered a major budget deal containing eye-popping spending increases and clear political benefits for both sides as lawmakers head into a crucial midterm election season. It just shows how tens of billions of appropriately scattered dollars can soothe any hard feelings. The agreement, the subject of intense private negotiations between Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been percolating for days. They consulted with Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, but the White House, by design, did not play a big role in the talks. Mr. Schumer gleefully pointed out that fact on the floor by noting that the deal “was completed without a great deal of help from the White House.” The talks got serious immediately after the shutdown when Mr. McConnell approached Mr. Schumer and asked how they should proceed on the spending divide. They ended Tuesday in Mr. McConnell’s office with Mr. Schumer inviting Mr. McConnell, a die-hard University of Louisville basketball fan, to New York to attend a future Louisville game against Syracuse University. (By earlier arrangement, Mr. Schumer will speak Monday at the university’s McConnell Center.) Both sides were heavily invested in trying to produce a result that would get them out of the stubborn cycle of budget dysfunction and, just as important, get them through the November elections without another politically damaging shutdown or threat to default on the federal debt.

"Through March 10. Nancy Hoffman Gallery, 520 West 27th Street, Manhattan; 212-966-6676, nancyhoffmangallery.com. Peter Plagens, now 76, has devoted most of his life to making paintings and writing about art. He will probably be best remembered for his stylish, cleareyed art criticism, which these days appears regularly in The Wall Street Journal. But persistence pays, and Mr. Plagens is now making the best paintings of his career. Like his writing, they are witty and knowing. They are also hard won, the results of more than a decade spent trying out different combinations of three or four specific abstract styles. His latest amalgam — the simplest and most balanced — is an eye-teasing sandwich of contrasting formalist strategies. The paintings seem to begin with an allover field of semiautomatic drawing: fast and furious squiggles, loops and grids, rendered in graphite and charcoal and annotated with watery color. Most of this activity is then blocked out by a big, squarish expanse of opaque color — juicy orange, lavender-gray or deep aqua. It’s a failed monochrome with wildly irregular edges and broad bands of drawing left exposed. Plunked into the center of this field is an irregular polygon, built from six or seven shards of bright color. This passing reference to hard-edged geometric abstraction, which the artist calls a badge, also evokes the big resin paintings of Ron Davis, an avatar of the Los Angeles art scene in the 1960s, when Mr. Plagens began his career there. Finally, the borders are gone over with flat white, as if a referee were moving in and out of the action, covering drips and editing down the outlying borders of drawing to blurry skirmishes at the frayed edges of the monochrome. Like most painters, Mr. Plagens has borrowed more than he has invented, but he’s never done it with such confidence. He is fully present in these smart, glamorous, high-spirited works. They take things we’ve seen before and put them together in ways we haven’t. ROBERTA SMITH Through March 11. Kai Matsumiya, 153 ½ Stanton Street, Manhattan; 646-838-9595, kaimatsumiya.com. "
"The subway turnstile — low enough to vault, ubiquitous enough to figure in the lives of millions of New Yorkers each day — has long served as a kind of dragnet for the Police Department. There, officers lie in wait, nabbing those who skip the fare. Of late, these rotating entry points and those who jump them have become stumbling blocks for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who despite his liberal credentials, has been vocally opposed to the Manhattan district attorney’s office's new policy of declining to prosecute most who are arrested over fare evasion. Mr. de Blasio, a champion of improving the lot of poor New Yorkers, has adamantly defended the police practice of using evasion of the $2.75 fare as a means for officers to check the names and warrants of those they stop, most of whom are black or Hispanic. He has been unpersuaded by critics on the left who believe the approach — pioneered in the 1990s by William J. Bratton, Mr. de Blasio’s first police commissioner — is a form of biased and overly aggressive policing akin to stop-and-frisk. And he does not think most are motivated by poverty. “A lot of people who commit fare evasion and the police encounter have a lot of money on them,” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference at Police Headquarters on Tuesday. “I think I have a lot of validity on the question of income inequality and how we fight it, but you never heard me say, you know, open up the gates of the subway for free. That’s chaos.” Before the mayor spoke, police officials highlighted a rise in crime on subways in Manhattan, specifically a jump in robberies: There have been 19 so far this year, up from nine in the same period a year ago.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “A genuine breakthrough.” That’s what Senator Chuck Schumer called the far-reaching budget deal he struck with Senator Mitch McConnell in a rare bipartisan moment. The agreement would add hundreds of billions of dollars to military and domestic programs over the next two years. But it has only tomorrow to pass in the House before a federal shutdown, and there’s opposition on both sides of the aisle there. Representative Nancy Pelosi spoke on the House floor for hours to protest the bill, which did not include protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. Above, a TV screen showed footage of her remarks on Capitol Hill. ____ "
"WASHINGTON — Tanks, jets and other killing machines painted olive-drab and tan could be rolling the routes of the nation’s capital later this year for a peacetime parade inspired by President Trump. The Pentagon is in the planning stages for an event that was last held in Washington in the summer of 1991, after the end of the roughly 41-day gulf war was celebrated with a $12 million dollar victory parade. But on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis avoided the word “parade” when tersely responding to reporters at the White House who asked about the possible show of force. “We’re all aware in this country of the president’s affection and respect for the military,” Mr. Mattis said. “We have been putting together some options, we will send them up to the White House for decision.” With the Pentagon plagued with readiness and budget issues, a massive display of military spectacle won’t come cheap or easily. It also very likely runs contrary to Mr. Mattis’s priorities. The Washington Post first reported the Pentagon’s planning for a parade on Tuesday. Mr. Trump and his advisers first floated the idea of a parade of military convoys through Washington soon after he was elected. The committee planning his inaugural ceremony reportedly explored, but rejected, the idea of highlighting military equipment in the traditional parade, from the Capitol to the White House, after Mr. Trump was sworn in.

"Joseph Polchinski, one of the most creative physicists of his generation, whose work helped lay the mathematical foundation for the controversial proposition that our universe is only one in an almost endless assemblage that cosmologists call the “multiverse,” died on Friday at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 63. His death was announced by the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he was a longtime professor and a permanent member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. He had been treated for brain cancer since late 2015. Dr. Polchinski was a giant force in the development of string theory, the ambitious attempt to achieve a “theory of everything,” which envisions the fundamental particles of nature as tiny wriggling strings. The theory has brought forth ideas and calculations that have opened new fields of study and new visions of a universe that is weirder and richer than astronomers had dreamed. In recent years, Dr. Polchinski’s investigation of black holes, the Einsteinian monsters that gobble light and everything else, uncovered a mystery that calls into question what scientists thought they understood about how these objects work. The Firewall Paradox, as he and his collaborators called it, led to a firestorm of speculation about the nature of gravity and space-time. Raphael Bousso of the University of California, Berkeley, who worked with him, said in an email interview that Dr. Polchinski “ranks among the greatest theorists of the last half-century.” Joseph Gerard Polchinski Jr. was born in White Plains on May 16, 1954, the eldest of two children. His father was a financial consultant and manager; his mother, the former Joan Thornton, was an office worker and homemaker. "
"The United States has the world’s most capable fighting force. But do we really want to spike the ball at a time when the country is embroiled in two wars, with no end in sight? The president seems to think so. President Trump, apparently taken by the Bastille Day parade in Paris, which he attended last summer, has instructed Pentagon brass to organize an even bigger show of military strength, down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington — tanks, missiles, jets and rows of uniformed troops marching in precision. “We’re going to have to try to top” the French procession, he told reporters. No date has been set, but the planning is underway. It’s all a bit silly. But leaving aside, for the moment, Mr. Trump’s insecurities and his desire to do everything bigger than anyone else, there are some serious reasons to reject his idea. Mr. Trump’s parade would further militarize America’s image. And it would be expensive, costing millions of dollars and most likely tearing up Washington’s streets. Does that make sense when the Pentagon is complaining that its $700 billion annual budget is inadequate, Congress is cutting vital programs, the State Department is being eviscerated and a Republican tax cut for the wealthy has added billions of dollars to the deficit? The United States used to regularly hold national military parades, generally to mark military victories. They took place after the Civil War, World War I and World War II. Most recently, the first President George Bush presided as 8,800 troops, with weapons, marched through Washington after the 1991 Persian Gulf war ended. But after American combat troops were withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, the Pentagon declined a ticker-tape parade in New York for gulf war veterans, saying it would not be proper while Americans were still fighting in Afghanistan.

"With Congress facing another potential government shutdown, Americans across the political spectrum have urged both parties to set aside differences and find a compromise. Many people also believe that, if Robert Mueller produces significant evidence of wrongdoing by Donald Trump, Republicans in Congress should vote to impeach him. Will arguments to “do the right thing” persuade lawmakers? Don’t hold your breath. Such exhortations are rarely heeded by politicians, because the structural incentives of the institution usually trump policy considerations. People often urge members of Congress to take positions that reflect arguments for the public good without regard to electoral or party consequences. They point to so-called profiles in courage, like Edmund Ross, a Kansas Republican who cast the deciding vote to acquit President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, in 1868, or Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a Democratic representative from a conservative district in Pennsylvania, who voted for the Clinton budget in 1993. But those instances are rare. Most of the time, members of Congress do want to pass good public policy, but they also have two other important goals, re-election and increased power in the legislature. These goals offer a road map to the incentives that shape their decision making. When the incentives don’t align, members face problems. In these cases, re-election usually wins out, not least because it is a prerequisite for any other goal. Indeed, profiles in courage are so rare because they routinely cost legislators: Both Edmund Ross and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky lost their re-election bids. Many argue, however, that members should be willing to risk their jobs for the public good, especially on matters of conscience or morality. Historically, some politicians have done this — perhaps most famously Sam Houston of Texas, when he refused to support slavery’s expansion or secession from the Union, which cost him first his Senate seat and then his governorship. But giving up one’s job for a public policy is tougher than it appears. Consider whether you would give up your current job — and likely any future in your current career field — to pass one specific public policy. "
"Since before President Trump was elected — and with greater frequency afterward — historians, political scientists and journalists have wondered how autocratic our democracy might become. Here is some evidence of how the public sees it. Bright Line Watch, a consortium of political scientists formed after the 2016 election, just released a survey of 2000 voters that shows public faith in 27 key democratic principles — ranging from the independence of the judiciary to constitutional limits on executive power — has declined across the board. Four political scientists — Gretchen Helmke of the University of Rochester, Brendan Nyhan and John Carey of Dartmouth, and Susan Stokes of Yale — report that from September 2017 to January 2018, voters’ assessments of the ability of the courts, Congress and the Constitution to “effectively check executive power dropped by 7-8 percentage points.” In the same period, “confidence that the elected branches respect judicial independence fell by 17 percentage points.” The results also reveal Helmke and her colleagues warn that these trends constitute a threat to democracy: The release of the Bright Line survey comes at a moment when Trump has once again defied traditional norms and constraints concerning the treatment of political opponents. On Monday, he charged that Democratic members of the House and Senate were treasonous in their failure to applaud him during his State of the Union address. In a speech in Blue Ash, Ohio, Trump described how he saw it: One day later, Trump declared: The decline of public faith in America’s democratic institutions can be seen in the accompanying chart describing Bright Line’s findings.

"He was a long-shot candidate with no prior political experience, and so very few people noticed when Aaron Coleman announced he was running for governor of Kansas last July. Those he told did not take him seriously — he could not even vote in the last election. But in Kansas, there are no minimum age restrictions to run and at 17, Mr. Coleman is one of six teenagers who have announced their bids in the last year to become chief executive of the state. Now, amid significant interest in their novel candidacies, some state lawmakers are clamoring to reform the eligibility process. The attention could create a carnival-like note to the race, and some lawmakers are calling for clearer election guidelines. This week, the Kansas House moved a bill out of committee that would require that candidates for governor fit two criteria: to be eligible to vote in the state and to be a state resident for at least four years. “I’m not discouraging them,” Representative Blake Carpenter, who sponsored the bill, said in an interview. He has “heard people say that a cat or a dog could be on the ballot.” “But as soon as they turn 18, if they want to run for the legislature, knock yourself out,” he said. He added he is not sure when the bill will be taken up by the full House. It would also need to pass the State Senate. "

"WASHINGTON — Syrian Kurdish fighters have detained two British men infamous for their role in the Islamic State’s imprisonment, torture and killing of Western hostages, according to American officials. The men were part of a group of four Islamic State militants known as the Beatles because of their British accents. Officials identified the two men captured as Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh. They were the last two members of the group to remain at large. The ringleader, Mohammed Emwazi, was killed in an airstrike in 2015 in Syria after an intensive manhunt. Known as Jihadi John, he beheaded American and British hostages. A fourth man, Aine Davis, is imprisoned in Turkey on terrorism charges. All four had lived in West London. Mr. Kotey, born in London, is of Ghanaian and Greek Cypriot background, while Mr. Elsheikh’s family fled Sudan in the 1990s. Both men have been designated foreign terrorists by the United States. The British extremists were known for their brutality. They repeatedly beat the hostages they kept imprisoned in Raqqa, Syria, formerly the Islamic State’s self-declared capital, and subjected them to waterboarding and mock executions. Mr. Emwazi was believed to have killed the American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, as well as Abdul-Rahman Kassig, an aid worker. The American government says the group beheaded more than 27 hostages. According to the State Department, Mr. Kotey “likely engaged in the group’s executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding. Kotey has also acted as an ISIL recruiter and is responsible for recruiting several U.K. nationals to join the terrorist organization.” ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. "
"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has lashed out at the country’s police chief, whom he accused of airing “delusional and mendacious” insinuations against him, just days before the police are expected to publish recommendations regarding potential charges against Mr. Netanyahu in two corruption investigations, possibly including bribery. “Any fair-minded person will ask themselves how people who say such delusional things about the prime minister can investigate him objectively and make recommendations in his case without bias,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote in a Facebook post after midnight Wednesday. “A large shadow has been cast this evening over the police investigations and recommendations in the case of Prime Minister Netanyahu,” he added. Critics said Mr. Netanyahu, now in his third consecutive term in office, was trying to discredit the police in order to delegitimize investigations that could undermine his political future. “Clearly it is unjustified,” Barak Medina, a professor in the law faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the attack on the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich. “The prime minister is trying to create a spin and present himself as the victim.” Like other observers, Mr. Medina drew comparisons to President Trump’s criticism of the F.B.I. and Justice Department amid investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign.

"As Minnesota lawmakers prepared to push a proposed tax on opioid sales in November, the pharmaceutical industry lobbyists who opposed the bill set up a meeting with its sponsors, and they brought an unusual guest: Jessica Hulsey Nickel, a prominent anti-addiction advocate in Washington. Ms. Nickel told the lawmakers that she took no position on the tax and was simply offering her group’s resources to help fight the state’s drug epidemic. But her presence along with five representatives from the industry’s trade group raised eyebrows among the Minnesota lawmakers, who believed that drug companies needed to be held accountable for the prescription opioid crisis — not embraced as an ally. “She was insisting that she was totally independent and they hadn’t put any strings on her,” said State Senator Chris Eaton, one of the bill’s sponsors. “I wasn’t buying it.” Two weeks later, Ms. Nickel’s ties to the industry grew even deeper when her advocacy group, the Addiction Policy Forum, announced in mid-December that it had accepted funding from the trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA. While she is open — and unapologetic — about accepting money from the pharmaceutical group, Ms. Nickel declined to disclose exactly how much PhRMA had donated to her group. “It is our preference to talk about the patients and the families and not focus on the numbers,” she said. Stephen J. Ubl, the trade group’s chief executive, said in an interview that it was in the “tens of millions,” over multiple years, a heady influx of cash for a nonprofit group whose annual donations and grants totaled $4.7 million last year.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday morning signed into law a far-reaching budget deal that will boost spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and allow the federal government to reopen after a brief shutdown. In an early morning tweet, Mr. Trump said he had signed the bill, adding: “Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more.” Mr. Trump’s signature came quickly after the House gave final approval early Friday to the deal, hours after a one-man blockade by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky delayed the votes and forced the government to briefly close. House Democrats, after threatening to bring the bill down because it did nothing to protect young undocumented immigrants, gave Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin the votes he did not have in his own party and ensured passage. In the end, 73 House Democrats voted yes to more than offset the 67 Republicans who voted no. Just before the vote, Mr. Ryan voiced support for bringing a debate on immigration to the House floor — though he did not make a concrete promise, as Democratic leaders had wanted. "
"This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions paused a discussion of the opioid epidemic to, once again, go after marijuana. He suggested that addictive pain medication wasn’t the only problem and that many heroin addicts start out “with marijuana and other drugs.” There is a relationship between cannabis and opioids, but Mr. Sessions has it backward. Marijuana isn’t a gateway drug to opioid addiction; it’s a safer alternative to pain medicines. Mr. Sessions’s vow to crack down on marijuana will only make the opioid epidemic worse. We know that 40 percent of all opiate overdose deaths involve a prescription opiate. So having legal access to cannabis as another option for pain relief may actually reduce consumption of opiates. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but consider the evidence. To start, a large study assessed the effect of medical-marijuana laws on opiate-related deaths between 1999 and 2010 in all 50 states and reported a 25 percent decrease in opiate overdose mortality in states where medical marijuana was legal, compared with those where it wasn’t. The study found that in 2010, medical-marijuana laws resulted in an estimated 1,729 fewer deaths than expected. Other epidemiologic studies found similar results. A study published last year examined opiate-related deaths in Colorado between 2000 and 2015. Researchers compared mortality rates before and after the state legalized recreational cannabis in 2014. For controls, they chose two nearby states: Nevada, which legalized only medical cannabis, and Utah, where all cannabis use is illegal. The study found a 6.5 percent drop in opiate-related deaths after recreational cannabis became legal in Colorado. Likewise, other researchers examined the link between medical cannabis and opiate use in a group of patients with chronic pain in New Mexico, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis. They reported that subjects who had access to medical cannabis were 17 times more likely to stop using opiates for pain compared with those not using cannabis. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump delivered a brief, uncharacteristically subdued message of faith and American values to religious leaders as a fresh crisis swirled in his White House, declaring on Thursday morning “we praise God for how truly blessed we are to be American.” “Faith is central to American life and to liberty,” Mr. Trump said at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, a gathering of religious leaders who have become a keystone of his political base. “Our founders invoked the creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares, ‘In God we trust.’” Mr. Trump’s remarks came amid growing questions about how the White House handled allegations of domestic violence against one of the president’s closest aides. The White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, steadfastly defended the aide, Rob Porter, right up until Mr. Porter resigned on Wednesday. Officials now say the White House was aware of the charges against Mr. Porter, which contributed to a delay in granting him a security clearance for his post as staff secretary. Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine general, accompanied Mr. Trump to the breakfast but the president did not mention him. He did salute members of his Cabinet who were also in attendance. Mr. Trump’s remarks were most notable for what he did not say. He made no mention of his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a landmark shift in American policy that was extremely popular with evangelical voters and a segment of hard-line pro-Israel American Jews.

"TEHRAN — An Iranian official dismissed as “old news” on Thursday a report in the Western news media that Washington had reached out to Tehran in December to establish secret, back-channel talks to negotiate the release of prisoners held by both sides. The official, Hamidreza Taraghi, said that he had given interviews as far back as July to Iranian news outlets about similar attempts by the Trump administration to arrange secret talks on prisoners using intermediaries from Oman and from Europe. But Mr. Taraghi, an adviser to the hard-liners around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that Iran had rejected the entreaties then and would never enter into discussions with the Trump administration. “In the nuclear deal, they have shown themselves as dishonest, so what is the use of new talks anyway?” he said, referring to President Trump’s continuing threats to scuttle the pact negotiated with the United States during the Obama administration and with other world powers. Iran acknowledged last May that it had discussed the issue of imprisoned Iranian-Americans with Trump administration officials at a meeting in Vienna on compliance with the nuclear accord. Another effort was made at a similar meeting in Vienna in December, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, but that overture and others were rejected. At least four American citizens and two permanent residents of the United States are known to be held in Iranian prisons. A fifth American, Robert A. Levinson, has been missing in Iran for more than a decade. Mr. Trump has repeatedly posted on Twitter about the fate of two Iranian-Americans in particular: Baquer Namazi, 81, a former Unicef diplomat; and his son Siamak. They were convicted by an Iranian court in October 2016 of collaborating with a hostile power — meaning the United States — after a closed trial. Their convictions and 10-year sentences were upheld last November on appeal. The precise nature of the accusations against them has never been disclosed. Mr. Taraghi refused to provide more details about the prisoners the Trump administration had been seeking to have released, but he said that Iranian officials had been contacted on numerous occasions. “They had diplomats from Oman coming to the island of Kish,” Mr. Taraghi said, referring to an island off Iran’s south coast. “They asked European politicians to convey this message to our Foreign Ministry officials. Things like that.” “Anyway,” he added. “This is old news, already from last summer.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) “The Shape of Water” has become the film to beat at the Oscars. After a year of political strife, natural disasters, immigration woes and revelations of sexual harassment, it makes sense — to a degree — that an uplifting fantasy would march to the front of the Oscars race. People are yearning for escape and signs of connection and compassion, and Guillermo del Toro’s tale — a lush hybrid of “Beauty and the Beast” and “Creature From the Black Lagoon” — serves up the feels in spades. It is extremely rare, though, for a fantasy or sci-fi film to win the Oscars race, and “Shape” could still be bested by “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” or “Get Out.” The Oscars are usually held on the last Sunday in February, but this year have been bumped a week, to March 4, to avoid conflicting with the closing night of the Winter Olympics. This means that strategists are running extra long campaigns, and the people behind “Shape” will be working to keep the film in the fore without making it seem like the preordained winner. You’d think being in the top spot would be a good thing, but when that happens in an Oscar race with weeks still to go, backlash often follows, as the folks behind “La La Land” learned last year.

"Winter Olympics fashion has, largely, been a tale of two events: the opening and closing ceremonies, where national costume comes out to play; and figure skating, where the aesthetic swings and swoops from Vegas-on-ice to Vera Wang, with a touch of Broadway and Diaghilev thrown in. As of this week, however, a new factor was added to the mix: the North Korean cheerleading squad. Approximately 230 young women strong, the squad arrived for the Pyeongchang Games in matching red wool coats, buttoned at the waist, with black fur trim at the neck and wrists and matching black caps, high-heeled ankle boots and sheer hosiery. They toted matching red wheelies and handbags, and all grinned matching grins. Imagine a cross between Pan Am “stewardesses” of the 1960s, “Red Sparrow” and the Dallas Cowboys squad, and you’ll get the idea. In North Korea they are reportedly known as “the army of beauties.” For a country whose image is defined largely by the figure of its leader, Kim Jong-un, with his severe military dress and strange trapezoidal hairstyle, the cheer squad provides a visual message of a different kind. There to support the joint North and South Korean team, they also serve, at least theoretically, to normalize and humanize the regime — propaganda in fashionable person form. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. At what point should members of one political party start voting for the other one to force their party to change? Jonathan Rauch and Benjamin Wittes have sparked a debate about that question with a piece in The Atlantic. “We have both spent our professional careers strenuously avoiding partisanship in our writing and thinking,” Rauch and Wittes write. Yet they argue that voting against the Republican Party is now a moral necessity, given its enabling of President Trump’s subversion of the law and his attacks on democracy itself. “If conservatives want to save the GOP from itself,” the subhead of the article reads, “they need to vote mindlessly and mechanically against its nominees.” My colleague Ross Douthat uses his latest column to offer a rejoinder. Forget for a moment about the tweets and focus on the policy, he writes: On policy — waterboarding, Nafta, NATO, Iran, libel laws and so on — the Republican Party is indeed constraining Trump. “And so long as he remains weak and trammeled and conventional in policy, the case that conservatives have a moral obligation to vote like liberals won’t convince,” Douthat concludes.

"SEOUL, South Korea — In the highest-level contact between the two Koreas in years, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea plans to meet Saturday with the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the North’s nominal head of state, officials said on Thursday. Mr. Moon’s luncheon meeting with the North Koreans was announced on Thursday, as Vice President Mike Pence arrived in South Korea carrying a message from Washington: not to waver from strong sanctions against North Korea. The high-level North Korean delegation, headed by Kim Yong-nam, the North’s ceremonial head of state, will arrive in South Korea on Friday on a special plane to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics later in the day. The trip’s significance was underscored by the revelation on Wednesday that the delegation would include Kim Yo-jong, the only sister and a trusted aide of Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader. In North Korea’s dynastic system, which upholds the Kim family’s “bloodline” as a sacred leadership qualification, Ms. Kim wields a singular clout that cannot be matched by any nonrelative members of the elite, regardless of their official titles, according to North Korea analysts. Ms. Kim would be the first member of North Korea’s ruling family to visit the South since the 1950-53 Korean War. In 2000, her father, Kim Jong-il, held a summit meeting in North Korea with Kim Dae-jung, then South Korea’s president, but did not keep his promise to visit the South for a second meeting. Kim Jong-il died in 2011, bequeathing power to his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has rapidly accelerated the North’s weapons programs. It remained unclear whether Ms. Kim would be carrying a message from her brother to Mr. Moon, who has said he is willing to meet Kim Jong-un if he is reasonably sure that such a meeting would help end the crisis over the North’s nuclear weapons and missile development.

"Donald Trump has a particular skill, one rooted in his weaknesses: Because he eschews intellectualism for intuition, because he prefers to watch rather than to read, he has honed his talent for reflexive reductionism. Nuance and complexity are founts of confusion in Trump’s basest mind. So he gravitates to the most emotionally charged parts of any issue and amplifies them. This is an essential function of branding: to capture a feeling in its purest form, to connect on a visceral level with a viewer, to compel an action. Trumpism in a way is about emotion over information. It is about heat over light. It is about hostility over comity. And it is divorced from the rigors of truth and honesty. It exists as a near ecclesiastical devotion in a space where passionate faith surmounts accuracy and science. In this space, everything must exist at the extremes, or not at all. Everything is love or hate, big or little, best or worst. And, everything is very, very, very. "
"Most American workers this month will see their take-home pay go up, some a little and a few quite a bit, as the new tax act takes effect and less money is withheld for federal income taxes. But for many, the gift will be short-lived. Because the law was rushed and written in a partisan frenzy, withholding may not be accurate and you might owe money to the I.R.S. next year. You might even be advised to file new forms so that more money is withheld — and then the forms and withholding amounts are likely to change again later in the year and then again every year thereafter as the cuts for individuals head toward expiration. This messy uncertainty, not abstractions like an increase in the federal deficit, will be the lived experience of Trump economic policy for most American households. It might seem like just a bureaucratic complication, but this episode could point progressives toward a persuasive economic message, one that reflects the economic realities of the middle class and the striving of people in struggling small communities as well as those in tech-driven metropolises. It’s the experience of the scam economy, where nothing is certain and anything gained might disappear without warning. It’s an economy where risk is shifted onto individuals and families, financial predators lurk behind every robocall and pop-up ad, work schedules are changed without notice and Americans have endless choices about savings, education, health care and other needs but very little clear guidance about how to make those choices wisely or safely. Since the 2016 election, Democrats have looked for an economic story and policy that would speak to the frustrations of Trump voters — even while recognizing that more nuanced analysis shows that “economic anxiety” wasn’t driving most of Mr. Trump’s well-off supporters — without losing their own base. While the headline economic statistics like gross domestic product, low unemployment, wages on a slow but steady upward path have been healthy, other indicators like stagnating wages, Gilded Age levels of inequality, and communities and older industries that have been left behind together create an obligation to think ambitiously beyond the assumptions of Clinton- and Obama-era economics. This overdue introspection has brought several new or revived ideas to the fore: universal basic income, especially popular in Silicon Valley, or a federal jobs guarantee, an idea last heard in the 1970s, revived by the Center for American Progress last May. And perhaps most promising, a new focus on economic concentration and the failure of antitrust enforcement, which has allowed a few behemoth companies, including the tech giants, to wield economic and political power at the expense of consumers and workers alike.

"If you want to understand how Kyle Duncan, President Trump’s nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, would serve in that role, consider how he behaved toward my late husband, John Thompson. J.T., as we called him, spent 18 years in prison, 14 of them on death row, for a murder he did not commit. When it emerged that prosecutors in the office of Harry Connick, who was the former New Orleans district attorney, had destroyed evidence of his innocence to gain that conviction, he was granted a new trial, at which he was acquitted. After his release, J.T. considered the long list of innocent men sent to prison by prosecutors in that same office who had withheld evidence. It was clear to him, as it is to any impartial observer, that the district attorney’s office for New Orleans has a track record of failing to turn over favorable evidence to defendants. In 2003, J.T. sued the prosecutors who had hidden the evidence in his case for failing to train their lawyers on the importance of turning over favorable evidence. The jury, considering the blatant destruction of evidence in J.T.’s case, awarded him $1 million for every year he was on death row — $14 million in total. When the prosecutors appealed, they argued, with a straight face, that what had happened to J.T. was so outrageous and illegal that the New Orleans district attorney could not be held responsible. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court. "
"After his hit series “Six Feet Under” ended in 2005, Alan Ball indulged his inner fanboy, creating the vampire melodrama “True Blood” and working on the gothic small-town-crime story “Banshee.” The move suited him — his aptitudes for dark comedy and unsettling atmosphere were a natural fit for genre entertainment. But with “Here and Now,” his new family drama for HBO (beginning Sunday), he’s back to making Big Statements, his mode in his Oscar-winning screenplay for “American Beauty” in 1999. “We’re living in a new reality” is the tagline on the show’s billboards, and Mr. Ball wants to say something definitive about it. Unfortunately — and this was also true of “American Beauty,” despite its multiple Academy Awards — he doesn’t have anything new or particularly interesting to say. Straight white people are self-loathing and lame. Dads are depressed but redeemable, moms are pretty much a lost cause. We’d all be better off if we put away our cellphones and got outside. Through four episodes of its 10-episode season, “Here and Now” works the well-plowed soil of middle-age suburban malaise, the ground of Updike, Cheever and their many imitators. The suburbs have been replaced by Portland, Ore., and the ennui-ridden father, Greg Boatwright (Tim Robbins), is 60, the new middle age. (Kevin Spacey’s Lester Burnham in “American Beauty” was 42.) The biggest update is that Greg and his wife, Audrey Bayer (Holly Hunter), have raised the kind of blended family that exists primarily as a screenwriter’s conceit: Ramon, from Colombia (Daniel Zovatto); Ashley, from Liberia (Jerrika Hinton); and Duc, from Vietnam (Raymond Lee); all adopted and all now adults. The brood is completed by the teenage Kristen (Sosie Bacon, the daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick), Audrey and Greg’s biological child, who calls herself “the boring white chick in the family.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The Senate is expected to vote today on a far-reaching bipartisan agreement that would significantly increase spending on military and domestic programs over two years. It would also raise the federal debt limit, moving to end the cycle of short-term showdowns on government funding. Republican congressional leaders have championed the deal, even though it would effectively negate President Trump’s demand that large increases in military spending be offset by deep cuts to nondefense programs. If it passes the Senate, the legislation will go to the House. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, delivered a record-breaking speech of more than eight hours on Wednesday opposing the deal because it lacks protection for young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. • If lawmakers cannot pass a temporary funding measure by the end of today, the government will shut down for the second time this year.

"They say that Bob Dylan, 76, is on a never-ending tour. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is eight years older and has a day job, seems to have acquired Mr. Dylan’s taste for the road. In the space of three weeks, she is set to make at least nine public appearances. They follow a pattern: a thunderous standing ovation from an adoring crowd, followed by gentle questioning from a sympathetic interviewer. Justice Ginsburg mixes familiar stories with insights about the Supreme Court and the law. She lands a couple of jokes. She promises not to step down so long as she can “do the job full steam.” She describes her friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. The audience swoons, and the show moves on to the next venue. She seems to enjoy the attention. “I am soon to be 85,” she said on Tuesday at New York Law School, “and everyone wants to take their picture with me.” Her fans call her Notorious R.B.G., a nod to the rapper Notorious B.I.G., and Justice Ginsburg embraces the connection. “We were both born and bred in Brooklyn, New York,” she likes to say. She was at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah on Jan. 21 for the premiere of a documentary on her career. The next day, she was absent from the Supreme Court bench, asking Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to announce her majority opinion in a closely divided case in which she tangled with the court’s newest member, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — A gaggle of young North Koreans in neon chased me down the mountain on skis, expertly skidding to a stop at my feet as I sat on the slope tightening my bindings. They peppered me with questions: “What’s your name? How old are you? Where are you from? Are you married?” It was 2014 and we were at Masikryong Ski Resort, a pet project of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The multimillion-dollar resort, featuring luxury lodges and pristine slopes about 100 miles east of Pyongyang, had opened a few weeks earlier and I was there on a reporting trip — and to get a little snowboarding in. These North Koreans, all students, told me they were assigned to learn to ski during their university break. Six days a week, eight hours a day, all they did was ski. Even back then, I could see the wheels turning in Mr. Kim’s mind. “To compete at the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2018?” I asked the young men. They chuckled. “Maybe,” they said. Four years later, North Korea is sending skiers — probably including some of those young men I met in 2014 — across the Demilitarized Zone to compete as wild-card entries at the first Winter Olympics to be held on the Korean Peninsula. South Korean athletes, meanwhile, have been training at Masikryong, perhaps the world’s most controversial ski resort, built in defiance of United Nations sanctions and in spite of North Korea’s crushing poverty. This cross-border athletic exchange would seem to encapsulate the spirit of peace and unity at the heart of the Olympics. But I worry that it is too fast, too soon, and that in their haste to ensure an Olympics without provocation, South Korean officials could be rushing headlong into a premature détente. "

Here’s the news: • In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel forged a deal with her previous coalition partners, bringing her closer to forming a new government after five months of political limbo. The pact came at a steep price for her conservative party, which gave up the Finance Ministry to the Social Democrats, a junior partner whose rank-and-file members could still veto the deal. The pact leaves the far-right Alternative for Germany as the leading voice of opposition in Parliament. _____ "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Impressed by the Bastille Day parade during a visit to France last year, President Trump is urging the Pentagon to organize a grand military parade in the United States. But many lawmakers — including Republicans — have quickly raised objections, calling the event unnecessary. For his part, Trevor Noah just wishes Trump had brought home a different lesson from France. He did his Trump impersonation, but added a Parisian accent. Stephen Colbert’s commentary was more blunt: He simply called the parade idea “stupid.” John Oliver, the host of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight,” was a guest on “The Late Show.” He offered a bleak prediction about Trump’s marriage based on his fascination with the Bastille Day celebration. Noah led “The Daily Show” with a video clip showing the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, correcting a woman for using the word “mankind.” "
"Your book “The Doomsday Machine” is a warning, based on your experience at the highest levels of nuclear planning at RAND in the early 1960s, that an accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust killing nearly every human alive could happen much more easily than most people realize — which is a pretty urgent message. Why did it take you nearly 60 years to write about it? It didn’t. I submitted the first third of the book to a publisher in 1975, as soon as the war ended. Her response was we would only sell 1,400 copies of this book. So I thought, “All right, that’s enough for every member of Congress and a lot of media people and academics.” And she said, “No, that means we wouldn’t publish it.” And that was reiterated a number of times in succeeding years. You’re warning people that human civilization itself is at risk, and so many people don’t seem to be concerned. Does it ever make you feel as if you’re the crazy one? No, it makes me feel that I’m living in a country in a very intense state of denial. I was saying to my wife the other day, “You know, if I didn’t know any more than the public knows about the nuclear danger, I wouldn’t be worried about it either.” If an accidental nuclear war does happen, will you have the willpower not to tell everyone “I told you so?” Well, how much time would I have? In San Francisco I would expect to be within the range of immediate effects. You were 30 years old when you wrote America’s nuclear-war plans for the defense secretary, Robert McNamara. Is that too much responsibility for someone that young? It’s too much responsibility for an 86-year-old or a 70-year-old. I don’t think we’ve ever had a human leader in any state that could really live up to that responsibility. How does it feel to write a plan that would kill tens of millions of people? I was in denial. I was part of a plan that should never have been made that was a crime against humanity. I once came to a disarmament press conference at the U.N., and Time had just had a picture on their cover of a terrorist, and I showed this picture from Time, and I said, “If I want to see a nuclear terrorist, I just have to look in the mirror.” Now if you say, “How do I feel about that?” Well, I feel terrible.

"WASHINGTON — White House officials conceded Thursday that they regretted the way they handled accusations against Rob Porter, the staff secretary who resigned Wednesday after two former wives publicly accused him of abusing them. But they refused to provide any information about when President Trump’s most senior advisers first learned about the episodes. Mr. Porter abruptly departed the West Wing on Thursday afternoon, one day after John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and other senior officials had issued statements defending him and said they would prefer that he remain in his post. Among the questions he left behind was whether Mr. Kelly and other members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle had been willing to ignore accusations of domestic violence to protect a trusted aide. Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, said that Mr. Kelly had not been made “fully aware” of them until this week. But two people close to the White House said that Mr. Kelly and Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff for operations, as well as Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, had known of the issues since late fall. It was unclear whether they knew the extent of the women’s allegations, though one former senior American official said that White House officials had been aware in August that the issue was preventing Mr. Porter from obtaining the security clearance he was seeking. Mr. Shah said that Mr. Porter had been operating with an “interim clearance,” which is customary for top White House officials to receive while the F.B.I. conducts a thorough check of their backgrounds. During a briefing for reporters that was dominated by questions about Mr. Porter, Mr. Shah described the accusations against his former colleague as “unsettling” for the White House. “I think it’s fair to say we all could have done better over the few hours or last few days in dealing with this situation,” Mr. Shah said. "
"The power of the president, as commander in chief of the armed forces, has evolved over more than two centuries, constrained by congressional action, the emergence of a standing military establishment after World War II and a more complex world. Some of the most important constraints on presidential power have been shaped in the form of norms of civil-military relations observed from George Washington to Barack Obama. These norms — respect for the military’s culture, its role in society and its separation from partisan politics — have been bolstered in recent decades by a professional military ethic that requires troops to avoid politics and focus on their missions. Enter Donald Trump, our 45th president. Since taking office, he has shattered countless norms of civil-military relations — for example, by appointing many retired or active generals to high office, by politicking before military audiences and by summarily dismissing military advice on Afghanistan. Mr. Trump’s proposal for a grand military parade in Washington — conceived in Paris after watching the pageantry of a French parade for Bastille Day — represents one more broken norm. In ordering the troops to march on Constitution Avenue, for no apparent military reason, Mr. Trump further politicizes the military, turning it into both a political prop and an issue to further divide the country in ways that politically benefit him. The march would also send an unmistakably autocratic message to Mr. Trump’s political enemies in Washington: Congress, the courts and the press, who have no armies of their own to parade in such fashion. It’s understandable why a president enjoying historically low approval ratings would seek cover behind the troops and the public confidence they enjoy. Proposing a parade like this fits a broader pattern for Mr. Trump of using patriotism as a wedge issue. Whether he’s attacking the National Football League and its players for their protests during the national anthem or proposing costly and unnecessary military parades, the net effect is to rally his base and force opponents to choose between appearing to love America and opposing Mr. Trump. Fortunately, our service members (like all government employees) swear their oaths to the Constitution, not to the president. All of these actions corrode the professional ethic of the military. In asking service members to support him politically, Mr. Trump presents troops with a dilemma: support their commander in chief or follow the rules, regulations and norms of the service. In most cases, this choice falls short of the threshold for disobeying an unlawful order, because it’s not strictly illegal for service members to support Mr. Trump politically or plan a parade for him. "
"WASHINGTON — From the moment in March when President Trump proposed his budget for 2018, Washington has been struggling to reach any consensus on spending. Congress finally appears to have found one, largely without Mr. Trump’s help. Here’s a look at how lawmakers got there. Barely two months into his term, Mr. Trump proposed an initial budget outline — known as a “skinny budget” — that called for big military spending increases and deep cuts to a broad part of the federal bureaucracy, making good on his campaign promise to reorder the priorities in the nation’s capital and dismantle what his administration calls “the administrative state.” It was largely dismissed by members of both parties. When the president’s full budget was released in May, it largely followed his earlier outline: a 10 percent increase in spending for the military but deep cuts in programs for the poor, health care and government agencies. Called “A New Foundation for American Greatness,” the document included $2.6 billion for border security, including the beginning of a wall on the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump struck a bipartisan deal to increase the debt limit and keep the government open until mid-December, and told Democrats that he wanted to do something to help the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. “Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I,” the president said, referring to the top Democrats in the Senate and the House, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. The president had dinner with “Chuck and Nancy” in the Blue Room of the White House and discussed a possible deal in which Congress would give legal status to Dreamers in exchange for border security. The two Democrats left the dinner and declared that they had reached “a deal” with the president. Conservatives recoiled at the idea of Mr. Trump embracing what they call amnesty for lawbreakers in granting the Dreamers legal status. The White House said that no deal had been reached. Mr. Trump tweeted: “No deal was made last night on DACA. Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent.” He said that would include “the wall.” "
"Broadway has made no secret of its displeasure with the Trump administration. There was the “Hamilton” incident, when the cast of the hit musical addressed Vice President-elect Mike Pence from the stage. There are the jokes slipped into shows (a recent revival of “Miss Saigon” added a “Make America Great Again” gag). There are the implicit critiques (“1984”) and the explicit (Michael Moore’s “The Terms of My Surrender”). Now comes something different — and more freighted. One of Broadway’s most powerful theater owners and producers, Jordan Roth, kicked off a raunchily comedic web video series on Thursday with a first installment that refers to Mr. Trump as “a national disgrace” and manages to allude to his combover hair style and his imagined penis size while critiquing a focus on personal appearances (“let’s take the focus off of looks and keep our insults humane”). Mr. Roth said the series, called “The Birds and the BS,” is intended to address the cultural coarsening that has accompanied the Trump era, reminding adults of the courtesies they learned as children, but using pungent language to attract attention, both to the videos and the broader issue. “We need a kids’ show for us, to remind ourselves of these basic human decencies in the complicated adult world that we now swim in, and if we can do that with a laugh and a catchy tune and a little bit of shock, then we might actually watch it, and then think about it,” he said. Mr. Roth, whose company, Jujamcyn Theaters, owns five of the 41 Broadway theaters, has not been shy about his opposition to the Trump administration — he is a longtime Democratic donor who co-produced a Broadway fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. But his decision to create a web series with a first episode that jabs pointedly at the president is striking because of Mr. Roth’s history with Mr. Trump. Mr. Roth’s father, Steven, a prominent real estate magnate in New York City, has been politically and financially allied with Mr. Trump. "
"Update April 1, 2019: The Senate voted down two different disaster aid bills Monday as Republicans and Democrats hit a stalemate over relief for Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican officials have for months denounced the federal government’s response to Hurricane Maria, urging for more attention and action to help the island’s hard-pressed storm survivors. This week, island leaders declared a rare victory when Senate leaders folded disaster relief funding into a two-year budget deal to avert a government shutdown. Puerto Rico, along with the United States Virgin Islands, certainly has reason to cheer: The deal includes $4.8 billion to replenish dwindling Medicaid funds, $2 billion to restore the shredded power grid and $9 billion for housing and urban development projects. But the funding falls tens of billions of dollars short of what Puerto Rico says it needs to come back from the devastating storm. In November, Puerto Rico estimated it would need $94.4 billion to rebuild the island after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and make its infrastructure more resilient to future natural disasters. Puerto Rico wanted $17 billion for the power grid alone — $15 billion more than what the Senate set aside. By comparison, Florida’s citrus industry is receiving $2.3 billion to recover from Hurricane Irma. “All of this money, it’s a starting point to initiate recovery and reconstruction,” said Carlos Mercader, the executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration in Washington. “There’s still a lot of work to do with Congress and the administration.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Wants a Military Parade, but Not Everyone Is in Step” (news article, Feb. 8): Many adult men obsessed with the trappings of the military have never been anywhere near a combat zone. Men who have seen the chaos and carnage of war often want no reminders of the experience. My father, for example, was a Marine Corps and Office of Strategic Services veteran who was awarded the Silver Star for his heroism helping combat the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia. He rarely spoke of the war, never consumed books or movies about warfare and avoided contact with men he had known during the war. It is often men like our current president, who went to great lengths to avoid military service during the Vietnam War, who have a childish preoccupation with all things military. DAVID HAYDEN, WILTON, CONN. To the Editor: President Trump wants a military parade, regardless of the expense and lack of precedent for holding one without a reason such as a military victory. How about this: He figures out how to finally end the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and then we’ll give him one. STEPHANIE JANARD, SPINDALE, N.C. To the Editor: President Trump’s reason for a big parade: He wants to support “America’s great service members who risk their lives every day.” As an enlisted man, I do not recall any of my fellow airmen saying, “Oh boy we get to parade today.” I do not recall any of us looking forward to being at the parade ground at 0700, lining up, standing at ease for an hour in the hot sun, listening to some speech, then marching in formation past a viewing stand for the entertainment of the higher-ranking officers and other important people.

"Take a deep breath and relax. The riotous market swings that have whipped up frothy peaks of anxiety over the last week — bringing the major indexes down more than 10 percent from their high — have virtually no impact on the income or wealth of most families. The reason: They own little or no stock. A whopping 84 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. And that includes everyone’s stakes in pension plans, 401(k)’s and individual retirement accounts, as well as trust funds, mutual funds and college savings programs like 529 plans. “For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University who recently published new research on the topic. Both Republicans and Democrats have promoted the idea that a rising stock market broadly lifts Americans’ fortunes. When there was a parade of market rallies, President Trump asked, “How’s your 401(k) doing?” There was a move toward democratizing stock ownership in the 1980s and 1990s, with the advent of individual retirement accounts, but the busts of 2001 and 2007 scared off some middle-class investors. Of course, any financial loss can be scary and painful. Indeed, the less you have, the more each dollar counts. And market gyrations could foreshadow deeper problems that signal the end of a nine-year boom and short-circuit the economic recovery. "
"BEIJING — In late December, a group of teenagers from North Korea traveled to the Chinese city of Kunming to play in an obscure under-15 soccer tournament. On the field, under a wintry sun, they faced teams from China and South Korea. Off the field, there was an unusual spectator: Choi Moon-soon, the governor of the province in South Korea hosting the Winter Olympics. Mr. Choi had flown more than 1,000 miles to meet the North Korean officials accompanying the young players — and to make the case for North Korea to attend the Olympics. “We were looking for any contact with North Korea, and the youth soccer teams were the only inter-Korean exchange still going on,” he later recalled. Even before Mr. Choi returned to South Korea, his government sent another signal: In a television interview, the South’s president, Moon Jae-in, said he favored postponing annual joint military exercises with the United States — an unmistakable overture to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, who had long condemned the exercises. Mr. Kim soon reciprocated, declaring at the start of the year that he was sending his athletes to the Olympics. There, they will march in the opening ceremony on Friday under a unified Korean flag with the South Koreans — a historic moment for the divided Korean Peninsula. The 11th-hour accommodation was the culmination of months of quiet discussions and behind-the-scenes diplomacy aimed at persuading North Korea to attend the Olympics, much of which unfolded even as the isolated nation tested its first intercontinental ballistic missiles and detonated its most powerful nuclear device yet. With President Trump threatening to respond to the North with “fire and fury,” the possibility of war on the Korean Peninsula overshadowed Olympic preparations, frightening fans and athletes alike, and prompting some nations to consider skipping the Games altogether.

"The Sunday before last, as I emerged tired and dispirited from Penn Station after a two-plus hour trip from the Newark airport, I found myself pondering President Trump’s campaign pledge “to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment,” a theme he raised  in this year’s State of the Union address and is expected to address again next week. A year ago, I embraced the newly elected president’s initiative, calling on him “to build something awe-inspiring.” Given the deficit-exploding impact of the new tax code, it’s difficult to see where the money will come from. In any event, after this trip, I’ll settle for something far more modest: basic improvements to public transportation. Regional transportation infrastructure is largely the responsibility of state and local governments, and it’s especially complicated in places like the New York metropolitan area, which includes multiple jurisdictions and agencies. But just as the federal government spurred the creation of the Interstate highway system under President Dwight Eisenhower, it could revitalize the nation’s transportation infrastructure — without blowing up the deficit — with a combination of better regulation, creative incentives, loans and grants. Many transportation projects are sound investments that can pay for themselves. My trip to Manhattan from Newark Liberty International Airport began at Terminal A. Newark is a finalist in Amazon’s quest for a second headquarters location, but one look at that terminal should be enough to send the e-commerce giant’s representatives back to Seattle. The aging terminal was packed and badly lit, with peeling, mismatched carpeting. There was a line out of the men’s room because so much plumbing was out of order. There was no dedicated TSA Pre-check line and the food options were minimal. Many consumer reviews of Newark generally, and Terminal A in particular, are scathing. “Let me just say that Terminal A is hell on earth,” wrote one traveler on the airport review site Skytrax. "
"Sometimes a book grabs you because it’s especially topical, or relevant to your life. Other times the appeal is more idiosyncratic: a strong voice, a great story, a brilliant mind at play. This week’s recommended titles offer distinctive and wide-ranging pleasures — beginning with a couple of distinctive and wide-ranging essay collections from Martin Amis and Zadie Smith, celebrated novelists who also rank among the best literary critics of their generations. Read them, and you’ll come up with your own recommendations. Or read more of ours! There’s a harrowing autobiographical novel about birth and death all at once, along with memoirs from a Chinese filmmaker and an indigenous Canadian writer. (I told you the list was wide-ranging.)

Senior Editor, Books THE RUB OF TIME: Bellow, Nabokov, Hitchens, Travolta, Trump: Essays and Reportage, 1994-2017, by Martin Amis. (Knopf, $28.95.) FEEL FREE: Essays, by Zadie Smith. (Penguin Press, $28.) The fourth collection of Amis’s nonfiction and Zadie Smith’s new book of essays find these two celebrated writers, friends from different generations, addressing politics, aging, art and more. “Amis’s new book, like the collections that preceded it, is the product of a ferocious yet sensitive mind,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “Even when he is considering writers he’s assessed many times before, his aim is so unerring that he resembles a figure out of Greek myth, firing arrows through ax-heads lined up in a row.” Garner writes that Smith’s “Feel Free” is a “gentler ride,” but in the best pieces, she “presses down hard as a cultural critic, and the rewards are outsize.” HEART BERRIES: A Memoir, by Terese Marie Mailhot. (Counterpoint, $23.) Mailhot, whose early life on Seabird Island Indian Reservation in British Columbia was pocked with poverty, addiction and abuse, began working on this memoir when she had herself committed after a breakdown. In it, she reckons with the wages of intergenerational trauma. Members of her family had passed through Canada’s brutal residential school system, which separated indigenous children from their families and cultures, and, in some cases, subjected them to physical and sexual abuse. The book is a “sledgehammer,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. It has “a mixture of vulnerability and rage, sexual yearning and artistic ambition, swagger and self-mockery that recalls Chris Kraus’s ‘I Love Dick.’” RISE AND KILL FIRST: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations, by Ronen Bergman. Translated by Ronnie Hope. (Random House, $35.) Bergman, a journalist based in Israel, conducted a thousand interviews with political leaders and intelligence operatives for this history of Israel’s secretive program of targeted assassinations. The result is “an exceptional work, a humane book about an incendiary subject,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “Blending history and investigative reporting, Bergman never loses sight of the ethical questions that arise when a state, founded as a refuge for a stateless people who were targets of a genocide, decides it needs to kill in order to survive.” IN EVERY MOMENT WE ARE STILL ALIVE, by Tom Malmquist. (Melville House, $25.99.) Based on a true story, this searing autobiographical novel, translated from the Swedish by Henning Koch, depicts a father struggling to cope with the tragic loss of his partner just as their daughter is born. “This is narrative as raw material,” Katie Kitamura writes in her review. “A novel about permeability, ‘In Every Moment We Are Still Alive’ captures the jumbled sensory experience of being profoundly, catastrophically overwhelmed. … It’s clear that Malmquist is explicitly interested in what can’t be contained, what continues to trouble.” EATING ETERNITY: Food, Art and Literature in France, by John Baxter. (Museyon, paper, $19.95.) A diverse and lavishly illustrated guide to French gastronomy that broadens its subject into the fields of art and literature and the culture at large. Who ever suspected that Proust’s famous madeleine almost lost out to a plain slice of toast? “Some of the best treats provided by Baxter’s delightful book are his startling asides,” our reviewer Miranda Seymour writes. Describing Matisse’s fondness for one dish, for example, he lets drop that “the repeated washing of the codfish was best achieved, some housewives found, by a day’s soak in the cistern of a flush toilet.” "
"HBO is getting into podcasts. The premium cable network has signed a deal with the hosts of the popular “Pod Save America” podcast to broadcast a series of hourlong TV specials later this year. The move comes just a week after HBO debuted the first of four specials from Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson, the hosts of the “2 Dope Queens” podcast. That special, which included an interview with Jon Stewart, received warm reviews. “Pod Save America,” a podcast hosted by Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor, all veterans of the Obama White House, has become a sort of refuge to liberal Americans during the beginning of the Trump era. During the 2016 campaign, the hosts produced a podcast for Bill Simmons’s website, The Ringer, called “Keepin’ It 1600,” which was supposed to end once the election was over. But given the popularity of it, the three began a new production. In keeping with how Donald J. Trump’s victory has upended much of the media world — Stephen Colbert is the most-watched host in late night, MSNBC has seen a huge ratings surge — “Pod Save America” averages around 1.5 million listeners a show. HBO made the deal with Crooked Media, the media company founded by Mr. Favreau, Mr. Lovett and Mr. Vietor. HBO plans to have the hosts do their specials on the campaign trail in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections. “The 2018 midterms are the most important elections of our lifetime, and the energy and excitement on the campaign trail is infectious,” Mr. Favreau, Mr. Lovett and Mr. Vietor said in a statement. “We are so grateful that HBO is taking a chance on us, even though these live shows will have so few dragons and sex robots.” HBO has been on the hunt for non-scripted deals for several years. Last month, the premium cable network signed Ronan Farrow to a contract to develop a new investigative series. The network now has 5 million digital subscribers and around 50 million cable subscribers. HBO developed its first stand-alone app, HBO Now, almost three years ago. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee to lead the Internal Revenue Service is a longtime tax lawyer who has specialized in defending people and companies against the tax agency in court. On Thursday, Mr. Trump formally nominated Charles P. Rettig, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer with the firm Hochman, Salkin, Rettig, Toscher & Perez, to succeed John A. Koskinen, the commissioner whose term ended in November. If confirmed, Mr. Rettig faces a steep task in overseeing the agency as it begins enforcing the sprawling $1.5 trillion tax overhaul Mr. Trump signed into law last year amid a shrinking staff and budget. Since 2010, the I.R.S. budget has been cut by $900 million — or 17 percent, after adjusting for inflation — and its staff reduced by 21,000, or 23 percent. The agency has also been under attack by Republicans, who have accused it of improperly targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, and by Mr. Trump. During the campaign, Mr. Trump, who has refused to release his personal tax returns, accused the agency of unjustly hounding him with audits year after year and said that paying as little as possible was “the American way.” As commissioner, Mr. Rettig would oversee the audit of Mr. Trump’s personal tax returns. The president has in the past said he would only release the returns once they were no longer under audit. Writing for Forbes in 2016, Mr. Rettig said he would not advise Mr. Trump, then a candidate, to release his tax returns while an audit was continuing. “Is there any legal impediment to Trump publicly releasing his tax returns? Absolutely not,” Mr. Rettig wrote. “Would any experienced tax lawyer representing Trump in an I.R.S. audit advise him to publicly release his tax returns during the audit? Absolutely not.” "
