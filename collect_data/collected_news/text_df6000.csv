"LONDON — Few world leaders have looked weaker than Theresa May, the British prime minister. Yet in Parliament on Wednesday, she vowed to stand tough in the escalating confrontation with Russia over the use of a nerve agent to poison one of its former spies on British soil. In language reminiscent of the Cold War, Mrs. May — until recently, accused at home of not being hard enough on Moscow — expelled 23 Russians she said were spies, promised a crackdown on corrupt Russians and the money they funnel into Britain, and called off high-level contacts between the two governments. Suddenly, she is the most forceful Western leader in denouncing President Vladimir V. Putin’s government, which she portrayed as a malevolent and lawless force. Her decision makes for a particularly sharp contrast with President Trump, who has been notably reluctant to criticize Mr. Putin and is dogged by accusations that the Kremlin tried to help him in the 2016 election. But it was not clear how strongly allies would rally to her side, and experts said that behind Mrs. May’s tough talk lay relatively mild measures, aside from the headline-grabbing expulsion, which she described as the biggest one of Russian diplomats in more than 30 years. That, in turn, reflects Britain’s weakened position in the world, as well as Russia’s continuing success in sowing discord and division. “I expected a stronger reaction,” said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based defense and security research institute. He said Mrs. May might have calculated that in response to tougher measures, Russia would “decapitate the British Embassy in Moscow” with its own expulsions. "
"Brooke Shields drew herself up to her full 6 feet, fielding reporters’ questions with an agility that has become second nature. At the Beekman Hotel in downtown Manhattan last month, Ms. Shields, the model, actress and veteran of numberless interviews, was delivering but the latest in a series of canny performances. She bantered good-naturedly, as is her habit, displaying an unflappable poise and a set of curves pneumatically packaged inside a closefitting top and skirt from the collection she was about to unveil for QVC, which will be introduced in its entirety on March 14. Her features and frame were considerably fuller than in 1980, when she scandalized television audiences with the coy claim that nothing came between her and her Calvins. The once-angular jaw is softer. Not that it matters. At 52, Ms. Shields, after transitioning through the decades from wide-eyed innocent to self-mocking glamorista in television shows like “Suddenly Susan” and “Friends,” has ripened into the kind of consummately relatable personality much coveted by QVC, the home-shopping behemoth that found success with celebrities including Iman and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Ms. Shields’s history is part of the draw. On screen and on the page, she has been a continual presence in the lives of her fans: a comedic talent and the author of several viscerally revealing memoirs in which she casts herself as a survivor, beating back demons that include a codependent relationship with an alcoholic mother and a severe episode of postpartum depression. As Rachel Ungaro, the vice president of fashion merchandising and design development for QVC said, “she transcends the decades”: fixed firmly in home viewers’ imaginations as paradoxically tough and alluring but approachable. “Our customer is going to love her,” Ms. Ungaro said, “because to their minds she is very real.” "
"Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, and his wife were directly involved in selecting a $31,000 custom mahogany dining room set for his office — contrary to Mr. Carson’s claim that the decision was handled by subordinates, newly obtained documents show. In an August email, the department’s administrative officer referred to “printouts of the furniture the secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out,” according to a 163-page cache of emails obtained by American Oversight, a Washington-based watchdog group, under the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Carson’s wife, Candy Carson, played a central role in coordinating the redecoration of his office suite — down to scheduling an appointment with an interior decorator, reviewing photo boards of furniture choices last summer and pressuring staff members to find more money for furnishings, according to the emails. The correspondence came as the Trump administration proposed extensive cuts to the department. It also reveals that senior HUD staff members scrambled to figure out ways to reconcile Mrs. Carson’s demands for major upgrades to the outdated office suite with federal laws that prohibit expenditures of more than $5,000 on office furniture without congressional approval. The emails contain vivid descriptions of the “wobbling” chairs and table. In one message, a top HUD official, Sheila Greenwood, wrote that she feared one of the chairs might collapse under a visitor — which she described as a potential “embarrassment.” At least one of Mr. Carson’s predecessors — Shaun Donovan, who served under President Barack Obama — abandoned the idea of replacing the furniture when told it would exceed the statutory price limit, according to two former agency officials.

"MONTREAL — Since arriving back in Montreal after nearly three decades abroad, one of the most striking changes I’ve noticed has been the seeming retreat of the separatist movement here. The younger generation seems far more focused on becoming the Quebecois Steve Jobs than in fomenting revolution. So as I began my Quebec road trip this week in my hometown, I sought out Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, a charismatic young proponent of Quebec’s independence from Canada. My aim was to try and understand how the movement has evolved since the culture wars of the 1980s, when the province was buffeted by the aftermath of a referendum on independence. Mr. Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc Mélenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 “Maple Spring,” huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty. “Quebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,” he told me on Monday over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the province’s National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire. While he acknowledged that the separatist movement was “not at its peak,” he stressed that about 30 percent to 40 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls. Moreover, he argued that Quebec’s independence would help neutralize the province’s simmering far right by expunging easy nationalism and xenophobia in favor of cultural affirmation and human rights. Having an independent country, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said, would mitigate against fear of the other. "
"This week Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced that they will be ending their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, having found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Trump administration. That’s no surprise: The announcement punctuates a process that has been a sham, falling far short of the benchmarks laid out by a bipartisan group of experts (including one of us, Ms. Schneider) last fall for effective, credible congressional investigations. But for those who may be thinking good riddance, think again. Every indication is that this is far from the end of the committee majority’s mischief. All signs instead point to this week’s developments as the beginning of a new chapter in the story, in which House Republicans go on the offensive to support President Trump — and fight the special counsel, Robert Mueller. That likely trajectory emerges from plotting the data points before us. First, the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, attempted to provide cover for President Trump’s false allegation that he was wiretapped by his predecessor. Mr. Nunes met with White House officials in secret and then held news conferences in which he claimed that the outgoing national security adviser, Susan Rice, and her colleagues had wrongly sought to “unmask” (i.e., identify by name) certain Trump associates in surveillance reports. When that effort ran out of steam, Mr. Nunes and the majority shifted their attention to the process by which law enforcement agencies obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorization to conduct electronic monitoring of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The committee released a highly misleading memo claiming that the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice had abused their powers — claims which turned out to be unfounded. Now, with their forthcoming report, the Republicans on the committee have turned their focus to attacking the substance of the Mueller investigation. The special counsel is examining three core issues: Did Russia attack the 2016 elections to aid Mr. Trump; did Mr. Trump or members of his campaign collude with the Russians to do so; and did Mr. Trump or others obstruct the investigation of these matters? The committee majority report, which has yet to be released but which members of the majority have begun to tease out in recent days, is an attempt to defang the first question, finding against all evidence that the Russian attack was not intended to help Mr. Trump (though a few members of the majority, including Representative Trey Gowdy, have been more equivocal). And the majority report endeavors to gut the second question, declaring the absence of collusion altogether. "
"BRUSSELS — The operatic ouster of Rex Tillerson leaves a State Department angry and adrift, and a world even more confused about the management and direction of American foreign policy, hoping but not expecting that the change leads to greater coherence in Washington. The angst is being felt especially acutely among European leaders. With the back-to-back resignation of Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, and the firing of Mr. Tillerson they fear the period of “benign neglect” they have experienced so far from Mr. Trump is over. Mr. Tillerson was roundly criticized by a much-demoralized diplomatic corps, accused of gutting budgets and staffing levels in a reflection of what many see as a long, downward trajectory of the State Department’s influence. But for allies, in particular, he was also seen as “one of the grown-ups” and a relative voice of reason, even comfort, in comparison with his boss’s brash impulsiveness. Mr. Trump’s move to replace him with Mike Pompeo, who was running the C.I.A., appears part of a forceful shift by the president to surround himself with a more like-minded cast. Mr. Tillerson was reported to have called his boss “a moron.” His successor has been an outspoken Trump supporter. Some expect that the potential alignment of views may usher in greater consistency from the Trump administration, but not necessarily on the positions America’s allies want. "

"Britain’s expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats over what officials called Russia’s role in the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil echoes the espionage feuds between Washington and Moscow. For both Britain and the United States, such expulsions have their roots in the spying between Russia and the West that has endured since the end of the Cold War. Here is a summary of the best-known expulsions in recent years between the United States and Russia: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered the United States diplomatic mission to reduce its staff by 755 employees in response to American sanctions, including the expulsion of 35 Russian officials, imposed in the final weeks of President Barack Obama’s administration. Mr. Putin had delayed such a move, hoping for an improved relationship under President Trump, “but, judging by everything, if it changes, it will not be soon.” The United States expelled 35 Russian officials, the largest number of diplomats forced to leave since 2001, in retaliation for what American spy agencies said was Russian interference in the presidential election. The United States expelled two Russian diplomats in retaliation for a bizarre episode outside the United States Embassy in Moscow, in which a Russian police officer attacked an American diplomat. Russian television broadcast a short clip of the scuffle and said the American was an undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative who had refused to show identification before entering the embassy. The State Department said the American was an “accredited diplomat” who had been assaulted as part of systematic harassment of American Embassy staff members by the Russian authorities. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump loves big personalities, live television, the stock market and loyalty. In choosing Larry Kudlow, a CNBC television commentator, to serve as the next director of the National Economic Council, he has checked all those boxes. Mr. Kudlow, often clad in a pinstripe suit and colorful tie, is a frequent pundit on the financial news channel where he opines about everything from the economy to the stock market to tax cuts and free trade. He is an unabashed prognosticator who relishes making the kinds of provocative statements that Mr. Trump has turned into an art form. He has lamented “growing government dependency,” touted tax cuts for the wealthy and lavished praise on high-flying corporate executives. Mr. Kudlow will assume the role of Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, replacing Gary D. Cohn, who said he would resign after losing a battle over the president’s longstanding desire to impose large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that Mr. Kudlow had been offered the job and that the administration would “work to have an orderly transition.” The decision to pick Mr. Kudlow, a longtime cheerleader of the president, is the latest move by Mr. Trump to surround himself with loyalists in high administrative posts. On Monday, Mr. Trump ousted Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state and said he would nominate the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, to take his place. As with the Pompeo announcement, which took Mr. Tillerson and some others in the administration by surprise, Mr. Kudlow’s selection startled some in the West Wing, who were unaware it was happening. In an interview on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Kudlow said Mr. Trump had called him Tuesday night and offered the job, which he had immediately agreed to take. "
"The title of Yascha Mounk’s new book, “The People vs. Democracy,” makes clever use of what looks like a glaring oxymoron: After all, what is democracy if not rule by the people? When democracy is under siege, the belligerents are supposed to be dictators, oligarchs and autocrats; the people are supposed to be the guardians (if all goes well), or else the victims (if it doesn’t). But that’s just the delusions of liberal democracy talking. Mounk, who lectures on political theory at Harvard and builds on the important work of scholars like Jan-Werner Müller and Cas Mudde, shows how populist insurgencies can undermine democracy — in the long run, that is. At first, populist movements often present themselves as deeply, even radically, democratic. The 2016 Brexit referendum is a case in point. Inviting citizens to vote on such an enormous policy change was a simple enactment of direct democracy. Those who voted for Britain to leave the European Union declared they were wresting autonomy away from the bureaucratic clutches of an unresponsive, Brussels-based elite. A characteristic slogan of the pro-Brexit campaign was “Take Back Control.” Much of this rhetoric baldly exploited anti-immigrant bigotry — a classic tactic in the populist playbook. For all that populists purport to champion the will of the people, their definition of the people is often restrictive and “deeply illiberal,” Mounk writes, if not downright exclusionary. They also rail against institutions that circumscribe what they deem to be the popular will: “They openly say that neither independent institutions nor individual rights should dampen the people’s voice.” Which is what makes populism ultimately inimical to liberal democracy, and what allows Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, to say he is building an “illiberal new state based on national foundations” while maintaining his popular support. Notice how far we’ve gotten without a mention of you-know-who, the chief populist of the United States. He’s included in “The People vs. Democracy,” as he should be, but one of the many things to recommend this clarifying book is its international scope. As much as Donald J. Trump might fancy himself one of a kind, Mounk argues that the American president is part of a global wave. Populist forces are surging in Britain, Germany, Italy and France; in places like Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey and Poland they have already settled in, set up house and gotten around to the next step: gutting institutional safeguards in order to shore up their rule. Political scientists like Mounk talk about norms and institutions with a kind of reverence that can seem puzzling to non-scholars and non-wonks. But institutions are what allow people, whose experiences and interests differ and diverge, to live together in a democratic system. Whether entrusted with regulating banks or protecting civil rights or enforcing term limits, “liberal institutions are, in the long run, needed for democracy to survive.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Tillerson Ousted as Trump Silences Dissent in Cabinet” (front page, March 14): It has been nearly a year and a half since Donald Trump became president, and only now is he assembling a cabinet he wants? That shows once again his abysmal and unprecedented unpreparedness for the office. After Stephen Bannon was fired, and then seemingly apolitical John Kelly made chief of staff, it appeared that Mr. Trump wanted to govern more from the center. But now, with the apparent declining influence of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the departures of Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn, and the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state, it seems that while Mr. Bannon left in disgrace, his ideology has taken hold in Mr. Trump’s mind and government. JAMES ADLER, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: As a former superintendent of schools and executive director of a professional association, I know how difficult it is to fire someone face to face. So I understand why President Trump decided to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter instead of meeting with him. Understanding, however, does not equate to justification. Nobody deserves to find out via a tweet that he has lost his job just because his boss does not have the courage to deliver the news in person. The president enjoys giving bellicose speeches that attempt to bully others into doing what he wants them to do. Like many bullies, however, Mr. Trump runs away from situations in which he has to actually display courage with actions instead of just words. JOSEPH J. CIRASUOLO

"An article about an Ohio man who has avoided political news since the election of Donald Trump caused a stir among readers, who expressed mixed opinions over the story’s subject, Erik Hagerman. Some criticized what they considered a sense of privilege while others lauded him as a modern day Henry David Thoreau. The story also hit a chord with journalists. Tyler Buchanan, the editor of The Athens Messenger, Mr. Hagerman’s local newspaper, said he was rattled by Mr. Hagerman’s decision to remain uninformed. Another journalist called Mr. Hagerman “the most selfish man in America” while another criticized his “willful ignorance.” Mr. Hagerman may never know how people reacted to his experiment because he does not read The New York Times or use social media.

"As thousands of students walked out of their schools on Wednesday to pressure Congress to approve gun control legislation, three other students were healing from wounds inflicted when a teacher’s firearm accidentally discharged in a California classroom. The teacher, Dennis Alexander, who is also a city councilman in Seaside, Calif., was showing the students a gun on Tuesday during his advanced public safety class at Seaside High School when the gun accidentally went off, Marci McFadden, a spokeswoman for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Mr. Alexander was pointing his gun at the ceiling when it fired, she said, causing pieces of the ceiling to fall to the floor. Ms. McFadden said that California law and district policy prohibit teachers from bringing guns on campus. Cmdr. Nick Borges of the Seaside Police Department said in an email on Wednesday that nobody suffered serious injuries, however, a piece of bullet shrapnel ricocheted and hit one 17-year-old on the neck, and two other students were also hit by debris. The 17-year-old boy’s parents told the television station KSBW that they took him to a hospital for X-rays after he returned home. “He’s shaken up, but he’s going to be O.K.,” the boy’s father, Fermin Gonzales, told KSBW. “I’m just pretty upset that no one told us anything and we had to call the police ourselves to report it.” "
"WASHINGTON — For the Democratic Party, Conor Lamb seemed like a candidate generated from reams of election data mined and analyzed to produce an ideal fit for his Southwestern Pennsylvania congressional district. A former Marine who favored gun rights, he was culturally conservative enough to appeal to rural voters. He was pro labor and pro tariff in an area that still has thousands of steelworkers union members. As a federal prosecutor, he cracked down on drug dealers but also offered empathy about the tragedy of opioid addiction. And his Ivy League polish and earnest manner played well with college-educated suburban voters. And now, with his victory in a district so Republican that Democrats did not even field a candidate in the last two elections, Mr. Lamb, 33, has offered a template that will be studied in congressional races where Democratic candidates need to win over voters who supported President Trump. “He is like the type of Democrat that won in ruby-red districts in 2006, who breaks the mold and is much more of a nontraditional, outside-the-mainstream, everyday American law enforcement type,” said John Lapp, a Democratic strategist who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006, when the party wrested control of the House from Republicans. Mr. Lamb had to navigate a district that President Trump had won by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. The president labeled him “Lamb the sham” in a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania last Saturday, and the administration deployed Vice President Mike Pence, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, and Donald Trump Jr. to defeat him.

"Conor Lamb, a Democrat and former Marine, scored a razor-thin but extraordinary upset in a special House election in southwestern Pennsylvania after a few thousand absentee ballots cemented a Democratic victory in the heart of President Trump’s Rust Belt base. The Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, may still contest the outcome. But Mr. Lamb’s 627-vote lead Wednesday afternoon appeared insurmountable, given that the four counties in Pennsylvania’s 18th district have about 500 provisional, military and other absentee ballots left to count, election officials said. That slim margin — out of almost 230,000 ballots cast in a district that Mr. Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016 — nonetheless upended the political landscape ahead of November’s midterm elections. It also emboldened Democrats to run maverick campaigns even in deep-red areas where Republicans remain bedeviled by Mr. Trump’s unpopularity. Republican officials in Washington said they were likely to demand a recount through litigation, and the National Republican Congressional Committee put out a call for voters to report any irregularities in the balloting. Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the committee, said the party was “not conceding anything.” The battle for a district in suburban and rural areas around Pittsburgh underscored the degree to which Mr. Trump’s appeal has receded across the country. And it exposed the ways in which both parties are weighed down by divisive leaders: Democrats by Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader; Republicans by Mr. Trump and Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House. Just as vividly, the race showed that only one party — the Democrats — appears willing to grapple with the implications of campaigning under its unpopular figurehead.

"President Trump’s decision to block a foreign company’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones and other devices, before the deal had even been signed, was extraordinary. It was also the right move, given the series of mergers that has left the semiconductor industry already dominated by a few large companies. Singapore-based Broadcom was trying to acquire Qualcomm, headquartered in San Diego, for $117 billion — which would have made it the largest technology deal in history — in a hostile takeover. Mr. Trump pre-emptively blocked the purchase on Monday, citing national security concerns. While the president did not provide a detailed rationale, a March 5 letter from the Treasury Department calling for a review of the deal said that the administration was concerned about Broadcom’s relationships with other foreign companies. The letter strongly hinted that those companies of interest are based in China. It also noted that Broadcom has reduced spending on research and development at the businesses it acquires, a practice that could make Qualcomm less innovative. That, in turn, would give Chinese businesses a leg up in the race to develop the technology for the next generation of cellphones, known as 5G, which is expected to provide faster internet access and generate billions of dollars in profits for the wireless industry in the coming years. Seen against the backdrop of the president’s protectionist statements and policies, this decision is unnerving. He recently used another national security law to announce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, arguing that he was seeking to force China to reduce excess production of those metals. In reality those tariffs will not hurt China much, landing a heavier blow on American allies like the European Union, Brazil and South Korea and possibly starting a wider trade war as other countries retaliate against the United States. That is why some experts fear that by blocking the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, Mr. Trump could further rattle the global economy and international norms. Other countries might now feel emboldened to block as a security threat inbound foreign investment that they consider significant, justifiably or not. France and other countries have a history of protecting companies they consider “national champions,” but the United States has been reluctant to do so. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is made up of representatives from across the executive branch, looks at acquisitions that could represent a national security problem, but its reviews typically end up scuttling only a few deals annually, though the number has increased in recent years.

"If you’re a murderous dictator, this is a joyous time to be alive. No one will make much of a fuss if your opposition leader is jailed, if an annoying journalist goes missing or if, as happened in Congo, a judge who displeases the dictatorial president suffers a home invasion in which goons rape his wife and daughter. As President Trump replaces Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with the more hawkish Mike Pompeo, let’s note something that goes far beyond personnel to the heart of the American role in the world: The U.S. has abandoned a bipartisan consensus on human rights that goes back decades. I’m back from Myanmar, where leaders are finding that this is also the optimal time to commit genocide. The army conducted a scorched-earth campaign against the Rohingya ethnic minority, with soldiers throwing babies onto bonfires as they raped the mothers. What has Trump said to condemn Myanmar for these atrocities? Essentially nothing. In the past, human rights was at least one thread of our foreign policy. This was pursued inconsistently, grudgingly or hypocritically, and it jostled constantly with realpolitik considerations, but in the past it was one of the factors in play. I periodically assailed Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush for not doing more after atrocities in Syria, Darfur or South Sudan, but both Obama and Bush were clearly anguished and frustrated that they didn’t have better tools to stop the slaughter. In contrast, President Trump seems simply indifferent. Trump defended Vladimir Putin for killing critics (“What? You think our country’s so innocent?”), and praised Egypt’s brutal president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for “a fantastic job.” Trump hailed the Philippines’s president, Rodrigo Duterte, whose dirty war on drugs has claimed 12,000 lives, for an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” "
"ST. LOUIS — Amid all the turmoil and uncertainty, with his White House seemingly fraying, his legislative agenda stalled and his electoral base in danger, President Trump these days finds one area of comfort: talking about his tax cuts. He finds it so reassuring, in fact, that he is increasingly talking about doing it all over again. Mr. Trump came here to red-state Middle America on Wednesday to promote the economic benefits of the $1.5 trillion in tax breaks he signed in December, surrounding himself with workers and business owners who celebrated the prospect of more money in their pockets. As he basked in the praise, the president promised that he was not done. “We’re now going for a Phase 2,” he told a selected group of supporters at a Boeing factory in St. Louis. He did not describe what would be in such a Phase 2 but said he would team up with Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “It’s going to be something very special. Kevin Brady’s working on it with me.” Mr. Brady said earlier in the day that he hoped to pass another tax-cutting bill by the end of the year. “We’re really encouraged,” he said on Fox Business Network. “Main Street optimism is at record levels. Our economy is really gaining momentum and booming in a big way. But look, we think even more can be done. We want to make sure that we’re encouraging innovation in America. We want to help families save for the long term.” If Mr. Trump had a plan in mind, it was a mystery to many of his aides, who knew nothing about it. What Mr. Trump and Mr. Brady might be talking about, however, could be more of a branding exercise than a major legislative effort that stands any chance of becoming law this year. The effort they are calling “Phase 2” appears to unify two lingering problems from the tax cut bill that Republicans sped through Congress late last year. In both cases, fixing them would require support from Senate Democrats, who are not inclined to lend any backing to a tax bill that they opposed and that was passed over their objections. "
"A decade after the federal government rescued the first of many faltering financial firms, the Senate voted on Wednesday to pass legislation that would relax restrictions on large parts of the banking industry, representing the most significant changes to the rules that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. In a rare showing of bipartisanship, the Senate voted 67 to 31 to pass the bill, which is intended to help small- and medium-size banks but which critics say is a dangerous rollback of financial regulations intended to prevent another meltdown. The legislation faces an uncertain fate going forward, as House Republicans are expected to push for a much more expansive rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Senate Democrats who voted for the bill that passed on Wednesday have insisted that major changes along the lines of what the House passed last year will sink the effort but expressed hope that the legislation could herald a return to the kind of cooperation that has recently eluded Congress. “This legislative package is an example of what we can achieve by working together and shows Democrats and Republicans can break the gridlock,” said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. The bill, which the Senate Banking Committee drafted over several years, would let hundreds of smaller banks avoid some federal oversight such as stress tests, which measure a bank’s ability to weather an economic downturn. Banks with $50 billion of assets are currently considered “systemically important” and are governed by more stringent regulations. The Senate bill raises that threshold to $250 billion, leaving only a handful of the biggest banks facing the toughest oversight. "
"Dear Career Counselor, My grandson just graduated from college and is having a terrible time finding work. I was wondering if he would qualify for a job with the White House. I hear there’s lots of turnover. Is secretary of state still available? Or what about the young man who carried around extra pens for the president? Didn’t he just get fired? — Ambitious Grandmother Dear Grandmother, Good thinking! About a third of the top jobs in the Trump administration are still wide open, and while they usually aren’t the kind of things that go to 21-year-olds, most of the people who are actually qualified wouldn’t touch them with a 10-foot résumé. Secretary of state seems to be off the table for the moment. But there’s definitely an opening for personal assistant to the president — that’s the guy with the pens. The previous incumbent, John McEntee, was escorted off the White House grounds this week after he failed his long-delayed security clearance — reportedly because of financial issues involving gambling and taxes. There aren’t any specific job requirements, but McEntee did star in a very popular video in which he demonstrated his ability to knock a bottle off a friend’s head with a football. Can your grandson do that? I guess he could practice. But what happens if my grandson goes to work for the White House and then fails a basic background check and gets tossed out the door?

"The nearly 17-year-old Afghanistan conflict, the longest war in United States history, will not end on the battlefield. It can be resolved only at the negotiating table. So, the bold offer last month from President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan to negotiate with the Taliban “without preconditions” is a welcome initiative. But it faces daunting obstacles. Mr. Ghani’s proposal envisions an outcome in which the Taliban would be recognized as a legitimate political party, prisoners would be released and United Nations sanctions against the group would be lifted. In exchange, the Taliban would have to recognize the Afghan government and respect the rule of law, including women’s rights. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, during a surprise visit to Afghanistan this week, said there was evidence that some Taliban factions are interested in talks. The Taliban have not responded formally to Mr. Ghani’s proposal, but in the past they have refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, which they deem an American puppet. Instead, the Taliban have insisted on direct talks with the United States that exclude the Kabul government, as a way to discredit it. The United States has long supported an Afghan-led peace process, in which Washington might play a role but would not stand in for the Afghan government. Assuming the Taliban refuse Mr. Ghani’s offer, it’s timely to ask: Is there an alternative to an indefinite United States military presence in Afghanistan? The fact is the Taliban remain strong, controlling or contesting over a third of the country. Their share continues to grow slowly, despite persistent Afghan and American efforts to weaken them. The early Obama-era surge to 100,000 United States troops, plus the infusion of an additional 40,000 troops from NATO nations, did not defeat or even permanently debilitate the Taliban. Late in his administration, President Barack Obama drew down American troops to below 10,000 and focused the mission squarely on counterterrorism, fighting Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, while providing only training, advice and assistance to Afghan forces fighting the Taliban. He ultimately ordered a deadly 2016 strike against the Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, in the hope that his removal would substantially weaken the Taliban. It did not. "
"BETHEL PARK, Pa. — There is the straightforward story about what happened on Tuesday in Western Pennsylvania: Another election in the Trump era, another surprising Democratic performance in the suburbs, this one in the affluent, but staunchly Republican townships south of Pittsburgh. But there is also a more refined account, one shared by the Trump lovers at Bob’s Diner and the Trump loathers at the Panera Bread down the road: Anti-Trump motivation is abundant, but in close races, candidates still matter. “I don’t have enough curse words to describe our current president,” said Paul Cohen, 74, a retired insurance broker eating lunch with his wife at Panera. But, he said, “I’m not necessarily a liberal. And to find a Democrat running as a centrist immediately got my attention.” This is a safe description of Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate who on Wednesday claimed a razor-thin victory over the Republican candidate, State Representative Rick Saccone, in a special congressional election. Mr. Lamb — moderate on gun control, personally disapproving of abortion but against stricter bans and supportive of Mr. Trump’s plan to put tariffs on steel and aluminum — seemed a particularly good fit for this generally conservative district. “His positions were more Republican than Democrat,” said Deb Vosel, 62, a retired nurse sitting with her husband at Bob’s Diner. She knows plenty of people who voted for Mr. Trump and almost no one who regretted it. Many of the same people, she said, voted for Mr. Lamb. “In this neck of the woods,” she said, “people judge people on their merits.” As simple as that sounds, it should not detract from Mr. Lamb’s feat. The 18th Congressional District runs from the rural southwest corner of the state, a blue-collar wedge of gas fields and coal mines, up to the middle- and upper-class Pittsburgh suburbs, a mix of dependably Democratic communities and Republican strongholds.

"In a “Meet the Press” interview on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin shrugged off questions about President Trump’s incendiary tweets, personal insults and vulgar language. Mr. Mnuchin suggested that he was above riffraff talk. “I think you should be focused on what the policies are,” he told the show’s host, Chuck Todd. His words sounded high-minded, but they rang hollow. Mr. Mnuchin, who has milked taxpayers so that he and his wife can travel in style, might benefit from a refresher course in the axiom that character is destiny. It’s an idea that has been around for a couple of thousand years, and for good reason: It’s inherently true. This brings us to Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor, who also once seemed to give that concept short shrift. “I do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals,” he said. “It is about ideas, the public good and doing what is best for the state of New York.” That was on March 10, 2008, a few days before Mr. Spitzer was forced to resign as governor amid revelations that he’d been a frequent patron of a prostitution ring. His hypocrisy was manifest, given how he had proclaimed himself an implacable foe of the sex trade because it exploited women. Character, meet your destiny. This week, the 10th anniversary of his resignation, news organizations have resurrected the scandal, exploring how it rapidly unfolded and offering where-are-they-now profiles of key figures. Mr. Spitzer, now 58, has taken control of his family’s real-estate business. After an unsuccessful run for city comptroller five years ago, he’s not through with politics so much as politics is through with him. Few New Yorkers shed tears over his demise because, in the course of fewer than 15 months as governor, he had alienated many voters and fellow politicians alike with his heedless manner. His fate is worth noting in light of present-day national politics. Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, warned a Republican assemblyman that he was a “steamroller” who’d run over opponents, modifying that word with a well-worn Anglo-Saxonism. He described Joseph Bruno, the State Senate Republican leader and a man 30 years his senior, as “old” and “senile,” throwing in vulgar language to show his own toughness. He gracelessly likened the governorship of his predecessor, George Pataki, to Rip Van Winkle, sleeping the years away — this in his inaugural speech, with Mr. Pataki sitting right there. During an argument, one state senator said, Mr. Spitzer threatened to cut his head off. "

arlier this week, I found myself trying to explain Nippers to my editors in Hong Kong. “It’s this Aussie beach surf lifesaving thing,” I said. “All the kids wear these colorful beanies and go down to the beach early on Sunday, and there’s swimming and running and then there are these boards and …” My description was interrupted by laughter and questions. I could tell from our video conference call that my American editors were a bit confused. And honestly, I could relate. I still recall having no idea what this whole Nippers thing was when we first arrived in Sydney a year ago. Even when I signed up our two children, I didn’t really understand what we were getting ourselves into. But now, as the Nippers season comes to a close, I’m overwhelmed with appreciation. It may take a few more Sundays to figure out exactly why, but there are a few things I greatly admire about Nippers — and perhaps by extension, Australia itself. First and foremost: the encouragement of managed risk, at least with nature. (Culture and business are subjects for another newsletter.) Here, children are not told to avoid the mighty ocean. They’re taught to be safe in it. "
"UNITED NATIONS — Britain called an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday to formally accuse Russia of trying to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil with a military-grade nerve agent. The March 4 attack in the British cathedral town of Salisbury was “indiscriminate and reckless,” Ambassador Jonathan Allen said, part of what he suggested was a pattern of Russian misbehavior that had become a threat to international peace and security. He received unequivocal support from his American counterpart, Nikki R. Haley, who, unlike her boss, President Trump, has bluntly rebuked Russia on a range of topics. “Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent,” Ms. Haley said, calling the poisoning “an atrocious crime.” The Security Council session was unusual. Permanent members of the council do not normally accuse one another of what under certain circumstances could be construed as acts of war. The former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on March 4 with what British investigators have identified as Novichok, a potent nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House has created a working group to prepare for the landmark meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. But Mr. Trump’s sudden ousting on Tuesday of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson could delay critical elements of the planning until the Senate confirms his successor, Mike Pompeo. Few officials expect Mr. Pompeo’s arrival at the State Department to derail the meeting itself, as long as the president and Mr. Kim remain committed to it. But Mr. Tillerson’s departure deprives the White House of the person most experienced in efforts to reach out to North Korea. As the C.I.A. director, Mr. Pompeo has focused more on the threats posed by Pyongyang. Mr. Pompeo will not be able to establish contact with the South Korean foreign minister, let alone his North Korean counterpart, until the Senate approves his nomination — a process that officials on Capitol Hill said could take several weeks. The White House has not yet even completed the paperwork to begin that process, the officials said. Adding to the confusion is the lack of official confirmation of a meeting from North Korea. Mr. Kim’s offer was relayed to Mr. Trump by two envoys from South Korea who had recently visited him in Pyongyang. But an American official said Wednesday that the United States and North Korea had still not conferred directly about the meeting through the various diplomatic channels they use. The radio silence from Pyongyang has sowed doubts among some North Korea experts about whether Mr. Kim even made the offer — or, at least, whether he pledged to refrain from testing missiles and to put his nuclear weapons program on the table in a negotiation with Mr. Trump. “What is nagging at me is that these alleged promises or concessions from Kim Jong-un seem so out of character for North Korea’s 34-year-old leader,” Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies, said in an essay posted on the Brookings website. "
"WASHINGTON — Green Berets working with government forces in Niger killed 11 Islamic State militants in a firefight in December, the American military acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday. The battle occurred two months after four United States soldiers died in an ambush in another part of Niger — and after senior commanders had imposed stricter limits on military missions in the West African country. No American or Nigerien forces were harmed in the December gun battle. But the combat — along with at least 10 other previously unreported attacks on American troops in West Africa between 2015 and 2017 — indicates that the deadly Oct. 4 ambush was not an isolated episode in a nation where the United States is building a major drone base. After the ambush, senior officers at United States Africa Command, which oversees American military operations on the continent, imposed additional measures to enhance the safety of troops on missions that were designed to train and advise local forces in Niger. But the missions did not end. On the morning of Dec. 6, a combined force of Nigerien and American troops “came under fire from a formation of violent extremists,” Samantha Reho, a spokeswoman for Africa Command, said in a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday. She said the gun battle killed 11 militants — including two wearing suicide vests — who were believed to be affiliated with the Islamic State in West Africa. No American or Nigerien forces were killed or wounded, she said. It was the first time the American military has acknowledged the December firefight, and Ms. Reho gave no explanation for the Pentagon’s failure to disclose the episode at the time. "
"WASHINGTON — With hundreds of high school students massed at the Capitol to demand gun control, the House instead approved modest legislation on Wednesday to beef up school security without changes to the nation’s gun laws, hoping to answer demands for action a month after the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Across Capitol Hill, a top F.B.I. official conceded in Senate testimony that his agency had made mistakes in failing to follow up on tips about the gunman. “We clearly should have done more,” David L. Bowdich, the acting deputy director of the F.B.I., told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the bureau was doubling the number of supervisors assigned to review tips from the public. The House vote and the Senate hearing came as students across the country  walked out of their classes to demand tougher gun laws after the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Hundreds rallied in front of the White House and at the Capitol, cheered on by congressional Democratic leaders. But the school safety bill had no provisions relating to guns, and the Senate hearing was focused on law enforcement failures. Gun control advocates said neither addressed what they saw as the real problem: the proliferation of high-powered firearms used in mass shootings, not only at schools but at concerts, churches, movie theaters and other public places. The House measure, which passed 407 to 10 as dozens of students looked down from the visitors’ gallery, is one of a flurry of school safety bills that have been introduced in Congress — without curbs on guns.

"When the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb began his race in a special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, he faced headwinds of the type that caused horizontal snow in the nor’easter last week. For starters, Donald Trump had won the district by 20 points in 2016. The district has been held by Republicans for most of the last 50 years. Conservative “super PACS” were willing to spend millions — it ended up being around $10 million — to buy TV time to savage Mr. Lamb. The incumbent, Tim Murphy, a conservative anti-abortion Republican, had a lock on re-election until The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion. Republican House leaders decided that Mr. Murphy had to go. He resigned in October. The man Republicans chose as their candidate was Rick Saccone, a Jurassic-era conservative who boasted that he was “Trump before Trump was Trump.” That apparently was a few Trumps too many for voters in the 18th, which begins in the Pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way, in classic gerrymandering fashion, through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the West Virginia border. It’s no wonder that Mr. Saccone entered the race as the favorite. This race was Mr. Saccone’s to lose — and darned if he didn’t. "
"RUSSIAN ROULETTE
The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump
By Michael Isikoff and David Corn
338 pp. Twelve. $30. It is an article of faith among President Trump’s most ardent detractors that he is a corrupt blowhard catapulted to the office by a devious intelligence operation ordered up by America’s supervillain, the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin. On the other end of the country’s hopelessly splintered political spectrum are those who join Trump in rebutting the idea, often with the caps lock on: “FAKE NEWS!” “NO COLLUSION!” Somewhere in between are those — and let us presume to count among them the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III — who are determined to establish what exactly Russia did to influence the outcome of the presidential election of 2016. For that, it seems, we will have to wait for Mueller’s band of investigators to complete their work. His latest indictment inched ever closer to the Kremlin, targeting 13 Russians, including one close enough to the top to be nicknamed “Putin’s cook,” but still stopped short of implicating the Russian leader or establishing the collusion with Trump’s campaign that critics are certain took place. In the meantime comes “Russian Roulette,” a new book by two veterans of Washington political journalism, Michael Isikoff and David Corn, whose subtitle promises to reveal “the inside story of Putin’s war on America and the election of Donald Trump.” "
"THE ANCIENT GREEKS put fate in the hands of three old women, goddesses who spun the thread of life, twisted it to allot each individual a measure of joy or sorrow, and wielded the “abhorred shears” (in the poet John Milton’s phrase) that could cut life short. The Greeks knew something that artists, along with a new generation of “craftivists” (people combining craft with activism), are rediscovering — that fiber (woven, knitted, braided, quilted, crocheted, embroidered) can be an expressive medium, one more powerful, perhaps, for its ubiquity. Textiles, after all, accompany us on nearly every step of life: We are born and swaddled, buried in shrouds; most of us are even conceived between sheets. The renewed embrace of fiber might have something to do with our increasingly virtual world, scrubbed freer every day of human contact and face-to-face interaction. Textiles, in contrast, are earthy and inherently tactile. We speak of the “hand” of fabric, meaning the feel of it — whether slick and cool or rough and grainy. We speak, too, of the “fabric of society,” especially when it is unraveling. “Modern industry saves us endless labor and drudgery,” the Berlin-born artist and designer Anni Albers noted back in 1965 in “On Weaving,” her pioneering compendium on the art, reissued last October to coincide with her retrospective at the Guggenheim Bilbao. “But, Janus-faced,” she continued, “it … leaves idle our sense of touch.” Both her hand-loomed abstract tapestries and her factory-produced functional fabrics tempered the harsh glass-and-steel architecture of her Modernist contemporaries. In 1922, Albers joined the Bauhaus — the school Walter Gropius founded in Weimar with the utopian aim of integrating art and design into everyday life — as a reluctant weaver. A neuromuscular disorder causing weakness in her legs contributed to her abandonment of wall painting. But then she heard Paul Klee’s famous lecture that drawing involved “taking a line for a walk,” and decided to adapt the lesson to her new medium. “I thought,” she later recalled, “I will take thread everywhere I can.” In the late 1950s, when Albers’s husband, Josef, was heading the Department of Design at Yale University, he introduced his wife to a student who’d been turned on to textiles after seeing a picture of Peruvian mummy bundles. Now in her 80s, Sheila Hicks has woven, twined and wrapped her way around the world with fiber-based bas-reliefs and installations that snake through tall grasses (on view through the end of the month on Manhattan’s High Line), pile up in brilliantly colored heaps (as at last year’s Venice Biennale) or cascade from high places (as in a piece planned for a 22-foot tower on Capri). Her retrospective, which opened last month at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, also showcases the small, jewel-like weavings she calls “minimes,” incorporating shells, rubber bands, toothpicks and hair — eccentric, lyrical poetry of the everyday.

This week, we’re looking at daylight saving time (not “savings,” officially), why we keep building homes in wildfire-prone areas, and the status of climate lawsuits. If you were in the United States or Canada this past Sunday, you lost one hour. Alas, you won’t get it back until 2 a.m. on Nov. 4, but for now you can enjoy more evening light. Many other countries are preparing to shift to daylight saving time or summer time in the coming weeks. Benjamin Franklin is often credited with first proposing a version of daylight time (in jest) as a way to save candles. The practice of pushing clocks forward to make more use of daylight hours during the warmer months was adopted as part of a global effort to conserve energy during World War I. In 1918, one senator claimed that it saved the United States $2 million in gas bills. But does daylight time still save energy? Not really, according to most research on the subject. Lighting has become a smaller part of overall energy consumption, and extending the use of daylight hours encourages people to use more air conditioning and heating. "
"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand’s foreign ministry censured its second-ranking envoy to the United States on Wednesday after she tweeted that the Democratic Party in America should get its act together “or we will all die.” Caroline Beresford, New Zealand’s deputy high commissioner to the United States, and second in charge to the ambassador, Tim Groser, has since made her Twitter account private, with the news website Newsroom reporting that her tweets had been deleted. Responding to an opinion piece from the politics website The Hill, titled “A Sanders-Warren ticket could win big in 2020,” Ms. Beresford responded on Twitter, “No it couldn’t.” “Please get your” — and here she used an expletive — “together or we will all die,” she wrote. That was apparently in response to the suggestion that two senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, could form a presidential ticket for the 2020 election to defeat President Trump. The two senators are among the most liberal in Congress and have fervent supporters, but some Democrats fear that putting them on a presidential ticket would turn off moderate voters. Minutes before her provocative tweet, Ms. Beresford tweeted about the same article in The Hill, saying of Democrats, “They’ve learned nothing.” A spokesman for New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, said he had been advised of the matter Wednesday, and was “confident the ministry is responding in an appropriate way.” Discussing Ms. Beresford’s acts, New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that there were “very clear expectations of staff” that they “maintain political neutrality and care in expressing personal opinion” when making public comment, and that had “not been met” in this case. “The ministry does not in any way endorse the content or tone of the tweets, which we note were deleted,” a spokeswoman said, adding the ministry was taking “appropriate action.” Ms. Beresford did not respond to a request for comment. She earlier confirmed to the Newsroom website that she had personally sent the tweets, but “realized very quickly that they were inappropriate, which is why I deleted them.” "

"It’s hard to imagine a candidate with friendlier looks, a more harmless demeanor and a gentler-sounding surname than Conor Lamb. It’s hard to imagine a message for the G.O.P. scarier than the one that Lamb, a Democrat, just delivered in a special House election in Pennsylvania’s 18th district, where he led his Republican opponent, Rick Saccone, by less than 1,000 votes in a race that remained too close to call on Wednesday morning. Lamb declared victory. But even if he somehow ends up losing, Democrats have reason to rejoice and Republicans to tremble. Just 16 months ago, Donald Trump won this district by 20 points, and its promise as the kind of place brimming with the sort of voters who thrill to him was confirmed by his visit there late last week for a rally in support of Saccone. The president put what popularity he retains on the line, and flexed his trademark schoolyard humor with the epithet “Lamb the Sham.” This is all that he has to show for it. Politically and ideologically, Saccone glued himself to Trump, running a campaign whose slogan might as well have been, “I’m With Him.” Outside Republican groups poured millions into the race, some of it for ads that touted the very tax cuts that are supposed to buoy their hopes to hold onto their House majority in the November midterms. In other words, they fought hard — and with definite cause for optimism. The district has voted so reliably Republican over the last decade that in the 2014 and 2016 House races, Democrats didn’t even bother to field a candidate. So Lamb’s showing — win, lose or draw — is remarkable, and it’s of a piece with the victory of Doug Jones, a Democrat, in a special election for the U.S. Senate in Alabama and with what happened last November in Virginia, where Democrats prevailed decisively in the gubernatorial race and picked up a large number of seats in the state’s House of Delegates. Clearly, the opposition to Trump is energized and organized. Just as clearly, Trump’s style of governing — bereft of truth, lavish with chaos, crude and divisive — has diminished his standing and given his rivals an enormous window of opportunity. "
"The passage, from a book read three decades back, came to mind not long ago. A tweet-driven tumult was, as usual, roiling Washington. Surly and defiant, President Trump was ensconced in the White House, lashing out like King Lear with a cellphone. The issue of the hour was our policy toward a defiant North Korea, and the president had chosen that moment to boast that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim Jong-un’s — hardly an Achesonian diplomatic strategy. Which doubtless would have pleased, rather than troubled, Trump, who, like Miranda in “The Tempest,” looks upon each day as a “brave new world” that offers him fresh opportunities to star in a global drama of his own direction. Shifting between cable news and my own Twitter feed, I recalled the historian Barbara W. Tuchman’s observation in her 1984 book “The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.” “Wooden-headedness” in statecraft, which she defined as “assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting any contrary signs,” has clearly become a prevailing factor in our politics. As Tuchman wrote, wooden-headedness was best captured in a remark about Philip II of Spain: “No experience of the failure of his policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence.” Why did the Trojans allow the Greek horse within the gates? How did the Renaissance papacy so badly misjudge the moment, accelerating the Protestant Reformation? What could the British ruling class have done differently to keep the American colonies within London’s reach? Who, if anyone, could have prevented Washington’s tragic misadventure in Vietnam? These were Tuchman’s topics, and now, in our own time, we are forced to ponder the why, the how, the what and the who about America in the Age of Trump. “A prince, says Machiavelli,” Tuchman wrote, “ought always to be a great asker and a patient hearer of truth about those things of which he has inquired, and he should be angry if he finds that anyone has scruples about telling him the truth. What government needs is great askers.” To put it mildly, though, the Trump White House seems more “Shark Tank” than Brain Trust. Tuchman’s literary legacy is various and important. She wrote well about many things, including the coming of World War I (“The Guns of August,” a favorite of John F. Kennedy’s, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1963), the Black Plague (“A Distant Mirror”), the Far East (“Stilwell and the American Experience in China”) and the American Revolution (“The First Salute”). There is something notable, though, about “The March of Folly,” a collection of sketches about mature countries getting things woefully wrong. To Tuchman, folly begins with the most fundamental of things: an outsize and self-destructive will to power. Both the governors and the governed can overreach, convinced of their own rectitude and righteousness. “Chief among the forces affecting political folly is lust for power, named by Tacitus as ‘the most flagrant of all the passions,’” Tuchman wrote. “Because it can only be satisfied by power over others, government is its favorite field of exercise,” or what she calls the “paramount area of folly because it is there that men seek power over others — only to lose it over themselves.” In this light, President Trump and his alt-right coterie are not something new under the sun but another chapter in the oldest of human dramas: the tension between appetite and the common good, between ambition and common sense. There is a lesson here not only for the president but for the people — particularly the people who chose to support him in 2016 and who stand with him now, apparently come what may. “Persistence in error is the problem,” Tuchman wrote. One of the more troubling features of popular political life is blind tribal loyalty — the refusal to acknowledge that your chief or your kind could be wrong. A perennial issue, this reflexive defensiveness is especially pronounced at the moment. But the historically literate voter, like a historically literate decision maker, need not be captive to previously held opinions at all times and at any cost. “There is,” Tuchman wrote, “always freedom of choice to change or desist from a counterproductive course if the policy-maker” — or, in my view, the voter — “has the moral courage to exercise it. He is not a fated creature blown by the whims of Homeric gods. Yet to recognize error, to cut losses, to alter course, is the most repugnant option in government.” And in the mind and heart of a fervent voter who was determined to send a message to Washington that business as usual was not working. The question now, more than a year into business as unusual, is whether those who supported the populist insurgency of 2016 will honestly assess its effectiveness in 2018 and in 2020. “Wooden-headedness” in the Oval Office, alas, begins in the voting booth.

"T
he V.I.P. terminal of Baghdad International Airport is a clean and quiet place, about a quarter-mile removed from the noise and squalor of the main arrivals-and-departures hall. If you have the right connections and $150 — American dollars only — you can wait for your flight in comfort on one of the soft white leather couches, sipping an espresso and getting a close-up view of some of the colorful people who run today’s Middle East. On a typical afternoon, your fellow passengers may include Iranian-trained guerrillas and death-squad veterans who have grown rich on embezzlement. If you stay long enough, gulf oil barons may glide by with their white-robed entourages, perhaps brushing past Iranian Revolutionary Guardsmen in uniform or diplomats from Turkey or Russia, all of them hoping to bully or bribe Iraq’s weak state to their own preferred shape. Everyone is welcome as long as you speak the language of money. On the wall above you are wide-screen TVs and a stylized mural of ancient Iraq, so that you can compare today’s catastrophes with those of yesteryear. Before you leave, a customs official in a dark suit will take your ticket and passport and then return 10 minutes later, smiling obsequiously and extending your stamped documents with both hands. But even here, special treatment has its limits. On April 15 last year, a Qatari man arrived in the V.I.P. terminal on an evening flight from his country’s capital city, Doha. After identifying himself as a senior government envoy, he announced that he and his 14 colleagues, all dressed in crisp white ankle-length tunics called thobes, did not want their luggage inspected. The Qataris had brought 23 identical black duffels, a small peninsula of black nylon that covered a sizable portion of the lounge’s hardwood floor. Each bag was so heavy — well over 100 pounds — that the porters had trouble rolling them into the room. The Iraqis insisted, politely, that all bags must be screened, even in the V.I.P. terminal. The leader of the Qatari team was visibly shocked to hear this. He asked for time. The Qataris huddled for a quiet discussion and then made a number of phone calls. Eventually, they relented and allowed the bags to be screened. Each of them contained stacks of bricklike squares, wrapped in black tape that the scanner could not penetrate. When customs officials asked what was under the tape, the Qataris refused to say. The standoff lasted all night, and finally, near dawn, the exasperated Qataris gave in and drove to Baghdad without their luggage. It was only later that the Iraqis opened the 23 duffels and discovered a mix of dollars and euros, amounting to some $360 million. The bills alone weighed more than 2,500 pounds. A week later, the money still impounded, the Qatari team left Baghdad in the same jet that had brought them. They were now accompanied by two dozen Qataris, including members of the ruling Al Thani family, who had been kidnapped during a hunting trip in southern Iraq 16 months earlier. The story of what happened on that trip has not been reported until now. It entails a ransom deal of staggering size and complexity in which the Qataris paid vast sums to terrorists on both sides of the Middle East’s sectarian divide, fueling the region’s spiraling civil wars. The cost to Qatar wound up far exceeding $360 million, but ultimately cash was less important than the deal’s political dimension. In order to retrieve its hostages, Qatar was made to negotiate a tightly choreographed population exchange in Syria, using the rebel militias it finances to forcibly uproot every resident of four strategically located towns. The transfers advanced Tehran’s larger goal of transforming Syria — along with Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen — into satellite states that will enshrine a dominant Iranian role across the region. The deal was a blow for the Trump administration’s goal of pushing back against Iranian aggression, and for thousands of starving Syrians, it meant being driven into exile by a shadowy agreement, with little say from Syria’s own government. What began as a brazen kidnapping eventually became a measure of the geopolitical forces tearing the Middle East apart, and of their human cost: corruption, sectarian hatred and terrorism. Everyone involved had something to hide — except, perhaps, the hapless hunters who set it all in motion. To Arab falconers, the houbara bustard — a bug-eyed, long-legged creature about the size of a large chicken — is the king of game birds. It is a fast flier with an unusual defense: When cornered, it vomits an oily green substance that can temporarily blind an attacking falcon or hobble its wings. In the days before oil was discovered in the Arabian desert, the houbara’s seasonal return every fall was met with celebratory poetry and long hunts on camelback. The Land Rover made things a lot easier, but chasing the houbara, whose stringy flesh is said to be an aphrodisiac, remains one of the hallowed pursuits — along with thoroughbred stallions, huge yachts and French chateaus — that occupy the minds of Persian Gulf royalty.

President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, a move that had long been rumored to be imminent. Tillerson held the position for just over 14 months, a relatively short term for a secretary of state. Trump boasted to reporters that he had made the call to oust Tillerson “by myself.” Jimmy Fallon found that amusing. Trump may have made the decision himself, but Trevor Noah took issue with how he announced it: publicly, on Twitter, before even telling Tillerson he had been fired. Republicans in the House said Monday that they were wrapping up their investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Stephen Colbert was not thrilled to hear that. He made a sidelong reference to the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy, using a deadly nerve agent. "
"For the first year of the Trump administration the story was one of containment and constraint. President Trump was constrained ideologically by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, pursuing a conventional Republican agenda on health care and taxes and letting his populist promises hang fire. But more important he was constrained institutionally, in roughly the ways that Republican politicians had promised that he would be — surrounded by a conventional Republican cabinet and (after a while) a conventional White House that essentially governed for him, letting him play the authoritarian on Twitter while the business of the presidency was conducted elsewhere. The problem with this arrangement is that unlike other out-of-the-loop presidents — Richard Nixon at his nadir, Woodrow Wilson after his stroke, Ronald Reagan with a bullet in him — Trump was not actually incapacitated or about to be impeached. He was just, well, Donald Trump: a septuagenarian cable-TV addict ill-suited for the responsibilities of his office but still fully capable of attempting to exercise its powers. Which meant that the containment game had to last, not weeks or months, but three more long years to work. And it may not last that long. From his exciting new steel tariffs to his promised summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, Trump has been acting lately like a man less inclined to listen to his handlers — and now those handlers have begun to disappear. The firing of Rex Tillerson, on the heels of Gary Cohn’s departure about a week ago, evokes the wildly chaotic atmosphere that characterized Trump’s first few months in office. But as my colleague Maggie Haberman tweeted, this time it seems less like something happening to Trump and more like chaos orchestrated from the Oval Office: “The narrative of Trump unglued is not totally wrong but misses the reason why — he was terrified of the job the first six months, and now feels like he has a command of it. So now he is basically saying, ‘I’ve got this, I can make the changes I want.’” In other words, Trump knows that he’s been constrained and tamed — for all I know he might have read my columns, or at least the headlines, saying so — and doesn’t want to play the incapacitated Twitter president anymore. He wants to actually use the office, and not just occupy it — and since he is the president, nobody can stop him from trying. What would Trump becoming a real president mean in practice? In terms of personnel, it might mean that instead of easing out the hacks and cranks and TV personalities, as his staff managed to do during the year of constraint, Trump will begin to usher out his more qualified personnel and replace them with, well, TV personalities — Cohn with Larry Kudlow, perhaps, or H. R. McMaster with John Bolton. But it also promises to further multiply the number of important vacancies within the government, since more true-to-Trump personnel choices would inevitably have some trouble with the confirmation process, which in turn — as Haberman notes — will encourage Trump to take more counsel from the shadow Trumpland of his campaign, where his more misfit-toy advisers tend to congregate.

"At a time when deals between American and Chinese companies are on the rocks, an early example that united a major Wall Street deal maker with the Chinese government has come to an end. China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, has sold its stake in Blackstone Group, the American private equity giant, the latter said in a recent filing. The fund, known as C.I.C., did not disclose a reason for the sale, and neither side disclosed how big it was. The sale ends an 11-year investment that seemed to presage a new era of economic relations between the two countries. It helped Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder, become a major player in business and diplomatic circles between the two countries. That era seems very much over. American officials have taken a harder stance against Chinese money as Chinese buyers have looked to strike deals in sensitive areas like semiconductors and self-driving cars. President Trump’s criticism of China’s trade policies and his new tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum have worsened relations between Washington and Beijing. The souring atmosphere could put Mr. Schwarzman, who serves as an informal economic adviser to Mr. Trump, in a difficult position. Blackstone sought to emphasize its continuing relationship with C.I.C., pointing to money that it said the Chinese company still had in some of its investment funds. “We greatly value our partnership with C.I.C. and are grateful for their successful, long-term investment in our firm,” a Blackstone spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We continue to expand this important relationship as one of C.I.C.’s major asset managers and look forward to working closely together.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Rex Tillerson and President Trump never really saw eye to eye. During his 405-day tenure as secretary of state, Mr. Tillerson had favored remaining in the Paris climate accord, preserving the Iran nuclear deal, and undertaking negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis. Those positions put him at odds with the president, on whom Mr. Tillerson was considered a restraining influence. On Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson learned from Twitter that he had been replaced by Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, who more closely aligns with the president’s “America First” worldview. • Looking for a pattern in the many staff changes? Don’t, our chief White House correspondent recommends. “I like conflict,” Mr. Trump said. "
"In his tweet announcing her selection for promotion to director of the Central Intelligence Agency, President Trump boasted that Gina Haspel was the “first woman so chosen.” As an Egyptian feminist, I am not celebrating. Ms. Haspel played a direct role in the C.I.A.’s global kidnap, detention and torture operation known as “extraordinary rendition.” Under the program, which was adopted after the 9/11 attacks, suspected militants who were captured in Afghanistan were sent to other countries, which held them in secret detention and allowed C.I.A. personnel to torture them. The first secret prison was in Thailand, where, as an undercover officer in 2002, Ms. Haspel oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects and later helped carry out an order to destroy videotapes that documented the interrogations. In one case, a suspect was tortured so brutally that it was hard to tell he was still alive. Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times in one month and repeatedly slammed into walls, and those weren’t the only harsh methods his interrogators used. Eventually, they concluded he knew nothing useful to tell them. At least 54 countries supported the rendition program. As an Egyptian, I am shamefully aware that my country’s government was among the most diligent. Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and Syria were among the most common destinations for rendered suspects. Ms. Haspel and others who ran the program could count on Egypt to do the dirty job the C.I.A. required. Annual reports issued by the State Department and human rights organizations have long documented the systematic use of torture by successive Egyptian governments. "
"LOS ANGELES — President Trump woke up here in the land of earthquakes on Wednesday morning, but he was 2,500 miles away from the tremor that was really shaking his party. While the president hobnobbed on Tuesday night with wealthy donors in the exclusive enclave of Beverly Park, the voters in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh were in revolt, giving the Democratic candidate a narrow victory in a special election in Pennsylvania that was taking on outsize proportions. Just as they did outside Birmingham and Montgomery, Ala., in December, and Richmond, Va., and Washington in November, energized and angry suburban voters were swamping the Trump stalwarts in the more rural parts of those regions, sending a clear message to Republicans around the country. While Republican turnout in a district that Mr. Trump won in 2016 by 20 percentage points was healthy, Democrats showed again that they could tap unions and other traditionally friendly groups to get their voters out in droves. The N.A.A.C.P. helped win Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s former Alabama Senate seat for Doug Jones in December. Organized labor, once seen as fractured and feckless in the Trump era, gave the Democrat Conor Lamb his edge in Pennsylvania. Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate who wrapped himself in Mr. Trump’s cloak and drew the president to his district last weekend in a bid to rescue a faltering campaign, trailed Mr. Lamb, a former Marine seeking to show his party can compete even in red territory. Mr. Lamb held an apparently insurmountable lead of 641 votes on Wednesday, with about only 500 absentee, provisional and military ballots remaining to be counted, according to county election officials.

"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Rex Tillerson’s relationship with President Trump was rocky from the start. But it was still a huge surprise when Mr. Tillerson was fired as secretary of state on Tuesday. Mr. Tillerson was the most persistent advocate of opening diplomatic channels with North Korea — a position that put him publicly at odds with his boss. As Mr. Trump prepares to meet Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, we talk with the man who came closest to a deal with Pyongyang about what the current administration can learn from previous attempts. On today’s episode: • Mark Landler, a White House correspondent at The New York Times. • William Perry, a former secretary of defense and one of the few senior U.S. officials to have negotiated directly with the North Koreans. (We last spoke with Mr. Perry in August. Listen to that interview here.) Background reading: • Mr. Tillerson’s dismissal pulls the White House even closer to the nationalist ideas that animated Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. • Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director who is Mr. Trump’s choice for secretary of state, opposes the nuclear deal with Iran and doubts North Korea will give up its nuclear arsenal through negotiations.

"A month ago, hundreds of teenagers ran for their lives from the hallways and classrooms of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and staff had been shot to death. On Wednesday, driven by the conviction that they should never have to run from guns again, they walked. So did their peers. In New York City, in Chicago, in Atlanta and Santa Monica; at Columbine High School and in Newtown, Conn.; and in many more cities and towns, students left school by the hundreds and the thousands at 10 a.m., sometimes in defiance of school authorities, who seemed divided and even flummoxed about how to handle their emptying classrooms. The first major coordinated action of the student-led movement for gun control marshaled the same elements that had defined it ever since the Parkland shooting: eloquent young voices, equipped with symbolism and social media savvy, riding a resolve as yet untouched by cynicism. “We have grown up watching more tragedies occur and continuously asking: Why?” said Kaylee Tyner, a 16-year-old junior at Columbine High School outside Denver, where 13 people were killed in 1999, inaugurating, in the public consciousness, the era of school shootings. “Why does this keep happening?” Even after a year of near continuous protesting — for women, for the environment, for immigrants and more — the emergence of people not even old enough to drive as a political force has been particularly arresting, unsettling a gun control debate that had seemed impervious to other factors.

"Broadcom officially withdrew a $117 billion takeover bid for its rival chip maker Qualcomm on Wednesday, two days after President Trump issued an extraordinary order to block the acquisition effort on national security grounds. In a statement, Broadcom said that it would comply with Mr. Trump’s order, formally abandoning what would have been the biggest takeover in the history of the technology industry. Broadcom has nevertheless said it will continue with plans to move its legal headquarters from Singapore to the United States. “Broadcom’s board of directors and management team sincerely appreciate the significant support we received from the Qualcomm and Broadcom stockholders throughout this process,” Broadcom said. Mr. Trump issued his order after a government panel tasked with reviewing the national security implications for business deals disclosed serious concerns about the bid. The panel’s finding was in keeping with the misgivings within the White House about China’s gaining access to important technologies like the nascent wireless standard known as 5G. The move by Mr. Trump was a rare intervention by a president, but under his administration, multiple deals have been quashed after a review by the panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, popularly known as Cfius. Those prospective deals have included the sale of Moneygram to a unit of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and an agreement involving Lattice Semiconductor and an investment firm with reported ties to the Chinese government. Mr. Trump acted despite efforts by Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, to win over the White House, even before the hostile takeover bid was announced. "
"Facebook said Wednesday that it had taken down several pages associated with “Britain First,” a far-right group whose leaders were recently convicted of hate crimes and whose inflammatory anti-Muslim videos President Trump shared with the world late last year. The social network said that the pages of Britain First and its leaders, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, had repeatedly violated community standards with posts that boasted of Islamophobia, incited hateful anti-Muslim comments and compared Muslim immigrants to animals. After the administrators of the pages failed to heed a final warning to abide by Facebook’s standards, the company took the fringe group’s pages down. “We do not do this lightly, but they have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the Pages from our service,” Facebook said. The Britain First Facebook page had about two million followers around the world. Facebook said that while it remains an open platform for all ideas and political speech, a wide range of views can and should be expressed “without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are.” Britain First, a Christian nationalist group estimated to have about 1,000 members, has used inflammatory tactics like confronting Muslims on the street and entering mosques to spread its belief that Islam is destroying Britain. In November, it got an unexpected boost from President Trump, who helped to promote its message by sharing with his tens of millions of Twitter followers three videos Ms. Fransen, the deputy leader, had posted on her own account. One video was titled “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” but featured an assailant who was not, in fact, a “Muslim migrant.” The other two, titled “Muslim destroys a statue of Virgin Mary!” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” were several years old and included no context. Before Mr. Trump retweeted those videos, no modern American president had amplified inflammatory content of that nature from an extremist organization. Mr. Golding, Britain First’s leader, and Ms. Fransen were both convicted last week on counts of religiously aggravated harassment stemming from videos they posted online. Mr. Golding was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison while Ms. Fransen was sentenced to 36 weeks. The videos, from May, showed Ms. Fransen knocking on doors that she believed — incorrectly, according to prosecutors — were hiding the Muslim defendants in a rape trial. She insulted the men and challenged them to come out. Facebook and other social networks have come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid rising concern about the proliferation of hate speech and conspiracy theories online. "
"LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats on Wednesday over the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil, raising tensions between the two countries to a level not seen since the heights of the Cold War. She vowed to crack down on Russian spies, corrupt elites and ill-gotten wealth in Britain. Her statement to Parliament came after Moscow rejected a British deadline for Russia to explain itself over this month’s attack on the former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter. The two countries have engaged in a worsening clash in recent days, with Britain widening an investigation into the incident and courting friends and allies to increase pressure on Russia, while Moscow has threatened to retaliate over any punitive action. The strident remarks from the British prime minister were a marked departure from the norm for a leader who has faced a litany of domestic and international issues. Mrs. May’s government is consumed with Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, a complex negotiation that it appears to be struggling with. And its closest international ally, the United States, is led by a president who has appeared reluctant to openly criticize Russia. “This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,” Mrs. May said in an address to the House of Commons. “It must therefore be met with a full and robust response.” "
"ST. LOUIS — Britain’s tough response in holding Russia responsible for a poisoning attack on its soil increased the pressure on President Trump to join with a NATO ally in taking action, even as he has been reluctant to retaliate for Moscow’s intervention in the 2016 election in the United States. Mr. Trump, who was visiting Missouri on Wednesday, has not personally addressed the attack since London assigned blame to Russia and left it instead to aides to express public solidarity with Prime Minister Theresa May after she expelled 23 Russian diplomats, canceled high-level contacts and vowed to impose more sanctions. “This latest action by Russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes,” the White House said in a written statement. “The United States is working together with our allies and partners to ensure that this kind of abhorrent attack does not happen again.” But for whatever reason, Mr. Trump avoided saying so personally in public, much as he has generally avoided condemning Russia for its election meddling. He has allowed top advisers to denounce Moscow for its interference in American democracy, but when it comes to his own Twitter posts or comments, he has largely stuck to equivocal language, seemingly reluctant to accept the consensus conclusion of his intelligence agencies and intent on voicing no outrage or criticism of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, for whom he has expressed admiration. Instead, through early evening, Mr. Trump used his Twitter feed to focus on issues like trade, infrastructure, school safety and his complaints that Senate Democrats are obstructing confirmation of his nominees. His only public comments during the day came at a Boeing plant where he talked about tax cuts. Critics of both parties pressed the president to speak out personally and possibly take action to back up Mrs. May. "
"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reviewing a recommendation to fire the former F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew G. McCabe, just days before he is scheduled to retire on Sunday, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. McCabe was a frequent target of attack from President Trump, who taunted him both publicly and privately. Mr. McCabe is ensnared in an internal review that includes an examination of his decision in 2016 to allow F.B.I. officials to speak with reporters about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The Justice Department’s inspector general concluded that Mr. McCabe was not forthcoming during the review, according to the people briefed on the matter. That yet-to-be-released report triggered an F.B.I. disciplinary process that recommended his termination — leaving Mr. Sessions to either accept or reverse that decision. Lack of candor is a fireable offense, but like so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe’s fate is also entangled in presidential politics and the special counsel investigation. He was involved from the beginning in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. He is also a potential witness in the inquiry into whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump’s supporters have tried to cast Mr. McCabe as part of a “deep state” that operates in secret to undermine the administration. Mr. Trump has goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against him. Now, Mr. Sessions is the final arbiter of Mr. McCabe’s dismissal, shortly before his retirement takes effect Sunday. Though no decision has been made, people inside the Justice Department expect him to be fired before Friday, a decision that would jeopardize his pension as a 21-year F.B.I. veteran. "
"The special election in southwest Pennsylvania garnered national attention for what it could portend for the midterm elections in November. Democratic enthusiasm in the heart of Trump country may have signaled a brewing blue wave in November. But on Wednesday morning, the winner of the House’s 18th district in Pennsylvania was not officially decided. Here’s a look at what’s next for the candidates and the district that President Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. As of Wednesday morning, one small Republican-leaning county was still counting more than 1,000 absentee ballots. Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate, had already claimed victory over Republican Rick Saccone. And House Republicans were talking about a recount and a legal challenge. Under Pennsylvania’s state election law, this type of race does not require an automatic recount, but voters could request one through two different processes over the next week. A recount, however, is unlikely to change the results, because most ballots in the state are cast electronically, said Neil Makhija, a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school and a former Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania’s state house.

"FROM RICK OWENS’S ragged T-shirts and canvas shifts to the giddy ornamentation of Alessandro Michele’s Gucci, all glitz and blitz and reconstituted Elton John costumes, the spring collections appeared to not have a common thread between them — a seemingly bipolar mix of downtrodden, derelict styles and escapist fantasies. Rei Kawakubo’s Boschean excess at Comme des Garçons — clashing Renaissance paintings and Japanese cartoons as prints and reconstituted pileups of tacky plastic children’s toys as headpieces — was a stark contrast to Miuccia Prada’s comic-book-print warrior women and the tatty gewgaws and currency-war patterns of Demna Gvasalia’s Balenciaga collection. There, the idea of luxury was debased and devalued with gaudy dresses, blouses and skintight pant-boot hybrids cut in post-Brexit-inspired euro-note and dollar-bill patterns. So, what is it with fashion at the moment? Designers appear to have assumed a fight-or-flight response to these uncertain times, which, to some — especially those with a flair for the dramatic — look a lot like the end of days. “Fashion is a reflection of the way we live,” said Gvasalia backstage at Balenciaga. “I wanted to create a feeling that something dangerous was going to happen.” He was talking, specifically, about the sturm-und-drang mood at his show, which took place in a blacked-out venue filled with smoke and the boom of ominous trip hop music. The message was less “apocalypse now” and more “apocalypse soon.” Art, literature and film frequently tackle themes of end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it destruction — in 2017 alone, there was the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which felt eerily prophetic; Kara Walker’s towering Goya-esque murals shown at New York’s Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in September, which depicted the unfolding of a modern, racially charged civil war; the artist Jonathan Horowitz’s doctored photo of President Trump playing golf while the sky above him burned; and, even, a sequel to that earlier neon-fizzed end-times nightmare, “Blade Runner.” But apocalyptic naysaying is less frequently found in fashion, an industry that trades on optimism, fantasy and, most importantly, an ability to predict the future. But in moments of great distress, even clothing tends to reflect our troubles. Immediately prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a surfeit of Austrian and Bavarian influences in the industry; in the late ’80s, Black Monday gave way to the rise of a movement dubbed “deconstruction” that originated with the Belgian designer Martin Margiela, whose leitmotif was the unfinished hem and the inside-out seam. His clothes were purposefully made to look poor — because the world suddenly was. It was a volte-face to the excess of the early ’80s, the dancing-on-the-lip-of-the-volcano styles of Christian Lacroix and his archaic indulgences of crinoline pouf skirts and Second Empire extremes. YET THIS SPRING’S fashions, more than in any era in living memory, seem inextricably linked to the times in which we live. They are hysterical, scatterbrained and lunging toward extreme opposites (glittery at Gucci, wasteland-era at Rick Owens) just as global political parties have become more polarized themselves. The collections telegraph post-national, post-history and post-internet ideas — all of which bear individual examination. The post-national is, perhaps, the easiest to connect to culture’s current fixations: Eschewing borders as various governments seek to enforce them, fashion is, in a sense, evoking an aesthetic idyll, a leftist liberal dream in step with most fashion designers’ sensibilities. The post-nationalism of fashion has emerged perhaps in response to the rise of the right wing — not only across America, but in much of Europe, too, where the notion of patriotism has been used as a Trojan Horse for prejudice and white supremacy.

"To the Editor: Re “House G.O.P. Closes Inquiry Into Collusion” (front page, March 13): Once again, Republicans have placed party above country and principle. When all the intelligence agencies conclude with “high confidence” that Russia and Vladimir Putin put their fingers on the scale against Hillary Clinton and in favor of Donald Trump in the 2016 election, when the special counsel, Robert Mueller, indicts 13 Russians for having done exactly that, and then the House Intelligence Committee Republicans release a premature report rejecting this conclusion without consulting Democratic committee members, whom do we believe? This is a no-brainer! House Republicans behaved in a partisan manner and therefore have little credibility. With the same raw intelligence data as the F.B.I., the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. and without interviewing all informed parties and gathering all relevant data, the Republicans chose to rally behind their president. They are failing to act as a bipartisan intelligence committee and providing cover for Mr. Trump when Mr. Mueller’s findings are eventually released. Shame on them and shame on all of us if we allow this to continue! RICHARD CHERWITZ, AUSTIN, TEX. "
"CNN is turning to one of its morning anchors to shore up prime time. Chris Cuomo, the outspoken co-host of “New Day,” who has gained prominence — and received some right-wing blowback — for his coverage of the Trump administration, is set to take over the network’s 9 p.m. slot on weeknights starting in the spring, CNN said on Wednesday. The move would catapult Mr. Cuomo, 47 — a son of Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor, and the brother of Andrew Cuomo, the current governor — into the highest echelon of cable news, pitting him directly against Rachel Maddow of MSNBC and Sean Hannity of Fox News. CNN has struggled recently in prime time, falling to third place behind Fox News and MSNBC, as viewers are increasingly drawn to partisan commentary. Anderson Cooper, who hosts the network’s coverage between 8 and 10 p.m., attracted about a third of Mr. Hannity’s audience last month, for instance. Shifting Mr. Cuomo to weeknights would reduce Mr. Cooper’s prime-time footprint from two hours to one. John Berman, a veteran television anchor and correspondent, is set to replace Mr. Cuomo on “New Day,” where he will lead the network’s morning coverage with the current co-anchor, Alisyn Camerota. CNN remains a lightning rod for President Trump, the target of “fake news” chants at rallies and the president’s own vicious tweets. Its prime-time coverage is focused on analysis by experts and political veterans — a contrast to the deeply partisan monologues by the likes of Ms. Maddow and Mr. Hannity, both of whom regularly draw more than three million viewers a night.

"Happy are the people of the Nordic nations — happier, in fact, than anyone else in the world. And the overall happiness of a country is almost identical to the happiness of its immigrants. Those are the main conclusions of the World Happiness Report 2018, released Wednesday. Finland is the happiest country in the world, it found, followed by Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Australia. Though in a different order, this is the same top 10 as last year, when Norway was No. 1 and Finland was fifth. Burundi and Central African Republic, both consumed by political violence, are the least happy countries for the second year in a row. This year, Central African Republic is slightly happier than Burundi; last year, their order was reversed. As for the United States, it is 18th out of 156 countries surveyed — down four spots from last year’s report and five from 2016’s, and substantially below most comparably wealthy nations. Though the economy is generally strong and per capita income is high, it ranks poorly on social measures: Life expectancy has declined, suicide rates have risen, the opioid crisis has worsened, inequality has grown and confidence in government has fallen. “I think there really is a deep and very unsettling signal coming through that U.S. society is in many ways under profound stress, even though the economy by traditional measures is doing fine,” Jeffrey D. Sachs, an editor of the report, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The trends are not good, and the comparative position of the U.S. relative to other high-income countries is nothing short of alarming.” The report was produced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and edited by three economists: Dr. Sachs, the network’s director and a professor at Columbia University; John F. Helliwell, a senior fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia; and Richard Layard, a director of the Well-Being Program at the London School of Economics’ Center for Economic Performance. It is based on Gallup surveys conducted from 2015 to 2017, in which thousands of respondents were asked to imagine a ladder with steps numbered 0 to 10 and to say which step they felt they stood on, a ranking known as the Cantril Scale.

"SAN DIEGO — Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) With Mexico off in the distance, speaker after speaker stepped to the podium Tuesday, each offering their vision of California values. There was a congressman, pastors, a rabbi, a representative of the Muslim community, a union organizer. “This wall is a symbol of hate,” said Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district represents part of San Diego. The Rev. Jose Castillo, pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Catholic Church, told the audience to “keep praying for this country that we all love.” A bit farther to the east was President Trump, who swept into enemy territory Tuesday for the first time as president. He inspected prototypes for his promised border wall, spoke to Marines near San Diego and then flew up to Los Angeles for an expensive fund-raiser in Beverly Park. With the president in town, and rain, Los Angeles traffic ground to a standstill. The visit had been highly anticipated: No president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had ever taken so long to visit California after winning the presidency, and some worried about mass street protests, or clashes between supporters and opponents. But the Trump followers and his opponents stayed far enough away, and instead of wide-scale protests, there were several modest gatherings, many centered on the wall and Mexico and immigration issues. Trumpism has come to stand for many things — a tough immigration policy, a chaotic culture inside the White House, freewheeling foreign policy. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Conor Lamb, a Democrat, appears to have pulled off a shocking upset in a Pennsylvania congressional election last night. The race is still too close to call. But Lamb has a 641-vote lead over the Republican, Rick Saccone, and the remaining uncounted ballots are absentee ballots, which tend to lean Democratic. It will be a remarkable win if Lamb holds on. Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012 both won this district, in the Pittsburgh area, by almost 20 percentage points. Last night’s result is a sign that, while Trump may be holding onto his base, most voters are unhappy with his presidency. Republicans are looking at a very difficult midterm election. One other point: There’s an ongoing debate, which I’ve covered before, about whether Democrats should focus this year on turning out their base or persuading swing voters. Lamb’s probable win helps answer the question: Both. Democrats appear to have turned out at a much higher rate than Republicans last night, as G. Elliott Morris notes (with handy charts). But Lamb — a populist who is moderate on cultural issues — also clearly won over a bunch of Trump voters, given the district’s conservatism. The 2018 midterm elections are a vital chance to check Trump’s power. They are, as David Remnick wrote this week, a “stress test of liberal democracy.” Given their importance, Democrats shouldn’t get caught up in either-or debates about turnout and persuasion. Rexit. Serve President Trump at your own risk. Just think about how badly Rex Tillerson damaged his reputation over the last 18 months. He went from being the longtime chief executive of one of the world’s biggest companies to suffering Trump’s repeated public humiliations. They culminated in yesterday’s firing by tweet. Elsewhere: In the end, the leader Tillerson failed to understand was not any foreign head of state but his own boss, argues Politico’s Susan Glasser. Many liberals are celebrating Tillerson’s firing as the end of the tenure of the nation’s worst secretary of state. But as The New Republic’s Jeet Heer and The Times’s editorial board each write, Tillerson’s replacement, Mike Pompeo, could make Tillerson’s sins look small by comparison. In The New Yorker, Dexter Filkins looked at Gina Haspel, Trump’s new choice to run the C.I.A., and her background overseeing illegal torture. Also in The Times, Samantha Power and Paul Pillar offer their perspectives on Pompeo. "

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, with fraud for raising money from investors on the back of false claims about the company’s blood-testing technology. One of Theranos’s main products, called a miniLab, could not perform all the tests the company said it could, the commission asserted. That, according to the complaint, didn’t stop Theranos from claiming that it had a bright future ahead. Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors’ eyes. It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company. Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies. Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense. Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small. The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary. Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results. — Peter Eavis There is an old adage that if it sounds too good to be true, it isn’t. The case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes describes a litany of falsehoods about a claimed revolutionary method to conduct blood tests that turned out to be pure fiction.

"At a refueling stop in Cape Verde on his way home from an exhausting visit across Africa, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson walked through howling winds late Monday night toward the airport’s V.I.P. terminal, where he pulled up a chair and started telling jokes to the reporters who had traveled with him.   He was fired by executive tweet just hours later. By the time Mr. Tillerson again spoke to reporters, on Tuesday afternoon in Washington, the man who had strode confidently and relaxed throughout the weeklong diplomatic trip was replaced by a humbled and emotional one who nearly choked up as he announced that he would be handing off his powers at the stroke of midnight. Some senior administration officials said Mr. Tillerson — who in nearly 14 months at the State Department had departed from President Trump’s policies on the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal and diplomacy with North Korea — should have seen it coming. Officials said John F. Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, urged Mr. Tillerson late last week to cut short his trip, warning vaguely that he should be on the lookout for an unspecified Twitter post. But State Department officials insisted that had Mr. Kelly intended to relay an ominous message, Mr. Tillerson did not receive it. That Mr. Tillerson missed such an important signal coming from the White House was emblematic of a tenure punctuated by inopportune comments, bureaucratic inertia and frequent and public disagreements with Mr.  Trump.

"White supremacists are increasingly hanging banners in public places, such as from highway overpasses and rooftops, to promote their views, according to a report released on Thursday by the Anti-Defamation League. “While white supremacists have been using banners for some time, the number of banners deployed in the past 10 months marks an unprecedented trend,” the report said. The tactic, it added, is significant because it “can garner widespread attention with very little actual effort involved.” From May 20, 2017, through this Monday, the A.D.L.’s Center on Extremism found, there were 72 such episodes. Before that period, the A.D.L. had not documented any white supremacist banners since Dec. 11, 2016, said Jake Hyman, a spokesman for the group. Most of those documented in Thursday’s report were racist or anti-immigrant in nature, with messages ranging from “America first: End immigration” to “‘Diversity’ is a code word for white genocide.” Others were anti-Muslim (a banner displayed on an overpass near Dearborn, Mich., home to one of the largest mosques in North America, read “DANGER: Sharia city ahead”), anti-Semitic (“UNjew HUMANITY”) or misogynistic (“Feminists deserve the rope”). More than 70 percent were hung by organizations associated with the so-called alt-right, according to the report. One group alone, Identity Evropa, was responsible for around 40 percent: 28 banners in 13 states. Altogether, banners were documented in 21 states. "
"The serene snip, snip, snip of scissors is the only sound that breaks the genteel silence at Paul Molé Barber Shop, which, at 105 years old, claims to be the city’s oldest destination for a shave and a haircut. The second-story business, a fixture on Lexington Avenue between 73rd and 74th Streets since it opened in 1913, has catered to generations of men. “And some ladies, too,” said Adrian Wood, the owner, a silver-haired Englishman and barber who wears dress shirts monogrammed at the cuffs. At Paul Molé (it rhymes with olé!), a “gentleman’s haircut” costs $38 and a “deluxe open-razor shave,” $39. Telltale signs of the shop’s vintage Americana aesthetic include an antique barber’s pole that rotates the classic red, white and blue stripes in the corner window, an 1890s carousel horse that is stabled in the children’s section and a collection of shaving mugs inscribed with customer names.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals on Thursday in retaliation for interference in the 2016 presidential election and other “malicious cyberattacks,” its most significant action against Moscow since President Trump took office. The sanctions came as the United States joined with Britain, France and Germany in denouncing Russia for its apparent role in a nerve-gas attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil, calling it a “clear violation” of international law. But the joint statement said nothing about any collective action in response. In his first comment on the poison attack, Mr. Trump agreed that, despite its denials, Russia was likely behind it. “It looks like it,” he told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. “We are in deep discussions,” Mr. Trump continued. “A very sad situation. It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen. And we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.” In keeping with his reluctance to blame Moscow for meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump did not mention the sanctions or election interference. The president has repeatedly dismissed the suggestion that Russia sought to influence the vote in his favor as a “hoax” and “fake news,” even as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has concluded otherwise and is investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russian agents. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, seized a pair of diplomatic properties and imposed sanctions in response to the election interference. But while Mr. Trump’s administration has issued sanctions against some Russians for human rights abuses or for the country’s intervention in Ukraine, the measures announced on Thursday represented the first time he took action on the meddling, and only after Congress passed legislation to force his hand.

"John Skipper, the former ESPN president, revealed on Thursday that he had a cocaine addiction and that an attempted extortion plot by somebody he bought drugs from caused his abrupt resignation in December. “They threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. Mr. Skipper said he spoke with Robert A. Iger, the chairman and chief executive of Disney, ESPN’s parent company, and the two agreed he had put the company in an “untenable” position and had to resign. He added in the interview that he had never used heroin or opioids. ESPN declined to comment on its former president’s interview. Disney didn’t respond to a request for comment, and Mr. Skipper didn’t respond to a message left at his home. Mr. Skipper admitted that his cocaine use had caused “a missed plane and a few canceled morning appointments,” but said that it otherwise never affected his professional work. “I judge that I did a very good job and that it did not get in the way of my work,” he said. “I worked hard, I worked smart. I worked all the time.” He did not say how long he had been using cocaine, or whether he reported the extortion plot to law enforcement. In December, at the time of his resignation, Mr. Skipper said he was entering rehabilitation. The police departments in Bristol, Conn., and Wilton, Conn., the Connecticut State Police and the New York City Police Department all said then that there were no records of any incidents involving Mr. Skipper.

"President Trump has a new chief economic adviser. Larry Kudlow, the CNBC commentator who served in President Ronald Reagan’s Office of Management and Budget, will become the director of the National Economic Council, a position being vacated by Gary D. Cohn, who said he would resign after losing an internal battle over the president’s plan to impose tariffs on foreign metals. Mr. Kudlow, often on-air and with a flair for provocative punditry, has prognosticated on many economic and political issues in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark.  The following is a look back at some of his economic predictions that did not bear out. Analysis: Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, the housing bubble popped, home prices were in a free-fall and the mortgage-backed securities that banks had loaded up on were threatening to plunge those firms — and the economy — into the abyss. Home prices in 20 metropolitan areas across the country dropped at a record rate of 18 percent in October 2008 from a year earlier as the fallout from the financial collapse reverberated through the housing market. The housing market has still not recovered completely or evenly and prices in many cities are still below their pre-recession peak. Analysis: The Obama administration’s plan to help homeowners included a litany of programs, including reducing the debt that distressed borrowers owed. The success of these programs was mixed but recent studies show that they did, in fact, help millions of people stay in their homes. "
"Paul Krugman took questions from readers about trade after President Trump’s announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Here are his answers to some of the hundreds of questions he received. — By the Editors 1. Literally every small consumer item I buy is made in China. Please explain how this came to be (and whether you think we can or should take steps to change it). 2. Should all manufacturing jobs flow to the lowest-cost, lowest-wage environments, regardless of working conditions or environmental impacts? If not, how can a free-trade system prevent this? 3. The government of China is subsidizing the growth of its electric car industry by providing very significant subsidies (about one-third of cost) to consumers. This subsidy will allow the industry to scale up much more quickly and produce electric cars cheaper than anyone else. In a free-trade world, is this good planning, or cheating? — Nick Van Kleeck, Tucson, Ariz. Paul Krugman: 1. It’s partly a sort of optical illusion. China dominates assembly of many goods thanks to a combination of still-low wages and an extensive industrial “ecology” of supporting firms. But much of the value of the good actually comes from elsewhere. For example, iPhones are “made” in China, but China only accounts for less than 4 percent of their price. 2. Not entirely — there’s some room for insisting on basic working conditions and environmental rules. But not too much. Consider Bangladesh: all it really has is a large labor force, with fairly low productivity. Low wages are the only way they can sell on world markets. If we insist that they follow first-world rules, we’re basically telling them to go starve. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince has compared the supreme leader of Iran to Adolf Hitler, and said that his country would acquire a nuclear bomb “as soon as possible” if Iran developed nuclear weapons. The comments by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ratcheted up the rhetoric in the increasingly volatile rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has fueled sectarianism and war across the Middle East. His statements were in an excerpt, released on Thursday, of a prerecorded interview with “60 Minutes,” the CBS News program. Iran’s Foreign Ministry responded by calling the prince a delusional and devious novice who “has no idea of politics.” Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, blames Iran for funding militias to undermine Arab states, while Shiite Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of backing Sunni extremist groups. Their struggle for regional dominance has put the two nations on opposite sides of conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq that have killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Prince Mohammed, who jailed hundreds of the kingdom’s most potent figures while swiftly consolidating his own power, is scheduled to arrive in the United States on Monday for an extended trip. His plans include meeting with President Trump in the White House and with business, entertainment and technology leaders in a number of American cities. One of his primary goals is to persuade Americans to invest in his reform plans, which aim to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, increase the kingdom’s military self-sufficiency and raise its citizens’ quality of life.

"For many people, it’s up to Robert Mueller, the special counsel, to settle the question of “collusion” in the 2016 election. A clean, clear, nonpartisan legal finding would be the most acceptable possible outcome. If he uncovers a crime by the president, Congress would be justified in pursuing an impeachment inquiry. So it should not matter that the House Intelligence Committee has abruptly ended its “investigation,” declining to compel testimony from key uncooperative witnesses or subpoena relevant records. In the words of one commentator, we need only “wait for Mueller.” But this view is wrong, a confusion of constitutional roles and responsibilities. Mr. Mueller has one job, and Congress has another. The potential offense that each is investigating might go by the same shorthand — “collusion” — but it is not the same. What counts as evidence, and how it is weighed and debated, is by necessity different in the two proceedings. Confusion over this point has major practical consequences for how long the nation must await a full and clear resolution of the question of Russian interference in the election, and any role Mr. Trump and his campaign played in it. The problem seems to start with anxiety about impeachment as too “political” a process — especially in a hyperpartisan environment. That it is political in character is undeniable, but the founders thought of the politics of impeachment as being of the highest order, concerned with the protection of the constitutional system from serious executive misconduct. As James Madison told the Congress, a powerful presidency carried with it a high danger of abuse of office, and the remedy of impeachment was available “at all times.” Legal and constitutional concerns require clarity about the nature and relevant evidence of misconduct. On the legal side, Mr. Mueller may be headed toward a theory of collusion, potentially implicating the president and others, in the form of a “conspiracy to defraud the United States.” "

"More than any president in living memory, Donald Trump has conducted a dogged, remorseless assault on the press. He portrays the news media not only as a dedicated adversary of his administration but of the entire body politic. These attacks have forced the media where it does not want to be, at the center of the political debate. Trump’s purpose is clear. He seeks to weaken an institution that serves to constrain the abusive exercise of executive authority. He has initiated a gladiatorial contest pitting the principle of freedom of the press against a principle of his own invention: freedom from the press. Trump has his media favorites, Fox News and other organizations that serve as approved public relations outlets, versus the “fake news,” meaning virtually everything else. Politicians have frequently questioned the neutrality and objectivity of specific journalists, their stories and their publications, but Trump has raised the stakes to a new level. He has described news organizations as “the enemy of the American people.” He has routinely called reporters “scum,” “slime,” “dishonest” and “disgusting.” In November, Trump proposed a contest to determine which network — Fox excluded — “is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!” The news media “have been incorporated into the political style of the governing party as fixed hate objects,” Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., wrote in an email to me.

"For once, let’s give Donald Trump his due. In throwing Rex Tillerson out on his ear, he has treated his secretary of state exactly the way the secretary treated those under him. Poetic justice has been served. And, in the nomination of C.I.A. Director Mike Pompeo to succeed Tillerson, so will the interests of American diplomacy. I’ll get to Pompeo below, but dwell for a moment on the awfulness of Tillerson. He came to office with no discernible worldview other than the jaded transactionalism he acquired as ExxonMobil’s C.E.O. He leaves office with no discernible accomplishment except a broken department and a traumatized staff. Six of the 10 top positions at State are vacant; even now the United States does not have an ambassador to South Korea, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, South Africa or the European Union, among other posts. To his credit, he did seem to figure out that Vladimir Putin is a bad guy. But that’s progress only because he was previously the Russian despot’s premier apologist. His director of policy planning had to write a memo explaining why human rights are a vital tool of American diplomacy. And he opposed the president’s two best foreign policy decisions: moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and decertifying the Iran deal. Some secretaries of state — Colin Powell, for instance — alienate their bosses by siding with the bureaucracy. Others, like Henry Kissinger, do the opposite. Tillerson is the rare bird who managed to do both. Goodbye, Rex. You won’t be missed. Pompeo is the anti-Tillerson. He doesn’t need to learn the Washington ropes. He’s been a competent leader of the C.I.A. He has the confidence of the president, meaning that, unlike Tillerson, he will have credibility with foreign governments. Just as importantly, he’s been willing to contradict the president, meaning he’ll be able to act as a check on him, too. "

"We recently traveled to the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as legal observers for a case against a detainee accused of being a leader of Al Qaeda. The military commissions complex known as Camp Justice — an assortment of white trailers and beige tents on an abandoned air strip — was established by the George W. Bush administration in 2001 to “swiftly” try terrorism suspects in the wake of Sept. 11. But over a decade has passed, the tents are still there, and so are 41 detainees. It is the traveling circus that never leaves town. At one point Guantánamo ignited passions across the political spectrum. Today the bipartisan consensus is apathy. And that apathy allows for enduring injustice in the form of indefinite detention, tainted procedure and dysfunctional bureaucracy. Only one journalist, Carol Rosenberg of The Miami Herald, continues to report regularly from Guantánamo. During two weeks of hearings in late January and early February, we found the court’s viewing gallery nearly empty. We watched the proceedings from behind a glass barrier with audio transmitted on a 40-second delay meant to intercept accidental disclosure of classified information. One day we toured the Gitmo gift shop — right next to the McDonald’s — where you can buy all variety of memorabilia emblazoned with “Guantánamo Bay” and images of iguanas and surfboards. A memorable shot glass bore the line “The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves.” The sleepy seaside setting obscures the reality that Guantánamo is in a state of quiet tumult, with alarming developments occurring largely outside the spotlight. President Trump announced in his State of the Union address, which we watched in an airless tent in Camp Justice, that he had signed an executive order to keep Guantánamo open. Then last month his administration indicated that it is receptive to sending more captives there, including members of the Islamic State. They would be the first new arrivals in a decade, extending the life of an institution that has disappointed on every front. "

On my morning commute yesterday, one of these throngs entered my subway car, but this time I didn’t mind at all. The teenagers — a mix of black, white, Latino and Asian — were in a buoyant mood.

"OTTAWA — First were the tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Then came a trade action over a Canadian jetliner, and duties on newsprint. Most recently the United States and Canada battled over potentially crippling duties on steel and aluminum that President Trump introduced last week. And all along the two countries have been fighting over renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now comes the latest slight to Canada from its closest ally and nearest neighbor: a report by The Washington Post on Thursday that Mr. Trump boasted at a private fund-raising event that he made up an assertion that the United States had a trade deficit with Canada during a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trade with the United States is a critical part of Canada’s export-dependent economy, and the actions and statements from the Trump administration concerning the two countries’ economic relationship have provoked equal parts anxiety, puzzlement and anger within Canada. The president’s reported comments dominated the news in Canada on Thursday morning and were greeted with bafflement by some Canadians. “I thought it was a dumb comment but I wasn’t surprised,” said Mark Warner, an international trade lawyer in Toronto. “If it came from any other world leader it would be troubling. But pretty obviously he’s not a details guy and he’s kind of got a negotiating strategy of being in the moment.” "
"The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will. United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West’s critical facilities in the event of a conflict. They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated. In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants. Still, new computer screenshots released by the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday made clear that Russian state hackers had the foothold they would have needed to manipulate or shut down power plants. “We now have evidence they’re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage,” said Eric Chien, a security technology director at Symantec, a digital security firm.

"Frank Bruni, a Times Op-Ed columnist, hosted an online conversation with two prominent Democrats: Representative Seth Moulton, a second-term congressman from Massachusetts and the founder of the Serve America PAC, which promotes military veterans like Conor Lamb as House candidates; and Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, who was a deputy campaign manager for President Barack Obama’s re-election effort and is a founding partner in Precision Strategies in Washington. They discussed the challenges and opportunities that the 2018 midterms pose for Democrats. Frank Bruni: There’s so much to discuss about Conor Lamb’s triumph. But maybe we should begin here, because I’m hearing ever more chatter since his win about Pelosi, Pelosi, Pelosi. Republicans genuinely believe — with, they say, polling evidence and election returns to back it up — that tethering Democratic candidates to Nancy Pelosi “from San Francisco” is one of their best weapons. Lamb blunted it by declaring loudly and repeatedly that he did not and would not support her as the leader of House Democrats. And you, Seth, voted for Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio over her for Democratic minority leader when you had the chance. Should candidates for the House renounce her? Should she proclaim that she has no interest in being House speaker if Democrats win the majority? Let’s start with you, Jen. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon: One of the things that the Pennsylvania-18 election has shown is that the old playbooks did not work for the G.O.P. in this race. Lamb won because he understood his district, focused on local issues, worked hard on the ground, built relationships that were stronger than attack ads and ultimately proved he wasn’t going to be a rubber stamp. There is no doubt that the G.O.P. will continue to use this playbook, but with Trump on their end and a barrage of daily news that clutters a clean message for them, I think it will be much harder to make that stick than in the past. Bruni: Before we have Seth chime in, I’ve got to press a little harder: What should or shouldn’t candidates in districts somewhat similar to Lamb’s say or not say when it comes to Pelosi? You’re right, he showed his independence with the positions he took. But he also ran an ad making clear his lack of support for her. O’Malley Dillon: I’m hard-pressed to believe that every candidate in similar districts is going to need to run an ad, as Lamb did. In part I think he was in that situation because of the $10 million outside groups were spending against him and the fact that this was a special election, which opened up the airways a bit more than we will see in November.

"HONG KONG — North Korea’s foreign minister flew to Sweden on Thursday, amid speculation that the country could be used as a venue for hammering out details of the planned talks between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, or could be the site of the talks themselves. Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho was seen at Beijing’s international airport on Thursday, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported, following earlier reports that he might go to Sweden. Hours later, the Swedish Foreign Ministry confirmed that Mr. Ri would indeed be visiting the country for talks on Thursday and Friday. Sweden has long played an intermediary role between the United States and North Korea, which do not have diplomatic relations. With the United States lacking an embassy in North Korea, Sweden is the so-called protecting power that provides consular services for Americans, including meeting with citizens who are imprisoned there. Sweden has also been the site of talks between North Korean officials and experts from the United States, South Korea and elsewhere. Other locations that have been mentioned as possible sites for the Trump-Kim talks include the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea; Washington; Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital; Ulan Bator, Mongolia; and Switzerland. Mr. Trump’s decision to accept Mr. Kim’s invitation to meet shocked the diplomatic establishment last week, coming after months of bellicose insults and threats between the two leaders and their governments. Any meeting, should it actually come to fruition, would probably be held by May, said Chung Eui-yong, a South Korean official who conveyed the invitation to the White House. "
"WASHINGTON — Long before Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, Larry Kudlow was selling his future tax plan. Mr. Kudlow spent the years leading up to the 2016 election trying to convince every potential Republican candidate that by slashing corporate tax rates, America’s rate of economic growth could double. His arguments foreshadowed Mr. Trump’s pitch for the tax cuts he would sign as president in late 2017. “The single group that benefits the most from a lower corporate tax is the middle-class wage earner,” Mr. Kudlow said in a February 2015 interview, “and every study shows that.” Several studies dispute that, but they do not deter Mr. Kudlow, whom Mr. Trump picked this week to head the National Economic Council. Mr. Kudlow is not an academic economist. He is a Wall Street economist, a polished television host and, most of all, an evangelist for supply-side economics, which espouses that cutting taxes on businesses and the rich will rain down benefits on everyone else in the country. Mr. Kudlow believes that limiting the federal government will unleash Reagan-level economic growth, and he derides the “highly flawed econometric models” of economists whose forecasts do not share his optimism, including those at the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s economic scorekeeper. His zeal has led him to issue some predictions that beat consensus and others that were wildly wrong, including twice denying the existence of recessions while they were already underway during President George W. Bush’s administration. (“Despite all the doom and gloom from the economic pessimistas,” he wrote in December 2007, right as the worst recession in a generation was beginning, “the resilient U.S. economy continues moving ahead.”) "

"WASHINGTON — If Republicans and President Trump are going down to defeat in November’s midterms, they are evidently going down together. Faced with a mortifying special election loss in what had been a Trump-loving Pennsylvania House district, Republicans on Capitol Hill did not point fingers in the president’s direction. Instead, they blamed their candidate, Rick Saccone, for running a lackluster effort while crediting the president with putting Mr. Saccone within reach of victory by firing up Trump supporters at a rally last weekend. “The president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday as he and his fellow Republicans sought to put the best possible gloss on the latest and most definitive portent yet that their party — not to mention his own speakership — is in severe peril in a very challenging midterm election climate. Statements like those and other recent developments highlight just how reluctant Republicans are to put any daylight between themselves and Mr. Trump despite obvious political danger ahead. History has shown that a president’s popularity is a key factor in determining the extent of a governing party’s losses in midterm elections. Presidents almost always lose congressional seats in midterm contests, but those polling below 50 percent get hit particularly hard. With Mr. Trump’s approval rating now hovering around 40 percent, House Republicans face potential losses deep enough to cost them control of the House, handing Democrats formidable power to challenge the president in the final two years of his term.

"Shortly after the inauguration of Donald Trump, at a particularly turbulent and divisive moment in American politics, The New York Times launched “The Daily.” The free, roughly 20-minute podcast posts every weekday at 6 a.m. Eastern, and provides in-depth analysis of key news events in a compelling, distinctive format. Hosted by the former New York Times political reporter Michael Barbaro, the show arms listeners with clarity and context for confronting the often-chaotic onslaught of news we’re bombarded with every day, and has been downloaded millions of times by listeners across the country. The show features engaging interviews with journalists from The Times on the front lines of major developments. These reporters are uniquely qualified to objectively explain the multifaceted nature of the stories they cover, and to guide listeners through the complex historical context crucial to understanding how we got here in the first place. As Mr. Barbaro says in a Times Insider piece about the origins of the podcast, “The whole point of the show was to disentangle and to explain this extraordinarily consequential and incredibly difficult-to-understand moment in our history.” Teaching with ”The Daily” can be a great way to bring Times reporters and the stories they cover into your classroom. The show offers a regular source of boiled-down news analysis and powerful storytelling, addressing a broad swath of national and international issues that can provoke student discussion and further investigation into the complex nuances of an issue and the history that shaped it. Keep in mind that most students are probably not accustomed to listening to long chunks of spoken word audio without any visual aids, and it may initially be challenging to capture their attention as easily as a video might. You can help prepare them for the experience by having them first read and discuss one of The Times articles related to the podcast episode, which you can find linked from each episode. It may also sometimes make more sense to just play samples of an episode rather than all 20 minutes of it. Or, consult our lesson plan Active Listening: Using Times Videos, Podcasts and Articles to Practice a Key Skill for even more ideas. Below, we explore two shows in depth, suggest five ways you can teach with any episode, and list seven more episodes we especially recommend for classrooms. "
"MIAMI — For the latest on the bridge collapse in Miami, read Friday’s live updates. The graceful pedestrian bridge was swung into place on Saturday. Heralded as a triumph of “accelerated construction,” the walkway would allow pedestrians to safely cross eight lanes of traffic separating the campus of Florida International University from the small city where many of the students lived. Five days later, around midday Thursday, the walkway collapsed in a pile of 950 tons of metal, concrete and dust, before ever opening to pedestrians. At least six people were killed, according to the Miami-Dade County police. Some reports put the number of dead a high as 10. Cars were caught under the bridge when a stoplight turned red at a nearby intersection. Eight of them could be seen poking out from the rubble, in a scene that resembled the aftermath of an earthquake. “I heard what sounded to me like a sonic boom from an aircraft which shook the ground below,” said Kurt Baker, a student at the university who had just exited the Florida Turnpike. “There was a large plume of smoke,” said Sgt. Adrian Mesa of the Sweetwater Police Department. “And then you could see the south end of the bridge was tilted over.” Drivers leapt from their cars to help pull people free, but quickly realized they could save only the people in cars that were partially crushed, said Lynell R. Collins, who had been about to turn onto the street in his pickup. The others were gone. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A pileup on Russia, a South African scolding for Australia, and the world’s coldest capital has a coal problem. Here’s what you need to know: • More fingers pointing at Russia. France, Germany and the U.S. joined Britain in denouncing Russia over an attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil that used a terrifyingly powerful, military-grade nerve agent, Novichok. The move came a day after Britain formally accused Russia of attempted murder, in an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, above. (The British royal family’s symbolic slap of boycotting the World Cup this summer in Russia was dismissed by a Russian official as “not so important.”) U.S. authorities accused Moscow of engineering a series of escalating cyberattacks that could have enabled it to shut off American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems. And the Trump administration took its toughest action yet against Russia — over a different issue, issuing new sanctions on Russian groups and individuals for election interference and other “malicious” cyberattacks.

"Few investors had more at stake in Broadcom’s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the chip maker Qualcomm than Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and chief executive of Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, and chief portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor mutual fund. Endeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor’s assets, a highly concentrated position. By pursuing a mix of value and socially responsible investing — avoiding companies that harm the environment, and favoring companies that treat their employees well — Mr. Dodson has emerged as one of his generation’s most successful investors. Morningstar ranks his Endeavor fund first among large capitalization blended mutual funds over 10-, five- and three-year periods. Then, this week, President Trump killed Broadcom’s takeover bid on national security grounds, and Qualcomm shares plunged. They dropped more than 5 percent on Tuesday, a $25 million hit to the Endeavor fund. Yet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president’s decision — he applauded it. “There’s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,” he said. “But as a shareholder, I voted against it.” "
"In the past two years, a wave of distressing commentary has stressed the fragility of American democracy and the potential, inspired by President Trump, for emerging authoritarianism. But a year into the Trump administration, Americans are rejecting authoritarian alternatives to democracy. In a new survey by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, we found that the percentage of Americans who expressed support for a “strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with elections or Congress” fell to levels not seen since the mid-1990s. In particular, young people overwhelmingly reject authoritarian rule, despite concerns about a rising generation retreating from democracy (raised most prominently by Roberto Foa and Yascha Mounk). Mr. Trump is almost certainly giving authoritarianism a bad name. Support for authoritarian rule declined most among Democrats and young people, while significantly increasing among Republicans. So when it comes to American authoritarianism, perhaps the problem isn’t so much Mr. Trump as it is hyper-partisanship. Support for authoritarian leadership is concentrating in the Republican Party, and its elites are doing little to push back. In our highly polarized two-party system, this poses the risk that future partisan conflict could become a battle over democracy itself. Mr. Trump’s illiberal style of politics fits the authoritarian leanings of a significant portion of his electoral base. Support for a “strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with Congress or elections” is much higher among Trump primary voters (32 percent) than among voters for any other primary candidate, Republican or Democrat.

"To the Editor: Re “Britain Expels 23 Russians. That’s the Easy Part” (front page, March 15): The rapid endorsement by its European and North American allies of Britain’s assessment and retaliatory actions in relation to the Salisbury nerve agent attack is to be welcomed. However, we have yet to see exactly what actions will be taken by France, Germany, the United States and Canada in response to the attack. A number of key European Union countries are dependent on Russian gas and may be reluctant to provoke Vladimir Putin beyond words. Many are warning that Britain’s actions alone, or even in concert with others, will have no impact on Mr. Putin’s international misbehavior and will only serve to increase tensions and build his domestic support. Then there are others, myself included, who ask, “What if we had done nothing?” We’d effectively be saying to a bully, “Come on in and use the U.K. as your playground — we’ll turn a blind eye.” Game over. When deciding what action to take, it is not always enough to ask what might come of it. We should also ask what bad may result from inaction. As Edmund Burke said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” PAUL WENMAN
ABINGDON, ENGLAND To the Editor: What was the purpose of this poisoning of a former Russian spy, apparently by the Russian state? The spy, Sergei Skripal, had ceased to be an active threat to its interests. The method pointed clearly to its source. A British inquiry’s finding of probable Russian state involvement in the 2006 fatal poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, an opponent of Vladimir Putin, made the Skripal poisoning particularly likely to draw a significant British reaction. It seems likely that Russia wished to send a clear message to other Russian nationals that any betrayal of Mr. Putin would be at the risk of his or her life. And what is the current subject of investigation that is arguably the most consequential to Russian interests? The Mueller investigation of Russian involvement in United States elections — and in particular any collusion by President Trump and Russian leverage over Mr. Trump — must be at the top of that list.

"PARIS — Europe is pushing for more stringent vetting of foreign investments, with an eye on Beijing. Australia has been blocking bids by Chinese buyers for strategic assets. And in Canada, a Chinese takeover of a major contractor faces a national security test. As China looks to spread its wealth and influence, the United States is not the only country seeking to shield its industries under the guise of national security. Governments around the world, and especially in Europe, are increasingly inclined to use such concerns as a litmus test for Chinese investments to protect their competitive edge. It’s a mixture of political posturing, national pride and outright paranoia. But China presents a difficult policy puzzle. Countries must balance safeguarding their strategic industries and preventing the loss of sensitive technologies, while still courting Chinese investors and improving trade with Beijing. “There’s a general impression that China is rising on all fronts, and the question is how to deal with that,” said Philippe Le Corre, a China specialist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Most countries don’t know how to react.” The United States appears to be taking the hardest line toward China. President Trump’s decision this week to block a hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom for the rival American chip company Qualcomm fell apart over concerns that a takeover could hand Chinese rivals an advantage. And the panel that reviewed the Qualcomm deal, known as Cfius, is likely to get tougher still on China. The committee, which can essentially block foreign acquisitions of American firms on national security grounds, has already quashed a number of deals by Chinese-linked buyers. Lawmakers are now calling to broaden the types of transactions the panel can vet. "
"LONDON — While Prime Minister Theresa May has united her warring Conservative Party by denouncing Russia over the poisoning of a former spy, things have not gone so smoothly for the opposition Labour Party. Among Labour lawmakers, familiar wounds have reopened over the more ambivalent stance of its left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Twice in Parliament this week, Mr. Corbyn, whose political views were forged in his leftist activism in the 1980s, has eschewed the supportive, cheerleading role that opposition leaders traditionally play to the prime minister when Britain is in conflict with a foreign power. At times, in his reluctance to criticize Moscow, he sounded like his ideological opposite, President Trump. While he condemned the attack in Salisbury, England, as an “appalling act of violence,” Mr. Corbyn has claimed that the Conservatives took donations from wealthy Russians, and he has highlighted cuts to the British Foreign Office and called for the Russian authorities to be “held to account on the basis of the evidence.” On Thursday, in an article in The Guardian, Mr. Corbyn added that criticism of Russia should not mean acceptance of “a ‘new cold war’ of escalating arms spending, proxy conflicts across the globe and a McCarthyite intolerance of dissent.” His resistance to falling into line with Mrs. May’s tough stance revived tensions with centrist Labour lawmakers who were reluctantly reconciled to Mr. Corbyn’s leadership last year after his better-than-expected performance in national elections. After Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn spoke in Parliament on Wednesday, several Labour lawmakers welcomed the prime minister’s statement, including Hilary Benn, a former shadow foreign secretary, who argued that “as Russia has chosen to act against us in such an outrageous way, we have to demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves.” "
"Chirlane McCray suddenly seems to be everywhere. She is in Puerto Rico, checking on mental health efforts in the wake of Hurricane Maria. She is sitting beside her husband, Mayor Bill de Blasio, at a City Hall news conference to announce the appointment of a new schools chancellor. Since the start of Mr. de Blasio’s second term in January, Ms. McCray, who once shied from the spotlight, has undertaken a political transformation, raising her visibility and profile — so much so that she is now contemplating running for office. But behind the scenes, a similar makeover has also quietly been taking place. Ms. McCray has stepped up her out-of-town travel, meeting with political leaders, speaking about her signature mental health initiative, networking and building the family brand outside New York City. Mr. de Blasio has been criticized for craving a role as a national progressive leader, a status that has eluded him as an individual. But as Ms. McCray’s activities come into focus, it appears that the couple are seeking instead to establish a brand as one of the nation’s first families of progressive politics — modeling themselves, consciously or not, after Bill and Hillary Clinton, who took turns, with one holding office while the other exerted influence from the sidelines. “The word has spread about what we’re doing,” Ms. McCray said in a City Hall interview this week, referring to invitations she receives to travel the country and talk about ThriveNYC, the wide-ranging mental health initiative that she has championed, and other matters. “Homelessness is not a New York City issue; it’s a national issue. Incarceration rates: not a New York City issue; it’s a national issue. What we’re doing here is a model for so many other places.” "
"WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization in recent weeks to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding records directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president. The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that encompasses Mr. Trump’s business ventures. Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over records related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said. The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will continue for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena came as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his inquiry to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States. Mr. Mueller has already indicted 13 Russians and three companies accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, and on Thursday, the Trump administration included them in sanctions it leveled at Moscow as punishment for interference in the campaign and “malicious cyberattacks.” The Trump Organization has typically complied with requests from congressional investigators for documents for their own inquiries into Russian election interference, and there was no indication the company planned to fight Mr. Mueller’s order. “Since July 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the special counsel, and is responding to their requests,” said Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer representing the Trump Organization. “This is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump repeated on Thursday his false assertion that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada, the morning after privately telling Republican donors that he had deliberately insisted on that claim in a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada without knowing whether it was true. Mr. Trump’s private admission to having a loose grasp of the facts and his public refusal to back down from the incorrect statement — the United States has an overall surplus in trade with Canada — were vivid illustrations of the president’s cavalier attitude about the truth, and a reminder of how that approach has taken hold at the White House. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had chosen his figures selectively in the conversation with Mr. Trudeau and in a subsequent Twitter post that repeated the claim. The president was referring only to the trade of goods, Ms. Sanders said, which ignores the larger trade surplus in services the United States exports to Canada. And in a briefing with reporters, she acknowledged that Mr. Trump had fabricated an anecdote he told the donors about unfair trading practices — Japanese officials, he claimed, conduct a test on American cars by dropping a bowling ball on their hoods from 20 feet high, and those that dent are barred from being imported. “Obviously, he’s joking about this particular test,” Ms. Sanders told reporters who confronted her about the veracity of the tale. “But it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.” Her explanation came two weeks after Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that she sometimes told white lies on behalf of Mr. Trump.

"To the Editor: Re “Democrat’s Win on Trump’s Turf Offers Road Map” (front page, March 15): There is a lesson of overriding importance for Democrats in Conor Lamb’s stellar result in the special House election in a red district in which the party sometimes did not even bother to field candidates. Democrats should run candidates who reflect the tenor of the local district or state, not those who strictly adhere to some fixed ideological template. Given President Trump’s great unpopularity and how well Democrats have done in recent elections, it looks increasingly likely that Democrats can recapture the House in 2018. Retaking the Senate will be a much more difficult challenge because several Democratic senators are running for re-election in red states. The stakes here are of enormous historic importance. Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans are zealously intent on stacking the federal judiciary — including the Supreme Court — with right-wing judges. It is the Senate that confirms these potentially lifetime appointments. Let the wingmen of Trump Republicans follow their kamikaze leader. It is crucial that the Democrats adopt a strategic battle formation. RUSS WEISS
PRINCETON JUNCTION, N.J. To the Editor: I don’t think Conor Lamb’s victory in the Pennsylvania congressional election was because he is a Democrat, or because he is a populist, or because he leans right on certain issues or even because Rick Saccone was a poor candidate. It was because Mr. Lamb is smart, articulate, works hard and is likable. But, in my opinion, he won because, above all, people believe him to be ethical. This November, I hope that people, whether they’re Republicans or Democrats, vote for candidates who are willing to listen to those who disagree with them, to work across the aisle and to put country above party. Pennsylvania voters believe that Mr. Lamb will do just that. In spite of the fact that I am a die-hard, lifelong Democrat, I would like to see purple hats predominate in the landscape. Purple hats with the words “Make American Ethical Again” printed in bold clear letters. Let’s elect more people like Mr. Lamb. ANNE KRICK, WHEATON, ILL. To the Editor: The razor-thin margin in Tuesday’s special election in Pennsylvania is dramatic evidence of how little it will take for Russian meddling to have a huge impact on our elections.

"WASHINGTON — In his State of the Union speech two months ago, President Trump vowed to end welfare as he defined it, heralding a plan to force recipients off federal housing vouchers, food assistance and Medicaid if they were not willing to do “a hard day’s work.” Days before the speech, as part of the plan, several federal departments took steps to impose the stricter work requirements on able-bodied adults receiving noncash aid. The move could result in the loss of subsistence benefits for as many as four million poor, single adults over the next few years, experts say. But Mr. Trump’s effort faces an uncertain future. The centerpiece of the plan, a sweeping executive order mandating that federal agencies review safety net programs with an eye toward cutting their rolls, has been delayed indefinitely, according to three senior administration officials. Disagreement among congressional Republicans over how to proceed, Mr. Trump’s own ambivalence — and the absence of any proof that the approach will achieve its intended goal of reducing dependency on federal programs — have resulted in a scattershot process that lacks the coherence and force of previous efforts at overhaul. “This isn’t the 1990s, when you had a broad national consensus for ending welfare as we know it,” said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which has worked closely with the administration on several domestic policy initiatives. Republicans have argued that the requirements are a way to cut down on federal caseloads, and the idea that people should try to work for their benefits, in principle, enjoys broad support, even among Democrats. “It’s good policy and it’s also remarkably popular,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who made welfare overhaul a focal point of his “Contract With America” plan and who succeeded in enacting such a proposal in 1996 in collaboration with President Bill Clinton.

"A few years ago, I installed a web browser extension that swapped out the word “millennial” any time it appeared on a website in my Chrome browser. In its place? The ridiculous phrase, “Snake People.” Why? Well, why not. The word millennial was being used to describe many different kinds of millennials in many different millennial think pieces. Once I installed the extension, any tendentiously oversaturated sentence would be transformed into something absurdly sublime. The creator of the extension, a designer named Eric Bailey, eventually added other preposterous text-swapping constructions to his software. And so my web browsing experience was peppered not only with mentions of Snake People, but also “Zolom’s Children” (for the emerging Generation Z) and the “Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.” (for the Great Recession). Harmless fun! An amusing distraction for myself during my time online. Or so I thought. That text-swap functionality about the Great Recession got me in a spot of trouble last week. As many people around the internet noticed, The New York Times had to issue a correction when an errant copy/paste job led to the fictitious “Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.” appearing in a trade policy article I worked on.

They can make thesaurus recommendations more accessible, create to-do lists in new tabs, or change the color scheme of web pages to make them more readable. "
"WASHINGTON — In his first full cabinet meeting last June, President Trump invited a chorus of gushing praise from his top aides by boasting that he had assembled a “phenomenal team of people, a great group of talent.” But in the nine months since then, Mr. Trump has fired or forced out a half-dozen of the “incredible, talented” people in the Cabinet Room that day: his secretaries of state and health, along with his chief strategist, his chief of staff, his top economic aide and his press secretary. And the purge at the top may not be over. Mr. Trump, who is famously fickle, appears to have soured on additional members of his senior leadership team — and his frequent mulling about making changes has some people around him convinced that he could act soon. “There will always be change. I think you want to see change,” Mr. Trump said, ominously, on Thursday. “I want to also see different ideas.” John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, met early Friday morning with Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, according to one official briefed on the meeting, amid speculation that Mr. Carson would be pushed out of the cabinet because of the bad publicity he received for the purchase of $31,000 in furniture for his office. Mr. Trump is also facing new reports that he plans to replace Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. Three people close to Mr. Trump said that he has concluded that he should remove General McMaster, but he has not disclosed when he will do it and who he will appoint as Mr. McMaster’s successor. "
"In 1813, not long before the end of his reign, Napoleon Bonaparte told the Austrian foreign minister, Count Metternich, the downside of being a strongman. “My reign will not outlast the day I have ceased to be strong and therefore to be feared,” Napoleon said. “Your sovereigns, who were born to the throne, can allow themselves to be defeated 20 times and will always return to their capitals.” Napoleon knew better than anyone the difficulties of remaining in power forever, particularly if you weren’t born to the throne. Years later, democratic institutions would resolve this problem by making it possible for a defeated leader to return by way of the ballot box. Electoral democracy made clear that the throne is never owned, only leased. But the spirit of democracy was hardly limited to the idea that the will of the people is expressed through free and fair elections. That rulers should not be encouraged to outstay their welcomes and that their power must always be constrained played an instrumental role in the modern understanding of liberal democracy as well. But this consensus, forged over centuries, is now being called into question. Today some of the leaders of the world’s most powerful countries, democracies and non-democracies alike, are fashioning themselves as modern-day emperors. They are concentrating power in their own hands with no plans to leave office in their lifetime. In their view it does not matter whether a country is a democracy or an autocracy; what matters is the quality of its leader. And they have a lot of support: At a time when mistrust of politicians is high, many people see strongman leaders as preferable to a corrupt political establishment. No example of this trend is clearer or more significant than the vote this week by China’s National People’s Congress to abolish presidential term limits. It’s not an exaggeration to say that this move signals the end of democracy’s hegemony as the world’s political ideal. In the days after President Xi Jinping of China announced his decision to abolish term limits, many analysts concluded that his attempt to become an actual emperor signaled Beijing’s ambition to openly challenge America’s global leadership. This is accurate, but it’s not the full story. "

"I have spent the last month trapped in a wrinkle in time. Not the film, mind you, though that was quite the fashion moment, and not the book. Rather, sitting by the runways, hour after hour, day after day, city after city between Feb. 7 and March 7, I could feel myself slipping further down a wormhole into the past. One moment it was 2018; the next it was 1981 (or ’85, or ’88). But here’s the thing: I have been there before. I’m not sure I want to go back. There’s a lot of talk these days about the end of trends, or at least trends as we knew them, when designers seemingly dictated en masse that skirts would be short, or long; pants wide or slim, the message filtered down insistently through magazines and department stores. Now fashion has been fractured into a zillion subgroups and subcultures through social media and direct-to-consumer everything, so that what has resulted is a smorgasbord of options. Yet every season a few major, yes, trends appear and demand a reckoning, not least because thanks to their ubiquity, they will likely dominate the visual landscape come August. It doesn’t mean you have to buy into them, but it does mean you have to consider them — and more interestingly, the reasons they exist, and how that makes you feel. This time round it was the 1980s, a decade that has been making a comeback of sorts around the aesthetic edges for the last few years. But while in previous seasons, its re-emergence was tempered by assorted other decades and influences, it has now reached critical mass. Shoulders were the body part of choice, most often inflated to mega proportions (see Marc Jacobs, which even included a pouf-skirted party dress). There were a lot of power furs and leathers, at Givenchy, Tom Ford and Alberta Ferretti. Spangles and shine, at Saint Laurent and Balmain — which, along with Gucci and Versace, also played logo-a-go-go. It was as if everyone had taken a wrong turn on the Warner Bros. lot and ended up in the costume department from “Bonfire of the Vanities.” "
