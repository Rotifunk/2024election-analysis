"WINFIELD, Kan. — If you watched the drama in Washington last month, you may have come away with the impression that the American health care system is a hopeless mess. In Congress, a doomed plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s health care law, has turned into a precarious effort to rescue it. Meanwhile, President Trump is still threatening to mortally wound the law — which he insists, falsely, is collapsing anyway — while his administration is undermining its being carried out. So it is surprising that across the continent from Washington, investors and technology entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley see the American health care system as the next great market for reform. Some of their interest is because of advances in technology like smartphones, wearable health devices (like smart watches), artificial intelligence, and genetic testing and sequencing. There is a regulatory angle: The Affordable Care Act added tens of millions of people to the health care market, and the law created several incentives for start-ups to change how health care is provided. The most prominent of these is Oscar, a start-up co-founded by Joshua Kushner (the younger brother of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner), which has found ways to mine health care data to create a better health insurance service. But perhaps the most interesting and potentially groundbreaking company created in connection with the Affordable Care Act is Aledade, a start-up founded in 2014 by Farzad Mostashari, a doctor and technologist who was the national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration.

"T
he editor in chief of Breitbart News is a 31-year-old craft beer enthusiast from Los Angeles named Alexander Marlow. Probably starting about here, the official style guide of The New York Times Magazine would have me refer to him as ‘‘Marlow,’’ but this is a story about storytelling — about the stories we choose to tell and the way we tell them; the fictions that we entertain when we claim to write nonfiction — so I’m going to blow past the usual journalistic claptrap and just refer to our subject as Alex, because that’s what everybody who knows him calls him, and people who don’t know him tend to call him something much worse. Alex has been the editor of Breitbart for about four years. In 2008, he was the first employee hired by its founder Andrew Breitbart, and he began to lead the editorial staff when Breitbart died in 2012, although it would be another year and change before he claimed the title of editor in 2013. However you cut it, that puts Alex in charge of Breitbart long before last year’s election, responsible for the daily decisions about what to cover and how. If right now you’re thinking that it’s kind of weird how you’ve been reading about Breitbart more or less constantly for the past year, following the daily exploits of former employees like Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos, but this is the first time you’ve ever heard of Alexander Marlow, that’s by design. People close to Alex refer to him variously as ‘‘a shut-in,’’ a ‘‘misanthrope’’ and a ‘‘hermit,’’ who communicates with his staff primarily by phone/text/email and doesn’t have a lot of friends. In fact, if you have come across Alex before now, it was probably in mid-June, when some of the people on the business side of Breitbart persuaded him to appear on the HBO show ‘‘Real Time With Bill Maher.’’ Before we get into that debacle and the jeweler’s-loupe clarity it gave to Breitbart’s predicament, you should know that in the weeks leading up to the appearance, Alex was nervous for all the wrong reasons. It seemed as if every time we got together, the topic of the show would arise, with Alex saying something along the lines of how much he hoped it wouldn’t happen. It wasn’t that he worried what Maher would ask him or how he should respond. Alex grew up in one of the crunchier enclaves of Los Angeles, went to school at Berkeley and lives today in Washington on the boundary between Dupont Circle and Georgetown, which is another way of saying that he has spent his whole life surrounded by liberals who can’t figure out why he doesn’t get it. More than most of us, he is accustomed to defending his job and his opinions to the postman, the neighbors and his wife’s colleagues with a faint, forbearing smile and quickly changing the subject if the vibe starts going south. What troubled him about the Maher appearance had nothing to do with the interview per se. It was the fact that after trying for years to maintain a certain balance in his public life — broadcasting his thoughts on Breitbart’s website and radio program but declining most invitations to appear on television and public stages — he was apprehensive about trading 15 minutes of face time on cable TV for the precious anonymity that allows him, for example, to shamble through his neighborhood every afternoon, walking his two dogs, without running into the rabble of protesters who have been known to picket Breitbart offices, or being spit upon by the 30-to-1 ratio of Democratic voters at the dog park. Also, at a more basic level, he was feeling self-conscious about his looks. Alex is maybe six feet tall, with a thick head of dark hair that he brushes in the slapdash manner of a kid giving in to his mother, and he speaks in a bracing, nasal timbre that recalls a Wayans brothers imitation of white people asking for directions. Entering his 30s, he is well aware that his physique is filling out, hovering on the gauzy line between sturdy and stocky. I remember in particular a dinner that we shared about three weeks before the show, when he confessed, as we shoveled handfuls of stewed Ethiopian vegetables into our faces, that he’d been trying all week to stay off carbs and slim down for Maher. ‘‘The thing is,’’ he said with a sigh, ‘‘if I gain 10 pounds, seven of them go to my face.’’ I mention this not to harp on a person’s ordinary insecurities but to give you a sense of how little importance he gave to the substance of the coming show. Among the topics that preoccupied our conversation — the precipitous rise of Breitbart; its elusive place in the taxonomy of conservative thought; its asymmetric impact on the last election and the subsequent migration of its staff into the West Wing, with writers like Julia Hahn and Sebastian Gorka decamping for senior policy positions, even as the company itself achieved a kind of mythic boogeyman status on the left — I don’t think either of us paused to consider that any of these things would be clarified in a few minutes of television.

"WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials are struggling to make sense of a new economic reality in which low inflation and low unemployment are persisting side by side. At the Fed’s most recent meeting, in late July, most officials said they expected the phenomenon to fade away by next year as low unemployment finally starts to drive up inflation. But a growing number of officials see the pattern as proof that the Fed needs to adjust its assumptions, according to an account of the meeting that the Fed published on Wednesday. At the July meeting, the Fed left its benchmark rate in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. It also said it planned to start reducing its asset holdings “relatively soon.” The minutes said some Fed officials were ready to announce a starting date for the reductions, but most favored just a little more patience. Analysts expect an announcement after the Fed’s next meeting, Sept. 19 and 20. The timing of the Fed’s next rate move is considerably less certain. The Fed entered the year predicting three rate increases of a quarter-point each; so far it has delivered two, with a third seen possible in December. But the weakness of inflation, which the Fed now expects to remain below its target annual pace of 2 percent for the fifth-consecutive year, is prompting some Fed officials to hesitate. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump did more on Tuesday than simply draw an equivalence between the torch-wielding marchers and the leftist activists who clashed with them in Charlottesville, Va. He relinquished what presidents from Roosevelt to Reagan have regarded as a cardinal duty of their job: set a moral course to unify the nation. Asked during his news conference in Trump Tower whether he would put white supremacists and neo-Nazis on the same “moral plane” as their liberal and leftist resisters, a frustrated Mr. Trump replied, “I’m not putting anybody on a moral plane.” “What I’m saying is this,” he explained. “You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible.” Like much of what Mr. Trump says, his statement could be dismissed as an offhand remark, thrown out in the heat of a contentious exchange with reporters. The president, after all, declared a day earlier that “racism is evil” — that the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists “are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.” Yet Mr. Trump’s refusal Tuesday to pass an explicit moral judgment on the violence in Charlottesville seemed a genuine reflection of his beliefs. Certainly, it is similar to his refusal to condemn the tactics of autocrats like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines or President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. "
"After President Trump accused Amazon on Wednesday morning of hurting local retailers and jobs by not paying taxes, the company’s shares dipped in premarket trading. “Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!” he tweeted Wednesday morning, echoing his earlier characterizations of the company as a “no-tax monopoly” that does not pay “internet taxes.” Mr. Trump’s suggestion that Amazon does not pay taxes is false. The company, in its latest annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that it paid $177 million in income taxes in 2014, $273 million in 2015 and $412 million last year. S&P Global Market Intelligence found that Amazon paid an average tax rate covering federal, state, local and foreign taxes of 13 percent from 2007 to 2015, according to analysis provided to The New York Times. That is a smaller share than the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average of 26.9 percent, and the federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent, but on par with Mr. Trump’s proposed 15 percent rate. If Mr. Trump’s point was that Amazon did not collect sales taxes — which are owed by the purchaser and collected by the retailer — it is true that the company once avoided doing so. “If this was five years ago, the tweet would be making a very compelling point,” said Carl Davis, the research director of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Historically, “there is no doubt that Amazon used its ability to not collect sales tax to gain a competitive advantage.” "
"A $29 billion plan to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan should be even more ambitious and allow trains to roll through the station from New York City’s suburbs in New Jersey to Long Island, an influential transit-advocacy group said on Wednesday. The group, the Regional Plan Association, also called for the Gateway tunnel project to include expanding Penn Station an additional block south to 30th Street, a move that would require taking several occupied buildings. The recommendations came in the midst of eight weeks of emergency repairs to the tracks at Penn Station, a season that New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had projected to be a “summer of hell.” The complicated commute has gone more smoothly than expected, but the association warned that “public transportation across the Hudson River is in crisis.” The group’s suggestions for addressing that problem include building a terminal for intercity buses beneath the Jacob K. Javits Center on the Far West Side of Manhattan. A second terminal in Midtown that would accommodate long distance buses would alleviate overcrowding at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on 42nd Street, the organization said. (The Port Authority’s long-term capital plan calls for replacing the main bus terminal but does not include a second terminal under the Javits Center.) The ideas on improving travel across the Hudson are part of the latest update to the association’s sweeping regional plan, the fourth edition of which is scheduled to be released this fall. The association is a nonpartisan research group that has helped to shape transportation in the New York metropolitan region for decades. Its suggestions are not entirely new. The planners of the Gateway project have considered expanding Penn Station to the south and extending the tunnels across Manhattan and have not ruled out either idea. Thomas K. Wright, the president of the association, said it did not have detailed estimates of the costs of these projects. But he said the extension of the Gateway tunnels across Manhattan and under the East River to Queens could cost about $7 billion. That would push the total cost of Gateway, half of which is expected to be provided by the federal government, well past $35 billion. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Again Says Two Sides at Fault in Rally Violence” (front page, Aug. 16): In a horrifying display of anti-Americanism and historical ignorance, we watched the president of these United States give succor to white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis who descended, torches in hand, on Charlottesville, Va., last weekend. Donald Trump once again, in suggesting that there was equivalency between those spewing hatred, bigotry and intolerance and those who marched to condemn that behavior, used his bully pulpit to signal to the indefensible that they have a powerful champion in the White House. The friends and families of the victims of the hate crime perpetrated in Charlottesville and a grieving nation could only watch in disbelief as a president failed to calm and comfort. Of course there is no equivalency, and now there must be no equivocating. A vociferous and united condemnation of the president’s behavior by our lawmakers and those who serve this administration is the order of the day. Anything short of that is cowardly and an unacceptable dereliction of duty. FELICIA MASSARSKY
ATLANTIC CITY To the Editor: President Trump asked “where does it stop?” after speculating that the statues of Washington and Jefferson will be taken down next. Is it really possible that our president does not distinguish between our nation’s founders, who risked (and sometimes lost) their lives and fortunes to create our country, with defeated traitors who sought to destroy the country primarily to preserve slavery? IRA BELSKY, FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J. To the Editor: While I am sure that most people wholeheartedly condemn the terror attack in Charlottesville and disagree strongly with the white supremacists and neo-Nazis, I am at a loss to understand or explain why the media and politicians are so strident in their criticism of President Trump for talking about extremists and violence on both sides. "
"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions hailed local authorities in Miami on Wednesday for falling in line with federal immigration efforts but denounced Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities that have escalated their rejection of Trump administration enforcement policies. “The leaders in Chicago have made this a political issue,” Mr. Sessions said in a speech in the Port of Miami. He contrasted Chicago’s defiance with Miami-Dade County’s recent cooperation, formally recognized by the Justice Department this month. “Respect for the rule of law has broken down. In Chicago, I suggest the so-called sanctuary polices are one sad example of that,” he said. Sanctuary cities’ policies vary, but they generally limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, arguing that close collaboration could undercut local law enforcement efforts. President Trump demanded in January that local authorities fully cooperate or risk losing federal grant money. Miami-Dade’s mayor, Carlos Giménez, has directed county jails to detain undocumented immigrants who were arrested on unrelated charges, giving federal agents a two-day window to retrieve them and possibly begin deportation proceedings. Mr. Sessions tied violence in Chicago to its government’s refusal to follow Miami’s example. “The same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had a historic number of shooting deaths: Zero,” he said. "
"In an unusually public move, the nation’s top military leaders, who typically try to steer clear of social controversy, have come out strongly against racism and extremism in the wake of violent protests over the weekend. Five of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, representing the Navy, the Marines, the Army, the Air Force and the National Guard, posted messages on social media condemning hatred and neo-Nazis, saying that the extremist violence in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday went against the military’s core values. “Events in Charlottesville unacceptable and musn’t be tolerated @USNavy for ever stands against intolerance & hatred,” the chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson, wrote on Twitter as news of the violence developed on Saturday. “No place for racial hatred or extremism in @USMC. Our core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment frame the way Marines live and act,” the Marine Corps commandant, Gen. Robert B. Neller, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. "
"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Wednesday denied a request by Ahmed Abu Khattala, the Libyan suspected of being a ringleader of the 2012 Benghazi attack, to suppress statements he made to interrogators in the brig of a Navy warship, rejecting arguments that the government violated his rights. The 59-page ruling, by Judge Christopher Cooper of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, means prosecutors may use Mr. Khattala’s statements as courtroom evidence during his trial on charges he conspired with others and participated in the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. It was the latest in a string of judicial decisions in terrorism-related cases that have stretched criminal-justice system interrogation rules intended to protect defendants’ constitutional right against self-incrimination in order to accommodate the need to obtain intelligence. After commandos captured Mr. Khattala in a raid in Libya in 2014, the Obama administration, rather than putting him on a plane and flying him directly to the United States, instead placed him in the brig of a Navy ship. It took 13 days to steam across the ocean. During that 5,000-mile voyage, Mr. Khattala was subjected first to a five-day intelligence interrogation without being advised of his so-called Miranda rights to remain silent or have a defense lawyer. Then, after a two-day break, a new team of interrogators with the F.B.I. delivered the Miranda warning and questioned him again. The F.B.I. agents persuaded him to waive his rights and continue to talk about the Benghazi attack without a lawyer present. Prosecutors want to use what he said during that second interrogation in court for their case, and they want the right to use what he said in the first if he were to contradict those statements on the witness stand.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Fallout from the violence in Charlottesville continues to reverberate across the country. The city of Baltimore removed statues of Confederate figures from parks and public squares overnight, above. Mayor Catherine Pugh said it was important to move “quickly and quietly” as a matter of public safety, given the current political climate. Here’s a list of monuments that are being removed nationwide. And colleges are bracing for more clashes as students return for fall term. With their legal options limited by the First Amendment, college administrators are expecting a rush of controversial speakers and are making plans to control violence. _____ 2. In Washington, President Trump’s main council of business leaders disbanded after he equated white nationalist hate groups with the protesters opposing them. Several executives had resigned from the president’s advisory councils over the past few days. "
"In 2014, one of New York City’s largest private employers, JPMorgan Chase, sought to make a deal with the newly minted administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio. The company wanted to move thousands of workers to a pair of new office towers in the Hudson Yards development, but it demanded a host of incentives from the city to make it happen. Mayor de Blasio scoffed at the idea, and the plan fell apart. The company has instead over the past two years added more than a thousand jobs to places like New Jersey, Delaware and Ohio. The episode offered an early demonstration of how a new mayor, who ran on a platform of ending income inequality and seemed proud not to have ties to the city’s titans of finance, would deal with demands from major businesses. Nearly three years later, Mr. de Blasio has not changed his core philosophy or his approach to Wall Street leaders; as he nears the end of his first term, the mayor has not fostered close relationships with the city’s business giants. Last week, when Mr. de Blasio proposed a tax on those making more than $500,000 a year to raise more money for the struggling subway system, he did not first seek support from the business community. And when Mr. de Blasio rolled out his plan to spur the creation of 100,000 new private sector jobs that pay $50,000 or more, he did not invite members of the Partnership for New York City, which represents some of the city’s biggest businesses. One senior administration official acknowledged that few business leaders had been briefed on the plan, and that the rollout could have been smoother, citing the fact that many of the promised jobs were not accounted for in the plan.

"“I am tired, tired of standing up, being counted, tired of ‘having a voice,’ or worse, ‘being a role model,’ Tired, true, of being a featured member of my racial group and/or my gender niche.” Those words come at the beginning of an artist’s statement making a splash on the internet since Tuesday afternoon, when it was released by Kara Walker — who, it so happens, has long been heralded as one of the most prominent and talented black female artists, praised for making work about her race and gender. The statement was published in a news release announcing Ms. Walker’s big fall show, opening Sept. 7 at Sikkema Jenkins & Co., the New York gallery that has represented the artist for years. According to Ms. Walker’s assistant, Allison Calhoun, reached by phone on Wednesday, for months the gallery had been asking for a few words from Ms. Walker, to use as the raw material for a standard news release on her show. But Ms. Walker had been far too busy making work to think about writing. (She was still finishing paintings this week, and wasn’t taking any calls.) Last weekend, however, confronted with the spectacle of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and of President Trump’s first reaction to it, Ms. Walker sat down and her statement poured out. The gallery’s staff had it by Sunday evening; despite its unorthodox content, they released it almost unchanged, said Scott Briscoe, a gallery associate. Ms. Walker’s words acknowledge that her right and capacity “to live in this Godforsaken country as a (proudly) raced and (urgently) gendered person is under threat by random groups of white (male) supremacist goons.” They also express frustration at the idea that she, a mere artist, might have answers for the urgent questions facing us at this moment in history. “I roll my eyes, fold my arms, and wait,” Ms. Walker writes, ending with the simple declaration that “this is a show of works on paper and on linen, drawn and collaged using ink, blade, glue and oil stick.” It is not “exhaustive, activist or comprehensive in any way.” "
"WASHINGTON — An American service member died in Afghanistan on Wednesday after being wounded in an operation against the Islamic State’s affiliate in the country, the military said. American and Afghan troops were also injured in the raid, which took place in eastern Afghanistan. American military spokesmen did not disclose how many were hurt or provide details about their mission. Even as the United States has sought to help Afghan forces push back the Taliban, it has been involved in a separate fight with the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, as the affiliate is known. In April, the United States dropped a massive conventional bomb on the extremists, the so-called mother of all bombs. The United States has repeatedly carried out drone attacks to kill the group’s leaders. The latest operation comes as the Trump administration is assessing its strategy toward Afghanistan in a review that is a month behind schedule. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this week that the options being discussed include sending several thousand more troops — the course recommended by the Pentagon — or using contractors or withdrawing forces. President Trump plans to assemble his national security team on Friday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, to continue the review. Wednesday’s combat death marked the 11th time this year that an American has been killed in the Afghan conflict. Two American soldiers were killed and four wounded earlier this month in a suicide bomb attack in Kandahar Province. Also, in Iraq, two Army soldiers were killed and five were wounded on Sunday when an artillery shell exploded prematurely during combat operations against the Islamic State. But military officials said it was an accident and not the result of enemy action. "
"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Heather D. Heyer, the woman run down during violent clashes here, was remembered on Wednesday for a quality that friends and relatives described as her most frustrating, and most admired — a passion for fighting injustice that was so relentless, it often spilled into her work and personal life. Hundreds of mourners packed a theater in downtown Charlottesville for her memorial service, wearing a sea of purple, her favorite color. Ms. Heyer, 32, had been among a crowd of counterprotesters who gathered on Saturday in opposition to a rally against the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee. That rally drew white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members. She was killed when a man drove a Dodge Challenger into the crowd of counterprotesters. The police arrested a suspect who had a history of espousing Nazi ideology. The suspect, identified as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, was charged in her death and the wounding of about 20 other protesters. At the memorial, a photo of Ms. Heyer with long curled hair, bright eyes and an understated smile splashed across a screen in front of the crowd. A raft of friends and family members came to the stage and shared memories of her, speaking from a lectern that was sandwiched between two sprays of pink and purple roses. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — A young, brash dictator in North Korea threatens to lob nuclear missiles at South Korea and its ally, the United States. From Washington, the leader of the world’s most powerful country threatens to slam the North with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.” Headlines brim with talk of possible war on the Korean Peninsula. How do South Koreans react? With a shrug. I was born in South Korea and have reported on its region for American news media for most of my career — for The New York Times since 2005. And yet, whenever I have to report a recurring “crisis” over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, I feel as if I am living in two different realities. On one hand, there is a deluge of urgent headlines: Analysts and pundits expound North Korea’s latest motives, serving up their newest estimates on its weapons capabilities. (And, of course, there are President Trump’s Twitter storms. But if he knows how to grab headlines with colorful language, North Korea has mastered that game for decades.) On the other hand, once I step outside the media and pundit circles, I meet a prevailing calm, even a nonchalance. The truth is, most South Koreans seem to take things in stride. People in Seoul on Friday evenings are as merry as ever, unmoved by the fact that their city of 10 million lies within the range of North Korean artillery, rockets and missiles. People here have complained about a recent heat wave more than they’ve discussed the possibility of war. None of my South Korean relatives called me about the North Korean threat. And South Korean journalist friends of mine were hoping, seriously, that they could get a trip to Guam out of the North Korea news. (It’s a popular vacation spot for South Koreans.) "
"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — Eric Brown had already seen the footage of the torches, the fire, the fights. The wreckage of Charlottesville days before was still fresh in his memory when he turned on his television on Tuesday to hear the words of President Trump. He listened intensely as the president appeared to equate white nationalist hate groups with those who protested them. First, he allowed himself to feel the hurt. And then he prayed. “His words were bone-crushing,” Mr. Brown, 51, the minister of Greater Mount Pleasant A.M.E. Church here, said, almost 24 hours after an erratic news conference in which the president addressed the protests for a third time. “I could not help but think of the struggles of my parents and my grandparents.” Across the country, Americans are discussing and debating the aftermath of the events in Charlottesville and the comments by the president. But for African-Americans in particular, what happened in the small Virginia city served to spotlight a racial fault line that, for all the talk of progress and diversity, many say has never gone away, according to dozens of interviews. To them, the images of white supremacists marching through streets — along with the deaths of three people — and the president’s response to racial violence were upsetting, but not shocking. Instead, they were proof that more work needs to be done. “I’m not surprised,” said Harold Harris, 41, a barber in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood in Atlanta. “This is the world we live in; this is the country that we live in. We have a lot of racism embedded in our country, in our history.” "

"For more than a year, members of the Baltimore City Council, like officials in many communities across the nation, had drifted indecisively about the fate of the city’s increasingly controversial Confederate monuments. Then, last weekend, white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., violently resurrected the frightening ghosts of the Civil War. That settled the issue in Baltimore: On Monday night, the Council voted unanimously to take down the statues. On Tuesday night, in an unannounced, unceremonious action, four statues were torn from their pedestals as the city slept, with no throng of witnesses or protesters in attendance. “It’s done,” Mayor Catherine Pugh told her city on Wednesday morning. She explained, “With the climate of this nation, that I think it’s very important that we move quickly and quietly.” That is sound advice. The racist rage in Virginia and President Trump’s shamefully sympathetic response have prompted local and state politicians to encourage community peace by weighing the future of Confederate monuments civilly and unapologetically, even if the president has not. Mr. Trump’s refusal to learn the lessons of Charlottesville deepened his estrangement from two panels of national business leaders enlisted to advise him. As more executives resigned in protest of the president’s equivocations, Mr. Trump was forced to disband the groups on Wednesday rather than suffer the humiliation of continuing defections. "
"BALTIMORE — It happened in the dead of night. Around midnight, as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, a crew of police officers and workers wielding a large crane began making rounds of the city’s parks and public squares, hauling away monuments to Confederate heroes. When they were through, before sunrise, four statues that had stood for decades were gone, one chapter in a searing drama that is roiling cities across the county, particularly in the South. “I thought that there’s enough grandstanding, enough speeches being made,” Mayor Catherine E. Pugh of Baltimore said at a news conference on Wednesday. “Get it done.” Elsewhere it was not so simple. From Birmingham, Ala., to Gainesville, Fla., to Durham, N.C., to Lexington, Ky., local and state officials this week faced bitter divisions over Confederate statues. Many of the issues had been building for years, but were now freshly volatile in the wake of the violence that exploded Saturday in Charlottesville, Va. Suddenly, it seemed, the questions of what to do with the roughly 700 remaining statues and monuments to the Lost Cause had come in for perhaps their hardest reckoning. At stake are not just the controversial pieces of public art, but civic, political and racial issues now inextricably tied to them. "
"Every week, 140 million Americans shop at 4,692 Walmart stores in 50 states. There is arguably no other company in the United States that so tangibly touches more Americans of every political, racial and cultural stripe. So when the company’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, on Monday forcefully criticized President Trump’s response to the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., he risked alienating as many customers as he might win over. Mr. McMillon’s remarks came during a week when many corporate titans publicly distanced themselves from the president by stepping down from his advisory councils. On Wednesday, a day after the president equated white nationalist hate groups with the demonstrators opposing them, the main council of chief executives, the Strategic and Policy Forum, agreed to disband. Since the violence in Charlottesville, chief executives across corporate America have had to weigh the risks of taking a stand against the administration. Mr. McMillon himself, while harshly rebuking the president, initially opted not to step down from the Strategic and Policy Forum before it disbanded — an example of the delicate balance that corporate leaders try to strike when dealing with Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, we spoke with customers at Walmart stores in three communities — Las Vegas; Bloomington, Ind.; and Union Township, N.J. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump found himself increasingly isolated in a racial crisis of his own making on Wednesday, abandoned by the nation’s top business executives, contradicted by military leaders and shunned by Republicans outraged by his defense of white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, Va. The breach with the business community was the most striking. Titans of American industry and finance revolted against a man they had seen as one of their own, concluding Wednesday morning they could no longer serve on two of Mr. Trump’s advisory panels. But before Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group and one of Mr. Trump’s closest business confidants, could announce a decision to disband Mr. Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum — in a prepared statement calling “intolerance, racism and violence” an “affront to core American values” — the president undercut him and did it himself, in a tweet. “Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Thank you all!” The condemnation descended on the president a day after he told reporters in a defiant news conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan that “alt-left” demonstrators were just as responsible for the violence in Charlottesville last weekend as the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated protests that led to the death of a 32-year-old woman, struck down by a car driven by a right-wing activist. Five armed services chiefs — of the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines and the National Guard Bureau — posted statements on social media condemning neo-Nazis and racism in uncompromising terms. They did not mention Mr. Trump by name, but their messages were a highly unusual counter to the commander in chief. "
"New York, a Northern stronghold of Unionists and abolitionists, has few Confederate memorials. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants there to be even fewer. On Wednesday, he asked the acting secretary of the Army to change the names of two streets at the Fort Hamilton Army base in Brooklyn that are named after Southern generals. Also on Wednesday, the president of the Bronx Community College said the school would remove the bronze busts of those two Southern generals, Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jonathan (Stonewall) Jackson, from its Hall of Fame for Great Americans, a century-old outdoor sculpture gallery on the campus. “Embracing difference includes creating space where all people feel respected, welcome and valued,” Thomas A. Isekenegbe, the president of the college, which is part of the City University of New York, said in a statement. He said the busts — which are among the 98 in the hall — would be replaced. Mr. Cuomo helped spread the news about the college’s decision, sending a tweet about it on Wednesday night. Mr. Cuomo’s request to the Army also came on the same day that a Brooklyn church removed two plaques that honored Gen. Robert E. Lee from a churchyard tree, in the wake of the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday that began when a group of white nationalists marched to protest the removal of a statue of Lee from a city park.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s embrace of the country’s racially charged past has thrown the Republican Party into crisis, dividing his core supporters who have urged him on from the political leaders who fear that he is leading them down a perilous and shortsighted path. The divisions played out in the starkly different responses across the party after Mr. Trump insisted that left-wing counterprotesters were as culpable as neo-Nazis and white supremacists for the bloodshed in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. Much of the right was ecstatic as they watched their president fume against the “violent” left and declare that “very fine people” were being besmirched for their involvement in the demonstration. Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, said in an interview that if Democrats want to fight over Confederate monuments and attack Mr. Trump as a bigot, that was a fight the president would win. “President Trump, by asking, ‘Where does this all end’ — Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln — connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,” he said. “The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it’s all racist,” Mr. Bannon added. “Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can’t get enough of it.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s personal lawyer on Wednesday forwarded an email to conservative journalists, government officials and friends that echoed secessionist Civil War propaganda and declared that the group Black Lives Matter “has been totally infiltrated by terrorist groups.” The email forwarded by John Dowd, who is leading the president’s legal team, painted the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in glowing terms and equated the South’s rebellion to that of the American Revolution against England. Its subject line — “The Information that Validates President Trump on Charlottesville” — was a reference to comments Mr. Trump made earlier this week in the aftermath of protests in the Virginia college town. “You cannot be against General Lee and be for General Washington,” the email reads, “there literally is no difference between the two men.” The contents of the email are at the heart of a roiling controversy over race and history that turned deadly last weekend in Charlottesville, where white nationalist groups clashed with protesters over the planned removal of a statue of Lee. An Ohio man with ties to white nationalist groups drove his car through a crowd, killing one woman and injuring many others, authorities say. In a fiery news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Trump blamed “both sides” for that violence. He said many of those who opposed the statue’s removal were good people protesting the loss of their culture, and he questioned whether taking down statues of Lee could lead to monuments of Washington also being removed. His words were widely criticized in Washington but were praised by white supremacists, including a former Ku Klux Klan leader. "
"Fox News, television’s equivalent of a presidential safe space, kept up its steadfast defense of President Trump even as he faced an uproar this week over his response to the violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia last Saturday. Anchors like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson praised the president and lauded his bare-knuckle criticism of the news media. But notably, some pundits broke ranks. Eboni K. Williams, a host of the 5 p.m. show “The Specialists,” derided Mr. Trump in exceptionally blunt terms, calling his initial remarks about the rally “cowardly and dangerous” and accusing the president of minimizing “blatant, flagrant hatred” rather than risk roiling a portion of his base. It was the kind of unvarnished criticism that Fox News usually outsources to liberal guests — and Ms. Williams, who is African-American, said that her words had come with a price. In the days since her segment aired, Ms. Williams said she had received nearly 150 menacing messages from people who denounced her remarks and called her a traitor, a racist, a “disgrace,” and anti-American. Some of the messages, she said, implied an intent to harm, and she said she requested and received a security escort from Fox News. “I’ve been on Fox News on and off for five years now,” Ms. Williams, 33, who calls herself politically moderate, said in an interview on Wednesday. “Never in my life had I received the response that I received.” "
"BEIJING — The Trump administration plunged America’s Asian alliances into new confusion Thursday with conflicting signals over how to counter North Korea’s nuclear threat, as the chief White House strategist said a military solution was impossible. Three other leading officials of the administration — its top military general on a visit to China, and its defense secretary and secretary of state in Washington — effectively contradicted him, emphasizing that Mr. Trump was prepared to take military action if necessary. The mixed messages about North Korea policy added to the sense of disarray coming from the White House, where Mr. Trump appeared to have all but forgotten the crisis a week after he threatened an ad hoc “fire and fury” response to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, if he menaced the United States. Stephen K. Bannon, the nationalist ideologue who is Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, said in an interview that there was “no military solution” in the Korean Peninsula, and that he might consider a deal in which United States troops withdrew from South Korea in exchange for a verifiable freeze in the North’s nuclear program. But Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was concluding a three-day visit to Beijing, dismissed the possibility of an American troop withdrawal. Speaking to reporters, he repeated the administration’s earlier position that military action was not preferable but still possible. General Dunford also said there were no plans to cancel American military exercises with South Korea scheduled to start Monday — drills that North Korea could interpret as a new provocation. He called the exercises “very important to maintaining the ability of the alliance to defend itself.” "

"Tycoon, television star, head of state and now — who’d have thought? — leading man of the New York stage. Not that Donald J. Trump has been known for spending nights at the theater since he took the oath of office. But his alter egos, summoned by playmakers angered and bewildered by his election, have been myriad lately. As a consequence, American theater has insinuated its way into the national conversation in a way we haven’t seen in years. The most resounding salvo from a stage was heard in June, when the Public Theater production of “Julius Caesar” in Central Park presented the title character as a portly plutocrat with a comb-over and a model-glamorous wife. When this Caesar cried “Et tu, Brute?” in previews, after being stabbed, it was a shout heard around the world. And partisans on both sides weighed in on the unseemliness (or appropriateness) of portraying the assassination of a ringer for the sitting president. Some Off Broadway productions have striven for Trumpian topicality even more directly (Robert Schenkkan’s dystopian prophecy “Building the Wall,” the nose-thumbing political cabaret “Me the People”). Other shows have asked theatergoers to infer parallels between fictive worlds and the real one of today, like the British reimagining of George Orwell’s “1984,” currently on Broadway. And that professional dissident Michael Moore took his anti-Trump act straight there, too, with “The Terms of My Surrender,” which opened this month. The New York Times theater editor Scott Heller asked critics Ben Brantley, Jesse Green and Alexis Soloski to collect their thoughts and to appraise the effectiveness, artistic and political, of the theater’s Summer of Trump. I can’t recall a night at the theater as electric as the performance of “Julius Caesar” in the park that was halted when a protester stormed the stage and had to be escorted out. Was that a sign of theater’s power? A misreading of Shakespeare? Both? "
"The comedian and writer Dean Obeidallah filed a defamation lawsuit against the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer on Wednesday, around the same time that the website briefly resurfaced from the dark web with a Russian domain name. The website was live at its new address, dailystormer.ru, for a few hours, days after the site had been booted by GoDaddy, Google and a Chinese registrar, for posting an offensive article about Heather D. Heyer, the paralegal who died during the demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday when a man with far-right views plowed a car into a crowd of counterprotesters. The Daily Stormer falsely claimed in June that Mr. Obeidallah, an American Muslim, was the “mastermind” behind the bombing in Manchester, England, and Mr. Obeidallah began receiving death threats. “Some of them actually believe I’m a terrorist,” he said. An article on the revived website on Wednesday morning praised President Trump, claiming that his friendly relationship with Vladimir V. Putin was responsible for the site’s new home. “The Daily Stormer never dies!” the article exclaimed. The website was no longer available by the afternoon. Andrew Anglin, the website’s publisher, told The Associated Press in an email that he had essentially been “banned from the internet” and that he was having trouble finding a domain registry service that would allow The Daily Stormer’s content. Johnathan J. Smith, a lawyer for Mr. Obeidallah, said in a conference call with reporters that the site’s Russian domain registration placed it “away from any ability for America to hold it accountable.” "

Their remarks came after a wild shouting match of a news conference during which the president again blamed “both sides” for the deadly violence, equating activists protesting racism with neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

"President Trump campaigned in large part on his business background and with a pro-business stance. More industry leaders, however — including the chief executive of Walmart — have rebuked Mr. Trump after his response to the weekend’s violence in Charlottesville, Va. “As we watched the events and the response from President Trump over the weekend, we too felt that he missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists,” Douglas McMillon, the Walmart chief executive, wrote in a letter to employees. Despite the tough words, Mr. McMillon is staying on the president’s economic advisory council. Others have decided otherwise. The president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which is a nonprofit business group, and two leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. have stepped down from an advisory council. (Here’s a list of those who have left presidential councils and those who have stayed.) Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, was also facing calls to leave a council she is on. Mr. Trump fought back at a pugilistic news conference on Tuesday. When asked why C.E.O.s had left the manufacturing council, he said: “Because they’re not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country.” Earlier, Mr. Trump had posted on Twitter: “For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!” Some business leaders and critics of Mr. Trump have argued that the advisory forums are not accomplishing much, but others involved in the panels argue that they can still have impact by remaining involved. The Strategic and Policy Forum, according to The Times, urged Mr. Trump not to deem China a currency manipulator. And the president so far has chosen to smooth relations with Beijing. "
"BEIJING — Trucks packed with seafood were backed up, bumper to bumper, at the Chinese border with North Korea. Protesters carried red banners demanding compensation. And Chinese businessmen who have been making big money from North Korean crabs, shrimp and squid were furious. United Nations sanctions banning the import of North Korean seafood started to bite on Wednesday, two days after China’s Commerce Ministry announced it would enforce the new rules passed by the United Nations Security Council as punishment for the North’s nuclear and missile tests. The crackdown came as President Trump offered some rare words of praise for North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, making an apparent reference to the country’s decision to wait “a little more” before acting on plans to launch ballistic missiles toward Guam, an American territory. The Trump administration had been pushing China to tighten its enforcement of the United Nations sanctions, and North Korea’s export of seafood is a decent, if not spectacular, source of cash for its government. By curtailing the trade, China, which has been criticized for not properly enforcing earlier sanctions, is obeying the intent of the latest sanctions resolution but harming its own businessmen. "
"SOFIA, Bulgaria — There is something mystifying about the American obsession with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The Kremlin’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula, its military involvement in Syria and its meddling in elections abroad may help explain some of America’s sense of alarm. But they fail to explain why liberals in the United States are so much more vexed by Russia than they are by, say, the growing economic power and geopolitical ambitions of China, or the global ideological challenge of radical Islam or the sheer craziness of a nuclear-armed North Korea. Russia suffers from demographic decline and arrested modernization. Its economy is overdependent on exporting natural resources. Its population has one of the highest percentages of university-educated people but the lowest labor productivity in the industrialized world. And although Mr. Putin is a strong and ruthless leader who enjoys popular support at home and celebrity status abroad, Russia’s institutions are corrupt and dysfunctional: Russian bureaucrats spend much of their energy fighting one another over money and power and have no time to cooperate. And Russia’s future after Mr. Putin — whenever that may come — is anybody’s guess. Was it not just two years ago that President Barack Obama called Russia a “regional power”? And is it not true that even today most experts concur that while Moscow is an aggressive military power interested in counterbalancing America’s influence in the world, it is no traditional “rising power”? As the eminent American historian Stephen Kotkin wrote last year in Foreign Affairs, “For half a millennium Russian foreign policy has been characterized by soaring ambitions that have exceeded the country’s capabilities.” It is no different today. And yet despite all of this, Americans are mesmerized and terrified by Russia. Is it simply that for liberal America, “Russia” is a code name for “Donald Trump”? As for many of the great questions of our times, an explanation can be found in Russian classical literature. In this case, Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s novella “The Double.” It is the story of a government clerk who winds up in the madhouse after meeting his doppelgänger — a man who looks like him and speaks like him, but who displays all the charm and self-confidence that the tortured protagonist lacks. The doppelgänger in Dostoyevsky’s story does not drive the protagonist insane just because they look alike but because he makes the protagonist realize what it is he doesn’t like about himself. And such it is with the United States and Russia today. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s longtime aide Hope Hicks will serve as the interim White House director of communications and will help the president find a permanent person for the job, the administration said Wednesday. However temporary it is, it was the latest reshuffling in the White House and comes at a time when the president’s remarks on white supremacists were drawing fire from Democrats and Republicans. The role of communications director is to set a clear and direct message coming from the White House each day. Ms. Hicks, 28, already is considered one of the most important people in the president’s communications orbit and has the most sway over who in the news media gets interviews with the president. Her current title is director of strategic communications. Ms. Hicks was a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and at the Trump Organization. Ms. Hicks is close to the president, and also close with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka. Ms. Hicks, who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., will temporarily fill the vacancy left by Anthony Scaramucci. Unlike Mr. Scaramucci, who kept a high profile during his 10 days in the position, Ms. Hicks has long been a hidden hand, staying behind the scenes and outlasting other administration staff members. She knows Mr. Trump’s rhythms, and he views her as one of the few people around him truly looking out for his interests, not tending her own image. Ms. Hicks is also keenly aware that Mr. Trump is, ultimately, his own communications director. For his part, Mr. Scaramucci expressed his support for Ms. Hicks on Twitter. "
"TOKYO — Twice a year, American and South Korean troops get together for large-scale war games to prepare for a possible attack by North Korea. And year after year, the North condemns the joint exercises as a rehearsal for an invasion and demands that they be called off. Now, with President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, recently trading threats of nuclear war, another round of the biannual drills is set to begin on Monday in South Korea. They are the first to be conducted since North Korea test-fired missiles that appear capable of hitting the United States, and some are asking whether they might be used as a bargaining chip to persuade the North to freeze its nuclear program. The United States and South Korea describe the exercises as defensive in nature. North Korea, on the other hand, views them as much more threatening, particularly components that include plans for assassinations of the country’s leadership in the event of an outbreak of war. Last weekend, the North said the exercises were “kicking up war zeal.” Two years ago, the North proposed a temporary moratorium on nuclear tests if Washington canceled the joint biannual military exercises. The exercises starting on Monday are known as Ulchi-Freedom Guardian and consist mainly of computer simulations carried out in a large bunker in mountains south of Seoul. Much larger war games in the spring usually involve live-fire training and tank movements as well as drills with ships and aircraft. China has also recently suggested a similar two-sided freeze, although the United States has so far refused. Now, some analysts say, a permutation of that offer may be the best way to defuse the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. In a statement released Tuesday by North Korea’s state media, Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, said the country would wait before carrying out its threat to launch ballistic missiles into the waters off the American territory of Guam. But in order for the United States to prevent “dangerous military conflict on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Kim added, it needed to “show it in action.” "
"WASHINGTON — No one should be worried about American military action anywhere in Latin America. The notion is risible. But President Trump’s cavalier remark last week referring to a “possible military option” to deal with the increasingly dictatorial regime led by President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela has real consequences. Such bluster could adversely affect the United States’ relations with its closest neighbors and make it even more difficult to resolve the hemisphere’s worst crisis. Although White House officials have said “all options are on the table” when it comes to Venezuela, Mr. Trump’s comment seemed to come out of nowhere. The administration had been pursuing a different approach: It expanded targeted sanctions on top Venezuelan officials — including Mr. Maduro — that began under President Barack Obama. Broader economic sanctions, possibly even cutting off oil imports, are reportedly being reviewed. Predictably, Mr. Trump’s warning set off a uniformly negative reaction both in the United States and across Latin America. Especially in Latin America, the remark evoked the Cold War era, when the United States sent troops to Central America and the Caribbean (though never to South America, where Venezuela is), often with unhappy results. The last time the United States used military forces in Latin America was in Panama, nearly three decades ago. Mr. Trump seems unaware that the hemisphere has fundamentally changed since then. Moreover, no senior official or political figure in the United States, neither Republican nor Democrat, has embraced or even hinted at a military option in Venezuela. Days before Mr. Trump’s remark, his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, asked by The Washington Post if he thought there would be military intervention in Venezuela from any outside source, said: “No, I don’t. I don’t think so.” The timing of Mr. Trump’s statement was particularly infelicitous. First, Latin American governments, whose response to Venezuela’s dramatic deterioration had been disappointingly slow and tepid, have recently ramped up diplomatic pressure on Mr. Maduro to adhere to the constitution and restore democratic rule. "
"Barack Obama’s response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., became the most-liked tweet in Twitter’s history Tuesday night, according to representatives for the social media platform. The former president’s tweet, sent out Saturday evening, paired a quote from Nelson Mandela’s 1994 autobiography, “Long Walk to Freedom,” with a picture of Mr. Obama smiling up at a diverse group of young children. It broke the record at about 10:07 Tuesday evening, a Twitter spokesman said, surpassing a tweet from Ariana Grande earlier this year reacting to a terrorist attack at her concert in Manchester, England. The picture of Mr. Obama was taken by the White House photographer at the time, Pete Souza, on June 9, 2011, at a day care facility in Bethesda, Md., near where Mr. Obama’s younger daughter, Sasha, had just participated in her fourth-grade closing ceremony. Mr. Obama’s supporters were often grateful for his emotional responses to moments of national tragedy. Those included his tearful speech years after the fact as he recalled the killings of children in Newtown, Conn., and his singing of “Amazing Grace” while eulogizing the reverend of a church in Charleston, S.C., who was one of nine parishioners killed by a white gunman motivated by racist hatred. His tweet provided a contrast to President Trump’s equivocal responses to the protests in Charlottesville. The protests developed out of a rally organized by white nationalists and resulted in the death of one counterprotester. Mr. Trump, in his early response to the episode, condemned the violence on “many sides.” Mr. Obama’s tweet passed Ms. Grande’s on the same day that Mr. Trump repeated his criticism of “both sides” in Charlottesville in an impromptu question-and-answer session. His remarks stunned many politicians, media personalities and even members of his own staff. But they prompted cheers from his supporters on Fox News, as well as the prominent white supremacists David Duke and Richard Spencer. Mr. Souza has continually used his personal Instagram account to lob darts at Mr. Trump, often posting pictures in response to news events that contrast the 44th president’s time in office with the 45th’s. Mr. Obama’s tweet drew a similar contrast. Though Twitter’s user base remains small compared to competitors like Facebook and Instagram, it has continued to report strong growth in its daily user base. And with more people using Twitter more frequently, it has become easier to break records on the platform. Mr. Obama’s tweet, which is also the fifth most retweeted ever (and climbing), is one of three tweets from 2017 in the top five. (Mr. Trump, who tweets too regularly, and explosively, for any one tweet to gain an outsize measure of attention — even as they often drive the news cycle — is not on the list.) Tweets need not be profound, or even substantive, to achieve such heights. The most retweeted post of all time came earlier this year when a Nevada teenager asked Twitter users to help him win a free year of Wendy’s chicken nuggets. "
"Back in the before-times, when all the polls predicted a landslide Hillary Clinton victory and establishment Republicans were pivoting away from Donald Trump like a chorus line, I had a postelection cautionary column in the hopper. It was imperative, I planned to write, that we remember who the Republicans were before Trump thundered in and tossed reality on its axis. Don’t let them trick you, I was going to say. They will try — they are already trying — to use Trump as a foil, to quarantine the Trumpists and situate themselves, by contrast, on the side of goodness and rationality and respect. Do not let them off the hook so easily. Never forget that Trump wasn’t anomalous, he was the Republican Party’s quintessence, and their defection is a matter of self-preservation, not conscience. Of course, I never got to write that essay. Trump won, and Republicans didn’t pivot. They wrapped their arms around his meaty torso and held on for dear life, while the most vile and violent factions of the Republican base got busy living their whole truth. This past Friday night, those factions — swollen and bold from eight months of making America great again — marched in Charlottesville, Va. They carried torches, shouted Nazi slogans and rallied in protest of the prospect of removing a statue of Robert E. Lee.. The next day, according to police, James Fields Jr., a registered Republican, drove his car into a crowd of counterprotestors, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Saturday afternoon, President Trump, in a statement that should taint his family name until human extinction, decried the violence “on many sides.” He personally did not mention white supremacy specifically until Monday, and then only under fierce pressure from the public and the media. Abruptly but unsurprisingly, on Tuesday afternoon, he doubled back to his original stance and again blamed “both sides.” "
"Republicans often point to Ronald Reagan’s 1986 Tax Reform Act as the kind of ambitious rewriting of the tax laws that is possible with persistence, bipartisan cooperation and strong presidential leadership. Congressional Republicans headed to the Reagan Ranch in California on Wednesday to seek inspiration at a place sacred to the last president who accomplished a sweeping overhaul of the tax code.   But not everyone remembers 1986 with such fondness. President Trump, who has often compared himself to President Reagan, was a fierce critic of the tax legislation. In 1991, Donald Trump was invited to testify before the House Budget Committee about the impact that the changes to the tax code were having on the construction industry. Mr. Trump, a real estate developer at the time, described the Reagan tax law as an albatross on the economy, warning that such sweeping changes were disrupting deals and stultifying economic growth. The concerns that he expressed could prove instructive as the Mr. Trump looks to sell his own ambitious tax plan this year. Never one to be shy, Mr. Trump told lawmakers that the 1986 tax act was essentially wrecking the economy. The central problem, he explained, was changes that were harming the real estate industry, which he described as a keystone to the labor market. "

"NEW ORLEANS — On Aug. 5, my wife got a series of frantic text messages from a friend who was watching her car fill with water. There was no hurricane, no tropical storm, but over eight inches of rain had fallen that afternoon, and the city’s pumps couldn’t keep up. Another friend had to abandon her car under a highway overpass and wade a mile across town, in the dark, to get home to her baby daughter. It was the second time in two weeks that parts of New Orleans flooded. Because of climate change, these floods represent the city’s “new normal,” according to Cedric Grant, the former head of the Sewerage and Water Board, the local agency charged with operating the city’s drainage infrastructure. “We’re now in a situation,” Mr. Grant said, “where we receive more rain than anybody could have imagined on a regular basis.” The trouble wasn’t unique to New Orleans, he added, in what seemed to be a mixture of fear and defensiveness; he soon resigned when it emerged that several of the city’s pumps had been out of order. Across the country, as our infrastructure ages, what was once regarded as extraordinary weather is increasingly ordinary. The day before, President Trump tweeted that he was preparing for hurricane season. I, too, try to be prepared. During hurricane season, I pay close attention to the weather forecast. I keep my gas tank full. My wife and I pre-argue about what we will take with us if we have to evacuate. Which is to say, I might have taken some comfort in the president’s tweet if he hadn’t written it on the 65th day of hurricane season. President Trump’s late message is part of a broader pattern of his shirking federal action on weather and climate. He waited over three months to nominate an administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, who was confirmed by the Senate only late in June. That’s when Tropical Storm Cindy was prompting flash flood warnings across the Gulf Coast, and my wife and I were bickering over whether we would bring her pet rabbit or my Martin guitar (don’t worry, the rabbit won).

"LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Wednesday criticized the reaction of President Trump to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., after initially declining to condemn the American leader’s stance. Earlier this week, Mrs. May had said that Mr. Trump’s remarks were “a matter for him,” but she went further during a visit to the southern English city of Portsmouth, saying there was “no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them.” “It is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views wherever we hear them,” she added. In a statement on Wednesday, the justice minister in Germany, Heiko Maas, condemned Mr. Trump’s reaction to the events in Virginia. “It is unbearable how Trump is now glossing over the violence of the right-wing hordes from Charlottesville,” said Mr. Maas, whose Social Democratic Party is in a governing coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats.

"WASHINGTON — With President Trump’s poll numbers slipping, a group of the president’s former campaign aides is beginning an effort to encourage new voters in parts of the country that supported him in the election, and to stop what they contend are illegal votes in Democratic areas. The former aides are starting a group called Look Ahead America to identify “disaffected” rural and working-class Americans who either do not vote or are not on the voter rolls, in order to register and mobilize them ahead of future elections, according to a prospectus being distributed to possible donors. Look Ahead America also seeks to discourage or invalidate “fraudulent” votes by deploying poll watchers with cameras, and through what it called a forensic voter fraud investigation to identify “votes cast in the names of the deceased, by illegal immigrants or non-citizens,” according to the prospectus, which was shared with The New York Times. The group is the brainchild of two people who initially helped run the data team for Mr. Trump’s campaign, Matt Braynard and Witold Chrabaszcz. They are rolling out Look Ahead America in a series of private meetings in Washington this week with conservative leaders and activists, including those gathered Wednesday morning for a weekly meeting of influential conservatives convened by the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist. Mr. Braynard and Mr. Chrabaszcz will be joined in the organization by a former regional coordinator for the Trump campaign, Andrew Stempki, and a board of directors including about 30 former campaign field staffers and state coordinators.

"WASHINGTON — As F.B.I. director, James B. Comey had widespread support from his agents, according to internal survey data released Wednesday that contradicts President Trump’s claim that he fired Mr. Comey in part because agents had lost confidence in him. Mr. Comey’s firing is among many topics now under investigation by the Justice Department special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump and his aides have offered changing explanations for why he fired Mr. Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into Mr. Trump’s associates and possible links to Russia’s election interference. The F.B.I. released the results of three years of internal questionnaires in response to a public records request by The New York Times. The surveys revealed that agents around the country gave the F.B.I. leadership high marks — 4.01 on a scale of 5 — in this year’s survey. The F.B.I. considers scores over 3.81 an indication of success. Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast Mr. Comey in a negative light. “He’s a showboat, he’s a grandstander, the F.B.I. has been in turmoil,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Comey in an NBC interview in May. “You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the F.B.I. a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn’t recovered from that.” The F.B.I. surveys show no support for that claim. They scored him above 4 as both an inspiring leader and someone more interested in leading than being liked. His direct subordinates rated him 4.48 on the question of whether they would work with him again. While Mr. Comey’s marks fell slightly in some categories over his three-year tenure, his scores were consistently high in each year and in nearly every area. Nationwide, agents gave higher marks to Mr. Comey’s leadership team in 2017 than they gave to Mr. Mueller, who preceded him as director and whose tenure is widely respected. "
"Paul Chabot, a Republican, ran in the fall for Congress from a part of California’s Inland Empire that was once reliably Republican. That was the best way, he figured, to revive a community he remembered from his childhood as being safer, more prosperous, with better public schools and less liberal politics. It was his final effort trying to make things work in California. Mr. Chabot lost by 12 points. By Thanksgiving, he, his wife, Brenda, and their four children were touring North Texas in a rented S.U.V. looking for a new home. In the language of political science, they were sorting. The Chabots left a part of the country where they believed they no longer fit in as conservatives for a new community where they felt sure they would. “I see it even more boldly — as escaping,” Mr. Chabot said from McKinney, Tex., where the family settled this year. Their migration is precisely the kind Bill Bishop described in his 2008 book “The Big Sort,” which posited that Americans have been self-selecting since the 1970s into like-minded communities that are less likely to hold competitive elections. San Bernardino County, which the Chabots left behind, leaned Democratic in the last three presidential elections. Collin County, Tex., where they landed, has gone Republican the last 13. "
"Mobile, Ala. — Former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore delivered a striking rebuke Tuesday to President Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Casual observers nationwide might marvel that Mr. Moore, twice evicted from the state high court for judicial-ethics violations, ran substantially ahead of the incumbent senator Luther Strange in Alabama’s special-election Republican primary — this, despite being outspent by more than 10 to 1, and despite Mr. Trump’s enthusiastic endorsement of Mr. Strange. But Mr. Moore had a few things going for him that outsiders seem to have missed. Mr. Strange has his own ethical stench. More important, the rest of the country just doesn’t get how much Alabama voters like and trust Mr. Moore. To understand the Strange stench, one must consider the context of his ascension to the Senate. He was appointed by Gov. Robert Bentley, not long before Mr. Bentley resigned over a cringe-inducing affair with a top aide, Rebekah Mason, and his heavy-handed attempts to cover it up, including (apparently) misuse of state funds. Mr. Bentley had run as a moral exemplar and a man of humility — but instead was revealed, by copious evidence, as a self-serving bully. The state House of Representatives had begun an impeachment inquiry into his conduct, but Mr. Strange, then the state’s attorney general, curiously asked the House to desist while his own office supposedly conducted a criminal investigation. Shortly thereafter, when Mr. Trump chose Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Mr. Strange sought and secured Mr. Bentley’s appointment as Mr. Sessions’s temporary replacement — at the exact same time Mr. Strange’s office was slowly investigating Mr. Bentley. To anyone watching in Alabama, Mr. Strange looked like a would-be executioner seeking favors from the king whose neck he alone could decide to guillotine. It didn’t matter that, as Mr. Strange has repeatedly noted, his successor secured a (lenient) plea deal that removed Mr. Bentley from office anyway: Many voters resent what looked like a tacit, wink-and-nod understanding between Mr. Bentley and Mr. Strange. Then they see Mr. McConnell’s political action committee pledge to spend an astonishing (by Alabama standards) $8 million on behalf of Mr. Strange, a former federal lobbyist, and that does it — for many voters, Mr. Strange is an irredeemably slick, deal-making insider.

"On Tuesday, Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo, joined a call with other prominent corporate chieftains who — like her — had agreed to advise President Trump. A rebellion was brewing. Along with other business leaders, Ms. Nooyi had watched with bafflement over the weekend as Mr. Trump blamed “many sides” for an outburst of white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Ms. Nooyi spoke with Mary T. Barra, the head of General Motors, Virginia M. Rometty, the chief of IBM, and Rich Lesser, the chief executive of Boston Consulting Group, who were similarly outraged with the president’s response. All of them wondered whether it was time to step down from the Strategic and Policy Forum, an elite group formed late last year to advise the president on economic issues. As these calls were occurring, the president’s other main business advisory group, the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, had begun to disintegrate. Early Monday, the chief executive of Merck stepped down from that group, followed by the chiefs of Intel and Under Armour, and representatives from a labor group and a nonprofit business alliance. Some chief executives were still on the fence on Tuesday, torn between remaining on the prestigious presidential policy advisory panel and making a statement by stepping down. But after the president delivered a series of stunning remarks in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday afternoon, when he again equated far-right hate groups with the groups protesting them, many chief executives had enough.

"The narrow strait that separates the Horn of Africa from the Arabian Peninsula is so treacherous it is called Bab el Mandeb — “gateway of grief.” It’s earned its miserable name lately as African migrants try to pass through war-torn Yemen to flee dire poverty and hunger and reach Saudi Arabia, and jobs. To escape the authorities, a ruthless smuggler threw migrants into the sea last week, drowning more than 50. More than 30 are missing. Shockingly, migrants said the smuggler returned to Somalia to pick up more desperate people, according to Laurent de Boeck of the International Organization for Migration, which helped survivors. Many of the migrants are teenagers from Somalia and Ethiopia, where there are few jobs and severe drought is pushing people to the verge of famine. Employment in Saudi Arabia can help their families survive, but to get it they have to travel through Yemen — where a serious cholera epidemic is adding to misery and nearly seven million people subsist on food aid. The breakdown of authority in Yemen has been a boon for the human traffickers. The level of desperation in Africa and changes in work-permit rules in Saudi Arabia have made legal migration more difficult. More than 55,000 migrants got to Yemen this year, following more than 111,000 who arrived last year, according to the International Organization for Migration, which is a United Nations agency. Deaths of migrants who set off for Europe from Libya drew international attention and prompted promises of action from the European Union. More than 2,400 migrants have died or disappeared in the Mediterranean so far this year, compared with at least 114 en route to Yemen. But the latest tragedy is testimony to a misery so great, teenagers are willing to travel through hell for a chance at a better life. Rather than cut aid to Africa, as the Trump administration has threatened to do, the administration needs to provide Africa with more help than ever. And if Saudi Arabia allowed more Africans to travel there legally to work, it would help prevent tragedies like the one last week and put the ruthless smugglers who prey on young Africans out of business.

"Show-business veterans and movie-trivia mavens, gather round. The mystery of “Chief Zabu” has been solved. The film, completed in 1986 but shelved by the filmmakers after a poorly received preview, will get its first official showing in New York on Thursday night at a comedy club. It’s a fitting premiere for a title that was the subject of a long-running joke on “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” the cult series that made fun of bad movies. Whenever a character in that week’s cheesy film would open a newspaper, the series’s original host, Joel Hodgson, would laconically drawl, “Hey, Zack Norman is Sammy in ‘Chief Zabu.’” The line was from an actual ad with a black-and-white photo of a stern-looking Mr. Norman that ran every Wednesday for nine years in Weekly Variety. Initially, the ad, first bought in 1981, was a jokey bit of self-promotion, and subsequently a tease for “Chief Zabu” when it was in production. But the movie stalled in postproduction. One of its backers went bankrupt. The writer-directors, Mr. Norman (credited as Howard Zuker) and Neil Cohen, put the movie in storage and resolved to “get back to it sometime,” Mr. Cohen said in a recent phone interview. But Mr. Norman kept running the ad. Why? Last year, he told SouthFlorida.com, “Because it gave me great joy.” In the recent phone interview, which included Mr. Norman, Mr. Cohen recalled: “Once Zack got a call from a reporter from Newsweek, and he wanted to do a story about ‘Chief Zabu’ and the ad. And Zack became indignant and said: ‘Clearly you don’t understand who I am and what I’m about. I hate publicity.’ And he hung up the phone.” While admitting to an impish sense of humor, Mr. Norman protested, “I don’t think I was so mean as that.” In Minneapolis, Frank Conniff, a writer and co-star of “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” found the ad had become “implanted in my head,” he said by phone. “Of all the staff, I was the one who most actively read the trades,” he recalled. “The ad always struck me as funny, but I don’t think I could have gotten the joke in as many times as I did had the others not gotten similarly obsessed.” In recent years the ad has taken on meme-like qualities; there’s even a T-shirt reproducing it.

"WASHINGTON — The renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement is off to a rocky start. The Trump administration lectured Canada and Mexico on the failures of the current agreement at an opening news conference Wednesday morning, while behind closed doors negotiators began to seek significant concessions from America’s neighbors. “We feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,” said Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who is leading the United States team aiming to overhaul the 25-year-old agreement. The Canadian and Mexican representatives were publicly pleasant, emphasizing their commitment to regional trade and the benefits resulting from a regional alliance. But both nations also say the current agreement is not tilted against the United States. The talks that began Wednesday are the first of several scheduled rounds between now and the end of the year, when the three nations hope to conclude a deal. It is a very fast timetable in the world of international negotiations, reflecting political imperatives in all three nations more than the practical realities of an immensely complex negotiation. Both Mexico and the United States have national elections scheduled next year. The overarching issue is the importance of trade deficits. Americans buy more goods and services from Mexico than Mexicans buy from the United States. Last year, the difference was $55.6 billion. The Trump administration regards this number as an indictment of the current trade deal — evidence that Mexico is taking advantage of the United States. While trade with Canada has been more balanced in recent years, Mr. Lighthizer said Wednesday that over time the United States has run a significant trade deficit with Canada, too. "
"WASHINGTON — Jewish members of President Trump’s administration remained largely silent Wednesday after Mr. Trump came to the defense of nationalist and right-wing protesters in Charlottesville, Va., who had chanted anti-Semitic slogans and demeaned the president’s Jewish son-in-law. Gary D. Cohn, the director of the president’s National Economic Council, who is Jewish, was described by several people close to him as “disgusted” and “deeply upset” by the president’s remarks. But Mr. Cohn has not publicly expressed those views. Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury and also Jewish, stood silently behind Mr. Trump on Tuesday as the president said there were “very fine people on both sides” at the Virginia incident. Mr. Mnuchin has not said anything since about the president’s remarks. And Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, who is also Jewish, has been silent about Mr. Trump’s comments. Ivanka Trump, Mr. Kushner’s wife, who converted to Judaism, said in a tweet on Sunday, “There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis.” Requests for comment on Wednesday from Mr. Kushner, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin were not answered. The violent racist protests in Charlottesville began as white supremacists and others rallied against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee from a park in the city. Their words were aimed at Jews as well as blacks. Neo-Nazis carried torches and chanted “Jews will not replace us” as they marched through the University of Virginia campus on Friday. And on Tuesday, Chris Cantwell, a white supremacist leader, told Vice News that he wanted a president who “does not give his daughter to a Jew.” "
"On Tuesday, President Trump stood in the lobby of his tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and again made excuses for bigotry and terrorism, effectively repudiating the remarks his staff wrote a day earlier in response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. I stood in that same lobby in January, fresh off a meeting with the new president-elect. Although I had endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, I was hopeful we could work together to bring some of his pro-worker campaign promises to fruition. Unfortunately, with each passing day, it has become clear that President Trump has no intention of following through on his commitments to working people. More worrisome, his actions and rhetoric threaten to leave America worse off and more divided. It is for these reasons that I resigned yesterday from the president’s manufacturing council, which the president disbanded today after a string of resignations. To be clear, the council never lived up to its potential for delivering policies that lift up working families. In fact, we were never called to a single official meeting, even though it comprised some of the world’s top business and labor leaders. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. joined to bring the voices of working people to the table and advocate the manufacturing initiatives our country desperately needs. But the only thing the council ever manufactured was letterhead. In the end, it was just another broken promise. During my January meeting with President Trump, we identified a few important areas where compromise seemed possible. On manufacturing, infrastructure and especially trade, we were generally in agreement. Mr. Trump spoke of $1 trillion to rebuild our schools, roads and bridges. He challenged companies to keep jobs in the United States. He promoted “Buy America.” He promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Here’s the thing: Working men and women have been promised the moon by politicians. Year after year. Campaign after campaign. Republican and Democrat. Too often, those promises have ended up being hollow; election year sound bites are often discarded as quickly as they are made. I told President Trump that this time must be different. I made clear that we would judge his administration on its actions. "

Email us at ourpicks@nytimes.com. • Erick Erickson in The Resurgent: “It seems one of the biggest problems with having Donald Trump as the messenger is that he is so flawed he allows the press and others, even people like Mitt Romney, to give Antifa and violent leftwing activists a pass they should not get.” Mr. Erickson writes that saying there was “good people on both sides” of the protests in Charlottesville was “stupidest thing of all stupid things the man has said.” But what, in his opinion, is true, however, is that the counterprotesters showed up “looking for a fight.” “Antifa is on the opposite side of the white supremacists on the same coin,” he writes.

They want the strength in numbers of the larger fascist right while also enjoying the credibility granted them by Breitbart, Steve Bannon, Milo, and — today — the president of the United States.” The president’s news conference gave the so-called alt-right the “greatest national media moment ever,” argues Mr. French. By delineating between the alt-right, and groups like neo-Nazis and white supremacists, he’s making its members “respectable” and “different.” And while Mr. French sees some “kernels of truth” in Mr. Trump’s statements at Trump Tower, he reminds his readers that the “most pernicious forms of evil always mix truth and lies.” Read more » "
"RIO DE JANEIRO — During a whirlwind trip to four Latin American countries this week, Vice President Mike Pence sought to soften the edges of the ‘America first’ worldview — the administration’s first major effort to mend fences with a region rattled by President Trump’s election. “Under President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first,” Mr. Pence said Wednesday in Chile during the third leg of a trip that began in Colombia and included stops in Argentina and Panama. “But as I hope my presence today demonstrates, ‘America first’ does not mean America alone.” Yet Mr. Pence’s hopeful message of expanded economic and diplomatic cooperation did little to assuage fears among the region’s leaders, who have been furiously planning for an era of diminishing returns in Washington by deepening regional trade relations and pursuing expanded commercial ties with Europe and China. Mr. Trump is widely loathed in Latin America, where his early moves have been interpreted as a return to an overbearing, security-obsessed American foreign policy. The contrast has been sharp with President Barack Obama’s administration, when Latin Americans felt they were treated with an unusual degree of deference and respect. “We went from being recognized as a strategic ally to being regarded as part of their backyard,” said María Jimena Duzán, an influential Colombian columnist at the weekly magazine Semana, echoing a view several Latin American officials have shared privately. The trip, which Mr. Pence cut short by a day to attend a national security meeting at home, was the latest example of the daunting task Mr. Trump’s surrogates face as they set out to modulate and interpret the president’s bellicose and impulsive remarks.

"A wide range of world leaders have condemned the violence in Charlottesville last weekend and sometimes sharply criticized President Trump, who said that some of the people marching with the white supremacist and neo-Nazi protesters were “very fine people.” Many of these countries are American allies who are no stranger to anti-Semitism and far-right violence. From Britain and Germany to Israel and Iran, here is what political leaders around the world have said in the aftermath of the clashes in Charlottesville. Prime Minister Theresa May criticized Mr. Trump on Wednesday for his contention that there were “very fine people” among both the protesters and counterprotesters who came to Charlottesville. Other leaders in her Conservative Party went further, including Sajid Javid, a member of Ms. May’s cabinet, and Ruth Davidson, the party’s leader in Scotland. Both were harsh in their criticism of the president. Chancellor Angela Merkel denounced the far-right groups who rallied in Charlottesville last weekend as “racist,” “horrifying” and “evil” in an interview with German media on Monday. "
"It is not just business executives who are moving away from President Trump after his remarks about neo-Nazis, white supremacists and protesters. The dancer and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, who will be honored by the Kennedy Center in December, announced on Thursday that she will forgo the related reception at the White House. “In light of the socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our current leadership is choosing to engage in, and in keeping with the principles that I and so many others have fought for, I will be declining the invitation to attend the reception at the White House,” Ms. de Lavallade, 86, said in a statement. Ms. de Lavallade took Alvin Ailey to his first dance class, and later appeared in ballets that he created for her, as well as others choreographed for her by Lester Horton, Glen Tetley, John Butler and Agnes de Mille. In her statement, she said that she was grateful to be recognized by the Kennedy Center, and that she still planned to attend the award ceremony there on Dec. 3. Her decision not to attend the White House reception — which is unusual — follows that of another of this year’s honorees, Norman Lear, the television producer known for his political activism, who has announced that he will forgo the reception. Representatives of Mr. Lear said Thursday that he still plans to skip the reception and accept the award. Another honoree, the singer Lionel Richie, told NBC’s “Today” show earlier this week that he would “play it by ear” as to what he would do about the Kennedy Center honors. "
"WASHINGTON — If President Trump is considering whether to fire Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, as has been rumored for weeks, Mr. Bannon just gave him several new reasons. In an interview published Wednesday by a liberal journalist, Mr. Bannon contradicted the president’s position on North Korea, bad-mouthed his colleagues in the administration, vowed to oust a female diplomat at the State Department and mocked Trump officials who fear the consequences of radically changing trade policy, saying they are “wetting themselves.” People close to Mr. Bannon said he believed the comments were part of an off-the-record conversation with Robert Kuttner with The American Prospect that, according to the magazine, he initiated. Still, they come as Mr. Bannon’s adversaries are aggressively seeking his ouster from the White House because of his links to Breitbart News, his feuding with other White House aides and a suspicion that he is the source of leaks about internal chaos inside the West Wing. Mr. Bannon’s critics intensified their efforts after last weekend’s racial unrest in Charlottesville, Va. Outraged over Mr. Trump’s insistence that “both sides” were to blame for the violence that erupted during a white nationalist rally, leaving one woman dead, human rights activists demanded that the president fire so-called nationalists working in the West Wing. That group of hard-right populists in the White House is led by Mr. Bannon. "
"A settlement in the lawsuit against two psychologists who helped devise the Central Intelligence Agency’s brutal interrogation program was announced on Thursday, bringing to an end an unusual effort to hold individuals accountable for the techniques the agency adopted after the Sept. 11 attacks. Lawyers for the three plaintiffs in the suit, filed in 2015 in Federal District Court in Spokane, Wash., said the former prisoners were tortured at secret C.I.A. detention sites. The settlement with the psychologists, Dr. Bruce Jessen and Dr. James Mitchell, came after a judge last month urged resolving the case before it headed to a jury trial in early September. The plaintiffs — two former detainees and the family of a third who died in custody — had sought unspecified punitive and compensatory damages. The terms of the settlement are confidential, and it is unclear whether a financial payout was involved. The parties agreed to a joint statement in which the psychologists said that they had advised the C.I.A. and that the plaintiffs had suffered abuses, but that they were not responsible. In a phone interview, one of the plaintiffs, Mohamed Ben Soud, said through a translator: “I feel that justice has been served. Our goal from the beginning was justice and for people to know what happened in this black hole that was run by the C.I.A.’s offices.” Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped bring the suit, called the case “a historic victory for our clients and for the rule of law.” "
"Spain was hit by its worst terrorist attack in more than a decade on Thursday, when a van driver plowed into dozens of people enjoying a sunny afternoon on one of Barcelona’s most famous thoroughfares, killing at least 13 people and leaving 80 bloodied on the pavement. Hours later, the Catalan police said they foiled a second vehicular attack, in the seaside town of Cambrils, 70 miles to the south, fatally shooting four people. A fifth died later of wounds, the police said. The suspects appeared to be wearing explosive belts, though these devices were later found to be fake, police said. Six civilians and one police officer were injured during the episode, the Catalan emergency services said. The Barcelona attack was at least the sixth time in the past few years that assailants using vehicles as deadly weapons have struck a European city. The police cordoned off the Plaza de Cataluña and Las Ramblas in the heart of Barcelona, both tourist destinations, and began a chaotic pursuit for the attackers. Three people were arrested, including a Moroccan man whose identification documents had been used to rent the van. The Barcelona police said none were believed to be the driver, who escaped on foot and remained at large. "
"WASHINGTON — Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s Supreme Court appointee, is scheduled to address a conservative group at the Trump International Hotel in Washington next month, less than two weeks before the court is set to hear arguments on Mr. Trump’s travel ban. Stephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University, questioned the justice’s decision to speak at the hotel, which is at issue in lower-court cases challenging the constitutionality of payments to Mr. Trump’s companies. “At this highly divisive political moment, especially as many Trump decisions are likely soon to reach the court’s docket, one just days later, a healthy respect for public confidence in the court should have led Justice Gorsuch to demur,” he said. Justice Gorsuch declined to comment, said Kathleen L. Arberg, the Supreme Court’s public information officer. Experts in legal ethics were divided about whether Justice Gorsuch’s appearance at the hotel was appropriate. Steven Lubet, a law professor at Northwestern University, said that Mr. Trump’s ownership interest in the hotel was problematic but that Justice Gorsuch’s appearance there was not. "
"When Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey goes on trial on federal corruption charges in less than three weeks, far more than his own fate hinges on the outcome. If Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, is convicted and then expelled from the United States Senate by early January, his replacement would be picked by Gov. Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey and an ally of President Trump. That scenario — where Mr. Menendez’s interim replacement would more than likely be a Republican — would have immediate and far-reaching implications: The Republicans would be gifted a crucial extra vote just as the party remains a single vote shy in the Senate of advancing its bill to dismantle President Obama’s signature health care law. Those potential consequences only heighten the drama around the first federal bribery charges leveled against a sitting senator in a generation. “This one vote, this one vote — if he’s convicted or does a plea deal — could change the course of history on Obamacare. It’s remarkable,” said Steve Lonegan, a New Jersey Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Senate three years ago. He added, “That’s a big ‘if.’” It’s enough to have Democrats anxious. “Many of us have a personal concern about Bob Menendez,” said Robert G. Torricelli, a former Democratic senator of New Jersey. “But there’s also an overriding concern about the Republicans’ strengthening their control in the Senate and, in the near term, being able to repeal Obamacare and 16 million people losing their health care.” Mr. Menendez stands accused of using his position to advance the interests of Dr. Salomon Melgen, a friend and political patron, in exchange for luxury vacations and hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign support.

"Carl Paladino, once a Republican candidate for governor of New York, was removed from the Buffalo school board on Thursday by the state education commissioner for revealing confidential information about collective bargaining negotiations with the city’s teachers union. In December, Mr. Paladino made national headlines for racist remarks about Barack and Michelle Obama that he sent a local publication called Artvoice. Asked in a survey what he’d like to see “go away in 2017,” Mr. Paladino said, among other things, that he would like to see Mrs. Obama “return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.” Days after the article was published, the school board adopted a resolution demanding that Mr. Paladino resign within 24 hours. In a move that came as little surprise to observers, he did not. The board went on to ask the State Education Department to remove him — but not for his inflammatory remarks. The board said he should lose his post because in a separate article he wrote for Artvoice he revealed confidential information about contract negotiations that had been discussed and approved in the fall. Mr. Paladino responded with a lawsuit that said the attempt to remove him was retaliation for his comments about the Obamas, a violation of his First Amendment rights. A wealthy real estate developer, Mr. Paladino shocked the state’s Republican Party by securing its nomination for governor in 2010. He ran against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as a fighter with salty disdain for political correctness, and a man who would take a baseball bat to the political establishment in Albany. Mr. Cuomo trounced Mr. Paladino on Election Day. "

"The “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that exploded into chaos and violence that culminated in the death of a 32-year-old woman, ended in a matter of hours. The onslaught of media reports about Saturday’s demonstration by white nationalists and its fallout, however, has stretched on for days. And there are few signs it will stop anytime soon. Indeed, some of the coverage itself has become news — or at least commanded the internet’s fleeting attention. There was a horrifying still photograph of the violence, a chilling documentary video, and of course, a series of defiant tweets from President Trump that continued into Thursday. And then there was Tuesday’s news conference — a combative give-and-take between the news media and Mr. Trump, which Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, described as “a moment that’s going to have a legacy.” “Trump has already forced several moments of reckoning on journalists,” Mr. Pope said. “What happened this weekend is another one of these seminal moments, another step in this very odd progression.” Taken together, the frenetic, disjointed ways the most striking media moments from Charlottesville and its aftermath unfolded and went viral — across many mediums and at lightning speed — seems emblematic of the way we consume news today.

"When Donald Trump first announced his presidential campaign, I, like most people, thought it would be a short-lived publicity stunt. A month later, though, I happened to catch one of his political rallies on C-Span. I was riveted. I supported the Republican in dozens of articles, radio and TV appearances, even as conservative friends and colleagues said I had to be kidding. As early as September 2015, I wrote that Mr. Trump was “the most serious candidate in the race.” Critics of the pro-Trump blog and then the nonprofit journal that I founded accused us of attempting to “understand Trump better than he understands himself.” I hoped that was the case. I saw the decline in this country — its weak economy and frayed social fabric — and I thought Mr. Trump’s willingness to move past partisan stalemates could begin a process of renewal. It is now clear that my optimism was unfounded. I can’t stand by this disgraceful administration any longer, and I would urge anyone who once supported him as I did to stop defending the 45th president. Far from making America great again, Mr. Trump has betrayed the foundations of our common citizenship. And his actions are jeopardizing any prospect of enacting an agenda that might restore the promise of American life. *** What, you may wonder, especially in the wake of Charlottesville, Va., did I possibly see in this candidate? Although crude and meandering for almost all of the primary campaign, Mr. Trump eschewed strict ideologies and directly addressed themes that the more conventional candidates of both parties preferred to ignore. Rather than recite paeans to American enterprise, he acknowledged that our “information economy” has delivered little wage or productivity growth. He was willing to criticize the bipartisan consensus on trade and pointed out the devastating effects of deindustrialization felt in many communities. He forthrightly addressed the foreign policy failures of both parties, such as the debacles in Iraq and Libya, and rejected the utopian rhetoric of “democracy promotion.” He talked about the issue of widening income inequality — almost unheard of for a Republican candidate — and didn’t pretend that simply cutting taxes or shrinking government would solve the problem.

"Whether it’s the heat you hate or the humidity, an armchair trip might help cure your summer doldrums. We recommend Antarctica — Ashley Shelby’s novel, “South Pole Station,” follows a painter’s adventures in the land of the penguins — or upstate New York, where the family at the center of J. Robert Lennon’s “Broken River” gets caught up in their new home’s not-quite-ghost story. Also on our list this week: Kamila Shamsie’s “Home Fire,” a powerful novel inspired by “Antigone”; Tom Perrotta’s first novel since “The Leftovers”; and Joshua Green’s deeply reported account of Steve Bannon’s alliance with Donald Trump. And if you’d rather really get away from it all, have a look at Robert Wright’s “Why Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment.” Radhika Jones
Editorial Director, Books HOME FIRE, by Kamila Shamsie. (Riverhead Books, $26.) Shamsie’s novel, longlisted for this year’s Man Booker Prize, is a bold retelling of Sophocles’ “Antigone” that follows the lives of three British siblings of Pakistani descent. It plays freely with Sophocles’ drama but hews to its themes: civil disobedience, fidelity and the law, especially as regards burial rights. Our critic Dwight Garner called it an “ingenious and love-struck” book that “builds to one of the most memorable final scenes I’ve read in a novel this century.” REFUGE, by Dina Nayeri. (Riverhead Books, $27.) Niloo, the protagonist of Nayeri’s novel, left Iran at 8 years old, along with her mother and brother. It was the last time she shared a home with her father. She has seen him just four times over the course of the last 22 years. The strains and indignities that come with remaking a life give Niloo’s story poignancy and relevance. Our critic Jennifer Senior said the novel “has the kind of immediacy commonly associated with memoir, which lends it heft, intimacy, atmosphere.” MRS. FLETCHER, by Tom Perrotta. (Scribner, $26.) Perrotta’s seventh novel — his first since 2011’s “The Leftovers” — succeeds in ways that will be pleasingly familiar to his admirers. The story of a divorced mother and her college-age son, both navigating the pursuit and pitfalls of sexual pleasure, it is the sweetest and most charming novel about pornography addiction and the harrowing issues of sexual consent that you will ever read. BROKEN RIVER, by J. Robert Lennon. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) This crafty, seductive novel, Lennon’s eighth, is not quite a ghost story, but it does involve a mysterious entity called the Observer. A budding novelist’s research into the unsolved murder that took place in the house where her family has moved attracts the attention of the killers. As the plot thickens, Lennon’s novel becomes a playful, sophisticated meditation on storytelling itself. SOUTH POLE STATION, by Ashley Shelby. (Picador, $26.) A painter spends a year at the South Pole as part of a National Science Foundation program in Shelby’s ramblingly entertaining first novel. The back stories of the ensemble cast provide a vivid notion of what it’s like to live in the dark, frigid landscape — one that heats up with the arrival of a climate-change denier. "
"WASHINGTON — Kara Young, a model who dated Donald J. Trump for two years before he married another model named Melania Knauss, remembers clearly bringing up her race with the real estate tycoon early in their relationship. As with so many issues, he steered the conversation to celebrity. “I didn’t hide my race from Donald Trump. He knew,” Ms. Young said in a rare interview. “He would say, ‘You’re like Derek Jeter.’ And I would say, ‘Exactly.’” “I never heard him say a disparaging comment towards any race of people,” she added. The furor that Mr. Trump has created with his equivocation over the violence this weekend at a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., has refocused attention on the president’s relationship with matters of race. Long before he embarked on his improbable political career, he had courted racial controversy, calling for the death penalty for five black and Latino teens who were later shown to have been wrongly convicted of a rape in Central Park, settling a Justice Department suit that charged the family business with housing discrimination and falsely accusing the nation’s first black president of being born in Kenya. Beyond dating a biracial woman, he made outsize efforts to hang out publicly with African-American celebrities: the boxing promoter Don King, the hip-hop impresarios Kanye West, Russell Simmons and Sean Combs, and celebrities as big as Muhammad Ali, James Brown and Michael Jackson. But more than ever, the question is being asked: Is Mr. Trump personally racist? The few African-Americans in his inner circle respond with an emphatic no. Most privately describe him as a 71-year-old man with fixed views and a cloistered history, raised in a heavily white enclave in Queens, who came of age and built a tower in the Manhattan sky when New York City was roiling with racial strife. “Just because you’re a nationalist and you’re white doesn’t make you a white nationalist,” said Katrina Pierson, an African-American who was a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. “Putting Americans first makes you a nationalist and in that case, I’m a nationalist. I think we should take care of our families and our children first.” "
"To the Editor: Ross Douthat’s column “An Elusive Immigration Compromise” (Aug. 6) and your editorial “A Senseless Immigration Proposal” (Aug. 7) disagree about the merits of the immigration reform bill introduced by Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia and endorsed by President Trump, but each defends its position in terms of a cost-benefit analysis. Cases made in these terms are tantamount to saying that our society should admit immigrants primarily, if not exclusively, for our own benefit. By contrast, some of us are convinced, either for religious or humanitarian reasons, that every person in deep physical or psychological need is morally entitled to whatever help we can reasonably give. Refugees and asylum seekers have a prima facie moral entitlement to that help. Unquestionably, we as a society are unable to satisfy all such valid claims, but that does not diminish the claims’ validity. We have an obligation to seek ways to increase our ability to take in more of these people, even if it is economically or emotionally costly for us to do so. BERNARD P. DAUENHAUER
MONTGOMERY, OHIO To the Editor: The Senate immigration bill that your editorial denounces is similar to what Barbara Jordan proposed while running a commission on immigration reform under President Bill Clinton. Contrary to your editorial, the bill would benefit low-wage American workers. Calculations from numbers from last year’s National Academy of Sciences study on immigration show that current mass immigration results in a transfer of nearly half a trillion dollars annually from low-wage American workers to business owners. The oversupply of low-skilled labor enables business owners to greatly reduce wages. Thus, while you claim that immigration as usual would grow the economy, you don’t mention the issue of who benefits and who loses: business owners and workers, respectively. You also don’t mention the National Academy of Sciences’ finding that low-skilled immigrants are a net fiscal burden, wiping out most of the economy’s gains, as George Borjas, a Harvard professor, wrote in these pages in February. Ironically, if the recommendations of Ms. Jordan’s commission had been followed, Donald Trump, who campaigned chiefly on an immigration crackdown, would have probably never gained the White House. DAVID C. HOLZMAN
LEXINGTON, MASS. To the Editor: Your editorial opposing President Trump’s endorsement of a bill that would slash immigration limits is slightly off the mark. It asserts that this endorsement, like his opposition to transgender people serving in the military and his encouragement of overly aggressive police behavior, is primarily aimed at recapturing his base. This conjures an image of the president deliberately formulating political strategy, and it is far from obvious that our president is capable of such rational action. To the contrary, I believe that our president is the genuine article — a genuine nativist, a genuine bigot, a genuine bully. Although his positions may be pleasing to his base, they are primarily, as it is said, Trump being Trump. ALAN STEVENS, BELLPORT, N.Y. "

"This was supposed to be a big week for infrastructure at the White House, in case you had not heard, and the person in charge was a builder who had weathered one of the great disasters to hit his hometown. Turned out he had other things on his mind, both then and now. After Hurricane Sandy caused mass destruction in the Northeast, Donald J. Trump, citizen of New York, immediately took to Twitter to do his part, recognizing that circumstances required him to relax a deadline. On the table was Mr. Trump’s claim that he would donate $5 million if President Obama released his college transcript and passport — part of the stack of so-called birther provocations that rose from the bogus theories that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Trump peddled those lies for five years, barging into the national political conversation. (Mr. Trump, by the way, had not given $5 million to charity out of his own pocket in the previous 20 years combined, by the estimate of The Washington Post’s David A. Fahrenthold.) Even at an hour of grave calamity, Mr. Trump did not want to surrender the pedestal he had built on a racial lie. More than 100 people had died; thousands of homes, along with hospitals, police and fire stations, water treatment plants, communication hubs and power generators had been wrecked or damaged. Among the places associated with his name (though not actually owned by Mr. Trump), The Trump SoHo New York hotel had no power for four days. Casinos in Atlantic City with the Trump name out front were shut down. Many people in three buildings called, at the time, Trump Place, part of the Riverside South development that was built above a filled-in lagoon, could not go to their jobs downtown. "
"WASHINGTON — The two top officers aboard a destroyer during a deadly collision off the coast of Japan in June were relieved of their duties on Friday, the Navy’s Seventh Fleet said. A number of other sailors were punished for their roles in the crash. The announcement followed the release of a harrowing preliminary report on the collision between the destroyer Fitzgerald and a freighter that killed seven people aboard the American ship. It was one of the Navy’s deadliest accidents in years. The ship’s captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; his second-in-command; and the senior enlisted sailor were relieved of their duties by the head of the Seventh Fleet in Japan, Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin. A statement from the fleet said “inadequate leadership” had contributed to the collision. The statement said a number of other sailors would face disciplinary action. A senior Navy officer said Thursday that about a dozen sailors in total would be punished, including all those on watch the night of June 17. The preliminary report described in detail the terrible moments after the collision and the rescue efforts aboard the ship. "

"“I know one wealthy person,” Robert Gangi, a longtime activist in criminal-justice reform, offered the other day. Mr. Gangi, a little-known Democratic contender in New York City’s mayoral contest, one whose result seems as assured as any in a race across a pond between Michael Phelps and a small, tired farm animal, has raised more than $80,000, though all but $14,000 of it has come from his own funds. According to the rules of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, a candidate seeking public matching funds must raise at least $250,000 from donors in New York to qualify for the money it distributes; Mr. Gangi, thus, has come up considerably short. Mayor Bill de Blasio, having raised $4.8 million, mostly through small donations, has not. Although almost no one imagines he will lose, he petitioned the board for public money regardless, successfully arguing that Mr. Gangi and another opponent, Sal Albanese, presented enough of a challenge that he should receive the near $2.6 million for which he was eligible. It is as if an heiress in the midst of a divorce demanded from the courts that her husband, a bartender, start paying her alimony. Before Mr. Gangi’s bid, one he is waging out of his rent-stabilized apartment on the Upper West Side, he served as executive director of the 173-year-old Corrections Association of New York and later as a founder of the Police Reform Organizing Project. Among other initiatives, PROP, as it is known, has sent volunteer monitors into criminal courts to examine and tally the impact of arrests for low-level offenses, most of which falls on black and Hispanic communities. Mr. Gangi has argued that as long as we keep policing quality-of-life crimes in accordance with the “broken windows” approach to law-enforcement, we are essentially criminalizing skin color. Although district attorneys around the city in recent weeks have dismissed hundreds of thousands of old warrants for low-level offenses, police officers maintain the discretion to continue to make those kinds of arrests. What does it mean for the mayor to denounce bigotry and hail the city’s progressive, embracing values, as he has done since the events in Charlottesville and repeatedly during the Trump era, without calling for a dismantling of “broken windows’’ altogether? Presumably, Mr. Gangi might have posed such a question to him in a debate, but a civic forum involving the two is one we are unlikely to witness. Created in the late 1980s as a response to the corruption scandals that had plagued the city, the Campaign Finance Board also sponsors debates and has required, since 1997, that anyone receiving its funds participates in them. The intent of the original stipulation was virtuous — that taxpayers should hear from the candidates who were receiving their money. But as it works now, someone who files paperwork for the matching-funds program but fails to raise enough money is not invited, which essentially silences anyone who is inadequately networked. Next week Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Albanese will debate each other, and Mr. Gangi will have to watch them on television. "
"Stocks plunged on Thursday as losses for Cisco Systems hurt technology companies and Walmart declined after its latest quarterly report. Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day. It was the second-worst day for stocks in a year of few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there were no specific signs of economic trouble on Thursday. The S.&P. 500 dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite index sank 123.20 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. William Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting last month signaled “a little bit of a change in tone,” and suggested that the central bank was becoming more cautious about raising interest rates. That helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, by preventing them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefit high-dividend stocks. Investors were also assessing the state of President Trump’s pro-business agenda as he continues to face criticism for his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday. Investors had hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would strengthen corporate profits. "
"LONDON — At London’s flagship modern art gallery, Tate Modern, one of this summer’s most lauded exhibitions features work by African-American artists made in the age of Martin Luther King Jr. Yet, while “Soul of a Nation” is nominally a historical display, gallery goers spilling out of the show this week found an obvious contemporary resonance to the art they had just seen. “There’s still a struggle, right?” said Chris Daley, a designer, in a reference to President Trump’s remarks this week on white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. “We’re still in a system where one part benefits from suppressing the other.” But though visitors to the exhibition were angered by Mr. Trump’s words, several did not see it as the turning point that it has perhaps been considered in some quarters of America. Mr. Daley, a 34-year-old Londoner, ran through a series of previous actions by Mr. Trump that he said had already highlighted the president’s position. There was the proposed wall on the Mexican border. The suggestion that some Mexican immigrants were rapists. “There’s a long list,” said Mr. Daley. “Nobody is really that surprised on this side of the pond because we’re on the outside looking in.” It is a sentiment that has been echoed in parts of the British and European commentariat. While there is plenty of outrage at Mr. Trump’s comments — Germany’s justice minister called the president’s reaction “unbearable” — many do not see this as the moment when a mask slipped. They feel it slipped some time ago. "
"North Korea is a true Orwellian society: The totalitarian government, currently led by Kim Jong-un, keeps its citizens disconnected from the internet and controls radio stations and newspapers, filling them with propaganda. The most minimal sign of dissent could land one in a concentration camp, as demonstrated by the case of Otto Warmbier, an American student held in North Korea for 17 months after he was charged with attempting to steal a propaganda poster. He returned to the United States this June in a coma, “unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands,” according to a statement from his parents; the 22-year-old died soon after. As tension between the two countries intensifies — President Trump has promised “fire and fury” should North Korea attempt an attack on the United States — below are two books that delve into the regime and life under Kim rule, while another makes policy suggestions for dealing with the nuclear threat. UNDER THE LOVING CARE OF THE FATHERLY LEADER
North Korea and the Kim Dynasty
by Bradley K. Martin
868 pp. Thomas Dunne/St. Martin’s. (2005) The Kim regime was established in 1948 by Kim Il-sung and inherited by his son Kim Jong-il, who ruled until his death in 2011, when his son Jong-un took over. This book, which took Martin 25 years to complete, draws on source material from China and Russia, as well as extensive interviews with defectors to paint a portrait of these two men. Kim Il-sung fought against the Japanese occupation in the 1930s, and came to power by creating a cult of personality that honored him as a deity. He was the country’s leading novelist, designer, philosopher and Ping-Pong trainer. North Koreans celebrated Kim’s birthday instead of Christmas, and he distributed gifts to children across the country like Santa Claus. Many genuinely revered him, but Martin argues that support has waned after his death in 1994. In his interviews, Martin learned that some North Koreans welcome the idea of a war; one defector says “people figure they will die of hunger or die in war. They’re prepared to die in a nuclear war.” THE AQUARIUMS OF PYONGYANG

"WASHINGTON — The nationwide push to dismantle Confederate memorials divided Congress’s most senior Democrats on Thursday, as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, pressed for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol while her Senate counterpart tried to keep the focus on President Trump’s equivocation over white nationalists. “The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,” Ms. Pelosi said, putting pressure on the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, to act. “If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, took a very different tack, saying that Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, were “trying to divert attention away from the president’s refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism and other forms of bigotry.” The division highlighted how delicate the political path forward might be for Democrats after the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., this past weekend. While large majorities of Americans say they disagree with the beliefs of white nationalists and the Ku Klux Klan, even Democratic voters are divided over the removal of Confederate memorials. The fate of those monuments has been the focus of attention around the country after the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, which protested the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a city park. "
"With a sweeping overhaul of the tax code on the horizon, two Senate Democrats believe this is the moment to broach the third rail of climate change policy: a carbon tax. The plan by the senators, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, to level a $49 per metric ton fee on greenhouse gas emissions is widely acknowledged as a long shot. But the lawmakers, along with climate activists and a cadre of conservative supporters, insist the tax reform is a way to create bipartisan support. The senators propose to use a portion of the estimated $2.1 trillion they anticipate in carbon tax revenue over the first 10 years to reduce the top marginal corporate tax income rate, something the White House has called for. They also hope to have an ally in President Trump’s economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who met in February with a prominent group of Republicans advocating a similar plan. No Republican lawmaker has signed on to the Senate measure. Mr. Trump, who routinely proclaims his affection for coal, during the presidential campaign flatly rejected via Twitter a suggestion that he might put a price on carbon pollution. The senators steering the effort admit they haven’t even broached a carbon tax directly with members of the administration, and the White House has distanced itself from the policy. Yet even the fiercest critics of a carbon tax say they can’t afford to dismiss the effort. “What is that Taylor Swift song? We are never, ever, ever getting back together? This is never, ever, ever going to happen,” said Grover Norquist, the anti-tax lobbyist and founder of Americans for Tax Reform. But, he added, the possibility of a carbon tax routinely re-emerges. “This time there is money for promoting that this idea might happen someday,” he said. Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, which promotes fossil fuels, agreed. “It’s so much revenue that it’s always going to be on the table and it’s always a threat,” he said. "

President Trump announced that he would dissolve two councils of business leaders after members left in protest over his defense of white nationalists. Top military leaders contradicted Mr. Trump, and some Republicans shunned him. (Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer defended him with secessionist rhetoric.)

"President Trump is rattling the rest of the world, too. Having scared a lot of people last week with his bombast over North Korea, causing jitters about nuclear war, he threatened on Friday to use force to quell chaos in Venezuela. That threat poured fuel on the worsening conflict between President Nicolás Maduro and his opponents. It also unsettled people across Latin America, which has suffered a long history of American intervention. It’s still not clear why Mr. Trump raised the subject of Venezuela in a discussion with reporters about North Korea, or what precisely he meant when he said, “We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.” Still, it seemed like another instance of reckless militaristic swagger by a president whose “America First” campaign rejected foreign entanglements, yet who in seven months has carried out the country’s first missile strikes against Syrian forces and has expanded counterterrorism operations in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. He is also considering sending more troops to Afghanistan. Venezuela, with possibly the world’s largest oil reserves, had a chance to become one of South America’s leading democracies. Mr. Maduro turned the country into an economic basket case and himself into a dictator. He modeled himself on his left-wing predecessor, Hugo Chávez, with excessive public spending that, coupled with mismanagement and falling oil prices, was unsustainable. The inflation rate for 2017 is estimated at 720 percent, and it is believed that 80 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, some suffering from malnutrition and full-scale hunger. More than 120 people have died in several months of protests demanding Mr. Maduro’s removal. Some analysts fear outright civil war. In this environment, Mr. Trump’s threat of military action is a lifeline for Mr. Maduro. Like other Venezuelan leaders, Mr. Maduro has used the United States to rally his people, often with specious warnings of American plots to invade. On Monday, thousands of government supporters rallied in Caracas to support Mr. Maduro and denounce Mr. Trump’s “military option.” Regional leaders also responded to his threat. Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, said on Sunday, “The possibility of a military intervention shouldn’t even be considered.” The episode appears to have set back the progress made by President Barack Obama, who strengthened ties with South America by working cooperatively to resolve regional disputes. Vice President Mike Pence, on a trip to the region, attempted to calm the outrage, saying in Buenos Aires on Tuesday that he was confident about reaching a “peaceable” solution for Venezuela through economic and diplomatic pressure on Mr. Maduro. But Mr. Pence also told NBC News on Monday, “We’re simply not going to tolerate seeing Venezuela collapse into dictatorship.” The precipitous decline of Venezuela is not just a tragedy for its people, but a threat to regional stability. Mr. Trump should continue to toughen sanctions, but any lasting solution will be achieved only in concert with regional leaders. "
"Donald Trump is still president. Hard to know what to do with this, people. In less than a week he’s managed to put on one of the most divisive, un-helpful, un-healing presidential performances in American history. It’s been a great stretch for fans of Richard Nixon and James Buchanan. On Wednesday Trump had to dissolve his business advisory councils because the C.E.O.s were fleeing like panic-stricken geese from a jumbo jet. We now have a president who can’t get the head of Campbell Soup to the White House. Trump also announced plans to hold a rally next week in Arizona, where he’s said he’s “seriously considering” a pardon for former sheriff Joe Arpaio, the loathsome racial profiler who never met a constitutional amendment he didn’t ignore. Arpaio’s treatment of Latinos won him a criminal contempt conviction, but of course that’s nothing to our leader. We had no idea how bad this guy was going to be. Admit it — during the campaign you did not consider the possibility that if a terrible tragedy struck the country involving all of our worst political ghosts of the past plus neo-Nazism, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz would know the appropriate thing to say but Donald Trump would have no idea. George W. Bush would have been at the funeral for the slain civil rights demonstrator in a second. About the best Trump could do was to praise Heather Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, for writing “the nicest things” about him. Bro did indeed express appreciation for the president’s denunciation of “those who promote violence and hatred.” That was his written-by-someone-else statement, which preceded the despicable impromptu version. We’re only safe when he’s using prepared remarks. The extemporaneous Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville wasn’t just tone-deaf and heartless; you had to wonder about the overall mental balance of a man who managed to both defend the alt-right demonstrators in Virginia and brag about his real estate in the neighborhood.

"I’ve been haunted by a story from Iran that appeared in The Times back in May. It described a campaign for the Tehran City Council by Payam Mohebi, a veterinarian who explained that he was running “for the animals.” The clerics in Iran regard dogs as impure, and it’s against the law to have one. Dog owners who defy the ban are subject to a fine, 60 lashes and the possible execution of their pet. Dr. Mohedi’s campaign poster showed him with a stray dog. That was gutsy (he lost the race), but what has stuck with me is what he had to say to Thomas Erdbrink, The Times’s Tehran bureau chief, about the city’s elected leadership: “We have one million pets in this city — what are they thinking? There is a massive gap between our politicians and us.” The image of a government as disconnected as that from the will of the people it purports to serve should leave us shaking our heads in sympathy and dismay. But look in the mirror: The image that reflects back is our own. Millions of Americans oppose repeal of the Affordable Care Act; in one poll in late June, only 12 percent supported the Senate Republican plan then pending. A separate poll that month found that overall support for the existing law had passed the 50 percent mark for the first time, probably because of increased public appreciation of its benefits and the consequences of doing away with the law. And yet the Congress of the United States spent months doing almost nothing else but trying different ways to strip people of their health coverage. What were they thinking? O.K., in fairness, the Senate has devoted time to confirming President Trump’s judicial nominees, some of dubious merit. Last month, on a party-line vote of 51 to 47, the Senate confirmed a Kentucky lawyer, John K. Bush, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Under the pseudonym G. Morris, Judge Bush was a regular blogger on a conservative site called Elephants in the Bluegrass, on which he shared his opinion that Roe v. Wade was one of “the two greatest tragedies in our country”; the other was the Dred Scott case, the decision that denied American citizenship to slaves. The Senate has been slower to approve another Trump nominee, Damien Schiff, a staff lawyer for the right-wing Pacific Legal Foundation nominated to the United States Court of Federal Claims, perhaps because on his own blog he called Justice Anthony M. Kennedy a “judicial prostitute.” "
"The American Civil Liberties Union has a long history of defending the First Amendment rights of groups on both the far left and the far right. This commitment led the organization to successfully sue the city of Charlottesville, Va., last week on behalf of a white supremacist rally organizer. The rally ended with a Nazi sympathizer plowing his car into a crowd, killing a counterprotester and injuring many. After the A.C.L.U. was excoriated for its stance, it responded that “preventing the government from controlling speech is absolutely necessary to the promotion of equality.” Of course that’s true. The hope is that by successfully defending hate groups, its legal victories will fortify free-speech rights across the board: A rising tide lifts all boats, as it goes. While admirable in theory, this approach implies that the country is on a level playing field, that at some point it overcame its history of racial discrimination to achieve a real democracy, the cornerstone of which is freedom of expression. I volunteered with the A.C.L.U. as a law student in 2011, and I respect much of its work. But it should rethink how it understands free speech. By insisting on a narrow reading of the First Amendment, the organization provides free legal support to hate-based causes. More troubling, the legal gains on which the A.C.L.U. rests its colorblind logic have never secured real freedom or even safety for all. For marginalized communities, the power of expression is impoverished for reasons that have little to do with the First Amendment. Numerous other factors in the public sphere chill their voices but amplify others. Most obviously, the power of speech remains proportional to wealth in this country, despite the growth of social media. When the Supreme Court did consider the impact of money on speech in Citizens United, it enabled corporations to translate wealth into direct political power. The A.C.L.U. wrongly supported this devastating ruling on First Amendment grounds. "
"The American Civil Liberties Union was under severe duress. Hate mail poured in, death threats, and the executive director was spat on. That moment, 40 years ago, fought over a planned rally by a small group of neo-Nazis in Skokie, Ill., would become one of the organization’s most notable cases, and to some, among its finest moments. The A.C.L.U. cemented its reputation for fighting for civil liberties, even, or especially, if it meant, in the words of its director at the time, “defending my enemy.” That philosophy came into renewed focus last week as the organization went to court to fight for the right of white nationalists to hold a rally at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Va. But the episode is likely to be remembered less for the constitutional principle than for its violent toll: brawls, ugly confrontations and the death of a 32-year-old woman. “I won’t be a fig leaf for Nazis,” a member of the A.C.L.U. of Virginia board, Waldo Jaquith, posted on Twitter, announcing that he was resigning from the organization. Among his parting messages to the organization was, “Don’t defend Nazis to allow them to kill people.” "
"Donald Trump chose Trump Tower, the place where he began his presidential campaign, as the place to plunge a dagger into his presidency. Trump’s jaw-dropping defense of white supremacists, white nationalists and Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., exposed once more what many of us have been howling into the wind since he emerged as a viable candidate: That he is a bigot, a buffoon and a bully. He has done nothing since his election to disabuse us of this notion and everything to confirm it. Anyone expressing surprise is luxuriating in a self-crafted shell of ignorance. And yet, it seems too simplistic, too convenient, to castigate only Trump for elevating these vile racists. To do so would be historical fallacy. Yes, Trump’s comments give them a boost, grant them permission, provide them validation, but it is also the Republican Party through which Trump burst that has been courting, coddling and accommodating these people for decades. Trump is an articulation of the racists in Charlottesville and they are an articulation of him, and both are a logical extension of a party that has too often refused to rebuke them. It’s not that Democrats have completely gotten this right, either. Too often, in response to the conservative impulse to punish, the liberal impulse is to pity. Pity does not alleviate oppression; it simply assuages guilt. The pity is not for the receiver but for the giver. But in the modern age one party has operated with the ethos of racial inclusion and with an eye on celebrating varied forms of diversity, and the other has at times appealed directly to the racially intolerant by providing quiet sufferance.

"HONG KONG — Carrots or sticks? Aid or sanctions? Engagement or containment? American attempts to counter North Korea’s nuclear program did not begin last week when President Trump promised to unleash “fire and fury” against the isolated government. For decades, Mr. Trump’s predecessors have waded into the diplomatic mire, trying to threaten or cajole North Korea’s ruling family into abandoning the country’s weapons programs. Each failed. North Korea, which conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, has detonated five test bombs and is expected to explode a sixth. Since 1993, the country has also launched a series of missiles, improving their distance, accuracy and lethality each year. Despite the North’s weapons tests and its bellicose bluster, the country has occasionally signaled a willingness to talk. The early 1990s brought the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war. North Korea threatened to withdraw from the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and begin to reprocess plutonium — both of which it eventually did. In 1993, the North launched a missile capable of hitting Japan. Former President Jimmy Carter went to negotiate with Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader, against the wishes of President Bill Clinton. The deal, which Mr. Carter struck and Mr. Clinton would eventually agree to soon after Kim’s death, amounted to a generous offer. President Clinton promised to lift decades-old sanctions, supply the North with 500,000 tons of oil a year and provide $4 billion in aid to construct a light-water reactor capable of producing nuclear energy but not weapons. In exchange for the reactor and oil, the North would end its weapons program and close — but not dismantle — the Yongbyon complex. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. All the major late-night shows on Wednesday continued denouncing President Trump’s defense of the right-wing protesters in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend. James Corden pounced on Mr. Trump after chief executives resigned en masse from two presidential councils, leading Mr. Trump to disband the advisory groups altogether. The way Seth Meyers sees it, Mr. Trump was using questions about the future of the chief White House strategist Steve Bannon to build intrigue in the news media. Mr. Meyers then took a look at the Twitter messages that Mr. Trump had posted in response to the departures of business leaders. Stephen Colbert said that Mr. Trump was not being unclear with his statements to reporters this week, he was deliberately professing his affinity for white nationalism. Mr. Colbert quoted from a report that Mr. Trump felt “liberated” after delivering his news conference. "
"Stanford, Calif. — California faces serious risks from climate change. Some are already being felt, like the severe heat this summer and recent episodes of extremely low snowpack in the mountains, which the state depends on for much of its water. Those are among the key messages in a new climate science report now under review in the White House. The good news is that California has been working hard to catch up with the climate change that has already happened, and to get ahead of what is still to come. The past five years have painted a clear picture of what is in store for California, according to numerous scientific studies that underpin the new assessment: Rising temperatures will bring more frequent and severe hot spells, intensifying heat stress; more precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, increasing storm water runoff; snow that does fall will melt earlier in the year, leaving less for the warm, dry season; and more moisture will be drawn out of soils and vegetation, increasing stress on crops and ecosystems. All of this will lead to more frequent and severe water deficits, punctuated by wet periods with increasing flood risk. Add rising sea levels, more extensive flooding during storm surges and the acidification of the coastal ocean, and California faces a phalanx of climate-related dangers to human health, agriculture, industry, economic productivity, and terrestrial and marine ecosystems. As the new report makes clear, California is not the only state facing such risks. However, California has been particularly ambitious in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience in the face of climate change uncertainty. The state’s hard work over the past two decades has yielded several lessons for cities, states and countries that face intensifying climate-related stresses. The first is that it is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also enjoying a thriving economy. Since 2001, California’s economy has grown, while its greenhouse gas emissions have fallen. The state recently renewed its landmark cap-and-trade program, which limits total statewide emissions while allowing a marketplace to determine the price polluters must pay. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. "
"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Upset by policies on immigration and climate change and by President Trump’s initial response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., the leaders of some of the country’s biggest companies began to drop one by one from presidential advisory councils. Then Mr. Trump again equated far-right hate groups with the groups protesting them. On Wednesday morning, chief executives moved to cut ties with the president who rose to fame as a businessman. On today’s episode: Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist for The Times, discusses the president’s relationship with American business leaders. Background reading: • With the collapse of the business councils, Mr. Trump has all but lost his most natural constituency — the corporate leaders who stood to benefit from his agenda of lower taxes and lighter regulation.

"WASHINGTON — There is no annulling this marriage. For several weeks, congressional Republicans have grown more brazen, inch by careful inch, in creating a measure of distance from President Trump. Perhaps he should not declare war on the face of a female host of “Morning Joe,” they have suggested, or antagonize Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader straining to usher Mr. Trump’s agenda through the Capitol. More recently, they have allowed that when a president’s words give heart to neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, it is probably not ideal. Yet this fever dream of an era in Washington — where identifying as anti-Nazi has become grist for an executive-bucking profile in courage — has obscured a longer-term truth about the relationship between Mr. Trump and his ostensible allies in conservative policy making: For now, and almost certainly for much longer, they are stuck with each other. For one, much of the Republican base stands with Mr. Trump, rejecting criticisms of his equivocations about white supremacists and insisting that protest groups on the left are at least as insidious. For another, the president still has a pen — deployed too infrequently to date for elected officials who would prefer to have more to run on next year than a series of post office dedications. “If Republicans want to be in the majority, it’s not a question of sticking from Trump, it’s a question of accomplishing things,” Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said in a phone interview, driving away from a town hall-style forum this week in Ada, Okla. “And most of those things require a presidential signature.” "
"PHOENIX — The tweet landed without warning or elaboration, just days before a presidential visit to Arizona: In the early hours of Thursday, President Trump, not for the first time, savaged Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, calling him “toxic” and “WEAK,” hailing Mr. Flake’s primary challenger and drawing fierce pushback from fellow Republicans. By tiptoeing to the edge of endorsing Kelli Ward, a far-right former state senator, over an incumbent Republican, Mr. Trump further roiled a state and region already badly shaken by his campaign and its aftermath. Well before Mr. Trump’s rise, a pair of Western states — Arizona and Nevada — foreshadowed some of the consuming clashes of his presidency, over the definition of conservatism and the struggle for power between diverse, booming cities and far-flung rural precincts. But both states have emerged anew this year as a defining battleground for both parties, in no small part because of Mr. Trump’s thirst for vengeance against Republicans who have crossed him. In Nevada, Senator Dean Heller, who made a great show of denouncing an early effort by Republicans to repeal the federal health care law, drew a primary contest last week from Danny Tarkanian, a frequent political candidate who has branded himself a cheerleader for the White House. In Arizona, which Mr. Trump plans to visit Tuesday, there is Mr. Flake, who shunned Mr. Trump in 2016 and recently published a book denouncing his political worldview, alongside a fellow Republican, Senator John McCain, a biting critic of the president who cast the deciding vote to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. McCain swiftly went to his colleague’s defense Thursday after Mr. Trump’s tweet. Calling Mr. Flake a “principled legislator,” Mr. McCain said in a tweet: “Our state needs his leadership now more than ever.” "
"WASHINGTON — Despite ongoing rebukes over his defense of white supremacists, President Trump defiantly returned to his campaign’s nativist themes on Thursday. He lamented an assault on American “culture,” revived a bogus, century-old story about killing Muslim extremists and attacked Republicans with a renewed vigor. Hours after a terrorist attack in Spain, Mr. Trump recalled a debunked event in which Gen. John J. “Black Jack” Pershing supposedly killed Muslim rebels in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in the blood of pigs, which Muslims are forbidden to eat. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in Barcelona, where the driver of a van crashed into a busy tourist boulevard, killing 13. “Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,” Mr. Trump tweeted, spreading a mythical story even as he again accused the news media of being “Fake News” in another tweet. “There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!” As when he trafficked in the same unproven legend during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump ignored the conclusions of historians, who repeatedly have said it did not happen. Additionally, his claim that Pershing ended terrorism in the Philippines for 35 years is refuted by the violence that continued for decades after the rebellion that ended in 1913. Mr. Trump also appeared in peril of losing support from key Republicans he will need to advance his agenda in Congress. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, questioned the president’s “stability,” and Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, declared Mr. Trump’s moral authority is “compromised.” Mr. Corker, a sober voice on foreign policy and a frequent ally of the Trump administration, bluntly questioned the president’s ability to perform the duties of his office.

"Nadia Murad was 21 years old when, she says, Islamic State fighters abducted her, beat her and raped her. Her offense: belonging to the minority Yazidi community, whom the Islamic State regards as infidels. Her cause for the last two years: demanding justice for the Islamic State’s atrocities. This week, Ms. Murad clinched a small, but important victory. Her country, Iraq, agreed to let the Security Council appoint a panel of independent investigators to gather evidence of the most serious crimes committed by the Islamic State, and not just those against Yazidis. Lacking that, the Security Council would have had to adopt a resolution to create such a panel. Still to be resolved is where and how those crimes will be prosecuted, and how to make sure those trials are credible and not displays of victor’s justice. Ms. Murad’s quest poses an acute test for the promise of international justice, born from the ashes of Nazi genocide 70 years ago, after World War II. If the most powerful countries in the world cannot hold accountable those who are accused of enslaving women for sex, beheading their perceived enemies, turning children into suicide bombers and carrying out what an international panel believes could be an act of genocide against the Yazidi people, what is the very notion of international justice good for? The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is accused of some of the gravest crimes known to humanity, and not only against the Yazidis. It does not have powerful countries defending it, as does say, the government of Syria, which also stands accused of a raft of war crimes. "
"The business elite has deserted President Trump’s advisory panels in drastic fashion. Now many of them are wondering whether Gary D. Cohn, the White House official whom they see as their man in the administration, will also jump ship. Mr. Cohn, the White House’s top economic adviser, looked uncomfortable standing next to Mr. Trump during the news conference on Tuesday in which the president defended white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Cohn, who is Jewish, was “disgusted” and “deeply upset” by Mr. Trump’s comments, according to several people close to him. But he hasn’t expressed his views publicly. And White House aides denied that he was planning to quit, even as the president disbanded two economic advisory councils as chief executives abandoned them. Perhaps that is because Mr. Cohn has other goals? He is said to be the leading contender to head the Federal Reserve when Janet L. Yellen’s term expires in February. And he appears determined to press forward with his portion of the Trump economic agenda: After the news conference, Mr. Cohn told reporters that the White House planned to focus on a tax overhaul in the fall and that he believed it could be in place by the end of the year. But Mr. Cohn is under pressure on multiple fronts. Others in the business world have questioned how long he can continue on the panel without irrevocably damaging his reputation, Reuters and CNBC reported. And he is locked in a battle with populists in the Trump administration. The White House’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, told The American Prospect: “We’re still fighting. There’s Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.” "
"SYDNEY, Australia — Australia’s Senate is rowdy and raucous, and often compared to a schoolyard. But after the leader of the anti-immigrant One Nation party walked into the chamber on Thursday wearing a burqa, the room went silent. Then came the stunned responses: “oh” and “what on earth.” The party leader, Pauline Hanson, took her seat as political rivals watched astounded. Senators from her party laughed. Removing the garment, Ms. Hanson, who is not Muslim, said that the burqa, a full-body and face covering, should be banned in Australia. She said that she wore the veil to draw attention to her party’s push to ban full-face coverings in public. “I’m quite happy to remove this because this is not what should belong in this Parliament,” she said as the Senate met during parliamentary sitting week, in which lawmakers debate legislation and other matters. In a speech in the chamber last year, Ms. Hanson said that Australia was “in danger of being swamped by Muslims.” A recent report from the Trump administration referred to Ms. Hanson in listing her party as a threat to religious freedom.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • A widening gap. President Trump said today that it was “foolish” to remove symbols of the Confederacy, adding that U.S. culture was being “ripped apart.” Mr. Trump’s insistence that left-wing counterprotesters were as culpable as neo-Nazis and white supremacists for last weekend’s violence in Charlottesville, Va., has divided his core supporters from Republican leaders, who fear lasting damage to their party. Chief executives who planned to announce a mass defection from presidential advisory panels were pre-empted by Mr. Trump, who dissolved the two councils. Here’s what the executives are saying. After the president’s news conference on Tuesday, his aides described themselves as stunned, despondent and numb. But they also said Mr. Trump felt liberated. • The Confederate state of America. The violence in Charlottesville took place at a demonstration against the proposed removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The Pacific has been gobbling up the California coast with growing voraciousness. A study this year by the United States Geological Survey predicted that as much as two thirds of Southern California’s beaches could be lost by the end of the century. Among the variables, said Patrick Barnard, a geologist and author of the report, are rising seas and intensified storms, both linked to climate change, as well as hundreds of river dams that are blocking the flow of sand to beaches. It all spells trouble for buildings and homes perched along the shore. The peril grew vivid last year in Pacifica, a seaside city just south of San Francisco. Widely shared drone footage showed apartment buildings poised at the edge of a cliff as mounds of dirt crumbled from its face and into the ocean. The structures were declared uninhabitable and torn down. In Big Sur this year, erosion accelerated by the wet winter knocked out a bridge and sent cascades of mud tumbling onto Highway 1. "
