"Must a New York City condominium forever bear the name T-R-U-M-P in large, brasslike letters? Or can it choose to take them down in favor, perhaps, of what a majority of residents believe is a more dignified name, 200 Riverside Boulevard, its simple street address? That is the question before a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan as part of a heated legal battle between the condominium’s board and DJT Holdings, a corporate entity owned by President Trump. There was a time in New York City and beyond when developers and businesses proudly emblazoned the Trump name on their residential buildings, hotels, steaks and water. But since Mr. Trump was elected president, a small countertrend has emerged. T-R-U-M-P letters have been peeled off three rental buildings also on Riverside Boulevard, as well as hotels in SoHo and Toronto. The Trump name was also excised from the now-defunct Taj Mahal casino on the Atlantic City boardwalk, but that happened at Mr. Trump’s insistence. The embattled condominium is part of a development that stretches from 59th to 72nd Street along the West Side, known variously as Riverside South and Trump Place. Mr. Trump bought the property, a former rail yard, in the 1980s, but with his business in distress, he ended up selling it to a group of Hong Kong billionaires who, with his help, developed it. The Trump name was cemented in place by a four-page licensing agreement, signed in 2000. It described Mr. Trump as a “worldwide renowned builder and developer of real estate who enjoys the highest reputation in these fields among others,” but set only a modest value on the use of his name: $1. Not payable monthly or even annually, but $1 in total. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/nyregion/trump-place-manhattan-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=67
"WASHINGTON — In a notable back flip, the Trump administration has decided that maybe the Obama administration was right in its efforts to change the way doctors and hospitals are paid under Medicare. The Trump administration said late Tuesday that it was starting a Medicare payment model very similar to the ones it canceled and curtailed last year. The Obama administration devised the earlier projects using authority in the Affordable Care Act. In the new program, as described by Trump appointees, Medicare will make a single “bundled payment” for nearly all the services provided in a 90-day period to certain Medicare patients who are admitted to a hospital or have certain outpatient medical procedures. Health care providers can receive a bonus if they hold Medicare spending for these patients below a target set by the government, and they may have to repay the government if Medicare spending for them exceeds the target. Tom Price, the first secretary of health and human services under President Trump, accused the Obama administration of trying to “commandeer clinical decision making” by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for care. Participation in the new project is voluntary. Medicare has traditionally paid a separate fee for each service. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the new bundled payments were “an important step in the move away from fee-for-service and toward paying for value.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/us/politics/medicare-trump-administration-obamacare.html?searchResultPosition=60
"WASHINGTON — Canada has filed a sweeping trade case against the United States at the World Trade Organization, lobbing a diplomatic grenade at the Trump administration’s “America First” approach amid an increasingly embattled trade relationship between the longstanding North American allies. The trade case could exacerbate tensions between the two nations, which have frayed in recent months as the countries wrestle with trade disputes and attempts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada’s case challenges the United States’ use of tariffs to punish unfair trade practices and protect its markets, saying those actions violate World Trade Organization rules. The case could expand into a multinational trade dispute given that Canada, a champion of global agreements, filed it in a way that allows other countries to join. The 37-page document outlines numerous problematic trade actions that it says the United States has taken against China, South Korea, Japan and Germany. The case, which was filed on Dec. 20 and made public on Wednesday, centers on the punitive tariffs that the United States imposes when it finds other countries guilty of subsidizing their products or of selling them abroad at unfairly low prices, a practice known as dumping. The United States has lost cases in the World Trade Organization over this system, which differs substantially from that of many countries. Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, called Canada’s action “a broad and ill-advised attack” on the American trade system. “U.S. trade remedies ensure that trade is fair by counteracting dumping or subsidies that are injuring U.S. workers, farmers and manufacturers,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “Canada’s claims are unfounded and could only lower U.S. confidence that Canada is committed to mutually beneficial trade.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/us/politics/canada-us-tariffs-wto.html?searchResultPosition=61
"If there has been any benefit from Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, it’s that it has raised awareness about President Vladimir Putin’s broader threat to democracies in Europe and elsewhere. In the face of complacency from Republicans fearful of what attention to these intrigues might reveal about the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have issued a report that appears to be the most comprehensive public accounting of Russia’s war on the West. It drives home the point that the 2016 election, which every American intelligence agency has said involved Russian interference to help elect Donald Trump, is part of a pattern in which Mr. Putin has worked to erode Western institutions and undermine faith in democratic practices. Few countries in Europe have escaped his malign intrusions. The report should serve as an alert for the United States to work urgently with its allies to protect democracy. There is a significant impediment, however, and that is President Trump and the congressional leaders who enable him. Mr. Trump persists in his bizarre fascination with Mr. Putin and refuses to acknowledge that Russia poses a security threat, even though his own recently released national security strategy says Russia, along with China, seeks to “challenge American influence, values and wealth.” Republicans in Congress have expressed more concern about those who revealed Russia’s meddling than about the meddling, and have done nothing to ensure it cannot be repeated. According to the report, the Kremlin is spending far more on foreign propaganda outlets, and on nongovernmental groups and political parties opposed to the European Union and NATO. It enlisted organized crime groups to launder money and commit other crimes, and used its control of energy supplies to spread corruption, the report said.

"PHILADELPHIA — It is not difficult to find an all-male panel at the annual January mega-gathering of American economists. They are as common as PowerPoint presentations and pie charts. One such panel this year met to sleepily critique President Trump’s economic policies, but it was overshadowed by another panel, two ballrooms away, that jolted a profession that prides itself on cool rationality. That panel on Friday was stocked with women, each of whom presented new research that revealed a systemic bias in economics and presaged a move by the field’s leaders to promise to address some of those issues. Paper after paper presented at the American Economic Association panel showed a pattern of gender discrimination, beginning with barriers women face in choosing to study economics and extending through the life cycle of their careers, including securing job opportunities, writing research papers, gaining access to top publications and earning proper credit for published work. Economics departments have gradually increased their share of female faculty members over the past 20 years. But only one in five tenure-track economics professors is a woman, according to the American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. In many parts of the profession, gender progress stagnated over the last decade. About one in three new economics doctoral students was a woman in 2016, and fewer than one in three assistant professors were women. In both of those cases, the share of women was essentially unchanged from 2006. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/us/politics/women-economics.html?searchResultPosition=64
"Egypt’s prosecutor general has ordered a criminal investigation over a New York Times article that described a covert effort by Egyptian intelligence to sway public opinion in favor of accepting President Trump’s decision recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The article “undermines Egypt’s security and public peace, and harms the country’s public interest,” the prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, said in a statement. The investigation comes after a torrent of furious commentary in Egypt’s pro-government media and in Parliament, where lawmakers denounced the article, published online on Saturday, as part of an international conspiracy to embarrass Egypt. Egypt officially supports a future Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. But The Times reported that Egypt, along with other Arab nations, had quietly acquiesced to Mr. Trump’s decision last month to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and to move the U.S. Embassy there. Mostafa el-Gendy, a lawmaker, said of The Times: “They are truly at war with Egypt, and are seeking to bring down the nation, not just the state or the president.” The Times quoted leaked audio recordings of an intelligence officer, Capt. Ashraf al-Kholi, coaching several talk-show hosts, as well as a prominent actress, about how to persuade their audiences to accept the American position on Jerusalem.

"Barely 12 months into the churn of the Trump presidency, when a week can be as eventful as a year, David Frum has published his new book aware of the perils he faces. “My choice of timing imposes on this project many risks of error and misunderstanding,” he concedes on the first page of “Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic.” There’s still plenty of time until the next presidential election for Trump and his sentries to do more: more fulminating, more tweeting, more back-stabbing, more enabling. “But if it’s potentially embarrassing to speak too soon,” Frum writes, “it can also be dangerous to wait too long.” If this sounds a bit much as justification for a release date, it’s worth remembering that the neoconservative Frum, once a speechwriter for George W. Bush, was an early and ardent supporter of the Iraq war. Neocons don’t like to wait. But Frum purports to offer more than a rushed assessment of the last year. After all, he says, President Trump is not a cause but a symptom. Like another new book, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt’s “How Democracies Die,” “Trumpocracy” is, in part, an exploration of the reasons for the president’s electoral upset and the roots of his rule. Trump, Frum writes, “did not create the vulnerabilities he exploited.” Despite sterling conservative credentials — helping Bush coin the phrase “axis of evil”; co-writing “An End to Evil” with Richard Perle (evil being even more loathed than waiting) — Frum was developing a reputation as a Republican dissenter before the election of 2016 put him in full Never Trump mode, when he held his nose and voted for Hillary Clinton. (This was a real sacrifice, considering he deemed Clinton “a suspicious and vindictive personality.”) As a columnist at The Atlantic, Frum has spent the past year excoriating the president and the Republican Party as a toxic mix of hot heads in the White House and lily livers in Congress. “The worse Trump behaved, the more frantically congressional Republicans worked to protect him,” he writes in “Trumpocracy.” The government has “imported the spirit of thuggery, crookedness and dictatorship into the very core of the American state.” While the populace (or audience) gets swept along by the daily gusts of gossip and palace intrigues, Frum wants to direct our ire at all those mild-mannered functionaries who have allowed “this new regime of deceit and brutishness” to take hold.

"BRUSSELS — A Belgian official’s decision to expel several Sudanese migrants late last year — several of whom say they were tortured when they went back home — has roiled Belgium’s politics, reflecting not only the fraught migration debate in Western Europe but also the divisions that have made the country notoriously difficult to govern. The official, Theo Francken, is a 39-year-old Flemish nationalist who in 2014 was appointed secretary of state for asylum and migration. He is known for making incendiary comments about migrants; in September, he apologized for using the term “cleaning up” about a police operation in which several undocumented immigrants were arrested. The term was condemned as xenophobic. Supporters and critics alike have called Mr. Francken “the Flemish Trump.” Last September, Mr. Francken invited several Sudanese officials to Belgium to review the cases of dozens of Sudanese people who were in the country without authorization. The decision outraged advocates for the migrants, who pointed to Sudan’s abysmal human rights record and the fact that its president, Omar al-Bashir, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for trial on war crimes and genocide charges. Representatives of the Belgian government were present during most of the interviews, but were not always accompanied by Arabic-language interpreters, raising the possibility that they did not follow all of what was said. Lawyers for the migrants said the Sudanese officials warned that if the migrants applied for asylum in Belgium but were denied and sent home, they would be targeted for abuse. Nine Sudanese were subsequently sent home, and accounts quickly surfaced that at least three of them, from the violence-prone Darfur and South Kordofan regions, were abused. The accounts appeared in the Belgian media and in interviews conducted by the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington-based think tank. In the interviews, the men said they had been detained, interrogated, threatened with persecution, and beaten or even tortured.

"China’s wherewithal to play rough in a trade war with the United States is not as strong as it looks. Beijing is mulling whether to slow or halt purchases of United States Treasuries, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The reason may simply be to diversify assets. But as the largest foreign holder of Uncle Sam’s liabilities with $1.2 trillion, China also appears to have some leverage as the Trump administration considers imposing tariffs. Like other retaliatory measures, however, ditching Treasuries would end up costing China. The dollar declined around 0.6 percent against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, hinting at the challenge involved. Beijing would weaken the dollar if it sold Treasuries, which might in turn reduce the competitiveness of Chinese goods abroad. Officials could mitigate that by purchasing other dollar-denominated assets, but it’s not clear there are enough alternative safe, liquid securities. Threatening to rush for the exits also means China risks selling into a falling market. The cost of selling echoes a broader theme: While Chinese officials have many options with which to retaliate against potential United States tariffs, they have few good ones. Take agriculture, which contributed nearly a fifth of all American goods exported to China in 2016. Strict and effective enforcement of tariffs levied on staple goods such as soybeans and pork would hurt American farmers in Upper Midwest swing states. But it also risks generating higher inflation on the mainland. Looser de facto enforcement of product origins — more likely for commodities — would simply reroute supply chains through a third country. That keeps consumer prices in check, but it also renders the tariffs largely symbolic, which happened after Beijing slapped retaliatory tariffs on chicken parts from the United States in 2010, according to Brad Setser of the Center on Foreign Relations. Beijing is likely to retaliate if the Trump administration uses pending reports on steel, aluminum and intellectual property to impose tariffs. But based on past experience, these would largely be tit-for-tat. The most painful measures might instead be informal harassment of American firms operating in China. Local media have already floated the idea of striking Apple and Boeing, among others. Bureaucrats can deploy state-inspired consumer boycotts, surprise inspections, denials for licenses and so forth. That squeeze would be painful for executives and investors. But it would also be another case in which Beijing’s tight grip indicates a weak hand.

"Since last Sunday’s Golden Globes, the question of what to wear to the various awards shows has become even more fraught than usual. It’s not just about a pretty dress any more, but about solidarity, statement making and so on. Luckily, however, a solution to at least one such conundrum is at hand. Though there is as yet no official ceremony or red carpet attached to President Trump’s Fake News awards, scheduled to take place next Wednesday (after being postponed from Monday), anyone who suspects that he or she may be in the cross hairs, has a perfect potential outfit. Or at least part of one. Topshop, the British retailer, has created a pair of jeans in semi-stretch denim, with a red stripe down the side blaring, “Fake News” over and over again in white block letters. They look rather like a nod to artwork by Barbara Kruger. Just imagine them with a tuxedo jacket and heels instead of the sweatshirts they are paired with on Topshop’s website, and bingo! “The term ‘Fake News’ became so ubiquitous last year that it was officially named the word of the year, so we thought we’d immortalize this of-the-moment phrase on a pair of our jeans,” said Mo Riach, Topshop’s head of design, by way of explanation. (“Fake News” was chosen as the word of the year for 2017 by both the Collins English Dictionary and the American Dialect Society, in case you were wondering.)

"President Trump is crashing the global elite’s ultimate party: He’s planning to attend the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering in Davos this month, the White House confirmed on Tuesday. It’s hard to imagine an audience less receptive to Mr. Trump’s “America First” agenda. Yet, whether he is seeking reconciliation or pitching for strongman status, his mere presence is a rebuke to the elites who got him badly wrong. Mr. Trump will stand out among the 3,000-odd political leaders, financiers and company executives due to convene in the Swiss resort on Jan. 23. His threats to raise barriers to the movement of goods and people, his rejection of the Paris climate change accord and his belligerence toward North Korea have convinced the gathering’s wealthy and mostly liberal delegates that the United States is giving up on global leadership. Indeed, this year’s Davos theme — “Creating a shared future in a fractured world” — seems an attempt to mitigate Mr. Trump’s influence. The self-proclaimed billionaire will be the first sitting United States president to attend the gathering since Bill Clinton in 2000. Just as President Richard M. Nixon’s right-wing credentials made it possible for him to visit Communist China, Mr. Trump’s anti-globalization stance has enabled him to risk a trip to the European mountain resort. Imagine the vitriol that Barack Obama would have endured at home if he had put in an appearance. What Mr. Trump hopes to achieve is less clear. There will be optimism that his visit is a sign that White House moderates have gained the upper hand. Even so, it is hard to imagine Mr. Trump giving a conciliatory speech or defending globalization, as the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, did last year. It’s more likely that he will be party pooper in chief, reasserting his isolationist policies while reminding the crowd of what it failed to foresee. At Davos two years ago, delegates dismissed Mr. Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election. A year later, attendees talked up his pragmatic deal-making credentials — only to watch Mr. Trump’s dark and foreboding inaugural address. The Davos crowd does not object to autocrats: Mr. Xi and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have received applause in previous years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, another nationalist, will deliver this year’s keynote speech. Ultimately, Mr. Trump will not be that different to the other wealthy attendees on the ski slopes, debating what the masses really think.

"Is Donald Trump mentally fit to be president of the United States? It’s an understandable question, and it’s also beside the point. Understandable because Mr. Trump’s behavior in office — impulsive, erratic, dishonest, childish, crude — is so alarming, and so far from what Americans expect in their chief executive, that it cries out for a deeper explanation. It’s beside the point not because a president’s mental capacity doesn’t matter, nor because we should blindly accept our leaders’ declarations of their own stability, let alone genius. Rather, we don’t need a medical degree or a psychiatric diagnosis to tell us what is wrong with Mr. Trump. It’s obvious to anyone who listens to him speak, reads his tweets and sees the effects of his behavior — on the presidency, on the nation and its most important institutions, and on the integrity of the global order. Presidents should not, for instance, taunt the leaders of hostile nations with demeaning nicknames and boasts about the size of their “nuclear button.” They should not tweet out videos depicting them violently assaulting their political opponents. They should not fire the F.B.I. director to derail an investigation into their own campaign’s possible collusion with a foreign government to swing the election. And, of course, they shouldn’t have to find themselves talking to reporters to insist that they’re mentally stable. This behavior may be evidence of some underlying disorder, or it may not. Who knows? Mr. Trump hasn’t undergone a mental-health evaluation, at least not one made public. But even if his behavior were diagnosed as an illness, what would that tell us that we don’t already know? Plenty of people with mental disorders or disabilities function at high levels of society. Conversely, if Mr. Trump were found to have no diagnosable illness, he would be no more fit for the office he holds than he is today. The problem lies in trying to locate the essence of Mr. Trump’s unfitness in the unknowable reaches of his mind, as opposed to where we can all openly see it and address it in political terms. As the psychiatrist Allen Frances told The Times: “You can’t say enough about how incompetent and unqualified he is to be leader of the free world. But that does not make him mentally ill.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/opinion/is-mr-trump-nuts.html?searchResultPosition=55
"For nearly a decade, central banks around the world have been the biggest buyers of bonds, sending interest rates plummeting and stock markets soaring. Now, investors are starting to worry about what would happen if the richest nations start to scale back on a buying binge that most of them began to stimulate economies hurt by the global financial crisis. The most immediate fear: A sharp falloff in bond prices would rattle equity markets that are now trading at record highs. Beyond that, there is a looming concern that as the global economy heats up, inflation, a bond investor’s main worry, will start to inch up, fed by higher wage demands on the part of workers everywhere. “Your largest investor might be stepping back, that’s what spooked people,” said John Briggs, a bond strategist at NatWest Markets. “The market is very vulnerable to any change in supply and demand.” That vulnerability has been on display in recent weeks, with many investors selling out of their bond positions, pushing the yield — which rises as bond prices fall — on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury bill up to a high of 2.59 percent on Wednesday from 2.3 late last year. Bond markets appeared to be further spooked on Wednesday by a report that China’s central bank, which owns $1.2 trillion in United States Treasury bonds, may be poised to slow or even halt its buying of United States debt.

"Our subject today is Donald Trump’s mind. Not the speculation about whether he’s losing his marbles. That was during our “Fire and Fury” period last week. Now we’re thinking about that lovely bipartisan meeting the president hosted Tuesday with members of Congress about immigration. Everybody was impressed by how concerned Trump seemed to be about all the young Dreamers suddenly facing possible deportation. “I came out feeling the president had made it very clear he wants this resolved ASAP,” said Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic whip. The only problem is that Trump seems to be committed to two totally contradictory ideas on what to do. Is he being your typical pol? Your typical loony person? Something in between? Let’s revisit. Right now the real immigration crisis is about the 800,000 young people who were brought here illegally as children and given protection under the Obama administration. Trump hates calling them Dreamers, so he refers to them as “the DACA population,” after the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protected them. Until he terminated it.

"With jitters and with prayers, with countdown clocks in their heads and their immigration lawyers on speed-dial, hundreds of thousands of young immigrants have spent all fall and winter watching President Trump and congressional leaders negotiate their fate, every fleck of news a tantalizing omen. “It’s like watching a telenovela: Every day is different,” said Francis Madi, 28, who was brought to the United States from Venezuela in 2003 and now lives on Long Island. “Now we’re just going to the stressful part of the telenovela where you wonder what will happen to the protagonist.” The protagonist, in this case, happens to be her. Perhaps more than any other single group of people in the country, the Dreamers, as these young immigrants are known, have had their lives shaped directly by the mood swings of national politics. But in the four months since the Trump administration announced that it would shut down Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the program that protects 800,000 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, the goings-on in Washington have felt especially personal. While Congress engages in a high-stakes staring contest over a substitute program, immigrants have already begun losing their protections, exposing them to deportation. Then came Tuesday afternoon, when the glimmers of a bipartisan deal emerged. And a little later on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump appeared ready to throw the entire immigration-reform debate open again. And then late Tuesday night, which brought news of a startling court ruling that threatened to muddle matters yet again. And Wednesday morning, when it was difficult to know how to feel at all.

"WASHINGTON — Prominent House Republicans stepped forward on Wednesday with a vision of immigration policy that clashed fiercely with President Trump’s recent overtures of bipartisanship and highlighted how difficult it will be for Congress and the president to reach accord in the coming weeks. The proposal, championed by the chairmen of the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, would crack down on illegal immigration and sharply reduce the number of legal immigrants to the United States. Coming one day after Mr. Trump held an extraordinary meeting in which he laid out the parameters for a bipartisan immigration deal, the House proposal highlighted the uncertainty surrounding negotiations that are supposed to coalesce before the government runs out of money on Jan. 19. “This is the only bill that’s going to unify the conference, and it’s going to get us to a majority of the conference,” said Representative Raúl R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who participated in Tuesday’s White House meeting. Mr. Trump convened Tuesday’s session to address the fate of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents and were eligible for work permits under an Obama-era initiative called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Mr. Trump rescinded DACA in September and gave Congress six months to come up with a replacement. During Tuesday’s session, the president and lawmakers outlined four broad areas to be negotiated as part of a bipartisan immigration deal: shielding the young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, from deportation; limiting family-based migration, in which one relative can sponsor another; ending the diversity visa lottery system; and improving border security. But the House measure, put forth by a group that includes two committee chairmen — Judiciary’s Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia and Homeland Security’s Michael McCaul of Texas — was far more expansive.

The decision by the school board for the Kenosha Unified School District means that the matter will not be taken up by the United States Supreme Court. The lawsuit was filed in 2016 by Ashton Whitaker, who was a rising senior at the time at George Nelson Tremper High School in Kenosha, a city on Lake Michigan.

After teachers and administrators there told him he could not use the boys restrooms, he sued the school district. “The idea of using the girls restroom was humiliating and there was no way I could do it,” he said in a court document filed in August 2016. “If I were to use the gender-neutral restrooms, I would also stand out from everyone else with a big label on me that said ‘transgender.’” He described feeling “scrutinized and degraded” when administrators repeatedly tried to keep him out of the boys restrooms, or when they used female pronouns after he had asked them not to. He added that he suffered from anxiety, depression, migraines and other health problems related to dehydration because he had tried to avoid restroom trips by drinking less water.

"Alarmed by displays of anti-Semitism among new immigrants to Germany, a German politician has offered a novel idea that appears to be gaining traction: required visits to Nazi concentration camp memorials. The idea, proposed by Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin state legislator of Palestinian heritage, received a significant boost on Wednesday when the leaders of Germany’s Central Council of Jews and the far larger World Jewish Congress agreed with her. “People who have fled to us who have themselves had to escape or been expelled can develop empathy in such memorials,” the council’s president, Josef Schuster, told Deutschlandfunk radio. The World Jewish Congress, a leading advocacy organization that represents Jewish communities in 100 countries, also welcomed the idea. “This proposal is an encouraging and effective method of educating people of all backgrounds about the Nazi attempt to wipe out the entire Jewish population of Europe and the dangers such hatred can yield,” Ronald S. Lauder, the organization’s president, said in an emailed response to a request for comment. “More than any other country, Germany has faced up to the crimes of its past in an honest and straightforward way, and has made it clear at the highest levels of government that the memory of the Holocaust must never be forgotten or diminished,” Mr. Lauder said.

"WASHINGTON — The European Union is the West’s last line of defense. The United States has historically been the world’s anchor of republican ideals, but President Trump has abandoned the role, openly admiring strongmen like Vladimir Putin of Russia. As the temptations of nationalist populism spread, Europe has responsibility for holding down the Western fort. The primary battle right now is over Poland, which is deepening its descent into illiberalism. The European Union needs to take a firm stand in defense of Western values. Since coming to power in 2015, Poland’s populist government has sought to control the news media, purged and politicized the civil service, and intimidated intellectuals and civil society organizations. Three weeks ago, Poland’s president signed into law legislation that compromises judicial independence, effectively clearing the way for the ruling Law and Justice party to stack the courts. In response, Brussels has taken the right steps, warning Warsaw of punishment if it continues to pursue policies inconsistent with the European Union’s founding principles, which include “democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.” In late December, the European Commission for the first time in the union’s history started a formal procedure that could lead to disciplinary sanctions, including the suspension of Poland’s voting rights in the European Union’s main decision-making body. These measures have not gone unnoticed in Warsaw. This week, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki reshuffled his cabinet, replacing a number of ministers whose relationships with European leaders were particularly strained. And he flew to Brussels for dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. But these moves have yet to be accompanied by any concrete steps to reverse Poland’s illiberal turn. The European Union must keep the pressure on. Poland’s trajectory is not unique within the bloc. Hungary has already gone down a similar path, and other member states in Central Europe are tilting in the same direction. But Poland’s descent is particularly consequential: With a population of almost 40 million, it is Central Europe’s standard-bearer. Poland’s leading role in the collapse of the Soviet bloc makes its illiberal slide all the more arresting. In the early 1980s, the Solidarity labor movement inspired widespread resistance to Poland’s Communist government, setting the stage for the broader revolt across Central Europe that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Poland was at the forefront of the transition from Communist satellite to market democracy, joining NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.

"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — At 5:20 on Tuesday evening, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tweeted a photo of himself at the Tallahassee airport with Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, announcing that he had decided, after meeting with Governor Scott, to exempt the state from a new Trump administration plan to open up most of the nation’s coastline to offshore oil drilling. It was a sudden and unexpected change to a plan that President Trump had celebrated just five days before, and it took lawmakers and governors from both parties by surprise. It also gave Governor Scott, a Republican who is widely expected to run for the Senate this year, a clear political boost in that race. Florida lawmakers of both parties have long opposed offshore drilling, especially after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill sent tarballs to the shores of a state where the economy relies heavily on tourism. Mr. Zinke’s sudden flip-flop on Florida drilling allows Governor Scott to tout the decision as evidence of his influence with the White House. Mr. Trump’s critics say the move highlights the president’s willingness to blatantly use the nation’s public lands and waters as political bargaining chips. It also appears to illustrate the clumsiness with which the Trump administration drafts federal policies. By publicly putting forth the comprehensive new coastal drilling plan and then abruptly announcing a major change to it less than a week later, with little evident public or scientific review, the Interior Department appears to have opened itself to a wave of legal challenges.

"WASHINGTON — Remember the infamous “Bridge to Nowhere”? The Montana Sheep Institute or the now-shuttered North Carolina teapot hall of fame? Congress years ago eliminated funding for these types of pet projects, known as earmarks, after they became derided as government boondoggles, largess and a pathway to corruption. President Trump now wants to bring them back. In a freewheeling meeting about immigration with congressional Republicans and Democrats this week, Mr. Trump lamented the gridlock that has gripped the capital in recent years and suggested that earmarks, the practice of stealthily stuffing funding for pet projects into legislation, be exhumed from the legislative graveyard. “Our system lends itself to not getting things done, and I hear so much about earmarks — the old earmark system — how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. “Maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.” Earmarks have a long and sometimes troubled history in Washington. Through the late 1990s and 2000s, they were used to persuade lawmakers to take tough votes in exchange for financial help back home. That spawned an entire industry of earmark lobbying and led to some enormous scandals, capped by the downfall of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. In 2011, on a bipartisan basis, earmarks were banned. As they careen toward potentially perilous 2018 midterm elections, Republicans are now actively considering bringing them back. Lawmakers have complained for years that without earmarks, they have no reliable way of funding vital constituent interests, from roads to sewer systems. The House Rules Committee is planning to hold public hearings on the subject next week. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said this week that he supports his party having “conversations” about allowing earmarks to re-emerge.

"WASHINGTON — A yearslong debate over National Security Agency surveillance and protections for Americans’ privacy rights will reach a climactic moment on Thursday as the House of Representatives takes up legislation to extend a program of warrantless spying on internet and phone networks that traces back to the Sept. 11 attacks. There is little doubt that Congress will extend an expiring statute, known as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, that permits the government to collect without a warrant from American firms, like Google and AT&T, the emails and other communications of foreigners abroad — even when they are talking to Americans. But it is far from clear whether Congress will impose significant new safeguards for Americans’ privacy. A bipartisan coalition of civil-liberties-minded lawmakers are trying to impose such changes, while the Trump administration, the intelligence community and House Republican leadership oppose them. Thursday’s vote is seen as the crucial test because more would-be reformers are in the House than in the Senate, which will take up the legislation later. If majority support for imposing new privacy protections on the program does not exist in the House, the Senate is unlikely to add them in. “The chances are better in the House,” acknowledged Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, at a news conference on Wednesday of House and Senate lawmakers who support surveillance overhaul efforts. “The privacy movement is stronger in the House than the Senate. Maybe we can learn from you guys.” The N.S.A. began collecting Americans’ international phone calls and emails without a warrant in October 2001 as part of the Bush administration’s post-Sept. 11 Stellarwind program. In 2008, after the program had come to light, Congress legalized a form of it by enacting Section 702 of the FISA law. That law enabled the program to expand to Silicon Valley firms, not just telecoms, and to all foreign intelligence purposes, not just counterterrorism.

"I met Steve Bannon for the first time in September 2013 at the so-called Breitbart Embassy on Capitol Hill in Washington. I had spent the better part of the previous seven years working for Republican members of Congress before making the leap to start my own public relations firm. Like anyone starting a business, I was eager to find clients. In Breitbart I had a media platform at my disposal to attract a stable. Before that meeting, I had never met or even heard of Steve, and so I approached it with an open mind. But as I would come to learn over the course of two years working with him closely, his character and temperament made his stunning fall over the past few days inevitable. In that first meeting, Steve described his ambitious vision for Breitbart. He wanted to seize on the social media revolution to create a central digital destination for conservatives. His observation — entirely correct — was that the center-right media universe was fractured and underserved by the mainstream media. The Tea Party movement that swept unconventional Republicans into office in 2010 represented a turning point that upended the establishment, and Steve wanted to use Breitbart to tap into that movement. Steve might have looked unkempt, but his energy, precision, clarity and certainty were impressive. I agreed with his overall observations about the media environment and the change in the Republican Party. So I joined the team. I would be Breitbart’s media consultant, promoting stories written, Steve assured me, by a world-class team of reporters. If Breitbart had an exclusive interview with a policymaker, my mission was to make sure every political reporter and Capitol Hill press aide knew about it. Bannon was obsessive about wanting Breitbart scoops mentioned in the handful of daily morning email tipsheets that set the agenda for Washington, especially Mike Allen’s Politico Playbook.

"Until Robert De Niro took the stage on Tuesday to introduce Meryl Streep at the National Board of Review awards gala, the night had largely been a ho-hum affair, lacking the drama of other events during film awards season, like the Golden Globes on Sunday. But past the evening’s two-hour mark, perhaps aware that the event wasn’t being televised, Mr. De Niro unleashed several profanity-laden asides directed at President Trump. He referred to the leader as a “fool” and an “idiot” (adding the same expletive each time), as well as the “baby-in-chief.” Politics were often front and center much of the night, even though anticipation was minimal because the winners, including Ms. Streep for “The Post,” were announced ahead of time. Mr. De Niro’s remarks were especially caustic, but criticism of Mr. Trump has become standard fare at Hollywood-centric events and several award recipients won applause when they condemned Mr. Trump’s treatment of the news media. The attention on Mr. Trump’s policies was contrasted with the emphasis at the Golden Globes, where efforts to combat sexual misconduct were the focal point. While many of Tuesday’s attendees wore black, missing were the Time’s Up pins seen just two nights before (one was spotted on Stephen Colbert, who was introducing Greta Gerwig for best director). Barely any of the speeches discussed the topic. Mr. De Niro was one of the few to make a glancing reference. “I am still fighting for Meryl to be able to get 79 cents of what a man would get to play Katharine Graham,” Mr. De Niro said. “It’s shameful, I know. The good news is that I think we’re at a watershed moment and it’s about time.” Ms. Streep, accepting best actress, started her speech with an ode to men. “I love men. Oh my God,” Ms. Streep said. “Yeah, I know it’s the year of the woman and everything, but oh my God. The men. All my mentors have been men.” Her film, about The Washington Post’s role in publishing the Pentagon Papers, also won best picture and best actor, for Tom Hanks.

Mudslides wreaked havoc in Southern California Tuesday amid intense rainfall across the state, demolishing homes in Santa Barbara County and killing at least 15 people. Just weeks ago, many of those areas hardest hit by mudslides were battling wildfires. Firefighters waded through debris, over piles of fallen trees and around displaced boulders in the aftermath of the storm, scouring for survivors after several homes were swept away.

In another instance, a boy was found under a freeway overpass and rescued by firefighters; mud had carried him for hundreds of yards.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump called the United States courts system “broken and unfair” on Wednesday, the morning after a federal judge’s ruling that ordered the administration to restart a program that shields young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. Republicans and Democrats are in the middle of a legislative battle over the program created by President Barack Obama, called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Lawmakers met with President Trump on Tuesday to discuss the program’s future. “We find this decision to be outrageous, especially in light of the president’s successful bipartisan meeting with House and Senate members at the White House on the same day,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement released Wednesday morning. Hours after the White House meeting, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco wrote that it was not proper to kill the program, and that the administration must “maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis” as the legal challenge to the president’s decision in September to end the program moves forward. Mr. Trump has previously criticized the courts system after judges have halted or held up his policy initiatives. Ms. Sanders said the fate of the program should be addressed by Congress. “President Trump is committed to the rule of law, and will work with members of both parties to reach a permanent solution that corrects the unconstitutional actions taken by the last administration,” Ms. Sanders said.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It can get exhausting to keep track of all of the counter-conspiracy theories that keep coming from President Trump’s allies (many of them in the employ of Rupert Murdoch). But some of those theories get enough traction that they are worth debunking. To that end, the release of the transcript of Glenn Simpson’s Senate testimony yesterday is important. Republicans initially opposed the release, but Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, ultimately made it happen. The key part of Simpson’s testimony, as The Plum Line’s Greg Sargent notes: The F.B.I. was already investigating the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia when it received additional information from Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer working with Simpson’s firm, Fusion GPS. (Various Fox News commentators and others have tried to spin a tale in which the Clinton campaign effectively started the F.B.I. investigation, via Steele and Fusion.) We still don’t know how much of the information in Steele’s infamous Trump dossier is accurate. Either way, Steele and Fusion are only supporting players in this story. The main questions are about Trump’s campaign and Russia — not the people trying to figure out what was happening between the campaign and Russia. Related: In The Times, Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, defends its decision to publish the Steele dossier one year ago today. Perspective. The story of Russian collusion is devilishly complicated. Susan Hennessey — a legal expert whose work I’ve often cited in this newsletter — offered an especially clear summary in a recent podcast with Vox’s Ezra Klein. She described two scenarios — one more innocent, one less so. Here are the basics: The innocent explanation: Amateurish Trump officials unwittingly blundered into a campaign by Russia to influence American policy and create chaos. The Trump officials cooperated with Russian nationals because they didn’t know they shouldn’t. They then lied about their contacts because those contacts were embarrassing, not because they were part of a sophisticated conspiracy. As Hennessey puts it, “the cover up is worse than the crime.” The less-innocent explanation: Top Trump officials understood that they were doing something wrong. Perhaps they were trying to help their campaign with tactics they understood were wrong. Or perhaps they were working to advance the interests of a foreign power, because of financial entanglements between those officials — maybe including Trump — and Russia. These officials, and others who were aware of the entanglements, then lied about the contacts. In that case, Hennessey explains, “the decision making at the top of the executive branch is not in any meaningful way being guided by the best interests of the American people.” Last year, I walked through five possible motivations for the Trump team’s strange friendliness with Russia, including some of the possibilities mentioned here.

At her apartment in Astoria, Queens, yesterday, she made breakfast for her family, prepared her 6-year-old for school and then got herself ready for work. At one point, she held her infant daughter to her chest to breast-feed with one hand and checked her phone for updates on a work meeting with the other. “I have to hand her off soon,” said Ms. Limongi Gabriele, 35, pausing to smile at her daughter. “There are things that I would love to do with her just to bond, a lot of stuff during the week that I can’t do if I’m at work.” Soon, Ms. Limongi Gabriele won’t have to choose between focusing on her daughter or her job as an assistant at New York University: She is set to be among the first beneficiaries of New York State’s new paid family leave policy, which the governor’s office has called the strongest in the nation.

New Yorkers are now eligible to take paid time off work to bond with a newly born, adopted or fostered child; to care for a close relative with a serious health condition; or when a family member is deployed on active military service abroad.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump declined on Wednesday to commit to being interviewed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating whether his campaign colluded with Russia to sway the 2016 election, backing off his statement last year that he would be willing to talk to Mr. Mueller under oath. “I’ll speak to attorneys,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference with Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, when asked whether he would agree to an interview. “We’ll see what happens.” That answer was a marked change from June, when Mr. Trump defended his firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, denying that it was related to his handling of the Russia investigation, and said he would be “100 percent” willing to give a sworn statement to Mr. Mueller. It came as the president’s advisers have been discussing whether Mr. Trump should submit to what would be an extraordinary but not unprecedented instance of a president being interviewed by a prosecutor investigating him for wrongdoing. Mr. Trump also repeated his criticism of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry as a “witch hunt” and the investigations being pursued by congressional committees as a “Democrat hoax.” In a Twitter post, he referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Senate committee conducting an investigation into Russian interference, as “Sneaky Dianne Feinstein.” “For 11 months, they’ve had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government, and it has hurt our government,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s a Democrat hoax that was brought up as an excuse for losing an election.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/us/politics/trump-russia-election-interference.html?searchResultPosition=98
"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea warned on Wednesday that North Korea would face stiffer sanctions if it resumed weapons tests, while crediting President Trump with helping force the North to resume dialogue and strike a broader agreement to improve Korean ties. “I am giving a lot of credit to President Trump,” Mr. Moon said at a nationally televised news conference a day after the two Koreas forged their agreement during border talks. “I am expressing my gratitude.” The White House said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Moon had spoken and “underscored the importance of continuing the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea,” adding that Mr. Trump “expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances.” Mr. Moon’s comments and his conversation with Mr. Trump suggested a tactful maneuver by the South Korean leader to stroke the ego of Mr. Trump, who has claimed credit for the inter-Korean dialogue, while easing fears in Washington and among his conservative critics at home that in his eagerness for dialogue, he may be too accommodating to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. In a post on Twitter last week, Mr. Trump asserted that North Korea had gone to the negotiating table because he had been “firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North.” Mr. Moon agreed on Wednesday that Mr. Kim’s decision to start a dialogue with the South could be a sign that the Trump administration’s policy of applying maximum sanctions and pressure was working. And he said South Korea and its allies must seize on the North’s renewed appetite for negotiations to persuade it to join broader talks involving the United States over how to end its rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program — an approach the North’s chief delegate to the border talks angrily rejected on Tuesday.

"MEXICO CITY — Countries don’t disappear, it has been said, but sometimes they do encounter perfect storms. These do not threaten their existence, yet they can represent major challenges to their welfare and integrity. Mexico may be on the verge of such a perfect storm as it enters a new year fraught with multiple perils and few opportunities. Three dark clouds threaten Mexico’s future in 2018: Donald Trump’s tax overhaul, the possible end of Nafta and a presidential election that may introduce an era of turmoil and uncertainty for the economy and Mexican society at large. The first threat has little to do with Mexico’s policies or control of its destiny. Whatever one thinks of the new tax regime in the United States, there is little question that it belongs strictly to the American domestic policy realm, unlike immigration policy, which has been the subject of several agreements between the United States and, among others, Mexico and Cuba. Nonetheless, with regard to tax policy, the problem for the United States’ neighbors lies in the consequences it may have on their domestic economies. This is a typical internal economic policy issue of the United States, like raising or lowering interest rates, with major international repercussions. For Mexico, it is quite likely, economists say, that Trump’s tax reform entails three significant downsides. First, Mexican conglomerates may decide to move their headquarters and legal residence to the United States to take advantage of a now much lower corporate tax rate (30 percent in Mexico versus 21 percent in the United States). While this would not necessarily transfer jobs from one country to the other, it may discourage foreign, or even national, investment in Mexico. If big Mexican multinationals such as Cemex, Bimbo, Televisa or Mexichem were to relocate north of the border, why shouldn’t smaller companies, or potential newcomers, do the same?

"On my pediatrics rotation in medical school, several residents told me they worked with children in part because they sometimes found themselves judging adults: Did they do drugs? Were they fat? Why did they drink so much? The idea that Americans should take personal responsibility for their health has recently received renewed attention. Vice President Mike Pence has argued for “bringing freedom and individual responsibility back to American health care.” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, expressed a more punitive view, saying, “That doesn’t mean we should take care of the person who sits at home, eats poorly, and gets diabetes.” The call for personal responsibility is not new, nor just conservative. Barack Obama said, “We’ve got to have the American people doing something about their own care.” Many Americans think it’s O.K. to ask people with unhealthy lifestyles to pay higher insurance premiums and deductibles.  Efforts to inject more personal responsibility into health care, however, have not consistently been shown to lower costs, improve outcomes or save lives. Effectiveness — or lack of it — is often in the eye of the partisan beholder. What does it actually mean to take personal responsibility for health? The basic idea is that if we adopt healthful lifestyles, are compliant patients and save money for our own medical care, we’ll feel better, spend less and reduce our burden on others. The details of how this philosophy is applied, however, get complicated: Which programs work and which are counterproductive? Does “personal responsibility” save money or just shift costs from insurers to patients? Who should judge whether we’re living a healthy enough lifestyle: Doctors? Insurers? Government?

Without exactly boasting, Ms. Nash, 27, painted a dreamlike picture of her home. It has high, coffered ceilings and a sweeping view of the East River. The sunlight “just pours in, in the morning — it wakes me up,” she said. The 13-story building’s lobby is “old-school Art Deco” with a terra-cotta floor and stained-glass doors. An actual person runs the elevator. “We honestly fell in love with how clean everything was, not just in the building but in the neighborhood,” Ms. Nash, who had previously lived on the Upper East Side, went on. “You couldn’t see a speck of gum glued to the sidewalk.” Now she has a choice of three subway lines to her job in Chelsea. “You could throw a stone on Second Avenue and hit five different restaurants,” she said. “Everything you want is within a five-minute walk.” Ms. Nash’s starry-eyed vision of Turtle Bay, which extends from East 43rd to East 53rd Street and from Lexington Avenue to the East River, may have something to do with her status as a newcomer. Residents of longer standing say they are wrestling with the neighborhood’s many changes. “Stores, particularly mom-and-pop shops that I relied on for years, are now replaced by banks and drugstores and Starbucks,” said Candi Obrentz, a product designer and consultant who has lived in Turtle Bay since 1995 and runs her businesses from her one-bedroom apartment on East 49th Street, for which she pays $3,200 a month.

"DANDONG, China — Not long ago, Ma Xiaohong was the public face of China’s trade with North Korea. By age 44, she had built a commercial empire accounting for a fifth of trade between the Communist neighbors. She was appointed to the provincial People’s Congress, granted special privileges to export petroleum products to the North and feted by officials as a “woman of distinction.” Now, Ms. Ma’s fate has become a test of China’s willingness to support President Trump’s efforts to throttle North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. Last year, American prosecutors indicted Ms. Ma on charges of using her companies to help North Korea evade international sanctions. After a briefing by American diplomats in Beijing, the Chinese announced their own investigation into Ms. Ma’s main company. Fifteen months later, however, it is unclear what has become of Ms. Ma. The government says it has not found evidence to support the American charges that she or her partners aided North Korea’s weapons program. Though she remains under investigation for “economic crimes,” it is not clear whether she was ever arrested or where she is now. A review of Ms. Ma’s case — involving interviews with officials, diplomats and others, as well as searches in corporate registries — underscored China’s deep ambivalence as it has come under increasing pressure to enforce sanctions against North Korea. While China is on the record opposing the North’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, it is wary of being seen imposing punishments at the bidding of the United States, especially against its own citizens.

"THE RUINED HOUSE
By Ruby Namdar
Translated by Hillel Halkin
514 pp. Harper. $29.99. It’s been a season of reckoning for our high priests, as one after another, in the film industry, journalism, politics, academia and other fields, have been judged and sometimes punished for their sins. How eerie that Ruby Namdar’s strange and exhilarating novel, “The Ruined House,” should appear in English translation just now. Namdar wrote the book, his second, in his native Hebrew, and received Israel’s most lucrative literary award, the Sapir Prize, for it a few years ago. Having lived in New York for decades, he was the first expatriate ever to gain that particular honor, and it looks as if he’ll remain the only one: After his win, the rules were shamefully changed to exclude those who live abroad. It’s just coincidental timing, then, that the novel centers on the sort of American high priest who has recently come under long overdue scrutiny. In “The Ruined House,” he’s the kind of 50-something Jewish New Yorker who publishes his essays in The New Yorker, occupies an impeccable Upper West Side apartment and leads seminars on “comparative culture” at N.Y.U. You can probably already picture him, this elegant Andrew P. Cohen, down to “the old-fashioned watch on his left wrist, the cartoonishly heavy-framed reading glasses, the Warholian shock of hair with its playful wink of gray.” We follow Andrew as he floats through his putatively enviable life, preparing for classes, visiting the mother of his 26-year-old Chinese-American girlfriend, schmoozing the slick president of N.Y.U. He shuttles between the Hamptons and gallery openings, treating himself to cappuccino and biscotti and almond croissants at “those sexy bakeries that have been opening all over.” True to type, Andrew surrounds himself with admiring women he has selected because they will play their roles (ex-wife, girlfriend, daughter) without ever impinging upon his “personal and aesthetic independence.” Namdar skewers the man thoroughly as a hypocritical misogynist, phony scholar and petty narcissist. But Namdar’s deeper subject isn’t contemporary patriarchy and its discontents. Some critics have mistaken the book as continuing the tradition of Saul Bellow, Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud — whose names Namdar strategically drops, as red herrings — with Andrew just another Kepesh, Silk, Levin or Herzog. Namdar actually has less in common with those novelists, whose imaginations were largely secular, than with Cynthia Ozick, who has grappled with religious prohibition, or with the young Leonard Cohen, who harangued an audience in Montreal in 1964, telling them: “There is an awful truth which no Jewish writer investigates today.... It is this truth: We no longer believe we are holy.” As if in response to that howl, in “The Ruined House” ancient Jewish holiness bleeds, insistently, horrifically, into the present. The connection is hinted at from the start, in the Hebrew dates given in the chapter headings, which count “from the creation of the world”: The novel begins on Elul 6, 5760 (“which happened to fall on Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2000”), and ends on “The 1st of Tishrei, 5762” or “Sept. 18, 2001.” This indicates that Andrew’s story is being narrated, unusually, as part of the trajectory of the long Jewish past.

"Migrant shelters along the southern border are filling up again. Immigration lawyers in the region say their caseloads are spiking. Across the Southwest, border officers are stopping more than 1,000 people a day. Just months after border apprehensions hit a 17-year low, which administration officials proudly celebrated as a “Trump effect,” the number of migrants trying to enter the United States has been surging, surpassing 40,000 along the Southwest border last month, more than double the springtime numbers, according to new data from the Homeland Security Department. Many factors, including the Central American economy and gang violence, play a role in migration patterns. But it also appears that any deterrent effect of Mr. Trump’s tough talk and ramped-up immigration enforcement has begun to wane. In interviews, volunteers and lawyers along the border say that migrants and smugglers have stopped lying low, deciding that trying to get a foothold in a well-off and safe country was no riskier than in the past. “I think this was a ‘Let’s wait and see what’s going to happen’ period,” said Ruben Garcia, director of the Annunciation House, a shelter in El Paso that provides housing to recent border crossers as they search for more permanent places to live. Mr. Garcia pointed to the president’s plan to hire tens of thousands of border agents, which was announced in February but has yet to come to fruition because Congress still has not provided the funding. The same is true for Mr. Trump’s centerpiece project, the border wall. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/us/border-crossings-trump-effect.html?searchResultPosition=105

WASHINGTON — Nearly a year into the Trump administration, mentions of climate change have been systematically removed, altered or played down on websites across the federal government, according to a report made public Wednesday. The findings of the report, by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, an international coalition of researchers and activist groups, are in keeping with the policies of a president who has proudly pursued an agenda of repealing environmental regulations, opening protected lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, shrinking the boundaries of federal monuments, and appointing top officials who have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change. The authors of the study said that the removal of the words “climate change” from government websites, and a widespread effort to delete or bury information on climate change programs, would quite likely have a detrimental impact.

[Update: 2 women say James Franco’s acting school exploited them.] During Mr. Franco’s appearance at the Golden Globes, where he won for his lead role in “The Disaster Artist,” multiple women suggested on social media that he should not have been wearing a “Time’s Up” pin in solidarity with victims of gender inequality. The actress Ally Sheedy tweeted that he was an example of “why I left the film/tv business,” though she later removed the message. When Mr. Colbert asked for a response, Mr. Franco focused on the broader movement for gender equality, then denied any suggestion that he had acted improperly. “First of all, I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy,” he said. “I directed her in a play Off Broadway, I had nothing but a great time with her, total respect for her.

"In the fall of 2014, Oprah Winfrey ran a “transformative two-day live event,” a traveling roadshow that was held in eight cities around the country. For this interactive revival-tent experience, she was joined by her “handpicked life trailblazers,” authors and personalities whose work she considered essential for the theme of the roadshow, “The Life You Want.” The trailblazers included, among others, Iyanla Vanzant, a spiritual teacher of New Thought, a 19th-century movement with links to Christian Science that emphasizes the idea of God as “infinite intelligence” and the human capacity to think our way toward godlike power … Rob Bell, an erstwhile evangelical megachurch pastor who has reinvented himself as an itinerant preacher of the vaguest sort of Christianity … Elizabeth Gilbert, author of “Eat Pray Love,” the megaselling memoir about finding religious ecstasy in India (as well as great pasta in Italy and a hot romance in Bali) … Mark Nepo, the poet-philosopher author of “The Book of Awakening” and other tracts on the spirituality of the everyday … and of course Deepak Chopra, the aging prince of the New Age. I list these figures and their theologies because in all the thousands of words that the political press has written about Oprah since her Golden Globes speech on Sunday night invited 2020 presidential speculation, there has not been nearly enough focus on the most important aspect of Oprah’s public persona, the crucial and fascinating role she really occupies in American life. We’ve heard about Oprah the entrepreneur, Oprah the celebrity, Oprah the champion of holistic medicine and the enabler of anti-vaccine paranoia, even Oprah the neoliberal (don’t ask). But though she is entrepreneurial and rich, Oprah is not Jeff Bezos; though she is famous, she is not the Rock; though she has elevated various dubious approaches to wellness, she is not Gwyneth Paltrow. Instead, her essential celebrity is much closer to the celebrity of Pope Francis or Billy Graham. She is a preacher, a spiritual guru, a religious teacher, an apostle and a prophetess. Indeed, to the extent that there is a specifically American religion, a faith tradition all our own, Oprah has made herself its pope. In other columns I have suggested that American culture is divided between three broad approaches to religious questions: one traditional, one spiritual and one secular. The traditional approach takes various forms (Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Orthodox Jewish) but its instincts are creedal, confessional, dogmatic; it believes in a specific revelation, a specific authority and a specific holy book, and seeks to conform itself to teachings handed down from the religious past. The secular approach is post-religious, scientistic, convinced that the laboratory and the microscope will ultimately account for everything that matters, while hopefully justifying a liberal society’s still-somewhat-Christian moral commitments along the way.

"The proudest day of my life was when I was accepted to Stony Brook University — the school of my dreams. I didn’t open the letter right away, weighing the envelope in my hands. When I finally tore it open, I felt relief and exhilaration. I was one step closer to my dream of becoming a high school English teacher. My mom was the first person I told and the first person to congratulate me. We celebrated over lasagna she had made just for the occasion. It was a huge deal for us; I’m the first one in our family to go to college. But my dreams are in jeopardy now. On Monday, the Trump administration announced it was ending Temporary Protected Status for Salvadorans. T.P.S. is the program that has allowed my parents to live and work in this country with legal authorization for decades. The security once felt by my family — and about 200,000 other Salvadorans like us — has suddenly been ripped from under our feet. My acceptance and enrollment into college is as much a reflection of my parents’ hard work as it is my own. As two immigrants who fled El Salvador, they’ve always put me and my two sisters first. They’ve worked factory jobs for years, and when I was young they held several jobs at the same time. They coordinated their schedules to make sure that at least one of them was always home with us kids. All they wanted was a good education and a brighter future for their children. When I got into Stony Brook, I finally felt that I had something tangible to show my parents that justified their hard work and sacrifices. Now I’m a senior preparing to graduate in the fall, and I want nothing more than to have them at my graduation ceremony. I’m a United States citizen, as are my sisters. I first realized that my immigrant parents, who are not citizens, could be under attack during President Trump’s candidacy. Before that, I’d taken for granted that my parents would remain protected.

"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Three brothers from this dusty Gaza border town paid smugglers to spirit them through underground tunnels across the border into Egypt. There they joined the Sinai affiliate of the Islamic State, which is battling the Egyptian Army in the Sinai Desert. One brother was killed about 18 months ago, at the age of 20. Last week the eldest, Hamza al-Zamli, 25, showed up in a shocking video, railing against Hamas, the Islamic group that dominates Gaza, and describing its fighters as “apostates.” In the finale of the 22-minute production, Mr. Zamli, a firebrand with long hair flowing from a black turban, instructs another fighter clad in camouflage to shoot to death a kneeling captive accused of smuggling weapons to Hamas. The video exposed new levels of enmity between Hamas and the Sinai branch of the Islamic State, injecting another layer of instability into an already volatile region. And it has roiled Gaza, prompting two families whose sons are shown in the video to disown them. The video accuses Hamas of betraying Palestinians by imprisoning extremists in Gaza, failing to prevent the American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and being supported by Iran. It urges attacks on Hamas’s members, courts and security positions, as well as on Shiites and Christians in Gaza, according to the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamic State propaganda.

"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand plans to use a prerogative given to home-state senators to try to block the confirmation of Geoffrey S. Berman if he is nominated by President Trump as the United States attorney in Manhattan, her spokesman said on Wednesday. The senator, Democrat of New York, intends to use her “blue-slip prerogative” to lodge her objection over reports that President Trump had personally interviewed Mr. Berman as part of the selection process. Ms. Gillibrand, through her spokesman, said those reports were deeply disturbing, because of conflicts of interest inherent in Mr. Berman’s “potential jurisdiction on matters that could affect the president personally.” “Under these circumstances,” Ms. Gillibrand’s spokesman, Glen Caplin, said, if such a meeting took place and Mr. Berman were nominated as United States attorney, “the senator would have no choice but to stand up for the independence of this office by using her blue-slip prerogative.” Mr. Caplin added that Ms. Gillibrand’s criticism was directed at President Trump “for conducting such an interview,” and not at Mr. Berman. Mr. Berman was appointed last week by Attorney General Jeff Sessions as the interim United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, placing him in charge of the powerful arm of the Justice Department in Manhattan that has jurisdiction, among other things, over President Trump’s businesses there.

He was 90. His death was announced by the Norwegian government, which said the cause was prostate cancer. Mr. Nordli, a career Labor Party politician who was prime minister from 1976 to 1981, supported full-employment programs and increased social welfare services while presiding over the expansion of Norway’s offshore oil production. In 1977, a blowout of a well disgorged tens of thousands of gallons of oil into the North Sea. But it was his actions as a staunch supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and as an advocate of heightened military security in Europe that largely alienated him from his party’s left wing. Opponents said his decision to let the United States store heavy weapons near the Soviet border would only increase tensions with Moscow. He resigned in 1981, citing health problems. Doctors had advised him to take a two-month break from politics, he said at the time, but he concluded that resignation would better serve his party’s interests. He was succeeded by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the first woman to serve as prime minister of a Scandinavian country.

"Most people agree that the federal government should tackle public health crises, and there is a particular consensus about the current epidemic involving opioids. The White House announced last fall that President Trump was “mobilizing his entire administration to address drug addiction and opioid abuse by directing the declaration of a nationwide public health emergency to address the opioids crisis.” Yet as of today, there is no permanent head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The president’s nominee for “drug czar” to run the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy withdrew from consideration in October and no replacement has been named. The acting chief of staff and general counsel for that office was dismissed last month. All this as overdose deaths continue to rise faster than ever, killing some 64,000 people last year, making the opioid epidemic a top national priority. We need to rethink how the federal government carries out this mission. The Food and Drug Administration, in approving new opioid drugs, puts more opioids in the marketplace because these drugs meet the standards for safety and efficacy in treating certain forms of pain. But the more opioids there are in the marketplace, the greater the opportunity there is for abuse. The D.E.A. tries to curb the amount by limiting the number of pills that can be manufactured, but when the agency cracks down on one form of the drug, opioid addicts move to other forms to sustain their addiction. Playing Whac-a-Mole is hardly a strategy. White House czars are largely ineffective because they do not control the agency heads who are legally responsible for carrying out the various congressional mandates of the czars. Historically, the relevant agency heads don’t pay much attention to czars. There is a world of difference between someone whose authority is to coordinate and someone who has the true authority to impose change. Moreover, the president’s drug control policy office has been more heavily focused on law enforcement than on public health strategies. The many federal agencies that work on this crisis live largely in their own worlds. Funding for opioid-related activities is under the control of multiple departments, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, both of which are criticized as operating with blinders with respect to coordination and accountability.

The sweeps of 98 stores in 17 states, from California to Florida, resulted in 21 arrests, according to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which signaled intensified efforts against businesses that hire unauthorized workers. “Today’s actions send a strong message to U.S. businesses that hire and employ an illegal work force: ICE will enforce the law, and if you are found to be breaking the law, you will be held accountable,” Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of the agency, said in a statement. Mr. Homan, the nation’s top immigration-enforcement official, has promised more scrutiny of businesses that knowingly violate federal laws requiring employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of their workers.

"The women of Hollywood have every reason to view the Golden Globes as a smashing success. Their Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment wholly defined and stole the show, eclipsing such trivial matters as who exactly won which award. Instead, the big stories of the night were the women’s rousing speeches, snarky digs, activist arm candy and swishy all-black garb, which, not that it was supposed to matter, made for an especially glam red carpet. Sure, the men kept largely mum about Time’s Up once they got onstage, despite professing solidarity on the red carpet and backstage, bedecked in Time’s Up lapel pins and black shirts. Several male winners said they felt they should just listen, though why they didn’t acknowledge as much from the stage remains an open question. Best-case scenario: They genuinely believed silence was golden. Worst: It didn’t cross their minds or they didn’t care. Likeliest (allowing benefit of the doubt): They were scared. Moving forward, there are questions. How can women keep up the momentum, and will they? And, how can the Oscars possibly top this? The Bagger’s guesses: The momentum will be hard to maintain, but not impossible. And the Oscars, which Jimmy Kimmel is set to host again, will probably fall short, now that the bar has been set high. At Golden Globes after-parties, several women involved in Time’s Up said that while their activist work would carry on strong, they didn’t know (or perhaps weren’t willing to say) what may be in store for the Oscars.

"If Omar Vizquel had hit 400 home runs, no one would be debating his Hall of Fame credentials. Marrying that offensive figure with his stellar defensive reputation would have rubber-stamped his induction this year, his first on the ballot. But for all of the acclaim Vizquel earned for his play at shortstop over a 24-year career — including 11 Gold Glove Awards — advanced statistics say he never had a season as baseball’s top defensive player. He came close, finishing second in the majors in defensive wins above replacement in 1993, but never reached the top. There is, however, another first-time Hall of Fame candidate who had an extended run as one of the game’s top defenders, including at least one season as baseball’s best over all: Andruw Jones, who at his peak, as a center fielder for the Atlanta Braves, delivered some of the most impressive defensive seasons of any player in history while, almost as an aside, clubbing 434 career home runs. In other sports, it would be unthinkable to overlook a player so respected for defensive excellence. Deion Sanders became a first-ballot Hall of Famer in pro football. Dennis Rodman sailed into the Basketball Hall of Fame with a hearty endorsement from Michael Jordan. But despite having at least as many qualifications as Vizquel — and many other Hall of Fame candidates this year — Jones is getting very little support in his first year of eligibility, according to Ryan Thibodaux’s tracking of Hall of Fame balloting. Jones, who won 10 Gold Gloves, all in a row, from 1998 to 2007, was named on nine of the 178 ballots that had been made public on Thibodaux’s website as of Wednesday morning. Vizquel, whose offensive credentials pale next to Jones’s, was named on 53 ballots. If Jones had one fewer vote, he would be sitting below the 5 percent threshold for returning on the next Hall of Fame ballot.

"To the Editor: Re “With Red Tape Losing Its Grip, Firms Ante Up” (front page, Jan. 2): The examples cited as producing a “wave of optimism” that has “swept over American business leaders” show exactly why we should not set policy based on the preferences of corporate chiefs. The article’s examples of regulations to be overturned include limiting mining debris in streams; requiring broadband providers to obtain permission from customers to collect and use online information; banning plastic bottles from national parks, and restricting housing development in wetlands. The prospect of removing this “red tape” is, according to a Moody’s economist, “lifting everyone’s spirits.” Not mine. Every one of these changes would have the effect of increasing short-term profits at long-term cost to us all. It is the job of government to weigh all factors and write rules that do not overly constrain business plans, but whose primary motivation is to consider the consequences to society as a whole. The views of corporations are just one highly self-interested pole of that debate; only regulation can balance their incentives away from short-term profit. WILLIAM S. KESSLER, SEATTLE The writer, an oceanographer, is an affiliate professor at the University of Washington. To the Editor: There seems to be almost total amnesia about the harm that deregulation can do to the economy. Didn’t something important happen in 2008? And what was the primary driver of that cataclysm? Financial deregulation. And, yes, when it was happening, it was heartily welcomed by financial industry leaders. Maybe we should look elsewhere for guidance this time. DAN IMMERGLUCK, ATLANTA The writer is the author of “Preventing the Next Mortgage Crisis: The Meltdown, the Federal Response and the Future of Housing in America.” To the Editor: The “trickle down” theory underlying the Republicans’ irresponsible tax overhaul had a famous moment of shame in November when a gathering of chief executives admitted that few of them would invest any resulting savings in their companies. The Trump administration’s deregulatory policy is cut from that same discredited cloth. Why should we expect different results? And as with the tax overhaul, the assault on public safeguards is dangerously regressive. As the White House and agencies let chief executives and companies off the hook for endangering Americans, it will be ordinary working families bearing the costs of regulatory rollbacks and delays — through more frequent asthma attacks, missed work days, preventable cancers and so on. Climate change, the opioid epidemic, the myriad harmful chemicals in consumer products and countless other threats to our quality of life won’t go away just because the Trump administration shifts the burden of these hazards from the companies that create them to the public at large.

"President Trump on Wednesday repeated a pledge to make it easier for people to sue news organizations and publishers for defamation, denouncing the country’s libel laws as a “sham” a day after his personal lawyer filed a lawsuit against a major media outlet, BuzzFeed News. The salvo from Mr. Trump, who has long expressed hostility toward traditional press freedoms, followed a days-long effort by him and his team to undercut the unflattering portrayal of the White House in a new book by the writer Michael Wolff. “We are going to take a strong look at our country’s libel laws, so that when somebody says something that is false and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts,” Mr. Trump said during a public portion of a cabinet meeting in the White House. The president added, “Our current libel laws are a sham and a disgrace and do not represent American values or American fairness.” First Amendment lawyers were quick to point out that Mr. Trump has little power to modify those laws, barring a Supreme Court appeal or constitutional amendment. Other libel laws are determined at the state level, where Mr. Trump, as president, has no direct influence. “President Trump’s threat to revise our country’s libel laws is, frankly, not credible,” the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement on Wednesday.

"Two political scientists specializing in how democracies decay and die have compiled four warning signs to determine if a political leader is a dangerous authoritarian: 1. The leader shows only a weak commitment to democratic rules. 2. He or she denies the legitimacy of opponents. 3. He or she tolerates violence. 4. He or she shows some willingness to curb civil liberties or the media. “A politician who meets even one of these criteria is cause for concern,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, both professors at Harvard, write in their important new book, “How Democracies Die,” which will be released next week. “With the exception of Richard Nixon, no major-party presidential candidate met even one of these four criteria over the last century,” they say, which sounds reassuring. Unfortunately, they have one update: “Donald Trump met them all.” We tend to assume that the threat to democracies comes from coups or violent revolutions, but the authors say that in modern times, democracies are more likely to wither at the hands of insiders who gain power initially through elections. That’s what happened, to one degree or another, in Russia, the Philippines, Turkey, Venezuela, Ecuador, Hungary, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, Poland and Peru. Venezuela was a relatively prosperous democracy, for example, when the populist demagogue Hugo Chávez tapped the frustrations of ordinary citizens to be elected president in 1998. A survey that year found that the Venezuelan public overwhelmingly believed that “democracy is always the best form of government,” with only one-quarter saying that authoritarianism is sometimes preferable.

The New York theater is obligingly presenting a host of deliberately disorienting productions from an international array of artists this month, in works designed to rearrange your mind and shake up your senses. Fixed notions of nationality, gender and race are being deconstructed and detonated in one of the liveliest lineups of brave new plays in many a season. Here, a quintet of iconoclastic eye-openers to help you focus on the future. For the Italian troupe Motus, boundaries aren’t made for crossing, but for erasing altogether. Two years ago, this genre-blending company confounded and elated downtown audiences with “MDLSX,” a mixed-media meltdown of gender-specific identity. Motus returns to one of its favorite haunts, La MaMa in the East Village, to consider the possibility of a world unfettered by nationalism — and, heck, even nationhood — in the sprawling performance piece “Panorama,” which suggests that to migrate is simply to do what comes naturally.

"WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, three federal judges in North Carolina threw out the state’s congressional map because it was “motivated by invidious partisan intent.” On Wednesday, another panel of judges in Pennsylvania upheld that state’s map, with one arguing that such a political issue was none of the courts’ business. The two competing federal rulings in partisan gerrymander cases this week underscore the courts’ angst over even getting involved in political decisions, much less overturning them. Both rulings are certain to draw the Supreme Court’s interest as it mulls a resolution to the gerrymandering question. The Court, with two other redistricting cases before it, is expected this spring to end a decades-long debate over when and if judges should make decisions that could reshape the country’s political landscape. “You’re seeing how much turmoil there is now in the lower federal courts, and how many federal judges believe the time has come for the courts to impose substantial limits” on partisan gerrymanders, said Richard H. Pildes, a scholar of the law of democracy at the New York University School of Law. Experts said that even if the Supreme Court chooses to limit partisan gerrymandering, federal judges are unlikely to force a redrawing of overly partisan maps in the middle of high-stakes midterm races. Legal observers said they believed the courts would put off requiring new maps until after the 2018 elections, or even until the next round of redistricting begins following the 2020 census. Still, the courts’ increased focus on the issue reflects the proliferation of extreme partisan gerrymanders — maps that do not merely hobble political opponents, but effectively doom them to permanent underrepresentation. And it points to growing concern that two tenets of American democracy — the concepts of majority rule and protecting the rights of minorities — are being supplanted by a third doctrine: the winner takes all.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday balked at an immigration deal that would include protections for people from Haiti and some nations in Africa, demanding to know at a White House meeting why he should accept immigrants from “shithole countries” rather than from places like Norway, according to people with direct knowledge of the conversation. Mr. Trump’s remarks, the latest example of his penchant for racially tinged remarks denigrating immigrants, left members of Congress from both parties attending the meeting in the Oval Office alarmed and mystified. He made them during a discussion of an emerging bipartisan deal to give legal status to immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children, those with knowledge of the conversation said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting. When Mr. Trump heard that Haitians were among those who would benefit from the proposed deal, he asked whether they could be left out of the plan, asking, “Why do we want people from Haiti here?” The comments were reminiscent of ones the president made last year in an Oval Office meeting with cabinet officials and administration aides, during which he complained about admitting Haitians to the country, saying that they all had AIDS, as well as Nigerians, who he said would never go back to their “huts,” according to officials who heard the statements in person or were briefed on the remarks by people who had. The White House vehemently denied last month that Mr. Trump made those remarks. In a written statement, Raj Shah, the White House deputy press secretary, did not deny the account of the meeting on Thursday or directly address Mr. Trump’s comments. “Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,” Mr. Shah said. “Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/trump-shithole-countries.html?searchResultPosition=16
"To the Editor: Re “Is Mr. Trump Nuts?” (editorial, Jan. 11): If President Trump were clutching his chest or falling down repeatedly and the medical community were silent, the public would wonder what cardiologists and neurologists thought of the president’s physical health and why they were not speaking up. In your editorial you problematically argue that the perspective of the psychiatrist is simultaneously irrelevant because the “obvious” is being stated and dangerous because of public misunderstanding and stereotyping. But these are not the only possibilities. It is one thing for psychiatrists to assume the role of the armchair psychoanalyst, presuming to know the deep unconscious conflicts of our president without examining him. It is this kind of (mis)conduct for which the Goldwater Rule was put in place. It is quite a different situation for a psychiatrist to illuminate an aspect of President Trump based on his observable behavior and to raise legitimate concerns about his mental health. As a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst I do not presume to know why President Trump has trouble staying in reality. But I do know, and the public should as well, that decision making is seriously affected when “reality testing” is impaired, and the consequences can be catastrophic. This discourse is essential regardless of the practical impediments involved in having President Trump examined. It is a moral imperative and an act of conscience. It is also a public service — educating the electorate and daring to lift the veil of shame around mental suffering and its impact. The risk of misunderstanding and stereotyping is only exacerbated when mental health professionals are encouraged to be silent. LARRY S.

"House Speaker Paul D. Ryan called electric vehicle tax credits “money wasted on losers.” The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said he’d “do away” with renewable energy subsidies. During the presidential election campaign, Donald J. Trump disparaged renewable energy as “very, very expensive” and “not working on a large scale.” He said a wind farm in California looked like a “junk yard” and claimed wind power killed birds in vast numbers. As president, he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change accord. So it’s no wonder that hardly anyone expected renewable energy subsidies to survive Republican tax reform. In the legislation the House of Representatives passed in November, Republicans drastically curtailed solar and wind power subsidies and put a stake in the heart of the tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles — all while preserving billions in subsidies for fossil fuels. Yet in the final tax bill Mr. Trump signed in December, there they are: the full panoply of tax incentives for renewable energy, as well as the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst for Morgan Stanley, called it a “surprise move” that suggests there may be deeper but little-recognized congressional support for electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them. Given that Tesla and General Motors are by far the top producers of electric vehicles, you’d expect their executives to be thrilled. G.M. has made a huge commitment to an electric vehicle future, and has pledged to have 20 new models on sale by 2023. It lobbied to preserve the incentives.

"WASHINGTON — A new front is opening in the battle to restore so-called net neutrality rules: state legislatures. Lawmakers in at least six states, including California and New York, have introduced bills in recent weeks that would forbid internet providers to block or slow down sites or online services. Legislators in several other states, including North Carolina and Illinois, are weighing similar action. They are responding to the Federal Communications Commission’s vote last month to end regulations that barred internet service providers from creating slow and fast lanes for different sites and services. The new policy will go into effect in the coming weeks. By passing their own law, the state lawmakers say, they would ensure that consumers would find the content of the choice, maintain a diversity of voices online and protect businesses from having to pay fees to reach users. And they might even have an effect beyond their states. California’s strict auto emissions standards, for example, have been followed by a dozen other states, giving California major sway over the auto industry. “There tends to be a follow-on effect, particularly when something happens in a big state like California,” said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at nonprofit consumer group, Public Knowledge, which supports net neutrality efforts by the states.

Of course, economists and economic historians these days are discouraged from writing books. Most of what I consume in these fields comes in the form of working papers and journal articles.

"HONG KONG — Michael Wolff’s book about the Trump administration has been getting mixed reviews from critics and others, but it’s finding fulsome praise in one corner: North Korean state media, which says the book’s popularity “foretells Trump’s political demise.” The book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” has apparently made its way to the so-called hermit kingdom, giving more ammunition to a North Korean government already in a raging propaganda war with President Trump. “The anti-Trump book is sweeping all over the world so Trump is being massively humiliated worldwide,” said a commentary in the country’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper, which is run by the ruling Workers’ Party. The book has sold so well in the United States — 29,000 hardcover copies the first weekend — that retailers are having trouble keeping it in stock, and digital and audio sales have topped 350,000. Pirated copies of the book are already circulating online in Asia. Rodong Sinmun said those sales figures were no surprise, given the worldwide enmity toward Mr. Trump, who has belittled the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Little Rocket Man” and suggested that the dictator’s “nuclear button” is too small. “Voices calling for the impeachment of Trump are on the rise not only in the United States but also abroad,” the commentary said. “Since the book was published, it has triggered a debate on whether Trump is qualified to be president, even in Western Europe.” Mr. Trump has derided the book and its author, and has threatened legal action to halt its publication, a warning the publisher, Henry Holt and Company, brushed off while moving up the book’s publication date. The book portrays Mr. Trump as inattentive, surrounded by aides who belittle his intelligence and capabilities, and describes the president as presiding over a dysfunctional White House. The administration has characterized the book as a “complete fantasy” full of “tabloid gossip.” The North Korean commentary comes after the country has refrained in recent days from attacking Mr. Trump as it held negotiations with South Korea that paved the way for the North’s participation in the Winter Olympics in February in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Oddly, the North through its commentary was praising a book whose title may be rooted in Mr. Trump’s threat to annihilate the country.

"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department took the first step toward carrying out the $1.5 trillion Republican tax overhaul on Thursday, releasing new tax withholding tables and encouraging companies to incorporate them as soon as possible so workers can begin seeing bigger paychecks. The legislation was signed into law late last month after moving through Congress at a blistering pace, sending companies scrambling to determine how the changes affect not only their own taxes but also their workers’ taxes, since employers must withhold federal and state taxes from employees’ paychecks. On Thursday, the Treasury Department told companies that they should incorporate the new, lower withholding rates no later than Feb. 15. “Workers will see changes in their February paychecks once employers adopt the new guidance,” it said. Withholding rates, which are based on income, marital status, number of dependents and other factors, affect the amount that employees take home in their paychecks. The withholding tables are changing because the new tax law does away with personal exemptions, doubles the standard deduction and lowers marginal tax rates. In anticipation of potential confusion over the new system, the Internal Revenue Service will release a calculator at the end of February so that workers can more accurately estimate how much of their income should be withheld from their paychecks. Workers who have too little or too much withheld can face a tax bill or penalties. The Trump administration, which has promised that the new tax law will put money back in workers’ pockets, is eager to ensure that the transition to a new tax code does not devolve into chaos and to show evidence that taxpayers are faring better under the new law.

This week, we’re looking at the causes behind California’s mudslides; why coal and nuclear power are fighting for survival; and the Trump administration’s effort to delete “climate change.” If, as some scientists think, climate change may make for more frequent severe wildfire seasons in California, it may lead to more deadly mudslides as well. That’s because in California, as in other fire-prone regions, fires and mudslides are inextricably linked.

"WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives voted on Thursday to extend the National Security Agency’s warrantless surveillance program for six years with minimal changes, rejecting a push by a bipartisan group of lawmakers to impose significant privacy limits when it sweeps up Americans’ emails and other personal communications. The vote, 256 to 164, centered on an expiring law that permits the government, without a warrant, to collect communications from United States companies like Google and AT&T of foreigners abroad — even when those targets are talking to Americans. Congress had enacted the law in 2008 to legalize a form of a once-secret warrantless surveillance program created after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Hours before the vote, President Trump set off last-minute turmoil as Republicans scrambled to secure enough support to extend the law without new privacy constraints. In a Twitter  post Thursday morning, shortly after “Fox & Friends” aired a segment discussing the issue, Mr. Trump expressed skepticism about government surveillance — even though a White House statement issued on Wednesday night urged Congress to block significant new constraints on the N.S.A. program. The legislation must still pass the Senate. But fewer senators appear to favor major change to spying laws, so the vote on Thursday in the House was the pivotal test. Effectively, the vote was almost certainly the end of a debate over 21st-century surveillance and privacy rights that broke out in 2013 after the leaks by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/fisa-surveillance-congress-trump.html?searchResultPosition=32
"People who bought policies from Centene, a large for-profit health insurance company, filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday claiming the company does not provide adequate access to doctors in 15 states. “Members have difficulty finding — and in many cases cannot find — medical providers,” who will accept patients covered under policies sold by Centene, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington State. “Centene misrepresents the number, location and existence of purported providers by listing physicians, medical groups and other providers — some of whom have specifically asked to be removed — as participants in their networks and by listing nurses and other non-physicians as primary care providers,” the lawsuit claims. People signed up for insurance and they “ discovered there were no doctors,” said Seth Lesser, a partner at the law firm of Klafter Olsen & Lesser who is representing some of the policyholders. A spokeswoman for Centene said that the company had not seen the lawsuit. “We believe our networks are adequate and we work in partnership with our states to ensure our networks are adequate and our members have access to high-quality health care,” she said in an email. Centene, which also provides coverage to low-income individuals under the government Medicaid program, has proved to be one of the mainstays of the Affordable Care Act. After many other large insurers abandoned the individual market created by the federal law and as President Trump has sought to dismantle the law, Centene doubled-down and has become one of the largest insurers still offering policies.

"One of the clearest patterns in public health research is the correlation between income and health. The richer you are, the more likely you are to have good health, and live a long life. The poorer you are, the more likely you are to be sicker, and die younger. That data could be an argument for just giving poor people money to improve their health. But in general, the way states and the federal government try to make poor people healthier is by giving them health insurance instead. Now the Trump administration wants to make a major change to Medicaid, the main program used to provide health care for the poor. Instead of simply providing Medicaid to poor Americans whose incomes are low enough, it is encouraging states to require childless adults without disabilities to work or take part in  “community engagement activities” in order to obtain Medicaid. The idea behind the change is that requiring work will help move more Medicaid beneficiaries into the work force and out of poverty. And, legally, it rests on the contention that the requirements themselves will make those people healthier, since improving health is the stated purpose of the Medicaid statute. There is not strong evidence for that contention. “Higher earnings are positively correlated with longer lifespan,” says a guidance document published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Thursday.

"WASHINGTON — A probe into the Treasury Department’s role in crafting and assessing the Trump administration’s tax plan found no evidence of any improper political interference with the career tax staff, but cast doubt on whether the department’s robust economic growth projections were achievable. The Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General launched a probe into the practices of Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis after The New York Times reported on the lack of a Treasury analysis of the $1.5 trillion tax plan and concerns that career tax staff were shut out of the tax bill process. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, had repeatedly asserted that the tax bill would pay for itself and that Treasury staff were working on a detailed analysis of the plan’s costs that would bear out that assertion. The Treasury Department did not provide that analysis before the Senate voted on the tax bill and did not provide Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, a promised analysis showing the tax plan would not add to the federal deficit. The lack of the analysis raised questions whether Treasury’s team of tax experts could really back up Mr. Mnuchin’s claims that the tax bill would not balloon the deficit. “It is unclear whether the Department’s involvement in the tax legislating process in 2017 has been any more or less ‘political’ than it has been in past years,” Rich Delmar, the counsel to the inspector general, wrote in a report outlining its findings. “I do not see a basis to conclude that the process employed by Treasury this past year was contrary to law, an abuse of authority or otherwise improper.” The career tax staff officials interviewed by the inspector general said that they were not shut out of the process or ordered to hide their work. In a letter outlining the report, Eric M. Thorson, the inspector general, said that Office of Tax Analysis officials said their analyses were not released publicly because the office had gotten the impression, as the legislative drafting process picked up, that Congressional staff and lawmakers were “less interested in getting OTA’s input.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/treasury-inspector-general-finds-no-political-meddling-in-tax-analysis.html?searchResultPosition=28

Here’s what you need to know: • House Republicans proposed a hard-line immigration policy on Wednesday that clashed with President Trump’s talk the day before of a bipartisan deal. The House proposal could complicate negotiations over government funding, which is scheduled to run out next Friday. Anxiously watching the debate are the “Dreamers,” the roughly 800,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who could soon face deportation. After a judge ordered the Trump administration to restart the program that protects the Dreamers, President Trump called the U.S. court system “broken and unfair.” • Also on Wednesday, federal agents raided 7-Eleven convenience stores in 17 states, arresting 21 people. The sweep was part of a growing effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement against businesses that hire unauthorized workers.

"To the Editor: Re “Request to Check Citizenship Stirs Fears for Census” (news article, Jan. 3): It is with questionable motivation that the Justice Department is seeking to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census. But even giving the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt, whatever good intentions may underlie this request — acquiring more information, in theory, can be a good thing — a likely result is that many immigrants will fear participating in the census because of this administration’s words and deeds thus far addressing this group. In turn, this lower participation among immigrants will significantly affect both the redistribution of seats across states in the House of Representatives and the allocation of much federal spending that occurs every decade based on the most recent census. Clearly, here the practical considerations outweigh any theoretical benefits. There is a reason that the professionals at the Census Bureau have chosen to exclude a question of this sort, and the administration should not impose its political agenda on the bureau and compromise the accuracy of the census.

"WASHINGTON — Nearly a year into her tenure as first lady — and after a week of intense scrutiny prompted by a new book that claims she had dreaded life in the White House — Melania Trump has hired a director of policy to advance her nascent platform. For months, Mrs. Trump’s East Wing had searched for a policy director who could further an agenda that has been broadly defined as helping children. On Thursday, the White House announced the first lady’s choice: Reagan Thompson, 27, who had previously served as an executive assistant on the National Security Council. Before working for the N.S.C., Ms. Thompson was a communications and policy adviser for Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, when he was a hard-line Republican congressman. It is unclear how Ms. Thompson’s background in serving Mr. Pompeo — she has described her duties with him as “working on issues for the intelligence and Benghazi committees and on Iran, Guantánamo and Asia” — may help her in her new role. But in a statement, Mrs. Trump said that Ms. Thompson, as well as two other aides whose hirings were announced on Thursday, had demonstrated “true professionalism.” “Reagan’s experience with various statewide and national campaigns will be a big asset as the first lady and her team prepare to roll out her official platform in the coming months,” Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, said in an email.

"WASHINGTON — Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said on Thursday that he would not challenge the Democratic incumbent senator, Heidi Heitkamp, in this year’s midterm elections. It was just the latest indication of the difficulty Republicans are having recruiting candidates in what had looked to be a highly favorable climate in the wake of President Trump’s inauguration a year ago. Ms. Heitkamp is among 10 Democrats seeking re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mr. Cramer had been seen as a top-tier challenger in a state the president carried by 36 percentage points. He made his announcement during a North Dakota radio program. “This is shaping up to be a tough cycle for Republicans across the board,” said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor for The Cook Political Report who specializes in Senate races. “It only makes sense that recruiting is going to be difficult. For someone like Cramer, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to give up a safe seat for a difficult race in a lousy environment.” That assessment is an abrupt reversal of how most analysts saw the midterm landscape shaping up a year ago. Democrats are defending 24 seats, including those in states Mr. Trump won, compared with eight for Republicans. But the president’s chaotic first term has led to the lowest approval ratings for any first-term president at this time in his tenure in the history of polling, and he is now seen as a drag for many candidates. Two Independent senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, are also up for re-election. The environment also became hostile for Republicans who clashed with the president, and two of them, Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, surprisingly announced that they would not seek another term. Those states are now rated as tossups by The Cook Political Report.

"Guess what? Donald Trump is a raving idiot. Every sentient person knows this, and if Michael Wolff is to be believed, so does most everyone in the White House. So why are we talking about Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury” as if it’s the news sensation of the decade? The answer lies in that timeless definition of the word “gossip”: Hearing something you like about someone you don’t. “Fire and Fury” is catnip for everyone who detests this president. Trump gorges on burgers in a bed he doesn’t share with his wife! He barely reads and constantly repeats himself! He has mastered the fine print in the Bill of Rights — all the way from the First to the Third Amendment! But gossip isn’t journalism. And Wolff’s book is Exhibit A in how not to damage Trump’s presidency, much less his chances of re-election. So much was apparent in Tuesday’s televised meeting of the president with congressional leaders to discuss immigration. This was not a good performance by past presidential standards: Trump seemed unable to grasp what a “clean” bill meant, or where Republicans stood on it. Oklahoma Senator James Lankford acknowledged as much when he said the meeting got “confusing.” Yet to a normal person casually tuning in, the president appeared reasonably affable and businesslike. He listened. He cracked an appropriate joke. He said he was prepared to defer to the wishes of Congress. Where was the drooling man-child we had been led to expect from Wolff’s book and the nonstop coverage of it? The net result is that “Fire and Fury” has so thoroughly succeeded in lowering public expectations for Trump that it makes it that much easier for him to exceed them. If the White House were smart it would tweet photos of Trump reading Dean Acheson’s “Present at the Creation” looking deeply engrossed. That should inspire a half-dozen Washington Times columns on how the press used to think Reagan and Eisenhower were boobs, too.

"I guess Donald Trump was eager to counter the impression in Michael Wolff’s book that he is irascible, mentally small and possibly insane. On Tuesday, he allowed a bipartisan session in the White House about immigration to be televised for nearly an hour. Surely, he thought that he would be able to demonstrate to the world his lucidity and acumen, his grasp of the issues and his relish for rapprochement with his political adversaries. But instead what came through was the image of a man who had absolutely no idea what he was talking about; a man who says things that are 180 degrees from the things he has said before; a man who has no clear line of reasoning; a man who is clearly out of his depth and willing to do and say anything to please the people in front of him. He demonstrated once again that he is a man without principle, interested only in how good he can make himself look and how much money he can make. Yes, he has an intrinsic hostility to people who are not white, particularly when they challenge him, but as a matter of policy, the whole idea of building a wall for which Mexico would pay was just a cheap campaign stunt to, once again, please the people in front of him. Trump is not committed to that wall on principle. He is committed only to looking good as a result of whatever comes of it. Mexico is never going to pay for it, and he knows it. He has always known it. That was just another lie. Someone must have stuck the phrases “chain migration” and “diversity lottery” into his brain — easy buzzwords, you see — and he can now rail against those ideas for applause lines.

"The new United States ambassador to the Netherlands refused on Wednesday to answer questions about his 2015 statement that politicians and cars had been burned by Muslims in the Netherlands, a claim he has not substantiated. “Do you now reach the conclusion that you were wrong when you stated that politicians and cars were being burned?” a reporter asked the ambassador, Peter Hoekstra, in his first news conference with Dutch journalists. “Was that a wrong remark, was it false?” “I issued a statement, I expressed my regrets and my apology for the comments that I made,” the ambassador replied. “And I am not revisiting the issue.” The ambassador, a former Republican congressman from Michigan who was appointed to the position in The Hague by President Trump, had referred in 2015 to “no-go zones,” erroneously suggesting there were Muslim-ruled enclaves in the Netherlands that are outside the government’s control. Reporters seeking clarification on Wednesday asked him about a half dozen follow up questions. “Are politicians being burned in the Netherlands in the past? Is that something you believe? Yes or no,” one asked. The ambassador repeated that he did not want to revisit the remarks and that he had expressed regrets. He then stopped replying, looking silently around the room as journalists continued to question him, according to a video published by The Associated Press. “Any example of a Dutch politician who is burned in recent years?” one reporter asked. “This is the Netherlands, you have to answer questions,” another said, as Mr. Hoekstra remained silent. “Please, this is not how it works,” another reporter said. On Friday, the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported that Mr. Hoekstra had acknowledged in an interview that he had made the controversial statement and that it had been “wrong.” Mr. Hoekstra made the original remarks at a conference hosted by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a conservative group, where he argued that the “Islamic movement” had plunged Europe into chaos. “Chaos in the Netherlands. There are cars being burned. There are politicians that are being burned,” Mr. Hoekstra said. “And yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.” The comments were captured on video, but Mr. Hoekstra denied ever having made them in an interview last month with Wouter Zwart, a reporter with the Dutch news program Nieuwsuur. “I didn’t say that. That is actually an incorrect statement,” Mr. Hoekstra told Mr. Zwart. “Yeah, we would call it fake news.” Shortly after that, in the same interview, Mr. Hoekstra denied having used the term “fake news.” After the interview, Mr. Hoekstra, who was born in the Netherlands but moved to the United States as a child, said in a statement that he had “made certain remarks” in 2015 and expressed “regret” for the exchange with Mr. Zwart. “Please accept my apology,” he wrote.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Gov. Jerry Brown moved to bolster California’s “rainy day” fund Wednesday when he unveiled the final budget proposal of his administration in Sacramento, asking the Legislature not to take the state’s economic stability for granted, while also deflecting questions about his legacy. His message centered on a warning: “What’s out there is darkness, uncertainty, decline and recession. So good luck, baby,” he said with a smile. Flanked by blown-up cardboard graphs, he predicted that his successors would probably face an economic recession in the near future and said he was determined to minimize the damage. The $132 billion budget plan centered heavily on infusing the emergency fund with $5 billion in the coming fiscal year — bringing the total stash to $13.5 billion — in order to prevent layoffs and soften other painful budget cuts in a downturn. He and his team said the progress California has made since 2011, when it was teetering on the edge of financial catastrophe, is more reason to double-down on the emergency fund. Today the state has a $6.1 billion surplus. “Yes, we have had some very good years and program spending has steadily increased,” reads his opening message in the budget. “Let’s not blow it now.” There are several obstacles facing the governor before his term expires.

"Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, waded into the bumpy waters of partisan politics on Thursday, announcing that it will use some of its savings under the new tax bill to provide wage increases, bonuses and expanded benefits to its hourly workers. The giant retailer, which faces stiff competition for qualified workers in a tight labor market and pressure from unions to increase wages, said it would raise its minimum starting wage to $11 an hour, from $9. It will also expand maternity and family leave benefits, and give bonuses of up to $1,000 to eligible employees. By tying its pay increases to the tax break it expects to receive, as other large companies have done in recent weeks, Walmart provided support for claims by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress that the new tax law will benefit not just the wealthy but also working-class Americans. “This law is helping improve people’s lives,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a tweet on Thursday, citing Walmart’s actions. But within hours, Walmart had undercut its triumphal message when news leaked that it was closing 63 of its Sam’s Club stores. Sam’s Club, a retail chain offering memberships, was soon trending on Twitter, and labor groups and Senate Democrats seized on the news to question Walmart’s motives and criticize the tax bill as failing to protect low-wage workers.

"Twenty-seven billion dollars has gone missing on Wall Street. For more than a decade, the world’s top investment banks practically minted money from the buying and selling of bonds, currencies and other complex securities. For many banks, the business became their lifeblood. Now, a combination of tough regulations, new technologies, calm markets and changing customer behavior has left that type of trading a shadow of its former self — and much of Wall Street trying to redefine itself. Five years ago, fixed-income trading — so called because its keystone product, bonds, typically provides a fixed payout — generated nearly $103 billion in income for the top 12 investment banks, according to Coalition, a London research firm. By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion — down $27 billion from the peak. The accelerating losses are likely to be on display over the next week as the biggest United States banks report their annual results, starting with JPMorgan Chase on Friday. Some analysts predict that fixed-income revenue could fall another 20 percent this year. Some large banks, including Deutsche Bank, have already warned that the bond-trading blood bath will get worse. The trend is not only depriving giant investment banks of a staple income source. It is also altering the pecking order and business practices of Wall Street in profound ways. Nowhere is the shift more pronounced, or more painful, than at Goldman Sachs Group, not long ago regarded as the unrivaled king of Wall Street.

"One of the last official acts of New Jersey’s outgoing governor, Chris Christie, may be to have his cash-strapped statewide transit agency pay about $12 million to buy a maintenance facility for boats that it does not have. New Jersey Transit, the much-maligned operator of commuter trains and buses, wants to acquire the only remaining dry docks in Hoboken for the exclusive use of a privately held ferry company, New York Waterway. If the agency goes through with the purchase, it will do so over the strenuous objections of Hoboken’s new mayor, Ravinder S. Bhalla, and his predecessor, Dawn Zimmer, who is a member of the transition team of Mr. Christie’s successor, Philip D. Murphy. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, has chosen a commissioner of transportation who will chair the board of directors of New Jersey Transit as of next week. But that may be a few days too late for the plan’s opponents, many of whom want the waterfront site turned into a public park. The agency’s board had been scheduled to vote on the purchase on Wednesday morning, but that meeting was abruptly canceled and rescheduled, first for Friday and then for Monday, which will be Mr. Christie’s last full day as governor and is a state holiday. The postponement provided Mr. Bhalla and his allies with an additional 48 hours to try to block a sale that they say is a political favor to a successful company and an attempt to circumvent Hoboken’s ability to decide how land within its borders should be used. Mr. Bhalla called the postponed vote “a tremendous victory for Hoboken, and more important, for good government.” He said that “hitting the pause button on this rushed and ill-conceived plan” would allow New Jersey Transit, under new leadership, to reconsider the idea, using “a deliberative and transparent planning process that considers input from all stakeholders, including the public.” The delayed vote was just the latest twist in the long struggle for control of the last vestige of Hoboken’s industrial shoreline. Once lined with working docks teeming with longshoremen — a rough trade captured in the 1954 movie “On the Waterfront” — the city’s Hudson River waterfront is now lined with parks, luxury condominiums and office buildings.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would allow states to impose work requirements in Medicaid, a major policy shift that moves toward fulfilling a conservative vision for one of the nation’s largest social insurance programs for low-income people. Federal officials said they would support state efforts to require able-bodied adults to work or participate in other “community engagement activities” as a condition of eligibility for Medicaid. “Our fundamental goal is to make a positive and lasting difference in the health and wellness of our beneficiaries, and today’s announcement is a step in that direction,” said Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Ms. Verma said the Trump administration was responding to requests from Medicaid officials in 10 states that wanted to run demonstration projects testing requirements for work or other types of community engagement like training, education, job search, volunteer activities and caregiving. Under the new policy, Trump administration officials would allow work requirements in Medicaid somewhat similar to those already imposed in other programs like food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the welfare program known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. In a speech to state Medicaid officials in November, Ms. Verma indicated that the Trump administration would be receptive to work requirements and other conservative policy ideas to reshape Medicaid. And she criticized the Obama administration, saying it had focused on increasing Medicaid enrollment rather than helping people move out of poverty and into jobs.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump, meeting with lawmakers on immigration, said he’d like to see immigrants from Norway, not “shithole countries” like Haiti. Elsewhere in Washington, the House voted against restricting a surveillance program that permits the government to collect, without a warrant, the emails and other communications of foreigners abroad — even when they are talking to Americans. The vote was a victory for the intelligence community and the Trump administration. There was some bad news for the White House too: Mr. Trump’s approval rating has fallen across a range of demographic groups, including among white voters, evangelical Christians and rural Americans. ____ ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/briefing/california-walmart-eric-greitens.html?searchResultPosition=12
