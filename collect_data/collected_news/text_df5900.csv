"From the outset, Gary D. Cohn was an unconventional choice to be President Trump’s top economic adviser. A former Goldman Sachs president and proponent of free trade, Mr. Cohn had a pedigree and economic views that clashed with Mr. Trump’s populist rhetoric and protectionist policies. His methodical approach also contrasted with the president’s freewheeling style. But Mr. Cohn, who said on Tuesday that he would resign as director of the National Economic Council, brought to the Trump administration something that the president himself lacked: the widespread respect of top corporate executives. Now, those business leaders are lamenting the loss of one of their own from what is among the country’s most important economic positions. “Gary brought a strong growth orientation for the economy and a very balanced perspective, particularly on critical topics like trade,” said Rich Lesser, chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group, who served on one of Mr. Trump’s business advisory panels last year and attended policy meetings with Mr. Cohn. “He’ll be missed.” Mr. Cohn was instrumental in putting together the sweeping tax law that was enacted last year, legislation that delivered a windfall to corporations and was the main policy achievement of Mr. Trump’s first year in office.

"One appointee went from “battleground states” director for the Trump presidential campaign to a role at the State Department that sent him to South Africa to meet with health officials. Another traded in her campaign experience as a field director in Virginia for a federal job promoting nuclear energy sales abroad. And another, who spent four months on the campaign in New York after graduating from college, landed a job as an aide to the commerce secretary with a résumé that included work as a receptionist at an animal hospital and a summer job at a country club’s golf shop. The three newly minted federal employees are among the nearly 260 or so former Trump campaign and inauguration workers who have gotten jobs reserved for political appointees in the administration, according to public records compiled by ProPublica and analyzed by The New York Times. In all, more than 2,475 political appointees have joined the federal government since President Trump took office, including at least 187 former lobbyists and also 125 people with ties to conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, the records show. A database of the employees, assembled through hundreds of open records requests, has been posted online by ProPublica. It offers a comprehensive look at how Mr. Trump is influencing the direction of the federal government, beyond high-profile cabinet appointments and other Senate-confirmed posts, and how he has rewarded people who have been loyal to him or share his priorities.

"SEOUL, South Korea — He has never traveled abroad as North Korea’s supreme leader. Until this week, his close encounters with foreign guests had been limited to dignitaries from China, Cuba and Syria — and Dennis Rodman. He increasingly resembles his grandfather, a national deity, down to the coifed flattop, gregarious grin and rotund waist. So when a delegation of South Korean officials arrived to visit they did not know what to expect from the leader, Kim Jong-un, a 34-year-old with a nuclear arsenal, who has remained an enigma even as his weapons tests have terrified the world. The envoys, some old enough to be Mr. Kim’s father, were taken aback by his friendliness and “forthcoming and daring” responses during a Monday meeting in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, that exceeded four hours, according to South Korean officials. They had worried that Mr. Kim would threaten a fragile détente if South Korea and the United States resumed joint military exercises next month. Previously, the North has responded to such drills with missile tests and shrill warnings of a nuclear strike on America. “We hope you can make another bold decision so we can overcome this hurdle,” read a bullet point in the handwritten memo carried by the South’s chief delegate, Chung Eui-yong. An image of the memo was captured by the North’s state-run television. Mr. Kim surprised the South Korean diplomats not only by accepting joint South Korean-United States military drills as a reality, but also by expressing a willingness to start negotiations with Washington on ending his nuclear weapons program. He also told them he would suspend all nuclear and ballistic missile tests while such talks were underway. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Serve Donald Trump at your own risk. Being a top aide in his administration doesn’t usually work out well. Some former advisers, like Michael Flynn, are in legal trouble. Others, like Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci, became laughing stocks. Still others have tarnished once-sterling reputations. Gary Cohn falls into the last category. Before working for Trump, Cohn had an underdog story good enough for a best-selling book. He overcame dyslexia, talked his way into a job at Goldman Sachs and rose to the No. 2 job at the firm. Shortly after Trump’s election, Cohn accepted a job as the top White House economic adviser. He took it, everyone seems to understand, in the hope that Trump would later name him Federal Reserve chairman. That didn’t happen. After Trump praised white supremacists last summer, Cohn offered a lukewarm criticism that managed to fall short of courageous while also infuriating his boss. Cohn was never again a leading candidate for the Fed job, which went instead to Jerome Powell, another former banker then serving not under Trump but as a Fed official. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Turkish government took the extraordinary step on Wednesday of asking the United States to stop Kurdish commanders from diverting their forces from areas of eastern Syria to the fight in Afrin in the west. The request followed an announcement from the Kurdish forces, which are allied with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State militant group, that they intended to send 1,700 fighters from Deir al-Zour, a strategically important eastern province, to the fight against Turkey in Afrin, a Kurdish enclave. Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, said his country had taken “the necessary steps” through official channels and “expected from the U.S. that it should absolutely step in” to prevent the movement of the Kurdish forces from Manbij to Afrin. “This is our most natural right,” Mr. Kalin added. It was not clear why Mr. Kalin had referred to Manbij, a city at the westernmost point of the Syrian territory held by the Kurds, though it might have been cited as a way station for the troops as they moved toward Afrin. There was no immediate American response to the request by the Turks, an American ally and NATO member that invaded Afrin in January and threatened to drive the Kurds from the entire Syria-Turkey border. But the Turkish assault has since bogged down. The fighting in Afrin is creating problems for the United States. The transfer of personnel from the Kurdish-led, American-backed militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., is a blow to Washington’s effort to stamp out the last vestiges of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

"BEIJING — When China hosted the last serious talks on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, in the mid-2000s, the setting was a huge, hexagonal table covered in green felt, in a government guesthouse in Beijing. At each side of the table, made specially by the Chinese, were diplomats from one of the six countries involved: North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China itself. Months passed between sessions, sometimes a year. Occasionally, China rearranged the seating, hoping for better chemistry among the delegates as they endured the complex, eye-glazing proceedings. In 2009, North Korea walked out — ending, to China’s dismay, the so-called six-party talks that Beijing had nurtured and prodded along for six years. Nearly a decade later, China is a bystander as President Trump says he’s open to the North’s new offer to talk. Even so, analysts say, Beijing is sure to be pleased by the prospect of a drawn-out diplomatic process that delays the possibility of war on its border — even if the talks ultimately come to nothing. And the new warmth between North and South Korea, which plan to hold a summit meeting next month, is a further boon to China, which would welcome any strains in the South’s alliance with the United States. “China’s priority is for the tension to be defused and for the talks to start,” said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, a research institute in Washington. “The Chinese have acknowledged their inability to make that happen, so they are O.K. with not leading the campaign.” "
"With Uber and Lyft cars taking over Manhattan streets, a state task force has proposed a surcharge of $2 to $5 on rides in for-hire vehicles as part of a broader congestion pricing plan to keep traffic moving and raise money to shore up public transit. But now a prominent transportation expert, Bruce Schaller, contends that those fees are simply too low to deter most passengers from calling cars, and in any case, would result in only a temporary reduction in congestion before being offset by the rapidly growing ride-hailing services. In a new report on Wednesday, Mr. Schaller calls instead for charging all for-hire vehicles — including yellow taxis and Uber and Lyft cars — $50 per hour to drive in Midtown Manhattan during weekday business hours, and $20 per hour in Lower Manhattan, the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side. Mr. Schaller, a former city transportation official, said he based the fees on current parking garage prices in Manhattan. “It takes high parking fees to really discourage people from driving into Manhattan,” said Mr. Schaller, who advised to the state task force. “Uber and Lyft and taxi passengers need the same price signals.” The hourly fee would be passed along to passengers. By his calculation, the average fare for a ride that begins and ends in Midtown would more than double to $24 from $10. The average fare for rides from Midtown to other Manhattan neighborhoods, or vice versa, would increase to $28 from $14, he said. It would also apply to vehicles even when they are not carrying passengers to discourage drivers from just circulating around Manhattan streets looking for business. Mr. Schaller said those fees would be billed to ride-hailing companies and taxi owners, who could pass that on to passengers through higher fares. "
"Stocks on Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday, a day after President Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, said he would resign amid an internal White House dispute over the decision to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. • The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index recovered much of its opening-bell losses, ending the day slightly lower, by less than a tenth of a percent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed lower by a third of a percent, while the Nasdaq composite ended in positive territory, gaining a third of a percent. • Earlier in the day, Asian markets closed lower, while European markets ended the session higher. The yield on a 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The global declines came as the plans to impose tariffs drew condemnation and threats of retaliation from major American trading partners, including Canada, China and the European Union. The announcement by Mr. Cohn that he would leave the administration amplified those fears. Mr. Cohn had argued against imposing tariffs. Stock markets had made gains in recent days, but Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients that those moves were largely to do with a belief that the president’s advisers, like Mr. Cohn, and fellow Republican Party leaders would rein in the proposals. “That optimism is fading this morning,” the analysts said. They added that Mr. Cohn’s resignation suggests “that Trump is leaning heavily towards some form of protectionist measures. Needless to say that Cohn’s resignation also leaves further question marks around Trump’s economic agenda.” "
"The announcement that President Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, plans to resign after apparently losing a battle over raising tariffs ratchets up concern that the White House is turning sharply toward protectionism. The deepest fear is that the planned steel and aluminum tariffs will echo the mistake of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which provoked a global trade war and helped fuel the Great Depression. The alarmists are getting a bit ahead of the story, however. Periods of deglobalization — when nations begin shuttering their borders to flows of trade, money and people — tended to be slow processes, not sudden events. They started with tectonic shifts — global wars and crises — not minor import levies. And they unfolded over decades, not years. The last era of deglobalization actually began when countries turned inward after World War I, more than a decade before Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression. It is important to view Mr. Trump’s latest trade actions in that historical context. The suggested higher tariffs on steel and aluminum are too narrowly targeted to trigger a trade war but represent another chapter in the evolving era of deglobalization. This era began long before Mr. Trump took office, but he is now capitalizing on the popular backlash against globalization. The mood turned decisively after the Great Recession of 2008. Trade collapsed as a share of the world economy, and despite some pickup in the past two years, trade has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. One big reason: the barriers that countries like India and Russia have been raising to block the flow of trade, money and people at their borders. In every year since 2010, the leading economies have instituted more discriminatory trade measures than liberalizing ones, according to data from Global Trade Alert. The difference with Mr. Trump is that he is reviving the old-school and easily detected weapon of the tariff. Many other countries have been using a wide array of non-tariff barriers. Some are stealthy, like hidden subsidies for export industries. Others are blatant, like barring foreign competitors outright. Though the world is now a decade into this age of deglobalization — with flows of money and migrants also running well below the peaks reached before 2008 — it’s an exaggeration to compare Trump’s tariffs to a tipping point like Smoot-Hawley.

"The current president may be completely uninterested in cultivating a number of traditional political skills — among them a sense of discretion and at least the semblance of self-control — but he has an uncanny feel for political symbolism, especially when it comes to the role of manufacturing in the United States. Factory work provides a diminishing share of working-class jobs: There were 43,000 iron and steelworkers last year, compared with almost 2 million hospital and home health aides. But to hear President Trump tell it, the factory workers are the ones who matter most. Just last week, he declared steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, tweeting that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” Joshua B. Freeman’s rich and ambitious “Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World” depicts a world in retreat that still looms large in the national imagination. “Behemoth” is more than an economic history, or a chronicle of architectural feats and labor movements. Freeman, a professor at Queens College and the Graduate Center of CUNY, traces the rise of the factory and how it became entwined with Enlightenment ideas of progress — “the notion that through human effort and rationality the world could be transformed toward greater abundance, well-being and moral order.” Factories weren’t always imbued with such lofty ideals. They were initially devised “to take advantage of mundane commercial opportunities,” Freeman writes. He dates the first factory to 1721: a silk mill, built in Derby, England. In the decade after it opened, Daniel Defoe paid it a visit, declaring it “a Curiosity of a very extraordinary Nature.” The proliferation of these curiosities, culminating in the Industrial Revolution, took some time. Obtaining machinery and technical know-how often entailed some trade espionage, before the British government took an active hand in promoting industrial development. Labor discipline was another matter. In the farming and domestic work that people had been doing for generations, “intense activity alternated with slack times,” whereas factory production was repetitive and continuous, requiring “coordinated activity by dozens or hundreds of workers, who were expected to start and stop work at the same time, day after day.” Now that factory work and stable, blue-collar jobs are such potent sources of nostalgia, it can be hard to recall how truly disruptive the manufacturing age was. Freeman does a superb job of reminding us. For an agrarian society like England, the factory generated a wistfulness for the bucolic agricultural past. The “dark Satanic Mills” bemoaned by William Blake were powered by steam and coal-fired boilers that belched smoke and soot. Seventy-hour work weeks were common. Male workers chafed at the constant supervision on the factory floor, and owners preferred not to employ men, anyway. “Today, in the United States, factories are associated with masculinity,” Freeman writes, “but in their early days they were spaces largely occupied by women and children.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Top Economic Adviser to Quit After Tariff Dispute” (front page, March 7): It seems rather odd that Gary Cohn chose not to resign over President Trump’s comments about the Charlottesville march (“very fine people on both sides”), and yet finds that the president’s trade war has crossed some sort of personal line in the sand. Moreover, as a Jew (as am I), he opted not to speak out in the face of anti-Semitic rhetoric sanctioned by his boss. Mr. Cohn’s service in this administration seems to be predicated solely on making sure the tax cut was enacted. Any thought that he is taking a principled stand on the trade issue is disingenuous and self-serving and rings hollow. SHARON RUZUMNA

"Peter Thiel is Silicon Valley’s homegrown Cassandra. He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed. Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming. Trouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on Facebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the world, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the United States. Even people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming. “The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,” Mr. Thiel said. “We were far from perfect in doing that.” Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley, ranging from the tech elite’s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel obtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger audience). Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump, whom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a typical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley peers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to talk about both. “It’s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,” Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.

Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. As the Trump administration weighs whether to block the chip maker’s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a central issue is how much of a threat the deal is to national security. In an effort to assuage concerns, Broadcom pledged Wednesday to increase research spending on 5G wireless tech and to create a $1.5 billion fund to invest in training engineering talent in the United States to help allay those concerns. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer. Beyond Broadcom’s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let’s take a look at a number of factors. Sales First, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: According to Broadcom’s most recent annual report, roughly 7 percent of its $17.6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States. The single biggest market for the company is China, which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue. “Other” markets made up nearly 38 percent. "
"To the Editor: Re “Go Ahead, Millennials, Destroy Us,” by Tim Kreider (Op-Ed, March 3): It shouldn’t be necessary to vilify one generation to support claims for a younger one, but writers often succumb to that rhetorical temptation. While I applaud and fully support the efforts of high school students to bring about meaningful gun control in this violence-addicted country, I also reflect on the fact that — having been born in 1944 — I have witnessed members of my generation energize the civil rights struggle, bring an end to the Vietnam War, create the feminist revolution, make important strides toward nuclear disarmament and environmental protection, and help elect this country’s first black president.

"JERUSALEM — In two months, the United States plans to open a new embassy to fulfill President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. There’s just one problem: The embassy may be in Jerusalem, but it may not be fully in Israel. The diplomatic compound that will serve as the American Embassy until a permanent site is found lies partly in a contested zone known as No Man’s Land. No Man’s Land encompasses the area between the armistice lines drawn at the end of the 1948-49 war and was claimed by Jordan and Israel. Israel won full control of it in the 1967 war, so the United Nations and much of the world consider it occupied territory. The State Department has avoided taking a clear position on the matter but relies on the fact that Israel and Jordan had informally divided the contested enclave. The provisional embassy site, in the Arnona neighborhood, “has been in continuous Israeli use since 1949,” the department said in a statement last week. “It is today a mixed residential-commercial neighborhood.” "

"WASHINGTON — Growing up in New York, Sam Nunberg loved the tabloids, and was dazzled by the real estate developer who dominated them. He admired Donald J. Trump, the crude-talking billionaire who did not seem to care what others thought as he shot from the hip in interviews with Howard Stern and held court on professional wrestling specials. Years later, after campaigning for Mitt Romney and making contacts in conservative circles, Mr. Nunberg was one of the first people to take the idea of a Trump presidential campaign seriously. “I’d followed him for years,” Mr. Nunberg, 36, said of Mr. Trump. “I was heavily invested into that campaign. I didn’t care what the Republican National Committee people thought.” When he came aboard early in the campaign, he already had a mentor in Roger J. Stone Jr., who self-identified as a dirty trickster. He helped craft some of Mr. Trump’s most hard-line rhetoric that was rolled out during the campaign, including the idea of a border wall. And he was involved in writing Mr. Trump’s tweets ahead of the presidential run, developing them as a tool to amplify his voice. But in 2014, before the campaign had officially begun, Mr. Nunberg became one of its first casualties, and after a brief return he was fired again. On Monday, he resurfaced, apparently bearing grievances. He delivered a series of bizarre televised interviews describing his initial unwillingness to share what he knows about the campaign’s early days with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating the campaign’s ties to Russian officials. Among other off-the-cuff declarations, Mr. Nunberg said that the president may have “done something” during the campaign in regard to Russia. “The president very well might not have done anything,” Mr. Nunberg said on Tuesday about the possibility of Russian collusion. “But he could’ve. That’s why we have an independent counsel.” "

"Christina Hoff Sommers is a self-identified feminist and registered Democrat with a Ph.D. in philosophy and a wicked sense of humor. She is also a woman who says bad things. Things like: Men and women are equal, but there are differences between them. Or: The gender gap in STEM fields isn’t simply the result of sexism. Or: Contrary to received wisdom, the American school system actually favors girls, not boys. When such a person steps foot on a college campus these days, you know what’s coming. So it was on Monday at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Ore., where Ms. Sommers had been invited by the Federalist Society to give a talk about feminism. In advance of the lecture, nine student groups, among them the Portland National Lawyers Guild, the Minority Law Student Association, the Women’s Law Caucus, the Jewish Law Society and the school’s Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter sent a letter protesting the appearance by this “known fascist.” The letter added that her invitation amounted to an “act of aggression and violence” and went on to offer a curious definition of free speech: “Freedom of speech is certainly an important tenet to a free, healthy society, but that freedom stops when it has a negative and violent impact on other individuals.” Yes, these future lawyers believe that free speech is acceptable only when it doesn’t offend them. Which is to say, they don’t believe in it at all. For the lecture itself, a student wearing a jacket emblazoned with the command “Stay Woke” led protesters in shouting “Microaggressions are real” and “No platform for fascists.” Ms. Sommers handled matters as gracefully as possible, but had delivered only half her lecture before Janet Steverson, a law professor and the school’s dean of diversity and inclusion, asked her to cut her remarks short and take questions from the hardy souls who somehow survived the violence of her words.

"Like a lot of guys, I’ve watched “The Shawshank Redemption” more times than I can count. Which is why, when I heard the news that Gary Cohn had resigned as Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, I thought of Red’s (Morgan Freeman’s) somber line: “Every man has his breaking point.” In the film, the remark is followed by the tale of how Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) busts out of Shawshank Prison. Dufresne, a former banker with a gift for numbers and a taste for risky trades, tunnels through a concrete wall and then crawls through a 500-yard sewer pipe to freedom, riches and a beach in Mexico. Then he tells the press everything he knows about Samuel Norton, the evil prison warden, and his corrupt minions. Justice is richly served. That could yet be Cohn’s story, too. O.K., I’m getting carried away. Dufresne is a Christ-like figure, innocent of crime but wise to the world, who suffers grievously and gives greatly. Cohn is a Goldman Democrat who went into the White House with his eyes wide open, seemed to enjoy treating Steve Mnuchin as a finger puppet, and chose not to resign over Donald Trump’s shameful Charlottesville equivocation. Whether he quit out of horror of the president’s protectionist turn, or merely out of the pique of losing a policy argument, is an open question. Whatever the case, Cohn couldn’t take it. His departure demolishes three theories, cherished by administration apologists, as to why the Trump presidency will be a success (or at the least not a disaster) despite the temperament of the man at the top. Theory No. 1: The grown-ups are in charge. Except they aren’t. In the trade debate, Cohn lost out to the third-tier White House official Peter Navarro, who likes to hang around the West Wing in hopes of sneaking in to see the president. On immigration, 32-year old Michele Bachmann acolyte Stephen Miller runs the show. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, is widely reported to be seeking an exit. His deputy Dina Powell already made her escape. Reince Priebus was once supposed to be a White House grown-up, and look at what happened to him. His successor, John Kelly, was supposed to quell the disorder, but has just as frequently contributed to it. "
"What did the actress Helen Mirren drink a shot of on the Oscars red carpet on Sunday? Tequila. What did Sarah Jessica Parker’s character and her tennis-playing friend have on the rocks with extra lime on the recent season finale of “Divorce”? Tequila. What did Kelly LeVeque, a Los Angeles nutritionist, recently advise her famous client Jennifer Garner to try instead of wine? Te-qui-la! Sixty years after the Champs’s song of that name went gold, the blue agave-based drink is having a renaissance as a beverage to sip and savor on its own, rather than disguise with Ecto Cooler colored margarita mix or shoot, eyes closed, nostrils pinched, in the back of a bar. Other famous Jennifers (Aniston, Lawrence) also drink it. Justin Timberlake and P. Diddy (who have their own brands) drink it. And so, apparently, do you. Since 2002, sales of tequila have risen 121 percent, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade organization. (Sales of vodka, which filled Cosmopolitans and appletinis in the early aughts, rose by only 2.4 percent.) In January the liquor conglomerate Bacardi acquired the high-end tequila brand Patron for $5.1 billion, and last year Diageo, another conglomerate, paid $1 billion for Casamigos, the tequila concocted by George Clooney and Rande Gerber. Connoisseurs discuss tequila’s tasting notes and aromas — the citrusy bite of an unaged blanco, the mellow spice of five year old anejo — and more than 600 others that are cataloged in the Mexican Academy of Tequila.

C’mon! Be nice!” he said. “I think it might be broken. Or the outlet might not be on.” He laughed. Just as it seemed his laugh had ended, he laughed again. “I’ll come back to that later.” Although he’s often construed as a cheeky urban ironist, much of Mr. Byrne’s music, in the Pop Art tradition of Richard Hamilton or Andy Warhol, arises from an ingenuous fascination with mundane objects. Cynicism and wonder both permeate his new slippery art-pop album, “American Utopia,” which, he said, portrays “the state of the country: who we are, who we hope to be, all this kind of thing.” The album title is neither ironic nor literal. “I’m certainly not describing any utopia,” said Mr. Byrne, 65, as he sliced a ginger root with a serrated chef’s knife. “Some of the verses, especially, are kind of dystopian, or not exactly cheerful. But they’re countered by the choruses, which seem to give a sense of hope.” Mr. Byrne’s forlorn, hilarious portrait of the country is well summarized in “Dog’s Mind,” a wiry electronic ballad. “We are dogs in our own paradise, in a theme park all our own,” he sings placidly. “Doggie dancers doing duty, doggie dreaming all day long.” "
"Update: The sponsor of a proposal to name a Utah highway route in honor of the president dropped the bill after this story published. Representative Mike E. Noel said he believed he had enough votes to pass the measure, but had received too many personal attacks after news of the bill spread. Families visiting America’s iconic national parks this summer might be surprised to find a new attraction amid the canyons, cliffs and juniper trees: the Donald J. Trump Utah National Parks Highway. A Utah lawmaker has introduced a bill that would rename the state’s most scenic route in honor of the president, placing 62 Donald Trump signs along a 600-mile stretch that rolls through or near five national parks: Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon and Zion. The bill’s sponsor, State Representative Michael E. Noel, a Republican, is calling the move a show of gratitude to Mr. Trump for the president’s December decision to slash the size of two contentious national monuments in the state, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. An opponent of the bill, State Senator Jim Dabakis, has said he would fight it by adding the name of an adult film star who is reported to have had an affair with the president. “If it gets to the Senate,” Mr. Dabakis threatened on Twitter this week, “I will present an amendment that the frontage road be designated as the Stormy Daniels rampway.” But Mr. Dabakis, a Democrat, could be on the losing side in a state where the Legislature is dominated by Republicans who have supported Mr. Trump for scaling back the monuments. “I think it’s going to happen,” he conceded in a telephone interview from the Senate floor. “If a vote is forced, there is not a lot of Utah politicians that are going to stand up and say they are against anything Trump.” "
"BRUSSELS — European Union officials unveiled an array of tariffs on Wednesday that they would place on American-made goods if the United States followed through on President Trump’s plan to impose penalties on imported steel and aluminum, raising the specter of a trade war. The announcement in Brussels was the latest rebuke to Mr. Trump’s proposed tariffs, which have met with consternation domestically and with threats of retaliation abroad. The president’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, said on Tuesday that he was resigning, a move widely believed to be linked to the trade plan, which he had lobbied against. Republican leaders, including Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, have also railed against the tariffs. Internationally, the plan for the new American tariffs — blanket penalties of 25 percent on imported steel and of 10 percent on aluminum — have drawn concern from allies including Britain and Canada, as well as from rivals like China. The European Union had warned of retaliatory charges last week, and outlined those plans on Wednesday. Such a move by the United States would “put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response,” Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union commissioner for trade, said at a news conference in Brussels. European officials have been meeting with their counterparts in Washington, urging them to revisit the plans, she added. If the American tariffs are put in place, Ms. Malmstrom said, Brussels could take three steps: It could take the case to the World Trade Organization, add safeguards to protect the European Union against steel diverted from the United States, and impose tariffs on a series of American-made goods. A provisional list of items being targeted ranges from steel to T-shirts, also including bed linen, chewing tobacco, cranberries and orange juice, among other products. The overall size of the business affected is relatively small, worth about 2.8 billion euros, or $3.5 billion, in imports, paling in comparison with the nearly €250 billion of goods the 28-nation bloc bought from the United States in 2016.

"The giant chip maker Broadcom pledged on Wednesday to keep the United States at the forefront of emerging mobile technology if it were to acquire Qualcomm, its latest effort to allay the Trump administration’s national security concerns about its hostile $117 billion takeover bid. In a statement, Broadcom said that, were it to complete what would be the largest technology deal in history, it would not only maintain Qualcomm’s current spending on research and development but it would increase that amount. It added that it would create a $1.5 billion investment fund to train American engineers. “This will ensure America’s lead in future wireless technology,” Broadcom said. The response came after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, ordered a delay of Qualcomm’s shareholder meeting as Broadcom sought to win a majority of the company’s board seats. That proactive move, all but unprecedented in the history of the panel, highlighted both how much the White House values the wireless technology known as 5G as a matter of national security and its fears of falling behind China in the race to develop the standard. The decision put a spotlight on efforts to expand the reach of the panel, known as Cfius, as a way to bolster the White House’s nationalist economic agenda. The Trump administration has already blocked a number of deals involving Chinese buyers, citing national security concerns. But while Broadcom is not Chinese — it is legally headquartered in Singapore, and plans to relocate to the United States as soon as May — it has nonetheless incurred fears that it may erode Qualcomm’s lead in 5G. Some lawmakers, including Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, have urged the Trump administration to intervene. And on Jan. 29, Qualcomm requested that Cfius review the situation. The panel’s intervention put Broadcom’s bid in jeopardy just as the company appeared likely to claim seats on Qualcomm’s board. Qualcomm has argued — and Cfius appears inclined to believe — that Broadcom’s winning a majority of director seats would effectively put Qualcomm under its rival’s control. A letter to both companies from Cfius sent on Sunday said that the government was worried about cost cuts that Broadcom may carry out at Qualcomm. Cfius described Broadcom’s approach to acquisitions as akin to private equity, shorthand for reducing research spending and laying off workers to bolster profitability. But Broadcom sought in its statement on Wednesday to dispel that notion. “Broadcom has a proven track record of managing R&D for maximum impact and investing in core franchises,” the company said. Cfius’s letter also referred vaguely to worries about Broadcom’s relationships with “third party foreign entities.” In its statement, Broadcom argued that it was American in every way but legally, highlighting that businesses it has acquired descended from companies like Hewlett-Packard and AT&T.

"Mexico City — On July 1, we Mexicans will choose our president for the next six years. It will be no ordinary election. During a period when democracy is being globally threatened, what may be in play is not only a change in government but also a change in the very nature of the liberal democracy that Mexico has built since the outset of the century. It would not be the first time that a democratic election puts democracy to the test. Some of the oldest and most established democracies are now facing that predicament. A change in government is desirable. The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., deserves to lose the election for having yet again committed and embraced acts of corruption that we all associate with the party’s usual behavior through the 20th century. We who were part of the struggle for democracy during the final decades of the last century know that history well. In 1928, President Plutarco Elías Calles had declared that the age of revolutionary caudillos was over. Mexico was no longer to be “the country of a single man” but was beginning an “era of institutions.” And the P.R.I. was born. All aspirants to power were to renounce any call to arms in exchange for the possibility of gaining the presidency merely through choice by the departing president. It was an absolute monarchy in republican clothing, with a new king every six years. The term limit was the only limit. This orderly transfer of power prevailed in Mexico for 70 years. There were other parties, but it was the government that organized the elections, counted the votes and dispensed thousands of federal and local appointments. There was no division of power and little freedom of expression. Although, until the late ’60s, some of the economic and social results of the regime were acceptable, corruption was a constant stain: Every presidential term produced a brood of multimillionaire politicians. The final decades of the 20th century were scarred by economic and political crises. Liberalization in both areas could not be postponed. And it occurred. In 2000, the victory of Vicente Fox, candidate of the center-right National Action Party, or P.A.N., put an end to the P.R.I.’s long reign. And the democratic experiment that we are living through at present began. There has been alternation in power. The P.A.N. won again with Felipe Calderón in 2006, and in 2012 the presidential power returned to the P.R.I. with Enrique Peña Nieto. In today’s Mexico, the president is not an absolute monarch nor does he designate his successor. In the Congress, various parties are represented and influential, not only the P.R.I. And the Supreme Court is independent. Key autonomous entities — among them the central bank and the National Electoral Institute — operate professionally. Although it is still somewhat limited, freedom of expression has revealed cases of corruption that would have remained hidden in the 20th century. "
"WASHINGTON — Gary D. Cohn was an avatar for big business in the White House. His departure will leave a market-oriented void in President Trump’s inner circle at what could be a pivotal moment for the United States economy. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has been the strongest opponent of economic policies that have rankled Republican allies and business groups, especially Mr. Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on foreign products and scuttle multilateral trade agreements. A blunt and outspoken adviser, Mr. Cohn took on the sometimes lonely task of carrying the banner of free trade and free markets, countering what he and Republican lawmakers viewed as a false narrative peddled by other advisers about the economic implications of protectionist policies. His resignation as head of the National Economic Council leaves a White House steeped with advisers who have encouraged the president’s more protectionist impulses. Few of his top economic policy aides share the traditional Republican views of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. That could reduce the already low odds of Mr. Trump championing traditional Republican and business priorities in the months and years to come, including free trade, immigration, infrastructure and reducing the federal budget deficit. Congressional Republicans and industry leaders, who only recently were celebrating the party’s passage of a sweeping tax cut, are suddenly very worried about Mr. Trump’s next moves on economic policy. A senior Republican aide said on Wednesday that the departure would allow the White House to move ahead with damaging economic policies that could stifle growth. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said on Wednesday he remained concerned that the White House was not aligned with traditional Republican views on free trade. "
"SACRAMENTO — California and the Trump administration have locked horns from the very first hours of Donald J. Trump’s presidency. But a visit by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the California capital, Sacramento, on Wednesday produced an unfiltered shouting match that was remarkable even for the long-embattled antagonists, and seemed to be a culmination of fraying relations between the conservative administration and the country’s deepest blue state. Mr. Sessions told a crowd of more than 200 law enforcement officials in a hotel ballroom that he would not stand for the insubordination of California lawmakers and what he called the dangerous obstruction of federal immigration laws. A 10-minute walk away, in a briefing room of the State Capitol, Gov. Jerry Brown unleashed a tirade against Mr. Sessions and the Trump administration. He said that the administration was “full of liars” and that Mr. Sessions was “basically going to war against the state of California.” It was highly unusual for an attorney general “to come out here and engage in a political stunt, make wild accusations, many of which are based on outright lies,” Mr. Brown added, “particularly a fellow coming from Alabama talking to us about secession and protecting human and civil rights.” Warning that California’s liberal politicians were endangering the state’s citizens and obstructing federal law, Mr. Sessions announced on Wednesday that the Trump administration was suing the state over laws devised to make it more difficult for federal immigration agents to operate there. Mr. Sessions described the state’s so-called sanctuary laws as a radical maneuver that would threaten public safety and throw open the nation’s borders to even more illegal immigration. "
"WASHINGTON — More than 100 Republican lawmakers implored President Trump to drop plans for stiff and sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs as the White House prepared to formalize the measures on Thursday afternoon. Officials said late Wednesday that the plan would initially exempt Canada and Mexico and could ultimately exclude other allies. Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, said on Wednesday night that the president would hold a signing ceremony on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. He said the tariffs would go into effect in 15 to 30 days. “The proclamation will have a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico,” Mr. Navarro said in an interview on Fox Business Network. A permanent exclusion will hinge on those countries agreeing to a “great” trade deal in the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, he said. “We’re going to open this up for our allies to just see if we can work through this problem,” Mr. Navarro added. Mr. Trump has said the tariffs would apply to countries across the board and that any exemptions could open a Pandora’s box of requests for special treatment. That has prompted stiff blowback from trading partners, Republicans and the financial markets, which sank over fears that across-the-board tariffs would incite retaliatory action that stunts the United States’ economic growth. It also prompted the resignation of Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who had argued against broad tariffs and said on Tuesday he would leave the White House in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, 107 Republican members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the president expressing concern about broad tariffs and calling for him to focus any action on unfair trading partners, like China.

"To the Editor: Re “Some Hope From North Korea” (editorial, March 7): President Moon Jae-in of South Korea deserves great credit for bringing North Korea to the table. But the talks hold peril as well as promise. North Korea appears to see its nuclear arsenal as essential to regime survival, keeping it from becoming another Libya, and in return would likely demand full United States withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula. At that point, talks could break down, giving President Trump an excuse to unleash “fire and fury” in a war that could kill hundreds of thousands — or millions if it went nuclear. To have a greater chance of success, talks should start with modest aims, such as a freeze in North Korean testing in return for a freeze in United States-South Korean military exercises. Meanwhile, we must urge Congress to pass legislation, sponsored by Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Ro Khanna, barring the president from attacking North Korea without congressional authorization. The ball is not only in President Trump’s court, but in ours as well, to prevent a disastrous war. DAVID KEPPEL, BLOOMINGTON, IND. To the Editor: The announcement that North Korea is willing to put its nuclear arms program on hold is incredibly important. It looks as if President Trump’s clenched fist and open palm method of negotiating is paying dividends. Although I’ve criticized almost everything he’s done since taking office, let me be among the first to offer Mr. Trump congratulations on what appears to be a major foreign relations breakthrough. This truly is welcome news. DENNY FREIDENRICH
LAGUNA BEACH, CALIF. To the Editor: For more than 60 years the world has tried to find a solution to the Korean situation. All of the conventional approaches have yielded little. Perhaps we need to rethink our approach with a Marshall Plan for North Korea. North Korea is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Its exports include military goods, a situation that frightens everyone. If the North Koreans could evolve their economy as China and the Asian Tigers did, we could see a renaissance. The Asian Tigers and China started out as low-cost manufacturers and evolved up the food chain. In so doing, they stopped being low-cost producers and had to move their manufacturing to lower-cost areas. What a great opportunity to develop North Korea into the next low-cost market. In so doing we would move it toward the world economy. When the Marshall Plan was first proposed in the late 1940s, there was fierce objection. There will be such objection to this plan, too, but we should not let that deter us from making a wise choice. BILL BEECHER, APTOS, CALIF. "
"FRANKFURT — Political instability in a heavily indebted eurozone country. The prospect of a trade war with the United States. Stock market turmoil. None of it fazed the European Central Bank, which took another small step back from crisis mode on Thursday. The bank’s policymakers, who set monetary policy for the 19-nation euro area, held interest rates steady, but dropped language from their communiqué in which they had promised to ramp up economic stimulus measures again “if the outlook becomes less favorable.” It was a subtle but important change. By omitting the phrase, which it has repeated since December 2016, the central bank was in effect saying that the eurozone was no longer in imminent danger of going up in flames, and that it was time to begin stowing the fire hoses. The expression of confidence came despite warnings from Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, about trade tensions with the United States. Mr. Draghi, in an obvious reference to President Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, said during a news conference that it was “dangerous” for countries to change the terms of trade unilaterally, rather than through negotiations.

"The prevailing wisdom suggests that there will be a Democratic wave election in 2018. In a manner that suggests that little was learned from the 2016 primary or general elections, pundits and analysts seem so committed to this narrative that they promote it even when the data point in the other direction. The primaries in Texas on Tuesday are a good case in point. Early-voting numbers suggested good news for the Democrats: 465,245 voters took part in early voting for their primary, as compared to 420,329 for the Republicans’. This is a big gain for Democrats over their totals in the previous midterm year, 2014, when their early-voting turnout was 226,730. However, contrary to the scaremongering letter that the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, sent predicting decreased Republican turnout in early voting this year, his party actually had an increase in participation, up 15 percent from 2014. In short, both parties were highly motivated in early voting. This picture was confirmed at the ballot box. Democrats had near-record turnout, with more than one million voters over all taking part in their primaries. Sounds impressive, right? But Republicans had actual record-breaking turnout, exceeding their previous midterm high-water mark, which was set in 2010. All told, with more than 1.5 million votes cast, Republicans had nearly 50 percent more voters take part in their primary than the Democrats in theirs. There does not seem to be an enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans. If the Democrats’ numbers seem impressive in 2018, this is because their previous benchmarks in the state have been relatively low. "

.C. Grayling, one of Britain’s most prolific public intellectuals, had just finished cradling a baby kangaroo in the green room, George Megalogenis had Australian economic data at the ready and I was drinking my flat white just as fast as I could. We were all running late for our Adelaide Writers’ Week discussion of democracy and populism, and when I saw the crowd of 400 people waiting for us on Monday morning, I was suddenly surprised and impressed at the level of interest.

I also noted the declining percentage of people who say “it is essential” to live in a democracy, with the sharpest drop-off among the young. Over all last year, I said, 71 countries suffered declines in political rights and civil liberties while 35 registered gains, according to Freedom House’s annual index. It was 12th year in a row of losses outpacing gains. "
"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said on Wednesday that American troops in Niger had been authorized to receive imminent-danger pay the day before the commander who oversees military missions in Africa told House lawmakers that the White House had still not approved that request. A Pentagon spokeswoman said that the decision to include Niger in the list of combat zones where troops receive extra pay was made on Monday — and had not been communicated to Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser before his testimony the day after. “I don’t believe the approval was processed quickly enough to make it before Gen. Waldhauser’s hearing,” a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, Maj. Sheryll I. Klinkel, said in an email. On Tuesday, during two hours of testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, General Waldhauser said the request for danger pay for forces deployed to Niger was submitted “a while back.” He said the final decision was waiting for approval from the White House Office of Management and Budget. A lawmaker on the House panel, Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, noted during the hearing that American troops stationed in Algeria, Chad, Egypt and Kenya already received such pay. The issue of pay was one of the few matters that General Waldhauser would discuss when asked about Niger. He declined to answer questions about a monthslong investigation into an Oct. 4 ambush near the Niger-Mali border that killed four American soldiers and five Nigeriens. Though the investigation is complete, it still requires the approval of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and its results will be shared with the families of the killed soldiers. General Waldhauser said that Congress would be briefed on the investigation’s findings once those notifications were complete. Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright and Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson were killed during an hourslong gunfight near the small Nigerien village of Tongo Tongo. The body of the fourth soldier, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, was found by villagers two days later. "
"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders, turning away from significant gun control legislation, have shifted instead toward measures that would beef up security at the nation’s schools, hoping the push will quell public uproar over the recent massacre in Parkland, Fla. But as students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School continue their own organizing, the school safety strategy is unlikely to end the debate. Democrats and gun control advocates accused Republicans and the National Rifle Association of using school safety to divert attention from what they see as the real issue: the proliferation of guns that have been used in mass shootings at concerts, in movie theaters, on college campuses, in churches and at workplaces, as well as at public schools. “This time, the gun rights crowd messed with the wrong community, the wrong kids and the wrong dad,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed at the school. He added, “I intend to be a part of breaking this gun lobby.” The Republican-controlled House plans to vote next week on the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence. The bill, drafted by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican and former sheriff from Jacksonville, Fla., is one of a flurry of bipartisan measures introduced in the House and the Senate devoted to school safety — without curbs on guns. In the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof doors. And Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate education committee, introduced his own school safety measure on Wednesday. His bill would allow 100,000 public schools to use federal dollars for school counselors, alarm systems, security cameras and crisis intervention training. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump once said “I alone can fix it.” Looks like he may have to. No one else seems to be sticking around. The record-high turnover at the White House has now reached 43 percent with the pending departure of Gary D. Cohn, the national economic adviser, as the team that arrived with Mr. Trump 13 months ago heads for the doors in increasing numbers and the president increasingly relies on his own judgment for key decisions. The head-spinning pace of departures has contributed to the sense of disarray in the West Wing, but it reflects the way Mr. Trump has operated since he announced that he was running for president. He constantly searches for new voices, but burns through staff as he quickly loses faith in the people around him, leaving him with a dearth of advisers on whom he genuinely depends. In effect, it can feel like a presidency of one. Mr. Trump said this week that this did not lead to chaos but to a healthy refreshing of his team, adding that a reasonable amount of conflict helped him make better decisions. But Washington veterans see a dysfunctional operation in which a president becomes trapped in an insular bubble and too dependent on his own instincts and assessments, however informed they may or may not be. “The truth is that no one has a good gut,” said James K. Glassman, who served as a senior State Department official under President George W. Bush and then founded Mr. Bush’s public policy institute after leaving office. “Everyone needs a foundation of values and beliefs and then good advice to test them against.” Mr. Glassman said Mr. Trump seemed to have concluded that his predecessors made mistakes by listening to bad advice. “Trump looks at Bush and Obama and thinks, ‘Those guys made some lousy decisions — Iraq, Iran, health care — so why should I do it their way? I was right during the election campaign by relying on my instinct. I’ll do the same in office.’” "
"As the Trump administration begins to gut federal enforcement of civil rights laws, minority communities that were targets for predatory home loans before the recession have become vulnerable yet again to mortgage discrimination. This time, many banks are simply writing off communities of color and denying them loans at all. An alarming new study by the Center for Investigative Reporting’s online publication Reveal found that African-Americans and Latinos were far more likely to be denied conventional mortgages than whites even when income, loan size and other factors were taken into account. The study examined 31 million mortgage records and found disturbing evidence in 61 metropolitan areas, including Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Antonio. African-Americans faced their worst obstacles in the South — Mobile, Ala.; Greenville, N.C.; and Gainesville, Fla. — and Latinos in Iowa City. Black applicants were disproportionately turned away, as compared to whites, in 48 metropolitan areas, Latinos in 25, Asian-Americans in nine and Native Americans in three areas. In Washington, D.C., the study found that all four groups were far more likely to be denied home loans than were whites. In Philadelphia, whites received 10 times as many conventional mortgage loans as African-Americans during 2015 and 2016, even though the two groups reside in the city in roughly equal numbers. Banks have subverted the purpose of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which was supposed to get them to lend and invest more, and open more branches, in low- and moderate-income areas. This was to correct decades of damage the federal government caused by encouraging lenders to ignore black areas until the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968. The Reveal study found that affordable mortgages issued in historically black neighborhoods to comply with the reinvestment act were going to white newcomers instead of longtime black residents. This has accelerated a pattern of gentrification that forces out black residents. "
"What do you see when you look in the mirror? My grandmother loved to ask me that question. She was, by any measure, an entertaining woman; one of her standard party tricks was asking me, at the height of an evening’s hilarity, if she had “ever told the story of the night your father was conceived.” Which, of course, she had. I would recount the details for you now, in fact, except that even in the age of Trump, there are some stories that cannot be told in print. But she had a serious side as well. I remember her standing me on top of a stool before the bathroom mirror when I was 10 or so, and asking me, “What do you see?” And before I could even reply with the obvious, “Myself,” she’d cut me off with a firm declaration — “That’s not you!” “It’s not?” I asked, and she pointed to herself. “And that’s not me!” Then she pointed to her heart. “The real you is in here!” she said. And then, as if I had somehow missed her meaning, she said, “In your bosom!” I thought about this story a couple of months ago as I was driving back from Rochester after spending a night at the university there, observing my son Sean’s improv troupe. As I pulled over on the Massachusetts Turnpike to take five at a rest stop, I noticed a woman at the Burger King counter wearing a lovely formal dress, her hair meticulously styled; she wore heels and a pair of stockings with seams running up the back. In one hand she carried a long white cane. Because she was blind. As I looked at her, I thought what in retrospect is something I’m ashamed of: If I were blind, I wouldn’t be wearing all that crap.

"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued California this week for not doing enough to find and punish unauthorized immigrants, and said on Wednesday he was girding for an epic battle. “California is using every power it has — and some it doesn’t — to frustrate federal law enforcement,” he said in a speech in Sacramento. “So you can be sure I’m going to use every power I have to stop them.” One of the weapons Mr. Sessions is counting on is a 2012 Supreme Court ruling siding with the Obama administration, which had sued Arizona for violating federal immigration laws. But in that case Mr. Obama’s lawyers accused the state of going too far in trying to find and punish unauthorized immigrants. “The state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority. So it may turn out that the principle of federal supremacy over immigration established by the Obama administration will help the Trump Justice Department achieve diametrically different goals. “The tables are turned,” said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University. The California case seems likely to reach the Supreme Court, where it could give rise to a landmark reckoning on the role of states in setting immigration policy. In the process, state and federal officials, along with judges and justices, will face a test of their commitment to consistency. "
"WASHINGTON — The day after the Texas primary, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, jumped into his general re-election campaign on Wednesday with a quick strike trying to paint his Democratic opponent, Representative Beto O’Rourke, as a Latino-come-lately. But Mr. O’Rourke, whose family has lived on the Mexican border in El Paso for four generations, hit back with a secret weapon — a picture of him as a preschooler with the name “Beto” stitched onto his sweater. At issue is that most intangible of political assets, authenticity, or perhaps a Shakespearean question, “What’s in a name?” Mr. Cruz, taking a page from President Trump’s playbook of stamping damaging labels on his opponents, seemed to be trying to undermine the authenticity of Mr. O’Rourke, whose birth name is Robert Francis, but who has been known since childhood as “Beto.” A quick radio and online jingle, released on Wednesday, drawled, “Liberal Robert wanted to fit in, so he changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin.” "
"President Trump’s lawyer secretly obtained a temporary restraining order last week to prevent a pornographic film star from speaking out about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, according to legal documents and interviews. (Read the restraining order.) The order, issued by an arbitrator in California and reviewed by The New York Times, pertained to the actress Stephanie Clifford, who had been paid $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election in what she calls a “hush agreement.” In recent weeks, she had prepared to speak publicly about Mr. Trump, claiming his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, had broken the agreement. The details of the order emerged on Wednesday after the White House’s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that Mr. Trump’s lawyer had won an arbitration proceeding against Ms. Clifford, who goes by the name of Stormy Daniels. Ms. Sanders’s statement put the White House in the middle of a story that Mr. Trump and his lawyer had been trying to keep quiet for well over a year. The turn of events created the spectacle of a sitting president using legal maneuvers to avoid further scrutiny of salacious accusations of an affair and a payoff involving the porn star. Although Ms. Clifford said their relationship was consensual, the issue is particularly sensitive to Mr. Trump, whose campaign was dogged by allegations of groping and his boast of grabbing women’s crotches. Ms. Clifford filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday asserting that the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment was void because Mr. Trump never signed it. "
"WASHINGTON — The special counsel in the Russia investigation has learned of two conversations in recent months in which President Trump asked key witnesses about matters they discussed with investigators, according to three people familiar with the encounters. In one episode, the president told an aide that the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, should issue a statement denying a New York Times article in January. The article said Mr. McGahn told investigators that the president once asked him to fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. McGahn never released a statement and later had to remind the president that he had indeed asked Mr. McGahn to see that Mr. Mueller was dismissed, the people said. In the other episode, Mr. Trump asked his former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, how his interview had gone with the special counsel’s investigators and whether they had been “nice,” according to two people familiar with the discussion. The episodes demonstrate that even as the special counsel investigation appears to be intensifying, the president has ignored his lawyers’ advice to avoid doing anything publicly or privately that could create the appearance of interfering with it. The White House did not respond to several requests for comment. Mr. Priebus and Mr. McGahn declined to comment through their lawyer, William A. Burck. "
"The United States has moved to allow hunters to import big-game trophies, including elephant tusks and lion hides, acquired in certain African countries with approvals granted on an individual basis. The decision, reported in a memorandum published last week by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, overturns an Obama-era ban on some trophies and contradicts public statements by President Trump, who had endorsed the restrictions. In November, agency officials moved to lift the ban on elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. The new policy supersedes and broadens that decision, officials said. Traditionally, the agency has considered imports of trophies from certain endangered species on a nation-by-nation basis. The Endangered Species Act stipulates that in order for such trophies to be approved, exporting countries must demonstrate that hunting enhances survival of a particular species in the wild — by reinvesting the money into conservation, for example, and by supporting local communities. In December, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that officials had implemented the Obama-era bans without following regulatory procedures, including a failure to open up the decision to public comment. To accommodate that court decision, officials said the Fish and Wildlife Service will change how it evaluates imports for certain endangered species across Africa — not just elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, the subject of the circuit court ruling.

"When a gunman rampaged through a high school in Parkland, Fla., three weeks ago, a 15-year-old soccer player named Anthony Borges showed undaunted courage. Anthony, who is of Venezuelan descent, apparently was the last of a group of students rushing into a classroom to seek refuge. He shut the door behind him and frantically tried to lock it, but in an instant the gunman appeared on the other side. Instead of running for cover, Anthony blocked the door to keep the shooter out. He held his ground even as the attacker opened fire. “I asked him why he would do that,” his lawyer, Alex Arreaza, told me. “He said, ‘What’s so hard to understand about what I did?’ He had no issue with risking his life.” Shot five times in the legs and torso, Anthony phoned his father to say that he had been wounded. He was rushed to a hospital and survived: Photos show him with wires and tubes snaking from him. He still can’t walk — it’s unclear if that is just temporary — but fellow students say he saved their lives. No one else in that classroom was shot. The world turned upside down: Armed law enforcement officers dawdled outside during the shooting, but a 15-year-old kid without any weapon at all used himself as a human shield to protect his classmates. More broadly, the Florida high school students have argued maturely for sensible gun laws, while Florida state legislators have acted like frightened toddlers, first passing a two-year moratorium on sales of AR-15 rifles and then undoing it 15 minutes later. And now it seems that the grown-up world is again going to fail Anthony and other young Americans. Congress and President Trump have stalled on a push to pass meaningful gun legislation that has overwhelming public support. The grown-ups are once more loitering in a crisis, leaving kids to be shot. "
"MEXICO CITY — Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, met with Mexico’s president on Wednesday, arriving just weeks after a planned meeting between the nations’ leaders fell apart because of a bitter phone dispute over Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall. Mr. Kushner’s meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto was meant to soothe tensions. Plans for the two presidents to meet have been abruptly canceled at least twice since Mr. Trump took office, and the relationship between their countries is suffering its roughest patch in decades. But the encounter between Mexico’s president and Mr. Kushner, a political newcomer whose top-secret security clearance was stripped last month, underscored the profound shift in approach that the Trump administration has taken with Mexico, and with the region more broadly. Officials announced the visit less than a day before it happened, offering no guidance on what would be discussed. Beyond that, Mr. Kushner, who also met with Mexico’s foreign minister, did not invite the American ambassador — Roberta S. Jacobson, a diplomat with more than 30 years of experience in the region — to join him in the meetings, according to a senior American official who was not authorized to speak publicly. “This is not the way foreign policy normally is, or should be, conducted,” said Christopher Sabatini, a lecturer at Columbia University. “The sending of the president’s son-in-law — someone with no experience in Mexican-U.S. relations — is another example of the de-professionalization and personalization of diplomacy that will hurt U.S. interests and leverage in the region.” "
"Next week’s special congressional election in southwestern Pennsylvania will test whether, deep in Trump country, union support can help elect a Democrat running on a middle-class economic agenda. A victory would remind Democrats of the electoral power of organized labor. Even though it has relied on unions’ electoral muscle for nearly a century, the party has often failed to shore up labor’s diminishing strength. Our research demonstrates what an enormous electoral mistake that has been. Political analysts have long argued that dwindling union power would be bad for Democrats. The conservative strategist Grover Norquist, for instance, has speculated that the decline of labor in recent years could mean that Republicans (and President Trump) may continue to win big despite Mr. Trump’s unpopularity. But there were not reliable estimates of the size of that effect on elections. We have quantified the electoral effects of one kind of anti-union law, commonly called “right to work” legislation. Those bills allow workers to opt out of paying fees to a union at their workplace — even if those workers benefit from union bargaining and protections. The results are ugly for Democrats and for the working class. We looked at how right-to-work laws shaped elections from 1980 through 2016. We compared pairs of counties, one in a state that passed a right-to-work law and the other just across the border in a state that didn’t. Even if right-to-work and non-right-to-work states are quite different, bordering counties in many states tend to have similar economic, demographic and political trends. Our approach, which isolates the changes that show up only when right-to-work laws are passed, holds up even when we account for other state-level legislation passed at the same time as right-to-work bills, including voter ID laws and other common pieces of conservative legislation.

"What does it mean to be an American? It is a question many people are grappling with, especially in the wake of the 2016 election. And it is one of the reasons the New-York Historical Society’s coming exhibition, “Enduring Ideals: Rockwell, Roosevelt & the Four Freedoms,” is so powerful. “We planned this before Trump got elected, but it’s taken on a different resonance since,” said Margaret K. Hofer, the museum director. The traveling exhibition, organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., hearkens back to Jan. 6, 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt articulated the Four Freedoms — freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from fear and freedom from want — in his annual address. “We had a president who showed leadership by outlining four simple answers to the question of, what does it mean to be an American?” said Louise Mirrer, the historical society’s president and chief executive. “America was a great democracy. It needed to project its democratic principles wherever they were being snuffed out around the world.” The United States declared war on Japan 11 months after Roosevelt’s speech, but the nation did not rally behind the war.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump is set to sign sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports this afternoon, under a legal provision that allows him to take actions to defend national security. More than 100 Republican lawmakers urged the president to drop the plan, which would initially exempt Canada, the largest source of steel and aluminum for the U.S., and Mexico. Washington is linking the exemptions to renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The proposal has raised fears of retaliation. “Choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,” China’s foreign minister said today.

"KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. — Each spring and fall in the old days, Chinook salmon swam up the Klamath River, crossing the Cascade Mountains, to Upper Klamath Lake, 4,000 feet above sea level. For millenniums, the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians fished salmon from the lake and the river. The Klamath had agreements with the downriver tribes — the Karuk, Hoopa and Yurok among them — to let fish pass so that some could swim all the way back to their spawning grounds. After dams were built on the river starting in 1912, the salmon were blocked. Today the only “c’iyaals hoches” (salmon runs) are enacted by the Klamath Tribes, whose members carry carved cedar salmon on a 300-mile symbolic journey from the ocean to the traditional spawning grounds to bring home the spirit of the fish. The Klamath River’s dams are scheduled to be demolished by 2020, in what will be one of the largest river restorations in American history. But there’s a threat to the dream of a revitalized river — a project that would put a newly unobstructed Klamath at risk of contamination while simultaneously contributing to climate change, desecrating grave sites and trampling the traditional territory of the Klamath people. If you’ve read anything at all about the protests near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, you might be able to guess what that threat is. It’s a pipeline. The Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline would run 229 miles from Malin to Coos Bay, Ore., crossing underneath the Klamath River near the city of Klamath Falls. It would extend, via interconnections, the Ruby Pipeline, carrying natural gas from Wyoming to a huge planned storage and export terminal for sales to countries in the Pacific Rim. The company behind the pipeline, Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline LP, and the export terminal, Jordan Cove Energy Project LP, are both owned by the Pembina Pipeline Corporation, based in Calgary, Alberta. The companies claim that the pipeline and the terminal will create jobs and produce around $20 million a year in tax revenue in some of the poorest counties in Oregon. And they promise that the 36-inch underground pipe will be barely noticeable — and safe. For the pipeline to proceed, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must decide that it’s in the public interest. The commission has already decided that it isn’t, twice. In March 2016 it denied the project’s application, and in December of that year, it turned down a request for a rehearing. The commission said that the companies had failed to demonstrate that the benefits outweighed the project’s negative impacts. Now the companies are trying again, though the commission said they had failed to show there was market demand for the project. "
"Early Tuesday morning, Donald Trump tweeted: “The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!” Lies. Of course the White House is in chaos. It’s just that Trump has lived his whole life in a state of chaos, so it feels perfectly normal to him. The only energy around Trump is a vortex of complicity and incompetence. Furthermore, it should be clear to us all at this point that Trump’s public relations approach to dealing with unfavorable news is simply to rush to the nearest microphone — or log into Twitter — and say that the exact opposite is true, even when his statement is an easily provable lie. Being right is never the point; retaliation is the point. Later in the day, during a news conference with the prime minister of Sweden, Trump continued on this point, saying: “The White House has tremendous energy. It has tremendous spirit. It is a great place to be working. Many, many people want every single job. You know, I read where, oh gee, maybe people don’t want to work for Trump, and believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office. They want a piece of the West Wing. And not only in terms of it looks great on their résumé; it’s just a great place to work. It’s got tremendous energy.” Then Trump lurches into emperor mode, discussing how much he enjoys the gladiator-style blood sport of the administration he has: “It’s tough. I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view, and I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it, I like seeing it and I think it’s the best way to go.” Trump ended by boasting that “I have a choice of anybody.” He continued, “I could take any position in the White House, and I’ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position. Everybody wants to be there.” "
"The health insurance giant Cigna said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, in a $52 billion deal that could further reshape the roiling health care landscape. The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidations that is sweeping through the health care industry. Companies are reacting to concerns over rising health care costs and the possibility of powerful new rivals entering the fray. In particular, Amazon’s move into the health care business has forced established companies to rethink how they can compete. Cigna and Express Scripts said the acquisition would benefit consumers by allowing the two companies to bring together patients’ medical and pharmacy histories to improve treatments and lower costs. “This step furthers our strategy to improve the affordability and value to the consumer in a more personalized way,” said Cigna’s chief executive, David Cordani, who will serve as chief executive for the combined company. The completion of the deal would mark the end of Express Scripts as the last major independent pharmacy benefit manager, one that has focused on striking deals with drug companies to lower costs for insurers and employers. The company is responsible for the prescription plans of more than 80 million Americans. “This is the future of the stand-alone” pharmacy benefit manager, said Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, who would serve as president of the Express Scripts business under the deal. The two companies said that they would continue to offer pharmacy services to other insurers and to employers that do not use Cigna. "
"SANTIAGO, Chile — A trade pact originally conceived by the United States to counter China’s growing economic might in Asia now has a new target: President Trump’s embrace of protectionism. A group of 11 nations — including major United States allies like Japan, Canada and Australia — signed a broad trade deal on Thursday in Chile’s capital, Santiago, that challenges Mr. Trump’s view of trade as a zero-sum game filled with winners and losers. Covering 500 million people on either side of the Pacific Ocean, the pact represents a new vision for global trade as the United States imposes steel and aluminum tariffs on even some of its closest friends. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from an earlier version of the agreement, then known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a year ago as one of his first acts in office. The resuscitated deal is undeniably weaker without the participation of the world’s biggest economy, but it serves as a powerful sign of how countries that have previously counted on American leadership are now forging ahead without it. “Globally, there has been an increasing level of uncertainty, given the adoption of policies and measures by some key players that question the principles that have contributed to generating prosperity for our peoples,” President Michelle Bachelet of Chile said in a speech shortly before the pact was signed. “We need to stay on the course of globalization, yet learning from our past mistakes.” In its original incarnation as the TPP, the accord was conceived as a counterweight to China, whose vast economy was drawing other Asian countries closer despite its state-driven model and steep trade barriers. Not only does the pact lower trade barriers, it could also prod Beijing to make changes to enjoy the same benefits. "
"“The Leisure Seeker,” the first English-language feature from the Italian director Paolo Virzì, stars Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland as a couple who skip town in a 1975 Winnebago, heading from Wellesley, Mass., to Florida, without giving notice to anyone, including their grown children. Ella (Ms. Mirren) plans to take John (Mr. Sutherland), an expert on Ernest Hemingway, to the Hemingway Home in Key West. John has symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, although that term is never used. And Ella, nursing her pain with a steady stream of whiskey, is clearly dying; the diagnosis will be obvious to viewers long before the film reveals it. “The Leisure Seeker” becomes a defense of their right to live their last days as they see fit — on the road instead of in nursing homes or hospitals. The sentiment is admirable; the execution decidedly is not. Part of the problem is that the screenwriters (four, including Mr. Virzì, share credit, working from a novel by Michael Zadoorian) treat the characters’ symptoms as plot devices — traits they can ignore or play up as each scene demands. (Some other Alzheimer’s films, like “Away From Her,” have done a better job of avoiding this trap.) When it’s time for a twist, John’s mind happens to be in the right year and place to share a secret. Neither ailment interferes with a host of cloying incidents, as when John drives off without Ella, forcing her to take a ride on a motorcycle to catch up. Or when the two experience a flat tire and are held up by a pair of young men. (Ella retrieves the shotgun she’s brought along, scaring them off, and John, who has already scolded one for ending a sentence with a preposition, tells them it’s not too late to take evening classes and turn their lives around.) In a mortifying sprinkling of topicality, the movie — set in summer 2016 — shows John, a lifelong Democratic voter, unwittingly joining in the chants at a rally for Donald Trump. The actors outclass this material by a Massachusetts-to-Florida distance, locating nuances and a sense of tenderness and intimacy. It’s hard to imagine other performers bringing so much to this setup. They give a true impression of two people who have spent their lives together and know how to talk each other. There is a movie to be made about John and Ella; it’s not one that ends with “Me and Bobby McGee” over the credits. "
"For American evangelicals, there is a term of praise for President Trump that falls like a question mark on most everyone else: “You are Cyrus.” That’s what the Christian pro-Israel activist Mike Evans promised to tell President Trump after his announcement that the United States would move its embassy to Jerusalem. Mr. Evans, who plastered Jerusalem with billboards praising the embassy decision, isn’t the only one to draw a connection to the ancient Persian king. In a 2016 book called “God’s Chaos Candidate,” the minister Lance Wallnau asked, “Could Trump be God’s Cyrus?” Even some Jews have gotten into the act. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the connection in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee this week, predicting the rise of a new Cyrus. Last week, the Mikdash Educational Center, an Orthodox group, produced a “temple coin” that superimposes an image of Mr. Trump over one of Cyrus. Obscure though it may seem, pro-Israel activists who suggest that Mr. Trump is a counterpart to Cyrus are drawing on a deep well of religious history that nourishes his current evangelical support. For centuries, American Christians have argued that United States foreign policy should follow biblical models. The desire to see America and its leaders as instruments for the fulfillment of divine intentions remains an important cause of their longstanding sympathy for Zionism and the State of Israel. King Cyrus, who is credited with allowing Jews to return to Jerusalem from exile in the Babylonian empire, represents the possibility that a nonbelieving leader and state could be used by God to reunite the chosen people and the promised land.

"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The leeway in President Trump’s tariff order. • President Trump authorizes tariffs. • What happens when the bond market and the Fed disagree? • Cigna struck a big deal for Express Scripts. • The White House plans to unveil its tariffs today. • Protesters want Visa to stop processing sales of assault-style rifles. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. President Trump has backed trade restrictions for much of his public life, but his tariff orders have some wiggle room. This leeway could come in useful if his administration needs to step back in the face of economic or political pressure. First, the secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs. Second, the order leaves the door open to discussions with allies other than Mexico and Canada, which are currently exempt. It says that a country that has a security relationship with the United States is welcome to discuss ways to allay the United States’ national security concerns. If successful, the president might decide to modify or remove the tariffs. — Peter Eavis The president defied allies both in his own party and overseas Thursday and signed an order imposing sweeping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, reports the NYT’s Peter Baker and Ana Swanson. Still, he sought to soften the impact on some of America’s closest allies. For now, Canada and Mexico are exempt and there is the possibility of later excluding allies such as Australia. But the order could hit South Korea, China, Japan, Germany, Turkey and Brazil. "
"With President Trump ordering steep new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Thursday, and with America’s trading partners threatening to retaliate, it looks as if Mr. Trump will get the trade war that he seems to want and that he thinks will be “easy” for the United States to win. “Trade wars aren’t so bad,” he had said at the White House on Wednesday. Which made me wonder: What trade wars does Mr. Trump have in mind? The most prominent trade war of the 20th century was ignited by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930, which imposed steep tariffs on roughly 20,000 imported goods. Led by Canada, America’s trading partners retaliated with tariffs on United States exports, which plunged 61 percent from 1929 to 1933. The tariffs were repealed in 1934. Historians and economists continue to debate the extent of the damage to the global economy, but there is little disagreement that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing trade war exacerbated and prolonged the hardships of the Great Depression. Many historians contend it also contributed to the rise of the Nazis and other fascist parties. There is almost universal agreement that no one “won” that trade war. Smoot-Hawley “was such a disaster that it’s held sway over American trade policy for over 80 years,” said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also teaches international trade law at Johns Hopkins University. “No one wants to repeat it.” He called Mr. Trump’s comments on trade wars “a dramatic departure” from economic orthodoxy. On the question of who wins, “the easy answer is to say that no one wins a trade war,” said Marc-William Palen, a professor of history at the University of Exeter in Britain and the author of “The ‘Conspiracy’ of Free Trade,” which examines trade rivalry between the United States and the British Empire in the 19th century. “But the more I reflect on it, it seems the winners are those nations that don’t take part.” "
"WASHINGTON — Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said Thursday that doctors and hospitals should tell patients how much their care would cost before patients received treatment. And if they do not do so voluntarily, he said, the government may use its leverage to force them to disclose the information. Mr. Azar, speaking to a conference of health insurance executives, said that such information would give patients more control over their health care. And that, he said, would advance one of the Trump administration’s top priorities: “the value-based transformation of our entire health care system.” “You ought to have the right to know what a health care service will cost — and what it will really cost — before you get that service,” Mr. Azar said. His speech — and similar remarks this week by other federal health officials — amounts to an experiment in jawboning by an administration viscerally opposed to new regulations. It is unclear what President Trump will do if the exhortations fail to produce the desired results. Mr. Azar hinted, at a news briefing on Thursday, that the administration’s policy preferences could be included in Medicare regulations and perhaps, if necessary, in legislative proposals. He told a personal story to illustrate what he called the powerlessness of many consumers. Several years ago, he said, when he was living in Indiana, his doctor ordered a routine echocardiographic stress test, which is meant to show how well the heart works during physical activity. Instead of receiving “a simple test in the room next door,” he said, he was sent to a hospital clinic, and as a result, “the sticker price on the test just jumped dramatically.” "

"President Trump’s decision to announce tariffs on steel and aluminum is his latest effort to close America off from the world in a counterproductive movement to turn back the global economy 40 years. The decision serves as a moment for Democrats to stand up for an open America that confidently competes globally. The immediate impact of Mr. Trump’s policy will be price increases for the middle class and loss of automotive-related jobs, which Democrats should campaign against in 2018. But for the longer term, these tariffs also represent a pessimistic and backward-looking view of the world that Democrats must reject. The future of the American economy is jobs in high-skill fields like cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing and energy technology, not in trying to reopen mills that closed down in the 1980s. Our policy must evolve to position America for technological changes and globalization, instead of pretending those trends will not continue. The political opportunity for Democrats is even stronger because congressional Republicans under Mr. Trump have given up on defending an American economy that competes globally. The relatively sheepish response from supposed free-trade advocates in the congressional Republican leadership shows they are more fearful of offending Mr. Trump than they are concerned with preventing price increases that working families in Kentucky and Wisconsin will face on everything from beer to baby strollers. For Democrats, the message is simple: After congressional Republicans passed a tax cut to benefit Wall Street and their wealthiest donors, they are now allowing significant price increases that will affect middle-class families, seniors and small businesses. The geopolitical implications of Mr. Trump’s trade decisions should also alarm Democrats. His decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which President Barack Obama negotiated) weakened America’s economic standing in the world and was a gift to China. If the United States is not involved in setting the rules for international trade, China and Russia will now drive these decisions. Our strong allies will be pushed into trade deals dictated by China. The alternative to TPP’s negotiated labor and environmental standards will be China’s lack of standards on labor and the environment. The same applies to technology, where either the United States will set rules with a focus on innovation or China will set rules with a focus on government control of information. "
"There’s near-universal consensus among both economists and business leaders that Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum are a bad idea, and that the wider trade war those tariffs could trigger would be very destructive. But the chances of heading off this policy disaster are small, because this is a quintessential example of Trump being Trump. In fact, the tariffs are arguably the Trumpiest thing Trump has done so far. After all, trade (like racism) is an issue on which Trump has been utterly consistent over the years. He has spent decades railing at other countries that, he claims, hurt America by taking advantage of our relatively open markets. And if his views are based on zero understanding of the issues or even of basic facts, well, Trumpism is all about belligerent ignorance, across the board. But wait, there’s more. There’s a reason we have international trade agreements, and it’s not to protect us from unfair practices by other countries. The real goal, instead, is to protect us from ourselves: to limit the special-interest politics and outright corruption that used to reign in trade policy. Trumpocrats, however, don’t see corruption and rule by special interests as problems. You could say that the world trading system is, in large part, specifically designed to prevent people like Trump from having too much influence. Of course he wants to wreck it. Some background: Contrary to what some seem to believe, textbook economics doesn’t say that free trade is win-win for everyone. Instead, trade policy involves very real conflicts of interest. But these conflicts of interest are overwhelmingly between groups within each country, rather than between countries. For example, a trade war against the European Union would make America as a whole poorer, even if the E.U. didn’t retaliate (which it would). It would, however, benefit some industries that happen to face stiff European competition. And here’s the thing: The small groups that benefit from protectionism often have more political influence than the much larger groups that are hurt. That’s why Congress used to routinely pass destructive trade bills, culminating in the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930: Enough members of Congress were bought off, one way or another, to enact legislation that almost everyone knew was bad for the nation as a whole.

"On Sunday night, the horror movie “Get Out” won the Oscar for best original screenplay but not for best picture. Voters’ attitudes toward the film reveal what may have contributed to the movie’s best-picture loss: the desire to turn a blind eye to the true, contentious state of black-white relations in this country. Some Oscar voters, in explaining why they didn’t pick the film, implied “Get Out” went too far in drawing attention to how black consciousness may be suppressed: “‘Get Out’ was a great, fun, entertaining genre film, but I don’t read as much into it as others do,” a voter said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. That person picked “The Shape of Water” for best picture because “it’s only ‘topical’ in that it deals with outsiders, not racism or sexism or anything else.” Another voter said to The Hollywood Reporter, “As far as I’m concerned, they played the race card, and that really turned me off.” Some other voters refused to watch the film because they didn’t want to engage with the issues it raises. “Get Out” made these voters uncomfortable by showing that black people can be silenced, whether ignored, stereotyped or even, as happens in the movie, kidnapped. So those voters’ response was to attempt to silence the movie, which paradoxically proves one of its main points. Such willful ignorance isn’t unique to the Oscars, however. This kind of attitude is also partly to blame for the lack of progress for African-Americans in rates of homeownership, incarceration and employment over the past 50 years. The Economic Policy Institute recently released a study showing that the black homeownership rate stayed about the same from 1968 to 2015. But during that time, the black incarceration rate nearly tripled, and it’s now more than six times the white incarceration rate. And the unemployment rate among blacks is worse than in 1968, and now twice the rate of white unemployment. "
President Trump signed executive orders imposing sweeping tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He did so in defiance of fellow Republicans. 
"WASHINGTON — The United States military has carried out twice as many airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Libya since President Trump took office as it has publicly acknowledged, raising questions about whether the Pentagon has sought to obscure operations in the strife-torn North African nation. The total number of strikes — eight since January 2017 — is relatively small. But the uptick points to the threat that the Trump administration believes Libya still poses, despite the president’s focus on the American-led campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq that he has trumpeted as one of his administration’s signature national security accomplishments. Counterterrorism specialists warn that the Islamic State and Al Qaeda also still pose formidable threats in places like Somalia, Yemen and West Africa. On Tuesday, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of the Africa Command, said in congressional testimony that “we are heavily involved in the counterterrorism piece” in Libya. On its website and in news releases, the Africa Command has acknowledged only four airstrikes in Libya in the last 14 months against the Islamic State, also called ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. All of the attacks have been carried out since September. But on Thursday, a spokesman for the command, Maj. Karl J. Wiest, said four other previously undisclosed airstrikes had been carried out against Islamic State militants, most recently in January. Commanders decided to reveal those strikes only if a reporter specifically asked about them, a practice the Pentagon calls “responses to questions,” Major Wiest said via telephone and email from the Africa Command’s headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. He said journalists, usually tipped off by local reporting in Libya, have called about some but not all of the four strikes. "
"When President Trump signed proclamations to place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Thursday, he portrayed it as an effort to throw around America’s economic weight in hope of reaching better deals from major international partners. But Mr. Trump, who had set off warnings by trade experts that this could become the first attack in a global trade war,  also sent a different signal. There would be exceptions in the nations that the tariffs are applied to, he said. The result is that the new tariffs look more like a negotiating tactic — less the beginning of a war, more the beginning of a new round of haggling. After announcing last week that the tariffs would apply to imports from all countries, the Trump administration said that they would not apply to Canada or Mexico, pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. These exceptions suggest the administration is looking to use the threat of steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to get a better deal out of those two close allies — which are also major exporters of metals to the United States — in mostly unrelated negotiations to revamp the 25-year-old agreement. “I have a feeling we’re going to make a deal on Nafta,” Mr. Trump said as he announced the tariffs. “If we do, there won’t be any tariffs on Canada and there won’t be any on Mexico.” "
"WASHINGTON — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has invited President Trump to meet for negotiations over its nuclear program, an audacious diplomatic overture that would bring together two strong-willed, idiosyncratic leaders who have traded threats of war. The White House said that Mr. Trump had accepted the invitation, and Chung Eui-yong, a South Korean official who conveyed it, told reporters that the president would meet with Mr. Kim within two months. “He expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,” Mr. Chung said at the White House on Thursday evening after meeting the president. Mr. Trump, he said, agreed to “meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearization.” The president expressed his optimism about the meeting in a post on Twitter, saying that Mr. Kim had “talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze.” “Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time,” Mr. Trump added. “Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!” Mr. Chung, whose talks with Mr. Kim on Monday in Pyongyang resulted in the invitation, noted that the North Korean leader said he understood that joint military exercises with the United States and South Korea would go ahead as scheduled after the end of the Paralympic Games this month.

"Students across the country continue to attack and shut down speakers at a steady pace, from Christina Hoff Sommers to Jordan Peterson. I confess that I find their behavior awful. My gut reaction is that these student mobbists manage to combine snowflake fragility and lynch mob irrationalism into one perfectly poisonous cocktail. But empathy is the essential character trait for our moment. So I thought it might be a good discipline to try to see things from the students’ perspective — to not just condemn or psychoanalyze them but to try to understand where they are coming from. So here goes. I would begin my stab at understanding by acknowledging that I grew up in one era and they grew up in another. I came of age in the 1980s. In that time, there was an assumption that though the roots of human society were deep in tribalism, over the past 3,000 years we have developed a system of liberal democracy that gloriously transcended it, that put reason, compassion and compromise atop violence and brute force. There was also an assumption that while we might disagree on the means, we all wanted basically the same things. For example, though America was plagued by economic divides we all wanted a society in which social mobility and equal opportunity were the rule. Though America is plagued by racism, we all wanted more integration and less bigotry, a place where talent and character mattered more than skin color and prejudice. Given those assumptions, sophisticated people in those days wanted to be seen, to use Scott Alexander’s term, as mistake theorists. Mistake theorists believe that the world is complicated and most of our troubles are caused by error and incompetence, not by malice or evil intent. Mistake theorists also believe that most social problems are hard and that obvious perfect solutions are scarce. Debate is essential. You bring different perspectives and expertise to the table. You reduce passion and increase learning. Basically, we’re all physicians standing over a patient with a very complex condition and we’re trying to collectively figure out what to do. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration rejected on Thursday Idaho’s plan to allow the sale of stripped-down, low-cost health insurance that violates the Affordable Care Act. The 2010 statute “remains the law, and we have a duty to enforce and uphold the law,” Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a letter to the governor of Idaho, C. L. Otter. While rejecting Idaho’s plan in its current form, Ms. Verma encouraged the state to keep trying, and she suggested that, “with certain modifications,” its proposal might be acceptable. President Trump has repeatedly criticized and undermined the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, saying it drove up insurance costs for millions of Americans. But Ms. Verma said that Idaho’s plan to circumvent the law was unacceptable. If the state does not enforce the coverage requirements of the federal law, she said, the federal government will. The director of the Idaho Insurance Department, Dean L. Cameron, gave a green light to noncompliant “state-based health benefit plans” in a bulletin issued Jan. 24. "
"Early in his presidency, Donald Trump knew exactly whom to blame for the chemical weapons used in Syria, and what to do about it. The “heinous” sarin gas attacks by President Bashar al-Assad on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last April happened because President Barack Obama “did nothing” to enforce his red line against the banned arms after an attack near Damascus in August 2013, Mr. Trump said. So Mr. Trump ordered the launch of 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian airfield where the April chemical attack originated. Invoking the horror of “innocent babies” choked by poison gas, he said military action would “deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.” Only it didn’t. In the 11 months since then, there have been many such attacks, including at least six this year, which American officials and human rights groups blamed on Mr. Assad. Rather than the more lethal sarin agent used in April, recent attacks reportedly have involved chlorine. The use of poison gas, a war crime under international law, has been integral to Mr. Assad’s scorched-earth drive to regain control of the last rebel-held areas near Damascus. By bombing civilians and depriving them of food and medical care, he has killed more than 700 people in the past several weeks, on top of nearly 500,000 killed since the civil war began in 2011. Mr. Trump seems less sure-footed about responding to atrocities in a war that has become even more complex with the Islamic State degraded. Unlike in April, Mr. Trump has said nothing about possible military retaliation. While The Washington Post reported that he has discussed the matter with top national security officials, the Pentagon denies it. Military action is never a panacea, though, and often the wrong choice. Mr. Trump’s attack, not authorized by Congress or the United Nations, wasn’t part of a larger strategy. It raised questions about whether he acted impulsively, was consumed with being the anti-Obama or wanted to fulfill his own vision of “toughness.” The one-off military strikes achieved little, as studies have shown is usually the case, and exponentially more Syrians have been killed with conventional weapons than with chemical weapons. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday began the next leg of a listening tour he promised after last month’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., eliciting heated opinions at the White House from critics of violent video games and from game makers who reject any connection to mass shootings, but offering no concrete views of his own. In broaching the subject after a mass school shooting, Mr. Trump was traveling a path well worn by his predecessors going back for decades. But his approach was all his own. As he has done with recent round-table discussions on gun restrictions and immigration, Mr. Trump on Thursday seemed most interested in drawing impassioned opinions out of the people around him, according to people who attended. But he stopped short of offering solutions. Melissa Henson, the director of programs for the Parents Television Council, a censorship advocacy group, said the president tried to “draw people out” for a “lively” discussion. “I don’t think he came to the meeting with his mind made up,” Ms. Henson said. “I think there’s more fact-finding to be done before anything is acted on.” As with his thoughts on gun restrictions, it remains unclear exactly what Mr. Trump thinks can be done on this issue, or what he truly believes. But he has a parent’s insight on how young people encounter violent media. In a February round table he hosted with lawmakers on gun restrictions, the president said some content viewed by his 11-year-old son, Barron, had surprised him. "
"President Trump met Thursday with several Republican lawmakers, video game industry representatives and others — no scientists, though — to discuss the role video games play in sparking real-world violence. The summit — called by Mr. Trump after reports that the gunman who killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., last month had played violent games — was far from the first where concerned politicians raised the alarm over pixelated violence. It is a subject that has provided government officials from both sides of the aisle a convenient target for criticism since the 1970s. The calls to arms reached a climax in late 1993, as outrage flared over nonstop beheadings and spurting blood in the popular Mortal Kombat game. Senator Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat of Connecticut, helped lead hearings on Capitol Hill that put video game executives under the spotlight. The hearings eventually led to a video game ratings system that continues to this day. Years later, the vast majority of researchers say questions over a possible link between video game violence and violence such as mass shootings have long been answered: There isn’t a connection between them. “If we’re talking about violence, then the evidence is very clear that there is no causal link to violent video games,” said Christopher J. Ferguson, a psychology professor at Stetson University in Florida. “That’s pretty established at this point.” Here is a look at the events that led to the hearings, and their aftermath. Violent video games began drawing the attention of the authorities shortly after they started showing up in arcades. In the 1970s, a game called Death Race, which required players to simulate hit-and-run killings from behind the wheel, was described by the National Safety Council as “sick, sick, sick.” "
"There are still 243 days until the midterm elections. There’s plenty of time for events to reshape the race for control of Congress. But despite plenty of developments over the previous 243 days — with seemingly endless mobile news alerts and presidential tweets — it is hard to say that the national political environment has changed. President Trump’s approval rating has been very stable. The generic congressional ballot, which asks voters which party they’ll support for Congress, has been more volatile over short periods, but the big shifts have proved ephemeral. It was only a month ago that Republicans seemed to post substantial gains on the generic congressional ballot. They had pulled five percentage points behind Democrats by some measures after a Monmouth poll showed Democrats up by just two. That led to a wave of articles declaring that the Republican tax plan and strong economic growth had revitalized the party’s fortunes. In February, it was hard to know whether the Republican surge would last. A little over a month  later, Democrats have recovered. The most recent Monmouth poll, published on Wednesday, gave Democrats a nine-point lead. Over all, Democrats lead the most recent generic ballot polls by around nine points, about the same as their standing before the tax debate began. "

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. ‘A failed state.’ Until recently, Kansas offered the clearest cautionary tale about deep tax cuts. The state’s then-governor, Sam Brownback, promised that the tax cuts he signed in 2012 and 2013 would lead to an economic boom. They didn’t, and Kansas instead had to cut popular programs like education. Now Kansas seems to have a rival for the title of the state that’s caused the most self-inflicted damage through tax cuts: Louisiana. “No two ways about it: Louisiana is a failed state,” Robert Mann, a Louisiana State University professor and New Orleans Times-Picayune columnist, wrote recently. A special session of the State Legislature, called specifically to deal with a budget crisis caused by a lack of tax revenue, failed to do so, and legislators adjourned on Monday. No one is sure what will happen next. If legislators can’t agree on tax increases, cuts to education and medical care will likely follow. The targets would include “health care programs that cover medically fragile children and the developmentally disabled, as well as the popular Taylor Opportunity Program for Students that provides tuition-covering grants for thousands of college students,” as Elizabeth Crisp of The Advocate, the Baton Rouge newspaper, explained.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Silicon Valley is over. Many people have come to that conclusion over the years — some hopefully, some sadly — and they have always been wrong. San Francisco and the peninsula to the south are still the global hub of tech finance and innovation. Peter Thiel, one of the most successful tech entrepreneurs and investors, is the latest to proclaim the end of the valley. He is giving up his San Francisco rental and moving to a house in Hollywood he bought some time ago. His personal investment firm will be making the journey as well. In 2005, Mr. Thiel explained, he was on a panel at Stanford. The question up for discussion was: Where will we find the next Google? “It was a search problem you couldn’t solve by typing into the Google search engine,” he says. “The answer I gave was there was 50 percent chance you would find it within a five-mile radius of the room we were in.” It turned out the next Google — at least in terms of the wealth it generated — was Facebook, in which Mr. Thiel was an investor. It was less than two miles away. “If I had to give that talk again, I’d say there was far less than a 50 percent chance that it’s in a 50-mile radius,” he said. Perhaps the next great company would be in China, he suggested; perhaps elsewhere in the United States. "
"Alan Cumming — actor, author, irrepressible provocateur — rarely shies away from expressing his desires, whether in choosing his roles (the pansexual M.C. in “Cabaret,” the fluidly dallying husband in “The Anniversary Party”) or identifying as bisexual (once married to a woman, he is now married to a man). And he hopes his latest character will be just as bold. In the new CBS series “Instinct,” making its debut March 18, Mr. Cumming stars as Dr. Dylan Reinhart, a former C.I.A. operative turned psychology professor who just happens to be gay and married to a man. Then the New York detective Lizzie Needham (Bojana Novakovic) encounters a killer ripped from the pages of “Freaks,” the professor’s best-selling treatise on abnormal behavior, and lures him and his natty tweeds from the ivory tower at the University of Pennsylvania onto the gritty city streets. His recruitment adds some zing to both their lives. “Instinct,” created by Michael Rauch from the crime novel by James Patterson and Howard Roughan, is the first hourlong network drama with a gay lead and a bit of a risk for CBS. “What’s fascinating is that I am taking a story with a gay person at the center and also showing a same-sex relationship to many millions of people who probably have never seen that before,” Mr. Cumming said. “And that to me is a very, very exciting point. It’s a mass way of confronting homophobia.” With the first 13 episodes of “Instinct” wrapped, he was recently back to jet-setting: shooting a secret project in the south of England, joining his mother to celebrate her birthday in his native Scotland and being ogled at London Fashion Week. In a phone interview from the road, Mr. Cumming, 53 — who lives in the East Village with his husband, the artist Grant Shaffer, not far from his bar, Club Cumming — talked about his return to a network series after seven seasons as the political operative Eli Gold on “The Good Wife”; his hopes for his new character (he’d like to flirt with his female co-star) and his cabaret show that sets his frustrations with America to song.

"Women’s progress in America has been inextricably tied to the availability of birth control. Landmark Supreme Court decisions in 1965 and 1972 recognizing a constitutional right to contraception made it more likely that women went to college, entered the work force and found economic stability. That’s all because they were better able to choose when, or whether, to have children. A 2012 study from the University of Michigan found that by the 1990s, women who had early access to the birth control pill had wage gains of up to 30 percent, compared with older women. It’s mind-boggling that anyone would want to thwart that progress, especially since women still have so far to go in attaining full equality in the United States. But the Trump administration has signaled it may do just that, in a recent announcement about funding for a major family planning program, Title X. Since 1970, the federal government has awarded Title X grants to providers of family planning services — including contraception, cervical cancer screenings and treatment for sexually transmitted infections — to help low-income women afford them. It’s a crucial program. Conservatives — often male ones — like to argue that Title X improperly uses tax dollars to subsidize women’s sex lives, and that some forms of birth control can be obtained inexpensively. “Back in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives,” the Republican donor Foster Friess said in 2012. “The gals put it between their knees, and it wasn’t that costly.” "
"LONDON — The leaders of an anti-Muslim extremist group in Britain have been found guilty of hate crimes and sentenced to prison, months after they drew international attention for helping President Trump get entangled in a diplomatic dispute with British leaders. A judge in Folkestone Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday convicted Paul Golding, the leader of the group, Britain First, of one count of religiously aggravated harassment, and Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader, of three counts of the same offense. Mr. Golding was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, and Ms. Fransen to 36 weeks. The two were convicted over posting videos online of their harassment of Muslims in May 2017, at the same time as a trial of three Muslim men and a teenager who were accused and later convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl. Britain First, estimated to have about 1,000 members, was little known outside the country until November, when Mr. Trump tweeted links to anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim videos made by the group, some of which were misleading. Britain First basked in the attention, but Mr. Trump was rebuked by Prime Minister Theresa May and other politicians, in multiple countries and across a broad ideological spectrum, as well as by human rights groups. In January, the president canceled a scheduled trip to Britain, to coincide with the opening of a new United States Embassy in London. It was clear that he would be met with large protests, fueled partly by those tweets, and 1.8 million people signed a petition calling on the government to rescind its invitation for a state visit.

"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — More than a year into his tenure as the nation’s chief diplomat, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has a set of diplomatic tools that he and aides use at nearly every stop. There’s the tight smile Mr. Tillerson wears when asked about insulting remarks by President Trump that have angered or bewildered entire continents. There’s the shrug or dismissive laugh when he is trolled or overshadowed by Russia or China, rivals the Trump administration has yet to develop a coherent strategy to contain or surmount. And there’s the signature pause that follows when his aides are asked why he has yet again failed to schedule a meeting during his trip with opposition or rival political leaders — the kind of encounters past secretaries of state routinely undertook to emphasize the importance of pluralism, and to hedge against sudden changes in government. Mr. Tillerson and his subordinates drew on that repertory of responses on Thursday as he visited the headquarters of the African Union, a set of soaring buildings constructed by the Chinese — and said to be riddled with Chinese listening devices. In a news conference with Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, the men were asked by a reporter from the China Global Television Network about reports that Mr. Trump described Africa as filled with “shithole countries,” a remark the reporter said “Africa is still digesting.” "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump defied opposition from his own party and protests from overseas as he signed orders on Thursday imposing stiff and sweeping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. But he sought to soften the impact on the United States’ closest allies with a more flexible plan than originally envisioned. After a week of furious lobbying and a burst of last-minute internal debates and confusion, Mr. Trump agreed to exempt, for now, Canada and Mexico, and held out the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia. But foreign leaders warned of a trade war that could escalate to other industries and take aim at American goods. “The actions we are taking today are not a matter of choice; they are a matter of necessity for our security,” Mr. Trump said in a ceremony at the White House where he officially authorized the tariffs, which will go into effect in 15 days. Flanked by a handful of steel and aluminum workers, some wearing coveralls and holding hard hats, Mr. Trump presented the move as a way to rebuild vital industries decimated by foreign competition. “Our factories were left to rot and to rust all over the place; thriving communities turned into ghost towns,” he said. “That betrayal is now over.” The orders were Mr. Trump’s most expansive use of federal power to rewrite the rules of global trade since he took office and upended the prevailing consensus on free markets that has largely governed Washington under administrations of both parties for decades. A longtime critic of globalization, Mr. Trump argued that the United States had been ravaged by unfair trading partners. As a result of Mr. Trump’s action, levies on imports of steel will rise by 25 percent and aluminum by 10 percent. Business groups have warned that the effect could be felt across the global supply network as consumers face higher prices for automobiles, appliances and other goods. But Mr. Trump’s aides dismissed such predictions as “fake news” and said most Americans would hardly notice any impact. "
"LOS ANGELES — Three immigration agents showed up last month at Poindexter Nut Company, which processes walnuts for 300 growers in California’s Central Valley, demanding payroll records to verify whether its employees were authorized to work in the United States. To comply with federal law, Mike Poindexter began amassing documents to turn over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. To comply with a new state law, he posted a notice above the time clock informing workers that ICE was auditing their employment records, a process that could take months. Immediately, workers began resigning, and Mr. Poindexter signed their last pay checks. “I am a pawn caught between the federal and state governments, like a child between two fighting parents,” said Mr. Poindexter, the company’s chief executive. “Each is threatening to punish me if I don’t listen.” The Trump administration is in combat with the nation’s liberal bellwether, filing a lawsuit against California this week seeking to nullify three state laws that protect undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, both sides threw gasoline onto their feud, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions denouncing the state’s “open borders radicals” and Gov. Jerry Brown saying the administration was “full of liars.” The fight has energized partisans on each side. And it has squeezed those in the middle like Mr. Poindexter — the people directly affected by the laws. Employers are now bearing the brunt of the Trump administration’s wrath against California and illegal immigration more broadly; ICE’s chief, Thomas D. Homan, has vowed more workplace enforcement and warned that the state had better “hold on tight.” "
"Inflation scares. Trade wars. Rising interest rates. Suddenly, it is a scary time to be an investor — but a great time to be a trader. After nearly a decade of calmly climbing stock markets, a period during which algorithms and index-tracking funds reigned supreme, newly volatile markets and the return of a little bit of fear have given new life to an old Wall Street creature: the swaggering risk-taker. Hedge funds, after years of poor performance and rich fees that led to questions about the viability of the industry’s business model, are finally beginning to perform better. Having steered clear of increasingly pricey stocks, so-called value investors, who make long-term wagers on undervalued companies, are getting back into the game. And as the volumes of buying and selling spike, traders at Wall Street banks who were relegated to the sidelines in recent years are hoping for a return to the days of easy profits. So far, it’s unclear which firms have been able to capitalize on the market turmoil and to what degree. But Wall Street firms are licking their chops. Volatility and uncertainty: “We’re in that business,” said Marty Chavez, the chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, speaking on a recent conference call with analysts.

Monday was a good example. Stocks plunged initially on news that Gary Cohn, President Trump’s top economic adviser, had resigned, only to recover those losses by the end of the day. "
"To the Editor: Re “Justice Dept. Sues California Over State Immigration Laws” (news article, March 7): “This is basically going to war against the State of California,” Gov. Jerry Brown said on Wednesday. This is not only a war against California. This is a nationwide civil war that has been festering just beneath the surface for some time, and more recently has surfaced with a vengeance. I’m not sure how best to define the adversaries — certainly not strictly by region — but it’s fairly easy to predict where proponents of either side will stand on any given issue, “sanctuary cities” being an obvious example. It is really a fight for the soul of America, and a great deal hangs in the balance. I can say that “my side” is not winning that battle at the moment. But there is hope.

On Thursday, President Trump called Ms. Schaaf’s actions a “disgrace,” but it is ICE’s maltreatment of Latino and Muslim immigrants that is reprehensible. These raids sweep up hardworking people, deport them and leave their families to suffer the consequences. Ironically, we are a nation of immigrants, and the growing sanctuary movement and the courage of people like Ms. Schaaf are hopeful signs that ICE’s anti-immigrant witch hunts will eventually come to an end.

"WASHINGTON — When the message from Matt Skiber arrived in the mailbox of the Facebook account for Donald J. Trump’s Florida campaign in early August 2016, it raised no flags, despite its slightly awkward attempts at colloquial American English. It was one of thousands of inquiries about getting involved — in this case asking for the campaign’s support in planning “a YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town” — that were fielded by an overextended staff that was mostly new to presidential politics. The campaign employee who oversaw the Facebook account took more than two weeks to get back to Mr. Skiber, according to private Facebook messages obtained by The New York Times. The employee, who did not want to be remembered as the victim of a Russian plot and asked for anonymity, thanked Mr. Skiber for his enthusiasm and creativity and recommended that he contact Chad Tucker, the Florida communications director, at his campaign email address. Adding a thumbs-up and American flag emojis, the employee told Mr. Skiber, “We can win this!” But Mr. Skiber was not an American supporter of Mr. Trump. Instead, he was a persona created by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian company indicted last month. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, alleged that the company, linked to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his country’s intelligence services, executed an elaborate and expensive plot to “sow discord” in American politics and ultimately to boost Mr. Trump and damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. A review of the private Facebook messages, as well as interviews with the Trump campaign operatives who were targeted by Russians, reveal that Mr. Trump’s team was susceptible to Moscow’s interference campaign. It preyed on unsuspecting staff members who were more interested in capturing the enthusiasm of supporters of their unorthodox nominee and did not envision the seemingly far-fetched possibility that Russians might enlist them as unwitting players in a scheme to undermine American democracy.

"Last week saw so many wonderful comments that we were moved to make a note of it on Twitter: The best of all that commenting can be seen below in the individual posts and conversations we chose as favorites. We heard from new schools in Fresno, Calif., New Egypt, N.J., and Texas and Georgia, as well as from old friends like a school in Danvers, Mass., and we noticed students choosing from among prompts past and present. (Though we don’t include old questions in this roundup, some we asked over a year ago lit up again this week.) Before we leave you to the student roundup, we want to call out the one school that is perhaps most responsible, week after week, for comments across forums, and for encouraging students to respond to each other thoughtfully: Wilmington, N.C., we love you! If your teacher is reading this, please ask him or her to write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, and tell us how this writing has become such an embedded part of the curriculum. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ Our most popular writing prompt this week — “Is It Harder to Grow Up in the 21st Century Than It Was in the Past?” — was suggested by a student reader, Jordyn, 14, from Westfield, N.J. With over 150 comments, it seems this was a question that was on many young people’s minds. The majority of students said yes, it felt harder to grow up today than it was in the past — and they overwhelmingly attributed it to the abundance of school shootings and everyday violence, which has left them feeling less safe than their parents and grandparents.

"Since announcing new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week, the Trump administration has argued that it is protecting American industry from China, which in recent years flooded the global market with cheap metals. It is impossible to take this argument seriously. For starters, the tariffs will have little impact on China. That country supplies less than 5 percent of the steel and about 10 percent of the aluminum that the United States imports. Further, a vast majority of metal imports from China are already subject to tariffs put into place by previous administrations, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Oddly, the primary victims of these tariffs, which are being imposed under a law that lets the president restrict trade to protect national security, will be American allies like the European Union and South Korea. Canada and Mexico will be temporarily exempted, but could still be hit with tariffs later if they and the United States fail to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Before President Trump signed orders authorizing the tariffs on Thursday, he suggested other countries could be exempted, too, but only if they treated the United States “fairly,” including by spending more money on their own defense. “Many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies as they like to call them,” he said at the White House, flanked by steel and aluminum workers and administration officers. More important, the Trump administration has repeatedly dropped the ball on efforts that might have succeeded in prompting China to curb production, something that would have benefited not just the United States but also allies that are now threatening to retaliate by imposing tariffs on American goods and services. Most experts agree that China is not moving fast enough to close steel mills and aluminum smelters that it no longer needs because its economy is growing more slowly as it has gotten much bigger. The country’s leaders fear that moving faster could hurt its economy, harm state-owned banks that have lent to the metal industries and create unrest among workers who lose their jobs. But experts like Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, say that the United States, the European Union and other countries could pressure China to move faster to address this problem, especially if they worked together.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trade retaliation, murmurs of dissent in China and overlooked obituaries. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump signed off on tough tariffs on steel and aluminum, promising to be “very flexible” after facing a global outcry. The tariffs have raised fears of retaliation. “Choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,” China’s foreign minister said. (Our senior economics correspondent calls it more of a “skirmish.”) Mr. Trump suggested some allies, including Canada, Mexico and Australia, might be spared. But some nations aren’t taking any chances. A group of 11 — including Australia, New Zealand and Japan — signed a broad free trade deal in a direct challenge to Mr. Trump’s protectionist agenda. And our news podcast, “The Daily,” examines Mr. Trump’s claims about tariffs and trade deficits. _____ "
"BEIJING — China pledged Thursday to hit back at the United States if it sets off a trade war, issuing its strongest threat yet as President Trump prepares to impose more tariffs against China. The White House is hours away from putting into effect sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs on its trading partners that have caused an international outcry. But more worrying to China are separate trade sanctions that Mr. Trump could impose under an investigation into China’s intellectual property practices. Hundreds of Chinese companies could be singled out in that process, known as a Section 301 investigation. Speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China’s legislature, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “History has shown that fighting a trade war has never been a correct way to solve a problem.” “Especially given today’s globalization, choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,” Mr. Wang said. “The outcome will only be harmful. China would have to make a justified and necessary response.” He did not elaborate on the measures that Beijing might take. But he urged the United States to “sit down peacefully” to constructively discuss finding a mutually beneficial solution. China has told American executives that it will retaliate against American companies if Mr. Trump levies tariffs against Beijing, according to a business lobby group, the American Chamber of Commerce in China. The most likely targets would be airplane and agricultural companies — political constituencies that are important to Mr. Trump. The group has said that trade tariffs imposed by the United States could also prompt Beijing to investigate American exports to China. China could say that these goods are sold below their fair value and subsidized by the United States. China is now less dependent on trade than it used to be, even though on paper it has more to lose from a trade war. It exports more to the United States than it imports, according to an analysis by Capital Economics, a London-based research company. Exports to the United States contribute only 2 percent to China’s annual economic output, which is driven largely by domestic demand. On Thursday, China released trade data that showed that its exports in February rose 44.5 percent from a year earlier, giving it a trade surplus of $33.7 billion for the month. Economists said, however, that this was a one-off and largely related to the Chinese New Year. Exporters usually rush to ship goods before closing for the holiday. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump dined at the ornate Georgetown home of a prominent Washington lawyer on Wednesday night with wealthy donors who are expected to play crucial roles in financing his re-election campaign. The dinner was the latest in a series of donor events associated with a pair of independent groups — America First Policies and America First Action — that are aiming to raise $100 million this year, mostly in large donations, to support Mr. Trump’s agenda and the election campaigns of allied congressional candidates. Attendees included donors and operatives who are working to raise money for the America First groups, such as the Dallas financial executive Roy W. Bailey and the Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm, as well as the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., according to someone briefed on the list of attendees and published reports. Mr. Hamm and Mr. Bailey are on the board of America First Policies, a nonprofit group that was created to advocate Mr. Trump’s agenda and that has paid for a series of polls and strategy memos about the political effects of the Trump administration’s efforts. America First Action, on the other hand, is a “super PAC” that is raising money to air advertisements in support of Republican congressional candidates allied with the president. The two groups are headed by the veteran Republican operative Brian O. Walsh, who also attended Wednesday’s dinner. The gathering was hosted by C. Boyden Gray, a Washington lawyer who served in top positions in both George Bush’s and George W. Bush’s presidential administrations, and who is known for hosting gatherings of the capital’s Republican elite. "

Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film star who has made headlines week after week, was the topic du jour of late night comedy on Wednesday. On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah roasted President Trump for his post Tuesday on Twitter insisting that there was no chaos in his administration, only “great energy.” Noah ran through some of the week’s headlines since the president issued that declaration, including that his adviser Kellyanne Conway had been found to have violated the Hatch Act and the resignation of Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn. Then he got to another headache of a headline for Trump: Daniels suing him on the basis that Trump reportedly didn’t sign a nondisclosure agreement meant to keep silent details of an affair. "
"PARIS — On Nov. 9, 2016, when we Europeans woke up to the news of Donald Trump’s election as president of the United States, most of us understood that it would have a significant impact on world politics. What we did not realize at the time was how much that event would alter the basic fabric of international relations. Over the past 16 months, we have been through roughly three stages in dealing with the fact that our first ally, the United States of America, is ruled by such an unorthodox president. We began by betting on human wisdom and political realism: Soon enough, Donald Trump, the nationalist, populist candidate, would wise up and become President Trump. Maverick politicians tend to do this in democratic societies. Then came the “adults in the room” stage. When it became clear that there was no wising up in the Oval Office, we were led to believe that fortunately, the celebrated checks and balances of the American system were functioning. The toxic Steve Bannon would soon be on his way out. Some experienced, reliable generals were taking over; their advice would prevail. How would official Washington have reacted if generals were appointed to key posts in a French or German government? Not warmly, one suspects. But these being no ordinary times, Europeans went along with the idea. For those who still bought it, the “adults in the room” theory took a serious beating last month at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top dogs in foreign and defense policy. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis came, but surprisingly did not take the floor. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, did speak but was very publicly chided a few hours later by a presidential tweet because he “forgot” to say that Russian interference had no impact on Mr. Trump’s election. Senior European officials admit that however good their cooperation may be with counterparts in the Trump administration, the president’s unpredictability looms too large over decision-making. We have now entered the third stage of the great European disbelief. It could be called the “Angela Merkel was right” stage, in a nod to the German chancellor’s statement after the NATO and Group of 7 meetings last May that “we Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands.” American officials keep trying to reassure their puzzled European interlocutors: “Don’t look at the tweets, look at what we do.” Repeated over and over, it is truly an extraordinary line. Think of representing your administration and telling foreigners every day: Ignore our president. But that’s a pipe dream. This president cannot be ignored because he is already profoundly transforming international relations, well beyond promoting unilateralism at the expense of multilateralism. "
"The gun control bill that the Florida Legislature passed on Wednesday was, in many respects, a major victory for the new activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It was passed in defiance of the National Rifle Association and, if Gov. Rick Scott signs it, will be the first successful gun control measure in Florida in more than 20 years. But it left out many of the biggest provisions the students and their supporters had sought, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Here is a look at what is in the final bill, and what is not. • Raise the minimum age. The bill would change the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21 from 18 — a provision that would have prohibited the Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz, 19, from legally buying the rifle he used in his massacre. This is a divergence from federal law, under which people cannot buy handguns from licensed dealers until they are 21, but can buy shotguns and rifles — often much deadlier than handguns — at 18. (Unlicensed sales, such as at gun shows, have looser restrictions.) Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, a fellow Republican, endorsed the age increase last month. • Create a waiting period. Prospective gun buyers would have to wait three days, or until a background check is completed, whichever is longer. There would be some exceptions, including for police officers, members of the military, licensed hunters and licensed concealed carriers. • Ban bump stocks. Bump stocks are devices that can be attached to rifles to enable them to fire faster, and they will no longer be legal in Florida if the bill is signed. (You can learn more about them here.) They came to public attention in October, after a gunman in Las Vegas used them to kill 58 people and wound hundreds; with the devices, his semiautomatic weapons were able to fire almost as fast as fully automatic machine guns. After that massacre, the N.R.A. said it supported a national ban on bump stocks, an extremely rare gun control endorsement by the group. But the proposal languished in Congress, and while President Trump told the Justice Department last month to issue new regulations, thus far it has not. "

"Many events of the last week have had the ominous undertones of a destructive global trade war. There was President Trump’s seemingly spontaneous announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs, as well as retaliatory threats from close allies, and the president’s tweets predicting that a trade war would be easy to win. It has all felt a little too much as if we’re in the early chapters of a history book about a calamitous event. But there is nothing inevitable about a trade war. In fact, the rebound in the financial markets in the last week suggests that the chances of a complete breakdown in the global trade system remain remote, if a little less remote than a week ago. That’s because the Trump administration has mostly paired the president’s bellicose language with signals that it will act within the rules of the global trade game. That is especially true if you follow formal documents issued by the relevant government agencies instead of the president’s tweets. This approach was evident Wednesday when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, “There are potential carveouts for Mexico and Canada based on national security and possibly other countries as well,” regarding the steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week. This implies the administration is seeking to use the tariffs more as a negotiating chit with two of the nation’s biggest trading partners. "
