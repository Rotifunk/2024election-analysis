"When the floodgates opened on Wednesday to cast Senator Al Franken aside, following a half-dozen accusations of sexual misconduct, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand had positioned herself at the crest of the wave. “Enough is enough,” she wrote on Facebook, becoming the first of Mr. Franken’s Democratic colleagues to call for his resignation on Wednesday morning. By lunchtime, more than a quarter of Democratic senators had concurred; by evening, a solid majority. Mr. Franken has now scheduled a public announcement about his future for Thursday. It was the second time in a month that Ms. Gillibrand, of New York, widely considered a possible presidential candidate in 2020, stepped to the forefront of the national debate about sexual harassment and powerful men. In mid-November, she told The New York Times that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, emerged two decades ago. That remark set off an unwelcome round of backward-looking questions for a Democratic Party that has tried to focus on the multiple women who have publicly accused President Trump of sexual misconduct, and the current Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, Roy Moore, who is accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls as young as 14. “I think when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual assault and sexual harassment and unwanted groping you are having the wrong conversation,” Ms. Gillibrand said Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference when asked about calling on Mr. Franken to resign. “You need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K. None of it is acceptable. "
"OSLO — Injecting rare drama into a process that is supposed to be shielded from politics, members of the Norwegian Parliament have blocked the appointment of a right-leaning populist politician to the committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize. For nearly three decades, from 1978 to 2006, the politician, Carl I. Hagen, led the Progress Party, transforming it from a small right-wing fringe party into a significant anti-tax, anti-immigration bloc that entered the ranks of government for the first time in 2013, in a coalition with the center-right Conservative Party. Mr. Hagen, 73, is an outlier in the consensus-based political world of Norway, an oil-rich nation that prides itself on its humanitarian record and its outsize role in international diplomacy. He has been a critic of immigration since the 1980s, long before the issue dominated the political agenda as it does now. He once argued that, like Hitler, fundamentalist Muslims planned world domination — a claim that drew formal protests from Arab diplomats. He denies climate change. And he supports President Trump, having likened him to Ronald Reagan. But even those controversies paled in comparison to the one set off last month when the Progress Party put forward Mr. Hagen as its nominee for one of three seats on the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize. Under the terms of Alfred Nobel’s will, members of the committee are elected for six-year terms, and the composition is supposed to reflect that of the Norwegian Parliament. The Progress Party put forward Mr. Hagen as a replacement for another party member, Inger-Marie Ytterhorn, whose six-year term is expiring. Leaders of the opposition Labour, Centre and Socialist Left parties immediately raised a furor. Descendants of Nobel, and a former secretary of the Nobel committee, Geir Lundestad, also spoke out against Mr. Hagen’s appointment. "
"WASHINGTON — Ten days before Donald J. Trump took office, Sheldon G. Adelson went to Trump Tower for a private meeting. Afterward, Mr. Adelson, the casino billionaire and Republican donor, called an old friend, Morton A. Klein, to report that Mr. Trump told him that moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would be a major priority. “He was very excited, as was I,” said Mr. Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, a hard-line pro-Israel group. “This is something that’s in his heart and soul.” The two men had to wait nearly a year, but on Wednesday, Mr. Trump stood beneath a portrait of George Washington to announce that he was formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and setting in motion a plan to move the embassy to the fiercely contested Holy City. “While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise,” he said, “they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.” For Mr. Trump, the status of Jerusalem was always more a political imperative than a diplomatic dilemma. Faced with disappointing evangelical and pro-Israel backers like Mr. Adelson, or alarming allies and Arab leaders while jeopardizing his own peace initiative, the president sided with his key supporters. In doing so, Mr. Trump invited opprobrium from foreign leaders, who said the move was reckless and self-defeating. He also acted against the counsel of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who worried about anti-American blowback, not least to diplomats and troops serving overseas. "

"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr. refused on Wednesday to provide a congressional committee details of a July telephone conversation with his father about a meeting last year at which Trump campaign officials had expected to receive damaging information from the Russian government about Hillary Clinton. Testifying in a closed session before the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump claimed that his conversation over the summer with his father, two days after The New York Times disclosed the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, was protected under attorney-client privilege because lawyers for both men were on the call. What, if anything, Donald J. Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting as a presidential candidate — and his role in drafting a misleading statement about it once he was president and it became public — are key questions for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the election. Donald Trump Jr. had agreed to the meeting after receiving an email stating that a Russian government lawyer would provide incriminating facts about Mrs. Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” He has said that no damaging information was delivered. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said after Wednesday’s session that Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged that he had discussed the Trump Tower meeting by telephone with his father on July 10. The congressman said that Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, asked the committee for more time to answer questions about that conversation because both he and a lawyer for the president were privy to it. Mr. Schiff said that he believed the contents of the phone call should not be kept secret simply because lawyers participated in it. “The presence of counsel does not make communications between father and son a privilege,” he said. He added that he would follow up with Mr. Futerfas about the legal basis for refusing to disclose what was discussed. "
"After last week’s surreal, poignant journey through Elliot’s emotional torment, “Mr. Robot” returned the plot to a full boil on Wednesday as onetime partners resumed tense relations. You had Elliot and the Dark Army, plotting each other’s demises. Mr. Robot and Tyrell Wellick rekindled their old oligarchy-smashing bond, with an assist from Phillip Price. Darlene and Dom took things to the next level. Angela and her fish spiraled in crazytown. While the actions and decisions that led to these encounters made sense from a character standpoint, only a few of them were very satisfying. The result was an uneven, somewhat draggy episode that nevertheless set up plenty of jeopardy for next week’s Season 3 finale. By the end Whiterose and her loyal attendant had resolved to give Elliot the send off she first promised in the season premiere; Darlene was captive at the F.B.I. with a Dark Army target perhaps on her back as well; and Angela was headed into a mystery van, which rarely leads to good things on “Mr. Robot.” (Or in life.) The main thrust involved Elliot’s counterstrike against the malign forces that have dominated this season, a theoretical Stage 3 that was actually a sneak attack on the Dark Army. It was part of a two-pronged approach that involved Elliot 1.) getting the group to copy his control-seizing file onto its server, while also 2.) pursuing the plan, posthumously provided by Trenton last week, to recover E Corp’s data by cracking the F.B.I.’s network, thus undoing the 5/9 hack. The scheme took Elliot on a greatest hits tour of his “Mr. Robot” past — he started in the arcade with Darlene and then went on to use Irving’s OnStar trick against him and briefly reunite with Leon, before finally tricking Dark Army flunkies into uploading his file. (Which they did in rather gullible fashion, for hacker terrorists, though by the end they were at least somewhat on to him.) Elliot was in hero mode throughout, imbued with the determination that emerged at the end of last week’s dark night of the soul. “The only thing we can do now is rebuild,” he told Darlene in the arcade. While such optimism was an abrupt switch from last week’s suicidal depression and bagful o’ pills, it was also a logical response from a man who’s spent this season in search of purpose, and afraid that his lack of it has been fueling Mr. Robot’s misadventures.

"Jay and I wondered what the climb back out would be like as we made our way down a wide, smooth, but radically tilted carapace of sandstone toward Upper Calf Creek Falls. This was a “trail,” visible mostly as an imaginary line between rock cairns. We had to brace ourselves against the steep pitch, mind the loose grit underfoot and take care not to be distracted: The domes and swales of bright vanilla rock, a faint scatter of distant pines and junipers, a dark weight of azure sky. The oceanic expanses of sandstone — known locally as “slickrock”— are common in southern Utah’s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.  For two decades, monument status has protected this mostly uninhabited high-desert region where ancestral Native American rock art and ruins are on view, backcountry hiking is accelerating in popularity, kayakers ply the Escalante River, rock climbers ascend towers and canyon walls, and the fossils of newly discovered species of dinosaurs are unearthed every few years. The geology is durable, but national monuments may no longer be. President Donald Trump appeared in Salt Lake City on Monday to proclaim that he will cut this one to half its current size, opening the other half to mining, drilling, motorized recreation and various industrial uses. An adjacent national monument, the 2,000-square-mile Bears Ears, will shrink by 85 percent. A long list of  Republican and Democratic presidents have created national monuments under the authority of the century-old Antiquities Act. Grand Staircase-Escalante was declared by Bill Clinton in 1996, Bears Ears by Barack Obama in 2016. According to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, “There is no doubt that President Trump has the authority to review and consider recommendations to modify or add a monument.” His opponents say no such authority exists. “We intend to sue the president immediately in federal court over these unlawful acts” Steve Bloch, legal director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said, just as the president arrived. S.U.W.A. will join several plaintiffs that include the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Wilderness Society, Earthjustice and other groups, he said. ""The Antiquities Act does not provide authority to revoke or modify national monuments once they’ve been created,” Mr. Bloch said, adding that “we’ll be in a position to move very quickly to have those actions declared unlawful.” "
"TUCSON — As the police chief here, I’m deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s campaign against “sanctuary cities,” which refuse to turn over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. Washington is trying to retaliate against them by withholding funding for things like crime prevention, drug treatment and mental health programs. Tucson is not technically a sanctuary city. But we are close to the border with Mexico and take pride in being welcoming to immigrants. Yet the government has warned us that our grants are in danger. Still, while federal judges in Chicago and San Francisco have ruled against President Trump’s executive order to withhold money from sanctuary cities, the administration’s crackdown on immigrants is already having a chilling effect on police-community relations here. Many community members have told me that Latinos are not turning to us for help or working with us as often as they have in the past. Their growing sense of fear and distrust is clearly a consequence of the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Justice Department could be playing a key role in building on the Obama-era policing reforms that many of my fellow police chiefs strongly support. Instead, the changes it wants to make — to force local police officers to cooperate much more closely with federal immigration authorities — will compromise public safety by reducing community confidence in law enforcement. To be sure, violent crime has risen in some cities over the past couple years. But the administration’s response, paradoxically, is shortsighted policies that hurt local law enforcement agencies. An associate deputy attorney general, Steven Cook, recently explained the department’s rationale this way: “It is unfortunate that cities like Chicago are more interested in implementing their extreme sanctuary policies that put criminal aliens back on the street than in addressing violent crime.” That couldn’t be farther from the truth. Public safety has always been our top priority. The message from Washington is that cities need to refocus on “law and order.” Yet the harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric and Mr. Sessions’s reckless policies ignore a basic reality known by most good cops and prosecutors: If people are afraid of the police, if they fear they may become separated from their families or harshly interrogated based on their immigration status, they won’t report crimes or come forward as witnesses.

"WASHINGTON — Support for Al Franken all but collapsed on Wednesday among his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, with dozens calling for him to resign after a sixth woman said he had made an improper advance on her. “Senator Franken should resign,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday evening, the latest in an avalanche of statements that began with a half-dozen Democratic women and then snowballed throughout the day. “I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately.” Mr. Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has scheduled an announcement on his future in the Senate for Thursday, and he pushed back on a Minnesota Public Radio report that he would be resigning. “No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family,” his office said on Twitter. By Wednesday evening, there was widespread expectation among senators in the Democratic caucus and aides that Mr. Franken would step down. If he does, he would be the most prominent lawmaker so far to be felled by the swirling allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct sweeping through the Capitol. On Tuesday, Representative John Conyers Jr., the longest-serving member of the House and the longest-serving African-American congressman in history, stepped down under severe pressure after multiple women said he had harassed them, including one who said she was fired for refusing to have sex with him. A freshman Democrat, Representative Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, has faced calls for his resignation since charges emerged Friday that he had repeatedly propositioned his former campaign finance director.

"SHANGHAI — The official newspaper of a Chinese province adjoining North Korea published a full page of blunt advice on Wednesday about what to do in case of a nuclear explosion or radioactive fallout, from hiding indoors to bathing quickly with soap. The newspaper, Jilin Daily, printed the advice as the United States and South Korea were conducting extensive military exercises this week, and after President Trump repeatedly threatened to take unspecified action if North Korea did not agree to halt its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The publication came less than a week after Hawaii resumed testing of a Cold War-era warning system designed to alert residents of an imminent nuclear attack. The advice published by the newspaper emphasized ways for residents to minimize their exposure to radioactive fallout. The suggestions, including cartoons vaguely reminiscent of those published in the United States during the 1950s, emphasized taking shelter indoors, washing off suspected radioactive dust from exposed body parts and shoes, and taking other precautions consistent with past tips from civil defense experts in the West. Tensions rose a week ago when North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that flew higher and longer than its previous tests. Its government subsequently declared that the missile could deliver heavy nuclear warheads anywhere in the continental United States. Residents of Jilin province, which abuts North Korea and Russia, had a jostling reminder of the dangers of nuclear detonations in early September, when the province was physically shaken by an earthquake set off by what North Korea described as a successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Scientists subsequently warned that the test had been so powerful that further tests underneath the same North Korean mountain could cause part of the mountain to collapse, releasing a cloud of radiation that could drift across the border into Jilin. Jilin is one of two Chinese provinces along the North Korean border — the other is Liaoning, which had not yet issued a comparable public warning. North Korea’s nuclear test site is close to the border with Jilin, and the nuclear test in early September has left residents with lingering anxiety. Publication of the civil defense advice caused a flurry of discussion on social media in China, and official news media sought to discourage speculation that a nuclear conflict might be imminent. The nationalistic Global Times said that China was trying hard to avert a conflict on the Korean Peninsula, while adding, “Even if war happens on the peninsula, our nation will try its best to make sure the war has the least possible impact on our northeastern areas.” Xu Yucheng, the deputy chief of Jilin’s civil air defense office, told the Beijing News that the information had been provided by the province’s civil air defense authorities and was consistent with other countries’ efforts to use mass media to spread knowledge about how to mitigate the effects of nuclear explosions.

"If he was hoping for thunderous applause from American Jews, President Trump may be disappointed. His announcement on Wednesday that he will recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital went down well with those on the political right, who have urged the step for years. They will be telling him so at the White House Hanukkah party on Thursday, they said. But other Jewish leaders said they were more worried than glad, fearing that the precipitous step would inflame tensions in the region, provoke more terrorism, put peace with the Palestinians even farther out of reach, and worsen the diplomatic isolation of both Israel and the United States. They say they wish he had held off, as previous presidents have done. “Jerusalem has always been the most delicate issue in every discussion about peace,” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest branch of American Judaism. “So we’re very concerned that the announcement will either delay or undermine the very, very important resuming of a serious peace process.” Debra DeLee, the president of Americans for Peace Now, an affiliate of the Israeli peace group Shalom Achshav, said, “Trump is causing severe damage to the prospects of Middle East peace, imperiling lives, and degrading U.S. leadership.” Jewish leaders are not alone in expressing alarm at Mr. Trump’s move. Leaders of other faiths decried it, including Pope Francis, Orthodox patriarchs and Protestant church leaders in Jerusalem and the United States, and Muslims around the world. The words Mr. Trump uttered about Jerusalem sounded sweet to many Jews, who belong to a faith that has revered the city as its holiest site for 3,000 years. But Jerusalem is also holy to Christians and to Muslims, and for centuries, attempts by any side to take exclusive control have brought trouble. Balancing their competing claims has been seen as the stickiest part of any peace effort. "
"BRUSSELS — Nearly a year after the State Department discovered that something terrible had happened to diplomats and their spouses posted in Havana, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Wednesday that the United States remained convinced the personnel were victims of “targeted attacks.” Mr. Tillerson also suggested that Cuba could have stopped the attacks, which the State Department has said left 24 people, who are associated with the American Embassy in Havana, with medical problems. His remarks came after The Associated Press reported that medical tests had revealed perceptible physical changes in the brains of some of the diplomats, leading experts to become increasingly skeptical that the attackers had used a sonic weapon, which had been initially suspected because the diplomats reported strange sounds in their homes or hotels. Sonic weapons do not cause the kind of physical changes seen in the personnel, experts have said. Instead, the sounds may have been a byproduct of something else that caused the damage, The Associated Press reported. The United States has never accused the Cuban government of perpetrating the attacks, but officials have said that Cuba, as the host government, was responsible for ensuring the safety of its diplomats and their spouses. On Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson made clear that no matter who was behind the attacks, Cuba was to blame. “What we’ve said to the Cubans is: small island,” Mr. Tillerson said, raising his hands. “You’ve got a sophisticated security apparatus. You probably know who is doing it. You can stop it. It’s as simple as that.” "
"ROME — Pope Francis said, “I cannot remain silent.” The United Nations secretary general spoke of his “great anxiety.” The European Union expressed “serious concern.” American allies like Britain, France, Germany and Italy all declared it a mistake. A chorus of international leaders criticized the Trump administration’s decision on Wednesday to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it a dangerous disruption that contravenes United Nations resolutions and could inflame one of the world’s thorniest conflicts. Secretary General António Guterres and Pope Francis both expressed alarm that the announcement would provoke new tensions in the Holy City, which is revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims. Within minutes of Mr. Trump’s speech, in which he said the American Embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Mr. Guterres delivered what amounted to a diplomatic rebuke. Reading a statement outside the Security Council chambers at United Nations headquarters in New York, Mr. Guterres criticized “any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,” underscoring the administration’s departure from decades of American policy. “Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides,” Mr. Guterres said. "
"BRUSSELS — Just hours before President Trump declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel, prompting warnings of unrest across the Muslim world, the administration’s top diplomat said on Wednesday that peace in the Middle East was still possible. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, during a news conference at NATO headquarters in the heart of Europe, said that he did not want to pre-empt the president’s official announcement, but expressed reassurances about the expected consequences of the decision. “The president’s very committed to the Middle East peace process,” Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Tillerson has been largely shut out of the usual back-and-forth between Israelis and Palestinians that many secretaries of state spent much of their tenures conducting. Instead, Mr. Trump entrusted that task to his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson was complimentary toward Mr. Kushner’s Middle East peace efforts, which have also been pursued by Jason Greenblatt, an assistant to the president. “They have done the hard work,” Mr. Tillerson said. “We continue to believe there is a good opportunity to achieve peace.” But in a chorus of concern, European and Middle Eastern leaders and diplomats said in recent days that the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital could have a devastating effect on efforts to resolve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Trump is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital to fulfill one of his campaign promises, his advisers have said. Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary who joined Mr. Tillerson at the NATO conference here, said he viewed reports of Mr. Trump’s looming decision “with concern because we think Jerusalem should be part of a final settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, a negotiated final settlement, and we have no plans ourselves to move our embassy.” Later, he amended those comments as he stood beside Mr. Tillerson before a bilateral meeting, saying the Americans should produce their plans for peace in the Middle East right away. “We would like to see, as a result of this, the American proposals on the Middle East peace process brought forward,” he said. Mr. Tillerson also met here with the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, who was far less diplomatic. “It will be a grave mistake,” Mr. Cavusoglu said of the pending announcement. “It will not bring any stability or peace but rather chaos and instability.” Mr. Tillerson has been calling leaders from around the world in recent days to alert them to the pending announcement. In brief public remarks on Tuesday beside Mr. Tillerson, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, warned against the Jerusalem declaration. “A way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states so that the aspiration of both parties can be fulfilled,” she said. But in his own comments Wednesday after meeting Mr. Cavusoglu, Mr. Tillerson said diplomats had barely brought up the subject with him. “We haven’t had a lot of talks about that,” Mr. Tillerson said. "
"JERUSALEM — Palestinians burned photos of President Trump in Gaza, and the walls of the Old City were illuminated with the American and Israeli flags on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump made good on his campaign pledge to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In a much-anticipated speech from the White House, Mr. Trump argued that it was “the right thing to do” to acknowledge the reality that Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s government. Decades of avoiding that fact, he said, has done little to resolve the protracted feud between Israelis and Palestinians. “It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump declared. Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, he said, is “a long overdue step to advance the peace process.” Mr. Trump said that the United States still wanted a negotiated peace agreement — and “would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides” — and that he was not seeking to dictate the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in the fiercely contested Holy City. “There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,” the president said. He appealed for “calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate.” Mr. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem isolates the United States on one of the world’s most sensitive diplomatic issues. It drew a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, including some of America’s closest allies. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. My view of the tax bill in Congress is probably clear to you by now. I think it’s bad for the economy and, in particular, for the middle class and poor. A small number of Republicans can still prevent the bill from becoming law, and I hope they do. But I also think that some of the commentary about the bill is exaggerating its impact. The goal of today’s newsletter is to put the bill in perspective. It does not fundamentally alter American politics. Its passage would not be as big of a deal as Obamacare repeal would have been (and, no, the bill does not stealthily repeal Obamacare). The tax bill doesn’t threaten democratic values in the ways that President Trump, Roy Moore and their various enablers are otherwise doing. The tax bill, to be clear, is a dreadful piece of policy. It’s also a dreadful piece of policy that is unlikely to endure — so long as people avoid becoming despondent. “Of all the horrors Donald Trump has (and has yet to) inflict upon the republic, a huge tax cut for the rich was the most inevitable,” Jonathan Chait of New York magazine wrote. “But it is also the most easily reversible.” Here’s my attempt at perspective: Tax policy swings back and forth with partisan control. Ronald Reagan cut taxes for the rich, and Bill Clinton raised them. George W. Bush cut taxes on the rich, and Barack Obama raised them. Now Trump is on the verge of cutting them again. Changes to the tax code are often ephemeral. "

"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we are looking at: • Disney may extend chief executive Robert Iger’s tenure • A Disney deal could split the Murdochs as an operating team. • An investigation of the people who abetted and protected Harvey Weinstein Like what you see? Get the DealBook Briefing in your inbox each morning. Here’s the sign-up. The Wall Street Journal reports that The Walt Disney Company may extend chief executive Robert Iger’s tenure if it completes a purchase of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox. Here’s the thinking: Any deal for Fox’s assets likely wouldn’t close until late next year, at which point Disney would spend the next year integrating Fox. Mr. Iger had previously said he plans to step aside in July 2019, but making a C.E.O. transition so close to the completion of the deal would be difficult. According to The Journal: This would be the fifth time Disney has extended Mr. Iger’s contract. What about James Murdoch? If the deal is completed, James Murdoch, who’s currently Fox’s C.E.O., could become a senior executive at Disney, with a portfolio that would likely include oversight of Sky and Star, The New York Times reported. Several news reports have said that James Murdoch could eventually succeed Bob Iger as Disney’s C.E.O., though they cautioned that there’s no formal agreement. Meanwhile, James Murdoch spoke at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference Tuesday night and faced questions about the deal. His response: Paul Pendergass, who wrote the “Jack Flack” column for DealBook from 2008 through 2009, has offered his unique take on James Murdoch’s response. "

"All aboard on this semi-sunny Wednesday. There’s one train show at Grand Central Terminal and another at the New York Botanical Garden. Vintage subway cars are making special runs, model trains are zipping through Macy’s Santaland, and tales of the Polar Express abound. Trains seem to be inextricably linked to the holidays. Why is that? Christian Wolmar, a railway historian and author of “The Great Railroad Revolution: The History of Trains in America,” told us that the holidays were, in essence, “invented by the railways.” “Until they had railways, people couldn’t travel very much,” he said. “There’s a strong association with time off or holiday time and the railways, because the two developed in tandem.” The railways, which originated in the United Kingdom, existed for at least half a century before people could travel by car, Mr. Wolmar explained, so the association between leisure and locomotives became fixed early on. The British “railway mania” of the 1840s picked up speed in the United States over the few decades that followed, but trains here had their holiday travel “heyday” in the 1920s and 1930s, Mr. Wolmar said, “before the luxury market was taken away by airplanes and the mass market was taken away by cars.” He added that mail-order — ordering gifts from department stores to homes, for example — was also made possible by the railways, further connecting trains to holiday traditions. Amy Hausmann, senior curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the New York Transit Museum, explained that “in the 19th century, going home for the holidays meant getting on a train to visit your family.” "
"Is social media responsible for our democracy’s current crisis? An increasing amount of political information (and misinformation) gets disseminated online, and many Americans do not trust the media, do not trust Congress and do not trust the president. By many measures, voters are as polarized now as they have ever been in recent memory. Many observers — even, before he left office, President Barack Obama — have tagged social media as a key driver of this crisis. The digital world offers no shortage of potential villains: targeted Russian ads; shadowy purveyors of fake news; political consultants like Cambridge Analytica wielding big data and cutting edge psychology; and formerly fringe media players like Breitbart leaping into the mainstream. But we risk giving too much weight to the newest and most frightening media technologies. If any media platform is to blame, it is not the web. It is more likely television, which is a more important source of political information. Growing polarization may also result from structural economic changes, like rising inequality, that have occurred in recent decades. A few facts can help keep the role of social media in perspective. The share of Americans who use social media as their primary source of political news and information is rising fast but remains relatively small. Recent work by Mr. Gentzkow and Hunt Allcott finds that only 14 percent of American adults reported that social media was their most important source of news for the 2016 election. On the other hand, 57 percent of American adults said that TV (cable, network or local) was their most important source. It’s also important which demographic groups use social media. In a paper recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we show that polarization has been growing as fast or faster among elderly Americans — those least likely to use social media — as among those aged 18 to 39. This applies across a broader set of demographic groups: Polarization increased as fast or faster among the Americans least likely to use the internet compared with those who are most likely. In the 2016 election, President Trump was most popular among demographic groups least likely to use social media. According to our calculations, Mr. Trump gained support relative to Mitt Romney among non-internet-using voters, but actually lost support among internet-using voters. An analysis by the media researchers Keith Hampton and Eszter Hargittai likewise finds that Hillary Clinton’s supporters were more likely to use Twitter and Reddit than Mr. Trump’s supporters. "
"During his first official trip to Asia last month, President Trump issued a stern warning to North Korea: “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us.” But for his part, Mr. Trump should not underestimate the steep human cost of initiating a war against Pyongyang. The key problem for the United States is the likely possibility that North Korea has the missiles to deliver nuclear bombs to South Korea and Japan. If one of these weapons were to reach its target, an entire city would be annihilated. And even if an American first strike knocked out North Korea’s nuclear capacity, millions of South Korean civilians, and American and South Korean soldiers, would be vulnerable to retaliation with conventional or chemical weapons. Pyongyang could devastate Seoul and kill tens of thousands of people. North Korea may have as many as 250 mobile missile launchers, some of which could fire nuclear-tipped missiles. If some of these mobile units were dispersed at the time of an American attack, it’s unlikely that the United States could destroy all of them before one fires a missile. America has not had much success in finding and destroying mobile missile launchers in recent wars. An American attack that truly caught North Korea by surprise could minimize the effectiveness of a North Korean counterattack — but not eliminate the possibility. And surprise would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. North Korea probably has reliable intelligence sources reporting on activity in South Korea and Japan that could warn of an attack. And news reports from the United States and elsewhere, or the intelligence agencies of other countries like China and Russia, could also warn Pyongyang. "
"First, let me vent. The Republican tax reform, now extremely likely to become law pending certain events next week in Alabama, represents a remarkable missed opportunity for a party struggling through an identity crisis and a country reckoning with a social crisis. After watching Trumpian populism overwhelm the dikes of ideology during the last primary campaign, Republican lawmakers could have learned something from the experience, and made the discontented working class voters who put Donald Trump in the White House the major beneficiaries of their tax reform. Instead, with Trump’s enthusiastic blessing, they devised a bill that was more solicitous of their donors than their voters, and that only modestly addressed the central socioeconomic challenge of our time — the nexus of wage stagnation, family breakdown and falling birthrates, which will eventually undo conservatism if conservatives cannot take it as seriously as they do the animal spirits of the investor class. What’s particularly frustrating is that it didn’t have to be this way. The bill’s basic architecture is compatible with better policy, and there is no great mystery about how it could have been improved: All it needed was to shrink the business tax cuts somewhat and push the extra money directly into the paychecks of the working class. But when a version of that improvement was attempted, when Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee tried to use a small portion of the bill’s corporate tax cut to pay for family tax cuts, the Republican leadership decided to make the corporate cut nonnegotiable, the Democrats decided it was better not to improve a bill that they oppose, and the senators themselves declined to be the Bad Guys of their caucus in a good cause and simply swallowed their defeat. So the result leaves a reforming conservatism as the neglected stepchild of the G.O.P., granted table scraps while the donors get the feast. It leaves Republicans with ownership of a bill that is neither populist nor popular, and Trump with ownership of an economic agenda that a reasonable voter should consider a betrayal of his promises. And it wastes an opportunity to turbocharge the recovery, because the bill’s corporate beneficiaries are already sitting on ample cash reserves and it’s the middle-class taxpayers who would have been more likely to spend extra money if they got it.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. We’ve had some technical difficulties this week that have resulted in some readers not receiving the Morning Briefing by email. We believe those problems have been fixed, and apologize for the inconvenience. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump is to announce today that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision that Arab and European leaders warned could disrupt the Mideast peace process and unleash violence across the region. The president wants to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to one of the world’s most fiercely contested areas: West Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s government, but the Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The president’s decision, likely to be welcomed by evangelicals and ardently pro-Israel American Jews, would upend nearly seven decades of U.S. foreign policy. The White House is preparing for possible unrest and is making plans to protect Americans abroad. • We spoke to experts about the modern history of Jerusalem, and why it’s important to Christians, Jews and Muslims.

"SAN JUAN, P.R. — For an overburdened pediatrician trying to care for a child who was in pain, needed hip surgery, and was displaced from his home in the wake of Hurricane Maria, it seemed a godsend — a modern military hospital ship sent from its berth in Virginia to help with medical care in Puerto Rico. But after days calling phone numbers that did not work and trying to navigate the admissions process for the ship, the 894-foot U.S.N.S. Comfort, Dr. Jorge Gabriel Rosado finally gave up. The boy is still awaiting surgery, which had been scheduled for the day before the storm hit more than two months ago. “It was rough because there were a lot of people that could have taken advantage of all the resources the Comfort had,” Dr. Rosado said. “But there were so many steps to it. Most physicians on the island, even us, decided it was too many steps.” The Comfort’s mission has ended, but it leaves behind questions about whether it was adequately used during a time of desperate medical need. The ship was prepared to support 250 hospital beds, but over its 53-day deployment, which included travel to and from the island, it admitted an average of only six patients a day, or 290 in total. An additional 1,625 people were treated aboard the ship as outpatients, all at no cost. In many ways, the Comfort’s story is that of the wobbly recovery effort in Puerto Rico, in which attempts to bolster vital services have often fallen flat or become entangled in bureaucracy and politics. Following public debate over the Trump administration’s initial reluctance to deploy it, the Comfort arrived two weeks into the disaster, after some of the medical urgency had abated. Its mission and capabilities were opaque to many doctors on the island. It lacked the ability to treat some important areas of need, and the complex referral procedures made little sense on a battered island with scant power or telephone service. "
"MIAMI — A dozen high school students working for Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political network funded by Charles G. and David H. Koch, fanned out across the Little Havana neighborhood one day last week to make the case that the Republican tax bill was something to get excited about. “We believe it’s time to fix our broken tax code and let families keep more of what they earn,” Barbara D’Ambrosio, a sophomore, dutifully told an elderly woman who answered the door in her slippers. After she finished her script, Barbara glanced up from the iPad she was carrying and asked if the woman would kindly call her senators to urge them to support the tax bill, which was hours away from being approved by the Senate. The woman stared at her silently for a moment. Then she nodded, politely but unconvincingly. So Ms. D’Ambrosio and her friends soldiered on, visiting about 40 houses that afternoon and finding more of the same: people who were often unenthusiastic, unaware or simply uninterested. It’s the trickle down theory of selling tax cuts to the American voter. Conservative activist groups like Americans for Prosperity, celebrating what they expect is the imminent passage of a tax package that they and the Republican Party’s corporate backers have sought for a generation, now need to convince ordinary Americans that this is good for them too. These groups have marshaled their resources in almost every state in a campaign that can sound at times as if it were something a Democrat dreamed up, complete with tributes to the American worker and the middle class. “The American people have waited 31 long years to see our broken tax code overhauled,” the leaders of the Koch’s political network insisted in a letter to members of Congress on Monday, urging swift approval of final legislation. They added that the time had come to put “more money in the pockets of American families.” "
"“Get Out,” the box office smash and awards season honey, almost didn’t get made, because its writer and director Jordan Peele figured it couldn’t happen. The broad strokes of the story line — white girl brings black boyfriend home to meet her family — evoked “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” but with a crucial and sinister twist (spoilers ensue): The boyfriend’s suspicions about the white folks having it in for him become increasingly, and terrifyingly, justified. Mr. Peele, 38, is known for his subversive comedy sketch show with Keegan-Michael Key, and had never before seen a movie like the one he desperately wanted to make. But he worried that its themes of white villainy and black victimization would keep people away in droves. Also, being biracial, he felt discouraged by the lack of people of color in the industry. “I didn’t have enough role models telling me this movie could be made,” Mr. Peele said during a chat in mid-November at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan, a few months before he would become a three-time Oscar nominee (for writing, directing and producing the movie). “But to me, it was the missing piece of the conversation. I’d never seen my fears as an African-American man onscreen in this way.” Around 2014, five years after he first began kicking the idea around, Mr. Peele started working on a script and brought it up with the producer Sean McKittrick (“Donnie Darko”), hedging all the way. He recalled telling Mr. McKittrick that it was his favorite movie that had never been made, and probably would never get made, and that he understood why. But Mr. McKittrick surprised Mr. Peele by telling him that he was on board. Three years later, in February 2017, the movie opened just as the racist ugliness attending the election of Donald J. Trump dashed lingering Obama-era delusions that America was a post-racial place. And Mr. Peele’s worries about the movie’s reception were knocked down like pins. "
"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency will be free to publicly discuss their work from now on, Scott Pruitt, the agency’s administrator, has assured lawmakers who criticized the E.P.A. for preventing employees from presenting findings about climate change. In a letter Monday to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, Mr. Pruitt did not explain why the agency had canceled the presentations of two E.P.A. scientists and one consultant who were scheduled to speak in Providence in October about the health of the Narragansett Bay, nor did he address whether the agency had acted improperly. “Procedures have been put in place to prevent such an occurrence in the future,” Mr. Pruitt wrote. He said he had assured staff members within the E.P.A.’s offices of research and development throughout the country that they had the authority to make decisions about participation in events. “I am committed to holding up the E.P.A.’s scientific integrity policy, which ensures that the agency’s scientific work is of the highest quality, is presented openly and with integrity and is free from political interference,” Mr. Pruitt wrote. Senator Whitehouse and 11 other Democrats from New England who challenged the E.P.A.’s move said they were pleased with Mr. Pruitt’s response but would remain vigilant. “After the E.P.A.’s reckless and shortsighted decision to muzzle its own scientists from presenting to the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, we appreciate Administrator Pruitt’s commitment never to let this happen again,’’ the lawmakers said in a statement issued Wednesday. “We will hold him to that commitment.” The cancellation of the presentations in October infuriated some scientists. Researchers who worked on the event said they believed that major factors in the agency’s decision were that the canceled talks dealt with climate change and that one panel was entitled “The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate Change.” The E.P.A. under Mr. Pruitt has deleted most mentions of climate change from the agency’s website and is preparing to open a national debate to question decades of peer-reviewed science that has concluded that human activity is the dominant cause of rising greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Pruitt’s letter said the agency would continue to conduct research as outlined in E.P.A.’s four-year strategic plan. That blueprint does not mention climate change as an issue the agency plans to address in the coming years. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and setting in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City. “Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital,” Mr. Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It’s something that has to be done.” The president cast his decision as a break with decades of failed policy on Jerusalem, which the United States, along with virtually every other nation in the world, has declined to recognize as the capital since Israel’s founding in 1948. That policy, he said, brought us “no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.” “It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump declared. Recognizing Jerusalem, he added, was “a long overdue step to advance the peace process.” Mr. Trump’s remarks were the most closely scrutinized of his presidency on the Middle East, where he has vowed to broker the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians but has yet to find a breakthrough to end the conflict. He said he remained committed to brokering an agreement “that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.” "
"President Trump on Wednesday officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of American foreign policy.

The following is a transcript of his remarks, as prepared by The New York Times. For more coverage and analysis, read here. _______ PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you. When I came into office, I promised to look at the world’s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking. We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. All challenges demand new approaches. My announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. "
"WASHINGTON — About 2,000 American troops are in Syria fighting the Islamic State, a Pentagon spokesman said on Wednesday, almost four times the total previously disclosed as the Trump administration changes how troop numbers are publicly counted. The new total, ordered disclosed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, counts service members on temporary duty of six months or less who were not included in Obama-era totals. The 1,500 or so previously undisclosed troops in Syria include traditional combat forces like infantry, artillery and forward air controllers trained to call in airstrikes, as well as support personnel, said Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman. He called the previous public total of 503 an “artificial construct” that became increasingly inaccurate as the campaign against the Islamic State progressed. Military officials said that the 2,000 personnel in Syria represented something of a high-water mark as the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria winds down. The American-led coalition has retaken 97 percent of the territory once held by the militants, and the military is working to stabilize recently liberated areas, including the restoration of basic essential services, the removal of explosive materials and the distribution of humanitarian aid. “The campaign to defeat ISIS is now in a new phase in Iraq and Syria,” Col. Robert Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. The updated figure does not reflect troops assigned to classified missions and some Special Operations personnel, Mr. Pahon said. The number also does not include combat aircrews flying from bases outside Iraq and Syria, nor from Navy aircraft carriers at sea. Mr. Mattis directed the Pentagon months ago to revise how it accounts for deployed personnel fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon also announced revised troop numbers in Afghanistan in August, acknowledging publicly for the first time that about 11,000 troops were deployed there. The numbers of American service members in Syria rose after a decision by President Trump in March to allow subordinate military commanders set the levels of troops they needed. But Colonel Manning said the number of troops in Syria “are generally trending downward,” and noted that an artillery battalion of 400 Marines deployed near Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, had recently returned to the United States. Colonel Manning said troop numbers would continue to decline as the American-led coalition transitioned to missions to train and advise local forces. The Pentagon also announced Wednesday that about 5,200 American troops are serving in Iraq. Colonel Manning said that total did not constitute a troop increase, but rather was a result of the change in the way troop numbers were accounted for and disclosed. About 3,000 Islamic State fighters remain in Syria, mainly in a strip of land along the Euphrates River Valley south of Deir al-Zour, according to military estimates provided by Mr. Pahon. "
"It began with Donald Trump’s taunting of prisoners of war: “I like people who weren’t captured.” Then came his mocking of a disabled reporter; his suggestion that Judge Gonzalo Curiel wasn’t qualified to do his job on account of his being “Mexican”; his attacks on a Muslim Gold Star family; his flirtation with David Duke. By election night, the catalog of Mr. Trump’s insults was thick. That first jab at P.O.W.s persuaded me, a staunch social conservative, that Mr. Trump wasn’t qualified for the office he sought. A loudmouth who denigrates war heroes, I knew, doesn’t belong in the White House. Yet I watched with dismay as many evangelicals and social conservatives — people I consider allies — embraced him. How could they back a candidate who obviously didn’t care a whit for basic decency, let alone religious tradition? The question of how social conservatives should practice politics in the age of Trump has resurfaced as Alabamians are poised to elect Roy Moore to the Senate. The likes of Mr. Trump and Mr. Moore promise social conservatives an appealing menu of policies and judicial nominations. Their offer is especially attractive after a decade during which the left embraced a new, aggressive mode of secular progressivism and continued its war against tradition long after it had won most courtroom and ballot-box battles. But these vulgar populists exact an exorbitant price: namely, complicity in the degradation, conspiracism, thinly veiled bigotry and leader-worship that is their stock in trade. To understand the social conservatives’ dilemma isn’t to excuse the vile personal conduct of a figure like Mr. Moore. But if you believe, as they (and I) do, that a public culture informed by the Bible and traditional morality is essential to America’s constitutional order, then the stakes are high indeed. "
"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders moved closer on Wednesday to resolving some key differences between the House and Senate tax bills, though several big issues, including the size of the corporate tax cut, remained in flux. As the Senate voted to begin the process of reconciling its tax bill with the House version, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, threw his support behind allowing a more generous state and local tax deduction in the final legislation. “That sounds like a kind of reasonable idea,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to a proposal brewing among House Republicans that would give people the option of deducting up to $10,000 in income taxes or property taxes. Right now, both bills would only allow taxpayers to deduct property taxes and cap that at $10,000. Once the conference committee process begins, lawmakers will begin formally hashing out the remaining differences, including what to do about the corporate alternative minimum tax, which crept back into the Senate bill as a late addition. The chambers are also debating how to treat the deduction that many people take for high medical expenses, a provision that is repealed by the House but expanded by the Senate. Complicating the discussions is the need to ensure that the overall bill stays in the $1.5 trillion bucket lawmakers have budgeted for the cuts. All the changes under discussion would cost money, requiring lawmakers to find ways to offset the effect on the deficit. Lawmakers continued to debate whether to increase the corporate tax rate to 22 percent from the proposed 20 percent, an idea that President Trump appeared to support over the weekend. Mr. McConnell publicly remains cool to the idea. On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, reiterated his support for a 20 percent corporate rate. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to fully end its blockade of food, water, medicine and fuel into Yemen, a rare humanitarian rebuke to the Middle East ally that he has firmly embraced since taking office. Saudi Arabia joined Yemen’s civil war, which pit the country’s leaders against Houthi rebels, in 2015. In November, the Saudis intensified a blockade on Yemen, stopping the entry of goods and other basic necessities, and heightening warnings of a humanitarian crisis from international aid groups. In a brief but blunt statement, Mr. Trump called on the Saudi government to “completely allow food, fuel, water and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it.” Mr. Trump added that lifting the blockade “must be done for humanitarian reasons immediately.” The president’s pointed request to the Saudi monarchy came on the same day that his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel sparked anger among Saudi leaders, including King Salman, who condemned Mr. Trump’s announcement. Mr. Trump has emphasized cooperation, not conflict, with Riyadh since becoming president. He has hailed his close relationship with the Saudis and described it as a key part of efforts to combat Islamic extremists. Even so, Saudi’s ongoing fighting in Yemen has the potential to strain the friendship between the kingdom and the United States, especially in the wake of the blockade, which humanitarian groups described as increasingly dire for Yemen’s civilian population. "
"WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators thrashing out differences over a major tax bill are likely to eliminate the insurance coverage mandate at the heart of the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers say. But a deal struck by Senate Republican leaders and Senator Susan Collins of Maine to mitigate the effect of the repeal has been all but rejected by House Republicans, potentially jeopardizing Ms. Collins’s final yes vote. “I don’t think the American people voted for bailing out big insurance,” said Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, who opposes a separate measure to lower insurance premiums that Ms. Collins thought she had secured. The sweeping tax overhaul approved Saturday by the Senate would eliminate penalties for people who go without insurance, a change not in the tax bill passed last month by the House. But the House has voted many times to roll back the mandate, most recently in a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and House members were enthusiastic about going along. “Mandating people to buy a product was a bad idea to begin with,” said Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia. “We made people do something that was supposed to be good for them. But they are telling us by the millions how much they dislike the mandate.” Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chief architect of the House tax bill, asked whether he was receptive to the idea of eliminating the penalties for going without insurance, said, “I certainly am.” "
"WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, told a former business associate that economic sanctions against Russia would be “ripped up” as one of the Trump administration’s first acts, according to an account by a whistle-blower made public on Wednesday. Mr. Flynn believed that ending the sanctions could allow a business project he had once participated in to move forward, according to the whistle-blower. The account is the strongest evidence to date that the Trump administration wanted to end the sanctions immediately, and suggests that Mr. Flynn had a possible economic incentive for the United States to forge a closer relationship with Russia. Mr. Flynn had worked on a business venture to partner with Russia to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East until June 2016, but remained close with the people involved afterward. On Inauguration Day, as he sat behind the president listening to the inaugural address, Mr. Flynn, according to the whistle-blower, texted the former business associate to say that the project was “good to go.” The account is detailed in a letter written by Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. In the letter, Mr. Cummings said that the whistle-blower contacted his office in June and has authorized him to go public with the details. He did not name the whistle-blower. “These grave allegations compel a full, credible and bipartisan congressional investigation,” Mr. Cummings wrote. "
"LONDON — He is a little-known Saudi prince from a remote branch of the royal family, with no history as a major art collector, and no publicly known source of great wealth. But the prince, Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, is the mystery buyer of Leonardo da Vinci’s painting “Salvator Mundi,” which fetched a record $450.3 million at auction last month, documents show. The revelation that Prince Bader is the purchaser, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times, links one of the most captivating mysteries of the art world with palace intrigues in Saudi Arabia that are shaking the region. Prince Bader splurged on this controversial and decidedly un-Islamic portrait of Christ at a time when most members of the Saudi elite, including some in the royal family, are cowering under a sweeping crackdown against corruption and self-enrichment. As it happens, Prince Bader is a friend and associate of the leader of the purge: the country’s 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The $450.3 million purchase is the clearest indication yet of the selective nature of the crackdown. The crown prince’s supporters portray him as a reformer, but the campaign of extrajudicial arrests has been unprecedented for modern Saudi Arabia, worrying Western governments about political stability in the world’s largest oil producer, alarming rights advocates and investors about the rule of law, and roiling energy markets. Prince Mohammed’s consolidation of power has upended decades of efforts by previous Saudi rulers to build loyalty and consensus within the royal family. And even before the disclosure of the record-breaking purchase in a New York art auction by one of his associates, Prince Mohammed’s extravagance had already raised eyebrows, most notably with the impulse purchase two years ago in the south of France of a Russian vodka titan’s 440-foot yacht, for half a billion dollars. A spokeswoman for Christie’s, the auction house that sold “Salvator Mundi,” said it did not comment on the identities of any buyers or sellers without their permission. Prince Bader did not respond to a detailed request for comment. But as The Times was pressing for a response on Wednesday, the newly opened branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, tweeted that the painting “is coming to Louvre Abu Dhabi.” The Saudi crown prince is a close ally of his counterpart in Abu Dhabi.

"WASHINGTON — The House on Wednesday easily passed a sweeping expansion of the right to carry concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country, putting the fate of the National Rifle Association’s top legislative priority in the hands of a divided Senate. To win over Democrats, House Republicans paired the measure, which would require all states to recognize any other state’s concealed-carry permit, with a more modest bipartisan fix meant to incentivize better reporting of legal and mental health records to the national background check system. Together, the measures were the first gun-related bill to pass through the chamber since two of the deadliest mass shootings in the United States, in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Tex., in the fall. But the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions. The final House vote was 231 to 198, with six Democrats in favor of and 14 Republicans against the bill. Passage in the Senate would almost certainly require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster, and although several Democrats have expressed support in the past, the climb for the N.R.A. will be steep.

"President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren make odd antitrust bedfellows. Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, says megadeals like Aetna’s $77 billion sale to CVS could kill competition. She also backs the Justice Department’s fight against an AT&T-Time Warner merger and has concerns about past merger remedies. That puts her in the same camp as the president. She laid out her views on deal making in a speech on Wednesday. AT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, she said, would mean higher prices, fewer choices and worse service for consumers. That echoes Mr. Trump’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, and the Justice Department’s November lawsuit to block the deal, which asserted that the merger would leave millions of television viewers paying more and would slow innovations like video streaming. Ms. Warren also said past concession agreements that allowed certain mergers to go forward had been “epic failures.” That almost feels like a hat tip to Mr. Delrahim, who in a speech last month said past behavioral remedies to address antitrust concerns had not worked out as planned and had been difficult to enforce. He cited Comcast’s takeover of NBCUniversal as an example, adding extra execution risk to vertical mergers in which deal partners don’t directly compete. His tough stance surprised the corporate sector, which had expected easier deal reviews under the Trump administration. It’s also rare for vertical mergers, like AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, to face court challenges since they are usually approved with conditions. Ms. Warren argued that big vertical deals needed to be viewed as critically as horizontal mergers and said Aetna’s sale to CVS would be a test for antitrust enforcers. It’s unclear whether the Justice Department, which reviews insurance-industry deals, or the Federal Trade Commission, which assesses the pharmaceutical and retail sectors, has jurisdiction over the merger. Ms. Warren did admit she was worried about whether the Justice Department’s AT&T lawsuit was politically motivated given Mr. Trump’s attacks on CNN, which Time Warner owns. She also branded Mr. Delrahim as someone with a “long record” of backing bad mergers. Still, in rare praise of the Trump administration, Ms. Warren said the Justice Department’s move to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal was “a good step.” Such an alliance of convenience puts more pressure on big M&A.

"The art critics of The New York Times Roberta Smith, Holland Cotter and Jason Farago share their picks for the best art of the year. 1. BEST GALLERY SHOW I REGRETTABLY DID NOT REVIEW “Ad Reinhardt: Blue Paintings” at the David Zwirner Gallery, which brought together 28 luminous abstract paintings from this artist’s early-1950s “blue period” — the most ever. With blue fields layered with levitating blocks, or intersecting beams of contrasting blues and sometimes greens or purples, these immersive paintings evoked geometric versions of Monet’s “Water Lilies.” Their joyfulness stood in striking contrast to Reinhardt’s relatively daunting if better-known Black Paintings, which suddenly seem a little pretentious. 2. ANOTHER ONE At Gavin Brown’s Enterprise in Harlem, Rirkrit Tiravanija continued his Johnsian devotion to inventing nothing with a masterpiece: a loving and infinitely touching frame-by-frame re-creation of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1974 film “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul.” The story centers on Emmi, a widowed German cleaning woman, and Ali, a much younger Moroccan migrant worker, whose unlikely romance and marriage elicit every species of bigotry from those around them. The Tiravanija version has an exquisite corpse of a title: “‘skip the bruising of the eskimos to the exquisite words’ vs. ‘if I give you a penny you can give me a pair of scissors.’” It was an in-house job, shot in the gallery in four weeks with a cast consisting almost entirely of artists, friends and employees, on sets that then became part of the exhibition. The stiffness of the amateur acting gave the proceedings an odd clarity, and the random casting unsettled stereotypes, as did giving the leading female roles to men: The Swedish artist Karl Holmqvist played Emmi; Florian Troebinger, the film’s only professional actor, portrayed Barbara, the blond Germanic bar owner and Ali’s sometime lover. In keeping with Mr. Tiravanija’s relational-aesthetics pieces involving the serving of free food, Mr. Troebinger tended the bar throughout the show. As Ali, Hamid Amini, who has worked with this artist on various projects, gave the remake its center of gravity as well as a touch of Hollywood dreamboat. 3. BEST FIRST IMPRESSION “War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Quilts From Military Fabric” at the American Folk Art Museum and its furnace blast of geometric patterns, predominantly in the reds, blacks and yellows of the military fabrics. On view through Jan. 7, it is some of the best abstract art you’ll see this season. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — For decades, the idea of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital served as a rare and powerful rallying cry that united the Arab world. Kings and dictators stumped for it, priests and imams prayed for it, jihadists and protesters died for it, and militant groups and political parties campaigned for it — naming their television stations, boulevards and even themselves, after Al Quds, the Arabic name for the holy city. In officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday, President Trump struck what many considered the death blow to those aspirations, handing a major victory to Israel in the perennial struggle between Jews and Arabs for control of the Holy Land. But as Arab and Muslim leaders raised their voices to condemn the move, many across the Middle East wondered if so much had changed in recent years that the real Arab response would amount to little more than a whimper. “ ‘Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine’ joins ‘Palestinian refugees are going back home one day’ in the let’s-hope-it-will-happen-but-it-never-will department,” Mustapha Hamoui, a Lebanese blogger, wrote in a rueful tweet.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump formally announced the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, saying it would advance the peace process. Mr. Trump asserted that the U.S. would remain a neutral broker in the effort, but offered little solace to the Palestinians. But the decision has drawn a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, and Pope Francis and China joined the chorus of voices warning that the move could stir unrest across the region. The leader of Hamas called it “an unaccountable gamble.” This video explains why Jerusalem is so contested. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a NATO conference that Mr. Trump was “very committed” to peace in the Middle East. _____ • Time Magazine named “the silence breakers” its person of the year for 2017, honoring the women who came forward to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment, and the global conversation they have started.

"To the Editor: Re “Does Mr. Trump Want Mideast Peace?” (editorial, Dec. 6): The world does not get to choose a nation’s capital. That is the right of the sovereign nation. Instead of focusing on Israel’s capital, the world needs to focus on Palestinian incitement to violence and the Palestinians’ refusal to recognize Israel’s right to exist. When Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered the Palestinians 93 percent of the West Bank and a piece of Jerusalem as their capital in 2008, the Arabs rejected the plan. Why? Because it allowed Israel to continue its existence. Once the Palestinians deal with the reality that Israel exists, that it has a right to exist and that Jerusalem is its capital, perhaps President Mahmoud Abbas can start real negotiations for the benefit of his people, as President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt did 38 years ago. HOWARD B. WEBER, NEW YORK The writer is president of the Coalition for Israel. To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Pledge Over Jerusalem Rattles Mideast” (front page, Dec. 6): When you are unencumbered by history, advice and empathy, you get to make quick decisions that have a monumental effect on a part of the world that can erupt at any time. You get to make those decisions because it suits your short-term political desires. Surely, Mr. President, you have made life more dangerous for your military and your diplomats in the region. Why decide to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel with a vague promise to move our embassy there? Did you receive anything of value in return? Did you get a promise of movement toward peace in the region? We know what you received. You got a chance to change the headline from your continuing troubles for 24 hours. If your decision results in violence against Americans, your short-term decision will result in lifelong pain for the Americans you swore to protect. ELLIOTT MILLER, BALA CYNWYD, PA. "
"I’m contemplating writing a book on the first year of President Trump’s foreign policy, and I already know the name: “The Art of the Giveaway.” In nearly 30 years of covering United States foreign policy, I’ve never seen a president give up so much to so many for so little, starting with China and Israel. In both the Middle Kingdom and in the Land of Israel, Christmas came early this year. The Chinese and the Jews are both whispering to their kids: “There really is a Santa Claus.” And his name is Donald Trump. Who can blame them? Let’s start with Israel. Every Israeli government since its founding has craved United States recognition of Jerusalem as its capital. And every United States government has refrained from doing that, arguing that such a recognition should come only in the wake of an agreed final status peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians — until now. Today, Trump just gave it away — for free. Such a deal! Why in the world would you just give this away for free and not even use it as a lever to advance the prospect of an Israeli-Palestinian deal? Trump could have said two things to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. First, he could have said: “Bibi, you keep asking me to declare Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. O.K., I will do that. But I want a deal. Here’s what I want from you in return: You will declare an end to all Israeli settlement building in the West Bank, outside of the existing settlement bloc that everyone expects to be part of Israel in any two-state solution.” Such a trade-off is needed. It would produce a real advance for United States interests and for the peace process. As Dennis Ross, the veteran American Middle East peace negotiator and author of “Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.-Israeli Relationship From Truman to Obama,” explained: “When you stop building outside the settlement blocs, you preserve, at a maximum, the possibility of a two-state outcome and, at a minimum, the ability for Israelis to separate from Palestinians. Keep up the building in densely populated Palestinian areas and separation becomes impossible.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Won, but Lost His Agenda,” by Henry Olsen (Op-Ed, Nov. 21): What happened to Donald Trump’s populist agenda? Simple: He never had one. It was a scam to get elected.

"Ann Marie Buerkle, a commissioner at the federal agency charged with protecting consumers from hazardous toys and products, has seldom voted for a mandatory recall, a maximum fine or a tougher safety standard. In more than four years on the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Ms. Buerkle has opposed limiting dangerous carbon monoxide emissions in portable generators; resisted requiring safety technology on table saws; and disagreed with the other Republican commissioner on the five-member board by rejecting fines against companies that delayed reporting hazards to the agency, as required by law. As President Trump’s nominee to head the agency, she is drawing criticism for her positions. Like some Trump administration officials, Ms. Buerkle is an unabashed supporter of voluntary regulations, and believes that collaboration with manufacturers, rather than levying fines or imposing recalls, is the fastest way to get dangerous products off the market. “My top goal, of course, is safety,” said Ms. Buerkle, the agency’s acting chairwoman, in an interview. But she elaborated that in her view, the agency had become too emotionally reactive under the Obama administration. “The agency is supposed to be data-driven and science-driven,” she said. “It’s not supposed to be emotional.” A 66-year-old former nurse, lawyer and member of Congress, Ms. Buerkle is very likely to be confirmed soon by the Republican-controlled Senate, but her record has spurred opposition from Democrats and some consumer advocates. The Senate will also vote on another Trump nominee for the agency, Dana Baiocco, who has long worked as a lawyer defending companies against liability claims. The emergence of Ms. Buerkle, Ms. Baiocco, and the newly appointed general counsel, Patricia Hanz, in leadership roles represents a major shift in the tiny agency, which had in recent years taken a tougher stance against companies manufacturing toxic toys, flammable pajamas, exploding batteries and other household hazards.

"Classical music critics and writers of The New York Times share their picks for the best of the year. On Jan. 20, the day President Trump was inaugurated, the outspoken conductor Daniel Barenboim seized the moment to argue for the importance of culture and community at a time of bitter divisiveness. The occasion was the second of Mr. Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin’s sweeping survey of Bruckner’s nine symphonies at Carnegie Hall. After leading a magnificent account of Bruckner’s Second, Mr. Barenboim spoke to the audience to defend classical music from charges of elitism. Concerts like this one, he said, can bring audiences and musicians from around the world together as “one community” in an act of “human communication.” Referring to the events that day in Washington, he emphasized that America, of all countries, has “the possibility” to “make the world great!” The audience applauded vigorously. Here was a musician who has long channeled social ideals into artistic action, drawing explicit links between a Bruckner cycle and today’s roiling political issues. But I was struck all year by how many performances — challenging new works as well as repertory pieces we may take for granted — spoke to our fractious times. ANTHONY TOMMASINI ‘THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL’ Last year, I included the world premiere at the Salzburg Festival of Thomas Adès’s audacious opera, adapted from Luis Buñuel’s surreal 1962 film, on my list of favorite performances. I’m choosing it again this year, after the Metropolitan Opera presented the American premiere in October with an impressive cast and Mr. Adès conducting. The opera’s themes felt chillingly pertinent: In the plot, the guests at a fashionable dinner party find themselves psychologically trapped in the salon of their wealthy hosts. Some force — internal, imposed or both — seems to be sapping their will to act. There were eerie parallels between these panicked members of the ruling class and the elected officials in Washington who can sometimes seem frozen in deciding how, and even whether, to stand up to a norm-shattering administration.

"The N.F.L. on Wednesday extended the contract of Commissioner Roger Goodell for another five years, ending an unusually rancorous monthslong standoff with Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys’ owner, who wanted to derail the deal. A committee of owners negotiating Goodell’s compensation signed off on a contract worth roughly $200 million over five years, which is in line with his current deal. But unlike his current arrangement, nearly 90 percent of the potential compensation will be paid only if a variety of financial targets are met. The N.F.L. and its commissioner routinely negotiate such matters behind closed doors. But this year, disorder among owners spilled out in public, leading to an extraordinary tit-for-tat of threats of legal action and rebukes that added to the sense of a league anxious over its future. Despite declining television ratings, persistent worries about the safety of the game and a backlash against the league because of players protesting during the national anthem, the league is still a financial juggernaut, with $14 billion in annual revenue. That is a big reason the owners are comfortable keeping Goodell — who became commissioner in 2006 — on for another five years. But with anxiety over the league’s weaknesses growing, Jones and other owners wanted to ensure Goodell continued to focus on growing the league’s business. As a result, they have insisted that most of his compensation in the coming years be based on the N.F.L. hitting financial targets, with various owners signing off on bonuses linked to the targets. Goodell’s guaranteed salary before those potential bonuses will be about $4 million a year. In a letter sent to every owner on Wednesday, Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the committee, said that Goodell’s contract extension was “fully consistent with ‘market’ compensation” and was “in the best interests of ownership.” Contrary to Jones’s efforts to undermine the deal, Blank said there was nearly a consensus to offer Goodell an extension and to move quickly “to avoid further controversy surrounding this issue.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has decided that the National Security Agency and the F.B.I. can lawfully keep operating their warrantless surveillance program even if Congress fails to extend the law authorizing it before an expiration date of New Year’s Eve, according to American officials. National security officials have implored Congress for the past year and a half to extend the legal basis for the program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, before it lapses at the end of the month. They portrayed such a bill as the “top legislative priority” for keeping the country safe. But with Congress focused on passing a major tax cut and divided over what changes, if any, to make to the surveillance program, lawmakers may miss that deadline. Hedging against that risk, executive branch lawyers have now concluded that the government could lawfully continue to spy under the program through late April without new legislation. Intelligence officials nonetheless remain intent on getting lawmakers to pass a durable extension of Section 702 by the end of the month — warning that even a stopgap short-term extension of several months, as some lawmakers have proposed, would risk throwing the program into a crisis in the spring. “We fully expect Congress to reauthorize this critical statute by the end of the year,” said Brian Hale, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “Not doing so would be unthinkable in light of the considerable value Section 702 provides in protecting the nation.” The expiring law grew out of the Bush administration’s once-secret Stellarwind warrantless surveillance program after the Sept. 11 attacks. After it came to light, Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to legalize a form of the program. "
"The journalist and author of “People Who Eat Darkness” and, most recently, “Ghosts of the Tsunami” avoids “lad lit” even more assiduously than he avoids “chick lit.” What books are on your nightstand? The books beside my bed are like the expensive, and suspiciously unsullied, pair of running shoes in the cupboard: an aspiration, and a symbol of the man I would like to be rather than the one I truly am. I’ve got the “Collected Poems” of W. B. Yeats and Ted Hughes, both of which I did in fact read a good deal of over the summer. I’ve got “Asia’s Reckoning: The Struggle for Global Dominance,” by Richard McGregor, which I hear great things about. “Quennets,” by Philip Terry, is a book of experimental poetry, purchased in a fit of avant-garde fervour that I will no doubt get round to one of these decades. Right at the bottom of the pile is “Ulysses,” by James Joyce. I know, I know … I read it at university, and then got halfway through it again in my 30s. And then stopped. For a while, I kept it in the loo, with the idea that I would read it in short, but regular, doses. It’s been in its current position for a few years. What’s the last great book you read? There are Great Books, and then there are great books. My last Great Book was “Nostromo,” by Joseph Conrad, which is admirable in all kinds of ways, but not as great as “Austerlitz,” by W. G. Sebald, which I seem to reread every two years. Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets — working today do you admire most? Like many male British writers my age, I am engaged in a grotesque Oedipal struggle with Martin Amis. His new collection of journalism, “The Rub of Time,” produced the usual reaction in me: intense, fawning admiration for his wit and verve, interspersed with bursts of contemptuous irritation at some pomposity or other. Annoyingly, for a part-time dabbler, he is one the finest writers of nonfiction in English. "
"WASHINGTON — Former Gov. Phil Bredesen, the last Democrat to win statewide office in Tennessee, announced on Thursday that he would run for the seat being vacated by Senator Bob Corker, handing his party a conceivable, if extremely narrow, path back to a Senate majority in 2018. Mr. Bredesen, a wealthy business executive and two-term governor who swept every county in the state in his 2006 re-election bid, was aggressively courted by Senate Democrats, who have been eyeing any potential openings in a year that features a forbidding map for the party. Democrats are defending 25 Senate seats next year, 10 of them in states that President Trump won. But if Mr. Bredesen can mount a strong campaign, Tennessee would join Nevada and Arizona as states where Republican-held Senate seats could be in jeopardy. Republicans currently have a two-seat majority. A win by Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the Alabama special election on Tuesday would provide a wider path to the majority. Mr. Bredesen, 74, declared his candidacy with a web video that illustrated why he could prove a formidable candidate but also why he faces a bruising campaign that could prove the most expensive in state history.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Arab and European leaders, Pope Francis and the U.N. criticized President Trump’s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. (Here’s the full video and transcript of his comments.) Mr. Trump seemed to relish playing a familiar role: the political insurgent, defying orthodoxy on behalf of his political base. While some American Jewish leaders welcomed the announcement, many worried that it could make peace in the Middle East even harder to achieve. Some in the region expect reactions to be muted as the Palestinian cause, once a rallying cry for Arab unity, has been overshadowed by the wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and the contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional dominance. _____ "
"In these dark, chaotic times, it would not be unrealistic for someone, when asked what color will represent 2018, to look around and guess, say, black. Or maybe deep, bloody burgundy. Wartime red? Fake-tan orange? At the very least, soot gray. Any of them would seemingly match different shades of the general mood. And yet the self-proclaimed “color authorities” at Pantone sent approximately 10 people to blanket the globe for weeks at a time last year, searching for color signals in food, cars, cosmetics, clothes and housewares. They reconvened, pooled their findings, did their analysis and declared the color of 2018 to be … Ultra Violet. Huh? Yup, the highlighter-purple shade that has also been the name of a Warhol superstar who died in 2014; a 2006 dystopian action film starring Milla Jovovich as a rebel infected with a vampiric virus; an online activist community founded in 2012 to combat sexism and violence toward women; and a kind of light that can cause skin cancer (ahem). Those things may not be exactly what you think about when you think about what’s coming, but the history does demonstrate that the idea has a broad reach. Ultra Violet can be many things to many people. It “communicates originality, ingenuity and visionary thinking,” Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said by way of explanation. It is found in the cosmos (think of all those swirling purple nebulae!), the wellness movement (amethyst crystals!) and was a favorite color of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who, Ms. Eiseman said, used to wear a purple cape when he was trying to be creative. Ditto Wagner, who liked to surround himself with purple when he was composing. Also, of course, Prince. "

"Barack Obama is not the subject of “Quest,” Jonathan Olshefski’s new documentary, an intimate and patient portrait of a North Philadelphia family. But the film, which begins and ends with presidential elections — Mr. Obama’s in 2008 and his successor’s eight years later — is shadowed, in some ways haunted, by his presence and his temperament. At one point, he appears on television, in the wake of the massacre of school children and their teachers in Newtown, Conn. “These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods,” he says, referring to the places that have been devastated by gun violence. “These children are our children.” The simple inclusiveness of that idea and the feeling behind it — the sense that this nation, with all of its troubles, is something we’re all in together — may sound especially poignant now, and even a bit quaint. But a similar ethic of solidarity informs every moment of “Quest,” which brings us into the neighborhood and the home of Christopher and Christine’a Rainey and their teenage daughter, PJ. Christopher is also known as Quest, which is the name of the recording studio where he sits behind the mixing boards as local rappers spit their rhymes. Christine’a is Ma Quest, and the two of them, without vanity or any expectation of praise or reward, serve as mentors, confidants and semi-parental figures for the people around them. Mr. Rainey wakes up at dawn to deliver coupon circulars door to door. His wife works long hours at a shelter for survivors of domestic violence. If you lived in North Philly, you would want to know them. “Quest” offers the gift of imagining that you do, even as it honors their complicated, sometimes opaque individuality. Mr. Olshefski doesn’t pry too intrusively into their lives. He and his crew record only what the Raineys are willing to tell and show, and a story takes shape in response to events in their lives. Time flows like a current rather than advancing steadily according to the calendar or the clock. Mr. Obama’s first term passes in the blink of an eye. Before you know it, PJ and her father are talking about Mitt Romney as the 2012 election draws near. Politics is part of their world, and some of the issues that have recently galvanized public debate — health care, addiction, crime, tensions between the police and African-American citizens — figure prominently in “Quest.” Gun violence affects the Raineys with direct and traumatic force, disrupting the film’s calm, contemplative rhythm. (There’s another, blessedly benign twist later on.) The disaster that strikes them is upsetting, and the stoicism with which they keep going is at least equally moving. "

"Almost a year ago, after heavy criticism from President-elect Donald J. Trump, Ford Motor Company canceled plans to build a $1.6 billion car plant in Mexico and announced that it would instead equip a Michigan factory to make electric and hybrid models. Now the automaker is changing its plans again, saying it intends to assemble new battery-powered cars in Mexico, not Michigan. But the Michigan location will get an even larger investment than previously planned and will focus on making a range of self-driving cars. The switch comes as the Trump administration has been pushing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Few industries are more heavily affected by the accord than the auto sector, which has rushed to build plants in Mexico over the last several years to take advantage of lower labor costs and that country’s extensive network of trade agreements. Late last month, Vice President Mike Pence met with top executives from Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler to discuss trade and the renegotiation effort. Automakers have been concerned that changes to the trade accord, such as rules requiring the use of more American-made parts, could raise the cost of vehicles produced in Mexican plants and hurt the value of the plants they have built. Sherif Marakby, Ford’s vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification, said Thursday that the company had altered its plans for the Michigan plant — in Flat Rock, 25 miles southwest of Detroit — because it now expected the market for self-driving cars for taxis and delivery fleets to grow rapidly after it rolls out its first model in 2021.

"The Masterpiece Cakeshop case, with its free speech claim by the baker who doesn’t want to bake, received enormous attention, both before and after this week’s Supreme Court argument. And no wonder: The baker’s position that no law can force him to lend his “art” to a use to which he objects — celebrating a same-sex wedding — would, if accepted, invite a flood of “I would prefer not to” opt-outs from anti-discrimination laws meant to apply to all. Another free speech case on the Supreme Court’s calendar with equally profound implications hasn’t yet caught the public’s eye, even though it is likely to be the only abortion-related case on the court’s docket this term. The justices accepted the case, National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra three weeks ago, and will hear it this winter. Just as Masterpiece Cakeshop is about far more than bakers and their creative expression, this case transcends the subject of abortion. The First Amendment question it presents is doctrinally complex but can fairly be boiled down to this: when is it unconstitutional to require an entity that deals with the public to tell its customers the truth? At issue are requirements that a 2015 California law imposes on “crisis pregnancy centers,” described in the legislative record as places that “pose as full-service women’s health clinics, but aim to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions” through “intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices.” These centers exist all over the country, and in many states are more numerous than actual abortion clinics. Women find their way to them by looking up “abortion” in the telephone book or by responding to ads on mass transit (“Pregnant? Need help?”). California has some 200 of them, most, like those that sued the state in this case, run by organizations with religious-based opposition to abortion. The main plaintiff, known as Nifla for short, is a Virginia-based national organization that describes its mission as to “empower the choice for life.” It operates 111 pregnancy centers in California alone, of which most are licensed medical clinics and the rest are unlicensed offices that provide self-administered pregnancy tests, referrals to doctors for prenatal care, and free baby supplies such as diapers.

"Given the triumph of contemporary conservatism, it may be time for liberals to take a look at the vulnerabilities of their own orthodoxies. Democrats who yearn for President Trump to be taken down should examine this list of Republican strengths: victories in all three contested special elections for the House of Representatives this year; Trump’s 82 percent approval rating among Republican voters; his success with the current tax bill; his swift evisceration of key regulatory policies; the Gorsuch appointment to the Supreme Court; economic growth of over 3 percent in the last two quarters; the Dow Jones topping 24,000; and the unemployment rate dropping to 4.1 percent. For the moment, the left is both stunned and infuriated by the vehement animosity it faces from red America, which is made up of counties that are 84 percent less dense than blue America, 37 percent less racially and ethnically diverse, and 34 percent more white. Voters in red America are 44 percent less likely to be college graduates and 22 percent more likely to have served in the armed forces. Geographically speaking, red counties are virtually nonexistent on the West Coast and on the East Coast north of the Mason-Dixon line. Many Democrats continue to have little understanding of their own role — often inadvertent, an unintended consequence of well-meaning behavior — in creating the conditions that make conservatives willing to support Trump and the party he is leading. I asked Karen Stenner, the author of “The Authoritarian Dynamic” and no fan of the president, for her explanation of the political dynamic in the current struggle between left and right. She emailed back: In fact, Stenner argues, these values are the subject of intense debate. They lie at the core of what divides America: Not only are the values that the left takes for granted heatedly disputed in many sections of the country, the way many Democratic partisans assert that their values supplant or transcend traditional beliefs serves to mobilize the right.

"President Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration is making a radical break with nearly 70 years of official United States policy and with the international community: He is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. This decision will be interpreted by Palestinians, Arabs and the rest of the world as a major provocation. It will cause irreparable harm to Mr. Trump’s own plans to make peace in the Middle East, and to any future administration’s efforts, as well. It will also undermine the United States’ own national security. The president should reconsider this decision immediately. Since Israel was established in 1948, the United Nations and the United States, like most countries, have refused to recognize any country’s sovereignty over Jerusalem, a city holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians. For this reason, the United States has always maintained its embassy to Israel in Tel Aviv. Since Israel militarily occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the United States and the international community have rejected as illegal Israel’s attempts to cement its control over the city by expanding its boundaries, annexing it and constructing a ring of settlements on occupied Palestinian land around its outskirts to sever it from the rest of the West Bank. With his announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump has legitimized Israel’s illegal actions and sent the message that the United States no longer has any regard for international conventions or norms, and that might and power prevail over justice and the law.

"This is the text of the keynote speech delivered on receipt of an honorary doctorate at Yeshiva University’s annual Hanukkah dinner in New York on Sunday. Thank you for the honor you do me with this degree. I’d like to think that somewhere in the great upstairs my rabbinical forbears from Vilna are smiling on this occasion. My topic this evening concerns the future of the United States — or, as some of my more pessimistic friends in the Never Trump camp are prone to frame the question: “What future?” It is prompted by the reflection that tonight is this 93rd year for this event, and thus by a sense of curiosity about where the world might be 93 years hence. I hope that my youngest child will have just celebrated her 101st birthday. And I predict the Jets will be no closer to winning a Super Bowl. What about the rest of America? Suppose it’s the year 2110, and a history professor at Yeshiva’s Business School is asking her students to name the inventions or innovations that defined the economic terms of the 21st century, much in the way that airplanes, the Model-T, and penicillin defined the 20th century, or the steam engine and locomotive defined the 19th.

"WASHINGTON — Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., defended his work force on Thursday in a politically charged hearing on Capitol Hill, rebutting President Trump’s accusation that the bureau was in “tatters” and fending off attacks from Republicans on personnel. The unusual scenario — the nation’s top law enforcement official pressed by normally deferential Republican lawmakers — was a reflection of the extreme partisanship that has taken hold in Washington. The F.B.I., whose leadership and agents have long seen it as an apolitical institution, has been thrust into the political maelstrom repeatedly over the past two years. Mr. Wray, who became director in August, remained unflappable during his first appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, touting the work of the F.B.I.’s nearly 37,000 employees. “There is no finer institution than the F.B.I. and no finer people than the men and women who work there,” he said. Mr. Wray was pressed by Republicans on the political leanings of F.B.I. agents and Justice Department prosecutors. Lawmakers tried to cast doubt on the impartiality of the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, noting that prosecutors on his team donated to Democrats. They also repeatedly brought up Peter Strzok, an F.B.I. agent who was removed from Mr. Mueller’s staff because of potentially anti-Trump text messages he traded with another person on the team. Mr. Strzok was also a key member of the F.B.I. team that investigated whether Hillary Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information. According to F.B.I. documents, he interviewed Mrs. Clinton. "
"WASHINGTON — Congress approved a two-week stopgap measure on Thursday that will avoid a government shutdown this weekend, pushing until just before Christmas a broader possible showdown over spending priorities, immigration and health care. The measure, which the House and Senate passed in quick succession, would fund the government through Dec. 22. President Trump is expected to sign it. “Along with enacting historic tax reform, we’ll be working together in the next two weeks to find a long-term solution to our funding needs while maintaining fiscal discipline,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. The approval came as congressional leaders from both parties met with Mr. Trump at the White House to talk about the thicket of issues facing lawmakers as the end of the year approaches. In negotiations this month, Democrats plan to press to shield from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has pledged to support the passage of bipartisan legislation intended to stabilize health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers also want to provide tens of billions of dollars in response to this year’s hurricanes and wildfires, and they need to provide funds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, whose financing lapsed at the end of September.

"John Lewis, the civil rights leader and Democratic congressman from Georgia, said Thursday that he would not attend opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum this weekend because President Trump would be there. In a joint statement, Mr. Lewis and Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said Mr. Trump’s presence at the event would be disrespectful to the memory of those who participated in the struggle for civil rights, particularly in light of his “disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants and National Football League players.” They encouraged people to visit the museum “after President Trump departs.” “President Trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,” the statement said. “The struggles represented in this museum exemplify the truth of what really happened in Mississippi.” In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Mr. Lewis said that he might attend the event in Jackson, Miss., if Mr. Trump did not. “Right now we’re not going,” said Mr. Lewis, who was badly beaten by the police while marching from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that it was “unfortunate” that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Thompson would not “join the President in honoring the incredible sacrifice civil rights leaders made to right the injustices in our history.” "
"President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel not only upends decades of American policy. It also appears to put the United States at odds with the United Nations Security Council. The 15-member council has adopted a number of resolutions, dating back 50 years, aimed in part at preventing Israel from claiming sovereignty over all of the holy city. That could make for awkward diplomatic dynamics on the council, where none of the other members share Mr. Trump’s position on Jerusalem. Eight members, including Britain, France and Italy, allies of the United States, have called for an emergency meeting of the council on Friday to discuss Mr. Trump’s declaration. Many supporters of Israel have long accused the United Nations of bias against it, a criticism that the United States ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, has echoed and vowed to change. As Israel’s strongest ally at the United Nations, the United States often has used its veto power to block Security Council resolutions critical of Israel. But there have been exceptions, including for resolutions concerning the status of Jerusalem. "

he end of the year at The New York Times usually means a rush of big, ambitious stories — and don’t miss this examination of Harvey Weinstein’s complicity machine, detailing all the people who knew about his behavior and did nothing, or helped hide it. But this week, I’m counterprogramming with a newsletter of (mostly) bite-size thoughts. 1. Two of Australia’s biggest stories this year — same-sex marriage, and China’s influence on politics — reached their expected conclusions this week. As you no doubt know, Parliament changed the definition of marriage, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull proposed new laws that would limit foreign interference. What stood out to me? Consensus. At a time when democracy around the world often looks meek or messy, Canberra managed to look this week like a capital populated with reasonable adults. Bravo, folks, bravo. 2. I watched “Animal Kingdom” this week, on the recommendation of a friend who works in Australian film. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s harsh criticism of the F.B.I. elicited a rare and impassioned defense on Thursday from its director, Christopher A. Wray, even as he noted “no shortage of opinions out there” about the bureau. Mr. Wray’s comments to the House Judiciary Committee may as well have described Mr. Trump’s own shifting stances on the F.B.I., C.I.A. and other federal agencies that do intelligence and law enforcement work. A review of Mr. Trump’s comments during and after the 2016 presidential campaign reveals his eagerness to praise them when they investigate his opponents. He is quick to rebuke them, however, when their actions do not align with his interests. Presidents normally refrain from commenting on or interfering with law enforcement investigations or intelligence analyses to avoid being seen as politicizing them. Most recently, Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday that the F.B.I.’s “reputation is in Tatters — worst in History!” following last week’s guilty plea by Michael T. Flynn, the former White House national security adviser, for lying to investigators. Mr. Trump also suggested, falsely, that the F.B.I. refused to charge Hillary Clinton for lying — a claim its former director, James B. Comey, has refuted multiple times. "

"WASHINGTON — The Republican tax bills moving through Congress could significantly hobble the United States’ renewable energy industry because of a series of provisions that scale back incentives for wind and solar power while bolstering older energy sources like oil and gas production. The possibility highlights the degree to which the nation’s recent surge in renewable electricity generation is still sustained by favorable tax treatment, which has lowered the cost of solar and wind production while provoking the ire of fossil-fuel competitors seeking to weaken those tax preferences. Whether lawmakers choose to protect or jettison various renewable tax breaks in the final bill being negotiated on Capitol Hill could have major ramifications for the United States energy landscape, including the prices consumers pay for electricity. Wind and solar are two of the fastest-growing sources of power in the country, providing 7 percent of  electricity last year. Sharp declines in the cost of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels, coupled with generous tax credits that can offset at least 30 percent of project costs, have made new wind and solar even cheaper than  running existing fossil-fuel plants in parts of the country. In different ways, direct and indirect, the House and Senate bills each imperil elements of that ascension. A Senate bill provision intended to stop multinational companies from shifting profits overseas could unexpectedly cripple a key financing tool used by the renewable energy industry, particularly solar, by eroding the value of tax credits that banks and other financial institutions buy from energy companies. The House bill’s effects would be more direct, rolling back tax credits for wind farms and electric vehicles, while increasing federal support for two nuclear reactors under construction in Georgia. Fossil fuel producers are under little pressure in either bill and some would stand to benefit: The Senate legislation would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling, while a last-minute amendment added by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, would allow oil and gas companies to receive lower tax rates on their profits.

"The world took a significant step toward averting future financial meltdowns Thursday, just as the United States under President Trump begins relaxing constraints on risky behavior by banks. A group of global central bank governors and bank regulators, meeting in Frankfurt, signed off on the last chapter of a banking rule book they began writing after the financial crisis began in 2008. The rules are intended to prevent the kind of mischief by banks that triggered the last meltdown, causing millions of people to lose their homes and jobs. The rules are the capstone of years of grindingly detailed work by the so-called Basel Committee. Known as Basel III, the rules require banks to reduce their dependence on borrowed money so they are less susceptible to losses from bad loans, market turmoil or other problems. “It’s a great day,” Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference. But he acknowledged that the agreement was not perfect. “This is a compromise,” Mr. Draghi said. The rules will make the banking system more resilient, he added, but “nothing is crisis proof.” The negotiators were unable, for example, to reach agreement on a way to address one of the root causes of the government debt crisis that nearly destroyed the eurozone a few years ago.

"WASHINGTON — Representative Trent Franks of Arizona, one of the House’s most ardent social conservatives, said Thursday night that he would resign after the House Ethics Committee began an investigation into complaints that he had asked two female staff members to be a surrogate to bear his child. In a statement, Mr. Franks said the discussion about surrogacy came up with “two previous female subordinates” because he and his wife, who have struggled with fertility, wanted to have a child. He said he regretted that the conversations had “caused distress.” “Due to my familiarity and experience with the process of surrogacy, I clearly became insensitive as to how the discussion of such an intensely personal topic might affect others,” Mr. Franks said. Mr. Franks denied that he had ever “physically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.” His statement said only that he deeply regretted discussing the topic of surrogacy, but a Republican familiar with the accusation said that Mr. Frank had specifically asked those aides to be surrogates. Speaker Paul D. Ryan was briefed a week ago on “credible claims of misconduct” and presented them to Mr. Franks, according to a separate statement from his office. When the congressman did not deny them, the speaker referred the matter to the Ethics Committee and told him to resign. Mr. Ryan’s statement did not detail the behavior in question. "
"All but two of 11 former United States ambassadors to Israel contacted by The New York Times after President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital thought the plan was wrongheaded, dangerous or deeply flawed. The 11 ex-envoys all closely followed Mr. Trump’s announcement on Wednesday, in which he also set in motion a plan to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Even those who agreed that Mr. Trump was recognizing the reality on the ground disagreed with his approach — making a major diplomatic concession without any evident gain in return. One of the exceptions was Ogden R. Reid, a former congressman who was the ambassador from 1959 to 1961, at the end of the Eisenhower administration. “I think it’s the right decision,” he said. “Not a lot more to say.” The other exception was Edward S. Walker Jr., who was ambassador from 1997 to 1999, under President Bill Clinton. “I think it’s about time,” he said. “We’ve been remiss in not recognizing realities as they are. We all know Israel has a capital, it’s called Jerusalem, and over my 35 years of service in the Middle East no one ever questioned that.” What about the departure from United States policy since 1948 — that the final status of Jerusalem is a matter for negotiation between the Israelis and Palestinians — and the condemnation from the international community? “It’s really a question of what are the lines, the borders, to be drawn around the state of Israel and the ultimate state of Palestine,” Mr. Walker said. “Nothing in what the president has said precludes the negotiation of a settlement of this issue.” "
"From the start, Lena Dunham and Hillary Clinton were something of an odd match. The millennial daughter of New York privilege known for her audacious public presence and frequent nudity on her HBO show, “Girls.” And the baby boomer raised with a steely Midwestern reserve, a devotion to her Methodist faith and a fierce affinity for a “zone of privacy.” But early on in a presidential election unlike any other, Ms. Dunham and Mrs. Clinton became a kind of package deal, with the campaign scrambling to reach young women and dispatching Ms. Dunham as one of its most visible ambassadors. On Tuesday, the generational tensions that hummed beneath the alliance during the presidential campaign exploded into public view. The rift came as a result of comments made by Ms. Dunham for an article published in The New York Times on Tuesday about the film mogul Harvey Weinstein and how he used a network of lawyers, publicists and journalists to protect his reputation and, in some cases, enable the sexual aggression of which he is accused. In the article, Ms. Dunham said she had warned two Clinton campaign officials against associating with Mr. Weinstein. “I just want you to know that Harvey’s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,” Ms. Dunham said she told the campaign. In reply to Ms. Dunham’s comments, Nick Merrill, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton, said, “As to claims about a warning, that’s something staff wouldn’t forget.” Ms. Dunham’s prominence in the Clinton campaign made her comments particularly resonant. Mrs. Clinton leaned on Ms. Dunham’s support so heavily that the actress and writer was awarded a prime speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (“Hi, I’m Lena Dunham and according to Donald Trump, my body is probably, like, a 2.”) "
"Let me ask you a question; take your time in answering it. Would you be willing to take health care away from a thousand children with the bad luck to have been born into low-income families so that you could give millions of extra dollars to just one wealthy heir? You might think that this question is silly, hypothetical and has an obvious answer. But it’s not at all hypothetical, and the answer apparently isn’t obvious. For it’s a literal description of the choice Republicans in Congress seem to be making as you read this. The Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, is basically a piece of Medicaid targeted on young Americans. It was introduced in 1997, with bipartisan support. Last year it covered 8.9 million kids. But its funding expired more than two months ago. Republicans keep saying they’ll restore the money, but they keep finding reasons not to do it; state governments, which administer the program, will soon have to start cutting children off. What’s the problem? The other day Senator Orrin Hatch, asked about the program (which he helped create), once again insisted that it will be funded — but without saying when or how (and there don’t seem to be any signs of movement on the issue). And he further declared, “The reason CHIP’s having trouble is that we don’t have money anymore.” Then he voted for an immense tax cut. And one piece of that immense tax cut is a big giveaway to inheritors of large estates. Under current law, a married couple’s estate pays no tax unless it’s worth more than $11 million, so that only a handful of estates — around 5,500, or less than 0.2 percent of the total number of deaths a year — owe any tax at all. The number of taxable estates is also, by the way, well under one one-thousandth of the number of children covered by CHIP. But Republicans still consider this tax an unacceptable burden on the rich. The Senate bill would double the exemption to $22 million; the House bill would eliminate the estate tax entirely. "
"To keep its graduate students from unionizing, Harvard is pushing the government to weaken important protections for workers across the United States. That’s not how the university puts it, of course. But as law students who came to Harvard to study labor, we are alarmed by the implications of the anti-organizing tactics the school is using against its students. The institution is poised to hobble unions far beyond our Cambridge campus. As teaching and research assistants at other universities have done, many graduate students at Harvard seek access to collective bargaining. They want basic protections like access to better pay, an independent grievance procedure for sexual harassment cases and adequate health care. Harvard is not unlike other elite institutions that oppose graduate student unionization attempts, but its current legal strategy poses a threat to workers inside and outside the academy. To understand how the university could gut workers’ rights, it’s important to explain the importance of what is called, in labor law, the “Excelsior list.” Workers across many industries can vote for union representation if 30 percent of employees want it. The workers can choose a union for representation and then file for an election, and all eligible employees have a right to vote on whether to unionize or not. In the past, during the lead-up to a unionization vote, employers could easily make their case against unionization but hopeful unions had no way of ensuring that all potential voters knew about the organizing campaign. In 1966 the National Labor Relations Board decided that this issue for workers — specifically, a “lack of information with respect to one of the choices available” — impeded their free choice in voting. The board declared that employers must provide unions with a master list of their employees, an Excelsior list, to ensure that union supporters could make their case to everyone before the election. "
"While President Trump has followed in few of his predecessors’ footsteps, his administration has done the expected in at least one respect: It has undertaken a Middle East peace initiative in its first year. Most recent administrations have done the same, and all have failed. Will Mr. Trump do any better? The specifics of the initiative are still being hammered out, but some elements are clear. Most administrations start with modest proposals to build trust between the parties and then, when these efforts have bred mutual suspicion and disappointment, they propose a framework for an agreement just as the process moves toward collapse. Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the chief negotiator, have done the reverse, hinting that Washington will lay down the principles of an agreement at the outset of talks, but without imposing them on either party. A two-state solution might not be in the cards. While talks toward a plan move forward, the administration will undertake a series of confidence-building measures; these might include a Palestinian pledge to resume security cooperation with Israel in return for the transfer of a bit of land to the Palestinian Authority, a limited settlement freeze and economic aid for West Bank Palestinians. This is standard fare. Mr. Trump will also try to regionalize the process. In exchange for Israeli flexibility, Arab countries in the Sunni coalition — notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — would extend privileges that Israel has long coveted, including overflight and perhaps some sort of diplomatic status, and offer lavish funding to prop up the Palestinian entity that signs an agreement with Israel. The Obama administration attempted to elicit Saudi involvement, too, but King Abdullah rejected its proposal. As the process evolves, the particulars of these canonical provisions will change as well. In addition, on Wednesday Mr. Trump conferred American recognition on Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and announced that the Embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He did not, however, define what he meant by “Jerusalem,” only defining it as an Israeli capital whose boundaries have yet to be negotiated with Palestinians. It is therefore unclear what precisely has been formally recognized. It is possible that Mr. Trump is attempting to lure Israel into concessions through this policy departure and maybe even trap Mr. Netanyahu into responding in kind. But the emptiness of the gesture suggests otherwise. One thing that the announcement will have done is to shore up the president’s evangelical base, who won’t inquire too closely into the practical import of the announcement but will be seduced by the headlines it generates.

"WORCESTER, Mass. — Hundreds of protests were staged across the country on Thursday in the latest uproar over a repeal of rules ensuring an open internet. The drumbeat of action can in good part be traced back to a yellow Victorian house in this leafy New England city. The home is the nerve center for Fight for the Future, a scrappy 10-person nonprofit that has helped lead the opposition to the change — even if its effort to protect so-called net neutrality has the longest of odds. For months, the founders, Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson, have pushed the group’s 1.8 million supporters to flood social media sites with warnings about how the change could favor big companies and hurt smaller ones. They have also supplied online tools to their followers, like one that makes it easier to call lawmakers and another to file comments directly to the Federal Communications Commission, the agency considering the repeal. For next week, just ahead of the agency’s vote on the proposal, they have organized hundreds of internet companies to alter their websites — slowing them down, for example — to show what online experiences could be like without the rules. “We believe people care about this enough to take a stand,” Ms. Cheng, 37, said while sitting inside the house, nearly surrounded in a tiny office by bookshelves stocked with medieval literature. Their efforts may seem quixotic. Fight for the Future is trying to stop the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, from dismantling rules that prevent internet service providers from blocking websites or charging them for faster delivery to consumers. The group argues that the policy, passed in 2015 under the Obama administration and with a groundswell of support, helps protect free speech and expression online. "
"To the Editor: Re “Senator Al Franken Resigning Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations” (nytimes.com, Dec. 7): What I find truly disturbing and outright appalling about the calls that resulted in Senator Al Franken’s decision to resign is what this says about our standards for honesty and accountability, as well as the failing status of our political system. Notwithstanding the fact that, arguably, his behavior may be categorically different than that of Donald Trump and Roy Moore, in essence Mr. Franken is being punished for, in the view of some, admitting what he did and demonstrating remorse and accountability for inappropriate actions. In stark contrast, Mr. Trump and Mr. Moore are being rewarded for very likely lying, denying and, worse yet, viciously attacking their accusers, most of whom are widely seen as credible. This is a sad commentary on the state of our political system and a stain on our moral code. In his resignation speech Mr. Franken clearly captured the problem, citing the “irony in the fact that I am leaving, while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.” RICHARD CHERWITZ, AUSTIN, TEX. To the Editor: Men who harass and abuse women should be publicly shamed and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I do not think, however, that accusations alone should be enough to force a public official out of office. I understand that for too long people in power have looked the other way, and women have felt powerless and at the mercy of abusive men. Thank God it appears this has changed. However, I fear that in some cases the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. "
"The buzz around Leon Wieseltier, the former literary editor of The New Republic, began years ago, and it had nothing to do with the sexual harassment allegations that made headlines in October. Rather, it was about his exuberant hair. “He has very important hair!” Gore Vidal exclaimed in a 1995 article in Vanity Fair. Four years later Sam Tanenhaus, writing in The New York Times Magazine, characterized Mr. Wieseltier’s mop as not merely “strikingly white” and “luxuriant” but “well, leonine.” And when word of Mr. Wieseltier’s unwanted advances emerged this fall, his hair cropped up again. “Two great white tufts of it,” said The Weekly Standard. Behold the man halo — or, if you will, the “manlo.” It’s the woolly, curly or frizzy nimbus that orbits, and sometimes sits atop, the skulls of certain gentlemen. Depending on the bearer, it can denote creativity, maturity or eccentricity. The manlo registered a few weeks before Mr. Wieseltier’s ignominy, when Graydon Carter announced his resignation as editor of Vanity Fair after 25 years. Newsweek remarked on his “fluffy, almost airborne hair” (which, it noted humorously, also applies to President Trump). Variety called attention to his “unruly” whorls. This hairy pantheon is filled with lofty examples. Boston Magazine once described James Levine, who was suspended this week as conductor of the Metropolitan Opera amid sexual midconduct allegations, as having “a wiry gray fan shaped like the wings of an F-16.” The hair of another noted maestro, Seiji Ozawa, is so famously expansive that the website classicfm.com reckoned it to be least 50 percent “cumulonimbus.” Not long ago, The Washington Post published a photo essay entitled “Great moments in Bernie Sanders’s hair.” The gallery presented the Vermont senator’s minimal manlo in various incarnations, including “When it gracefully flowed in the Washington air” and “When it puffed itself out like a glorious mane.” "
"This was a year when books — like the rest of us — tried to keep up with the news, and did a pretty good job of it. Novels about global interconnectedness, political violence and migration; deeply reported nonfiction accounts of racial and economic strife in the United States; stories both imagined and real about gender, desire and the role of beauty in the natural world. There were several worthy works of escapism, of course, but the literary world mostly reflected the gravity and tumult of the larger world. Below, The New York Times’s three daily book critics — Dwight Garner, Jennifer Senior and Parul Sehgal — share their thoughts about their favorites among the books they reviewed this year, each list alphabetical by author. Janet Maslin, a former staff critic who remains a frequent contributor to The Times, also lists her favorites. The year in books included a historic change at The Times. Michiko Kakutani stepped down as our chief book critic in July. Kakutani began her role as a critic in 1983, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998.

This is Adiga’s third novel, and it offers proof that his Man Booker Prize, for “The White Tiger” in 2008, was no fluke. He is not merely a confident storyteller but also a thinker, a skeptic, a wily entertainer and a thorn in the side of orthodoxy and cant. This is a cricket novel that maintains a running critique of the sport, and a moving novel about fathers and sons. It’s a book about religion and its tribal cruelties, and it bears bad tidings. Adiga’s take on the world makes you consider what the apocalypse might sound like as reported by the BBC’s Hindi service. (Read the review.) ‘THE VIRGINIA STATE COLONY FOR EPILEPTICS AND FEEBLEMINDED: POEMS’ By Molly McCully Brown (Persea). This is Brown’s first book of poems, and it is part history lesson, part séance and part ode to dread. The title refers to an actual place, a government-run hospital that, in the early part of the 20th century, sterilized many of its patients without their consent. The author grew up near the institution, and it has long haunted her. Brown’s blank verse is supple yet restrained; it contains all its essential oils. In its formal design, and in its interest in art and history, the book resembles a slender ghost version of James Agee’s text for “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” (Read the review.) ‘TRANSIT’ By Rachel Cusk (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). Faye, the divorced writer who is the narrator of Cusk’s transfixing latest novel, is the same woman we met in the author’s previous novel, “Outline.” These two short books are part of a projected trilogy, and together they’re already an achievement: dense, aphoristic, philosophically acute novels that read like Iris Murdoch thrice-distilled. We watch Faye move through her days, speaking to friends, old lovers, real estate agents, salon employees, fellow writers, construction workers. Cusk’s writing offers the iron-rich pleasure of voice instead of style. (Read the review.) "

"WASHINGTON — United States officials have expressed concern about security at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February, initially raising the possibility of withdrawing from the games but later insisting that American athletes will compete. The American envoy to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said on Wednesday that it was an “open question” whether American athletes would be able to attend the Winter Games, given the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, echoed Ms. Haley’s remarks during a briefing for reporters on Thursday, saying that “no official decision has been made” about participating in the Olympics. Asked about whether the reason is security concerns, she said “absolutely.” But moments later, Ms. Sanders took to Twitter to clarify, saying that “the U.S. looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics in South Korea. The protection of Americans is our top priority and we are engaged with the South Koreans and other partner nations to secure the venues.” The Winter Games are scheduled to be held Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang, a city about 50 miles south of the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea.

"Good Thursday. Here’s what is happening: • Morgan Stanley has fired Harold Ford Jr. for misconduct. • Bob Iger might stay at Disney a little longer. • Bitcoin Surges Past $16,000 Like what you see? Get the DealBook Briefing in your inbox each morning. Here’s the sign-up. The Associated Press reports: Take a look at its move over the past 40 hours. Late Tuesday one bitcoin traded around $11,700.

The cryptocurrency has retreated since crossing $19,000 and was recently trading above $16,500. Bitcoin was valued at less than $1,000 at the start of the year and has gained more than 15,000 percent so far this year.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, Time magazine named “the silence breakers” — the women speaking out against sexual harassment and assault — as 2017’s Person of the Year. It’s an excellent choice. Decades from now, I expect we will look back on this year as a turning point on this issue. And unlike many potential 2017 turning points, this one is welcome. Still, don’t forget the terrible price many women pay for speaking up: “Nearly all of the people Time interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up.” Related: Lauren Greene, a former staff member to Blake Farenthold, a Texas congressman, has suffered both personally and professionally after accusing Farenthold of sexual harassment. Rachael Bade of Politico reported the details this week, and they’re worth reading. In The Times, Thomas Chatterton Williams writes that too many women — often poor and of color — are prevented from telling their stories of harassment and assault. Unfairness in higher ed. This country’s colleges are not the meritocracies they claim to be. Top public and private colleges — as measured by resources, graduation rates or just about anything else — still disproportionately enroll affluent students. The colleges do so even though many highly qualified low- and middle-income students exist, as I’ve written before. "
"WASHINGTON — Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, in an emotional speech on the Senate floor, announced on Thursday that he would resign from Congress, the most prominent figure in a growing list of lawmakers felled by charges of sexual harassment or indiscretions. At turns defiant and mournful but hardly contrite, Mr. Franken called it “the worst day of my political life,” as he denied allegations of groping and improper advances from at least six women. Instead, as his Democratic colleagues looked on, he took a parting shot at President Trump and Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama; both have also been accused of sexual misconduct. “I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party,” Mr. Franken said. Hours later, Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, resigned after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment — a move that made him the third member of Congress to leave under a cloud of claims of sexual impropriety in three days. On Tuesday, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and the longest-serving African-American in House history, also quit. The dizzying series of departures comes during a national reckoning over sexual misconduct in the workplace that has cost men their jobs across the spectrum of American life, including in the entertainment and media industries, the arts, academia and now, politics. As accusations of sexual improprieties continue to swirl on Capitol Hill, lawmakers have struggled with how to respond. Democrats and their leaders forced Mr. Conyers and Mr. Franken out in a succession of seemingly coordinated statements that made clear that their continued presence would be untenable. Mr. Franken stepped down one day after nearly all the Senate’s Democratic women — and most Democratic men, including the top two leaders — called for him to resign. "
"MSNBC pulled an abrupt about-face on Thursday, announcing that it had rehired a contributor just days after it fired him when far-right activists drew attention to an inflammatory tweet he posted in 2009. “Sometimes you just get one wrong — and that’s what happened here,” Phil Griffin, the cable network’s president said in a statement on Thursday announcing that the cable network had rehired Sam Seder, a political commentator and host of the “Majority Report” podcast. The episode began late last month when Mike Cernovich, the far-right activist, resurfaced a tweet sent by Mr. Seder in 2009 that was meant to mock supporters of the film director Roman Polanski. Mr. Seder’s tweet, which has since been deleted, was posted shortly after Mr. Polanski, who pleaded guilty in 1977 to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old, was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 in connection with that crime. As some spoke out to support Mr. Polanski, most prominently the French culture and foreign ministers, Mr. Seder posted a cutting parody of a statement defending the director. “Don’t care re Polanski, but i hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene,” Mr. Seder’s tweet said.

"JERUSALEM — Palestinians clashed with Israeli forces in the West Bank and along the border with Gaza on Thursday, as widespread predictions of unrest were realized a day after President Trump took the high-risk move of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Hundreds of youths clashed with Israeli forces at checkpoints. In Gaza, youths protested along the border fence, rallied in a central Gaza City park and burned tires in a refugee camp. Dozens were injured, at least one seriously. After nightfall, two rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza. The Israeli military said they had fallen short and landed inside the Palestinian coastal territory. The Israeli military said it was sending additional battalions to the West Bank in response to the protests. Mr. Trump’s decision ignited other protests across the region, from the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to Tunisia. Hundreds of Jordanians protested outside the United States Embassy in Amman and called for its closing, chanting, “America is the head of the snake.” At a news conference in Baghdad, Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Iraqi Shiite cleric, called for a unified “Arab Spring” against Israel. Jihadist groups from Somalia to Syria and from Yemen to Afghanistan issued venomous statements about Mr. Trump’s decision. "

"To the Editor: Re “President Calls Jerusalem Shift ‘the Right Thing’ ” (front page, Dec. 7): President Trump said all final status issues, like border issues in Jerusalem, remain open to negotiation between the parties. So he may not have actually denied that Jerusalem could be negotiated to be the capital of not only Israel but also Palestine: to be a shared capital. This could decrease the high emotion on all sides, and would seem the most important question to ask him about where United States policy stands today on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. JAMES ADLER, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: President Trump, in his speech about Jerusalem, called attention to President Harry S. Truman’s recognition of the state of Israel 70 years ago. But what Truman did not do was to recognize Jerusalem as its capital. Truman supported what we now call a two-state solution, a partition plan drawn up by the United Nations. Palestine would be divided into two separate states, one Jewish and one Arab. They would be tied together in an economic union. As for Jerusalem, an international zone would be established around the city to guarantee access by all faiths to their holy sites. Jews welcomed the partition. The Arabs did not. Truman believed that was a great missed historic opportunity. President Trump’s decision on Jerusalem will likely be seen as a great historic mistake, making a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians that much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.

"At 11:45 a.m. on Thursday, Al Franken, the Democratic senator from Minnesota, stood on the Senate floor and announced his intention to resign. He didn’t admit to allegations of groping and unwanted kisses, but argued that they’d become too great a distraction for him to serve effectively. “Minnesotans deserve a senator who can focus with all her energy on addressing the challenges they face every day,” he said, implying he’ll be replaced with a woman. While Franken is on his way out of the Senate, Roy Moore, Republican of Alabama, may be on his way in. Moore stands credibly accused of molesting a 14-year-old whom he picked up outside her mother’s custody hearing and of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old after offering her a ride home from her waitressing job. Nevertheless, Moore has President Trump’s endorsement. The Republican National Committee, which pulled financial support for Moore in November, has restored it. Recent polls show him leading in the special election set for Tuesday. Franken noted the asymmetry in his resignation speech: “I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.” This irony reveals the limits of the #MeToo movement. This week, Time magazine named those who’ve spoken out against sexual harassment — collectively called “The Silence Breakers” — as its Person of the Year. “When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former ‘Today’ show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door,” the cover article says. In truth, however, this new door is open for only some people — those whose harassers are either personally or professionally susceptible to shame. Since October, when the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was outed as a serial sexual predator and shunned by the social worlds he once ruled, an astonishing number of powerful and famous men have been fired and disgraced. It sometimes feels as if we’re in the midst of a cultural revolution where the toll of sexual harassment on women’s lives and ambitions will finally be reckoned with. But the revolution is smaller than it first appears. So far, it has been mostly confined to liberal-leaning sectors like entertainment, the media, academia, Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party. It hasn’t rocked the Republicans, corporate America or Wall Street — with some exceptions — because these realms are less responsive to feminist pressure. "
"Donald Trump is the contemporary master of a little-used literary device: the narcissistic third person. On the indictment of Paul Manafort: “There’s not even a mention of Trump in there.” On the possibility of Russian interference in the 2016 election: “Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?” Even his very first tweet, back in the innocent days of 2009, employed this peculiar mirror-gazing perspective: “Be sure to tune in and watch Donald Trump on Late Night with David Letterman ….” Like so much else that Mr. Trump favors — red baseball hats, caps lock — referring to oneself in the third person has, these past few years, come to seem tainted, almost pathological. It has entered the cultural lexicon — suitable only for the toweringly grandiose (LeBron) or the deeply immature (Elmo). When the writers of a drama wish to signal that someone is soon to die of tuberculosis, they have her cough blood into a handkerchief. When they wish to signal that someone suffers from a terminal case of self-regard, they have him refer to himself in the third person. Which accounts for the sheepishness I feel when I tell you about my recent discovery: that referring to yourself in the third person is, well, kind of wonderful. Lately I’ve been walking around with an inner monologue that runs something like this: Ben is feeling tired; Ben is considering blowing off the gym; Ben is feeling regret about eating that entire baguette while walking home from the grocery store. And I’ve not only found my ego swelling from all this Ben-ing. I’ve also found it tamer than ever before, as manageable and mild as a baby panda. Much as it pains me to admit, I’ve come to believe that our egotist-in-chief may have stumbled onto something profound. Allow me to explain. At the core of Buddhism is the concept of non-self. The idea, basically, is that the thing you think of as you — the entity whose well-being occupies your every waking thought — is an illusion. This doesn’t mean that your body is a hologram — that Uniqlo-clad lump of meat is indisputably there. What non-self refers to, rather, is the thing that you think of as your true self — the little captain who lives somewhere behind your forehead and looks out through your eyes. The thing that says, “I hope people like me” or “I can’t stand another minute on this train” — that, Buddhists believe, is what needs to be seen through and rooted out. "
"VIENNA — The top diplomats from the United States and Russia sat yards from each other at a security conference here on Thursday in Vienna and lobbed broadsides that were sharply at odds with the tone of President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin’s meeting last month. “We will never accept Russia’s occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson vowed in his opening remarks at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Russia is “arming, leading, training and fighting alongside antigovernment forces” in Eastern Ukraine, Mr. Tillerson added. Moments earlier, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, gave such a rapid-fire list of grievances — complaining about the growing expansion of NATO and the West’s increasing limits on Russian-language journalists, for example — that his interpreter could barely keep up. “We’ve reached an absolute low point regarding confidence between the main players,” the secretary general of the security forum, Thomas Greminger, told reporters at the start of the conclave. The dueling remarks at the conference, with underpinnings of Cold War tensions, played out under the sparkling chandeliers of the Hofburg Palace as diplomats came in from a cold, gray Vienna day to ballrooms warmed by endless speeches. Whether Mr. Tillerson’s tough stance on Russia is in keeping with Mr. Trump’s often-stated wish to improve relations with Russia is unclear. But the secretary of state has maintained it since his confirmation hearings in January despite the Order of Friendship he received from Mr. Putin when Mr. Tillerson was Exxon Mobil’s chief executive.

This popular Italian tenor, who made headlines a year ago for backing out of a rumored performance at President Trump’s inaugural ceremony, is in town this week for a pair of less-fraught engagements at the Garden. At both shows, the Broadway and TV star Kristin Chenoweth will join Mr. Bocelli as a special guest.

In an era when it’s de rigueur for rappers to mix a bit of melodic stardust into their lyrics, the Chicago-area musician Kweku Collins has consistently found ways to distinguish himself from the crowd. On his 2016 album, “Nat Love,” and the more recent EP “Grey,” Mr. Collins raps and sings with subtlety and aplomb; these are releases that demand, and reward, attention.
877-987-6487, babysallright.com GABRIEL GARZÓN-MONTANO at Warsaw (Dec. 8, 9 p.m.). Fans of Frank Ocean will find much to love in the sinuous future-soul music of Gabriel Garzón-Montano’s critically acclaimed 2017 album, “Jardin.” And while his recorded work is full of psychedelic production flourishes, Mr. Garzón-Montano is equally adept at pure solo performance. At this hometown show, this New York auteur will close out his breakthrough year on a high note.

All proceeds, as always, will go to the True Colors Fund, Ms. Lauper’s charity for young, homeless L.G.B.T. people.
800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com LIL PUMP at PlayStation Theater (Dec. 12, 8 p.m.). A star of note in South Florida’s fractious, feverish SoundCloud rap scene, Lil Pump celebrated twin milestones this year, scoring a Top Five Billboard hit just months after his 17th birthday. On that song, the two-minute marvel “Gucci Gang,” he achieves an almost meditative state through repetition of the title phrase. This signature single is sure to feature in the set list when he headlines this Midtown venue on Tuesday.
212-930-1940, playstationtheater.com PERFUME GENIUS at the Bowery Ballroom (Dec. 10-11, 9 p.m.) and Music Hall of Williamsburg (Dec. 12-13, 9 p.m.) Many musicians spend their careers building up to an album like “No Shape,” the one that the singer-songwriter Perfume Genius (known offstage as Mike Hadreas) released in May. It’s a revelatory work, developing Mr. Hadreas’s experiences of love and loss into a virtuosic song cycle of himself — at turns bold (“Slip Away”), elegiac (“Wreath”) and sexy (“Die 4 U”), and quite often all three at once. The album’s intimate scale has translated well to large rooms this year, but these performances at a pair of smaller venues (the first two of which are sold out) are likely to be particularly powerful.
