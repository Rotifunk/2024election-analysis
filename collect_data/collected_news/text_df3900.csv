"WASHINGTON — The White House inflated the potential benefits to workers from a proposed corporate tax cut, according to a Harvard University economist whose work informed the estimate, highlighting a challenge Republicans face as they push a tax rewrite that President Trump has promised will benefit the middle class. Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers said in a report released on Monday that reducing corporate taxes could raise average household incomes by as much as $9,000 a year. The top end of that estimate was based on work by a trio of researchers, and on Tuesday one of them, Mihir Desai of Harvard, said Mr. Trump’s team had misread the research. The actual income gain implied by his study, he estimated, would be $800. Mr. Trump’s economic team disagreed — saying Mr. Desai had erred in interpreting his own paper. The distinction could prove critical in the public reception to the Republican plan, which bets heavily on the notion that the best way to raise pay for American workers is to cut taxes on their employers. The Republican proposal, which still lacks key details, thus far includes what analysts project will be only modest reductions in income taxes for many middle-class Americans. But it reduces the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a move that Mr. Trump and Republican leaders say will spark faster economic growth and higher profits. Their theory is that companies will pass those winnings on to workers by raising their pay. That claim has already run into opposition from many economists, particularly liberal-leaning ones. It could prove a difficult sell politically, at a time when corporate profits are near record highs and polling suggests Americans are skeptical that the Republican plan will help average workers. “They are facing a lot of headwinds” in selling the plan, because Americans will not see it as a boon to the middle class, said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the liberal opposition research group American Bridge, which is gearing up to oppose the Republican plan. “This plan is vulnerable, based on that landscape.” "
"WASHINGTON — Four days after his son died in Afghanistan, John F. Kelly, then a Marine Corps general, eulogized two Marines killed by a truck bomb in Iraq. He made only a fleeting, oblique reference to his son Second Lt. Robert Kelly as he paid tribute to the two other fallen service members who held their ground for six seconds as a truck bore down on them. Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s chief of staff, and the commander in chief is testing his aide’s long-held reluctance to discuss his loss. Mr. Trump, in defending his handling of the deaths of four Green Berets in Niger, falsely claimed on Monday that President Barack Obama did not contact the families of fallen troops. And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump brought to light that Mr. Obama never called Mr. Kelly after the death of his son. Such phone calls are not routine, especially when the rate of combat-related fatalities is high, as was the case in 2010, when Lieutenant Kelly was killed after stepping on a land mine while leading a platoon in Afghanistan. But Mr. Kelly is the highest-ranking American military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. Mr. Trump called the families of the soldiers killed in Niger, the White House said Tuesday, and the president has said that he would try to call as many families of American troops killed on his watch “when it’s appropriate.” “You could ask General Kelly, ‘Did he get a call from Obama?’” Mr. Trump said in an interview on Tuesday on Fox News Radio. “I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy. I can tell you my policy is I called every one of them.” A spokesman for Mr. Obama declined to comment. But Mr. Trump’s remarks have drawn angry rebukes from allies of the former president because his claims about Mr. Obama are false — he called or met with relatives of multiple fallen service members. Former military commanders, for their part, said Mr. Trump was politicizing one of the saddest and most sacred duties of the presidency. "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump took office in January, the Islamic State controlled about 23,300 square miles of territory across Iraq and Syria. Now, as an American-backed militia declared on Tuesday that it had liberated Raqqa, Syria, the capital of the extremists’ self-proclaimed caliphate, the Islamic State’s territory has dwindled to no more than 9,300 square miles. For months, Mr. Trump has demanded credit for a stepped-up military campaign that has weakened the Islamic State, claiming repeatedly that he has done “far more against ISIS in nine months” than President Barack Obama did during his entire administration. Yet experts said it was always anticipated that the three-year war against the Islamic State that was started by Mr. Obama in 2014 would reach this point, and military officials are quick to praise local troops and fighters for battleground victories. “Just by looking at the map, the losses this year are off the scale compared to previous years,” said Columb Strack, an analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, which has been tracking the territory that the Islamic State has surrendered. But, he added, “I haven’t seen any major differences in the U.S. approach against the Islamic State.” "
"Browse all our Text to Text lesson plans. What would you be willing to sacrifice in the name of science? For the six participants in a NASA-funded behavioral research study that simulates a trip to Mars, the hope is that the sacrifices they endure benefit the greater good. The eight-month project, named HI-SEAs (for Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation), places these scientists in isolation on Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii, a location chosen for its Mars-like conditions. There, strict restrictions cut them off from the rest of Earth’s comforts and connections. Through a continuing series of 360 videos, The Times is covering the research mission. Our Text to Text series pairs often-taught literary, historical, scientific and cultural pieces with articles from The New York Times. In this one we match an excerpt from Ray Bradbury’s 1954 short story, ""All Summer in a Day,” which explores the potential sacrifices required to live on Venus, with the “Life on Mars” series. _________ Traveling to another planet was once only imaginable in the realm of science fiction. Today, scientists are pursuing this as a real possibility, perhaps even by 2024. Will life on Mars be a reality for this generation, or the next? What might be gained from this exploration? What must be given up? Currently the HI-SEAS mission seeks answers to these questions — some of the same asked through Ray Bradbury’s short story in 1954. The Times 360 videos show that “home” for the HI-SEAS participants is a 1,200-square-foot structure called “the habitat.” Any time one of them wants to venture into the outdoors, they must first don a full-body spacesuit. Communication with outside colleagues, friends and family is restricted to email with a built-in 20-minute delay that mirrors the length of time it would take for transmissions to pass between Mars and Earth. How will the participants handle the extreme isolation of the simulation? Data gathered from the experiemtn will inform how astronauts will be selected for long-duration space travel in the future. Bradbury’s short story was written at a time when space exploration was gaining significant momentum, as the Cold War raged and the space race between the Soviet Union and the U.S. picked up speed. Just 15 years after “All Summer in a Day” was published, the 1969 Apollo 11 mission succeeded in sending the first humans to the moon. "
"A broad coalition of law enforcement officials and activists is expected to urge President Trump on Wednesday to adjust policies on policing and criminality, the first time such a group has spoken out against the Trump administration. Some of the nation’s most prominent prosecutors, police chiefs and criminal justice overhaul advocates — including Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, as well as representatives from the conservative Koch brothers network — will gather in Washington for the National Law Enforcement Summit. The former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. and Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general whom Mr. Trump abruptly fired in the first few days of his presidency, will speak. They and other presenters are expected to pose the challenge to Mr. Trump, who ran in 2016 as a “law and order” candidate but whose attorney general’s policies — as well as Mr. Trump’s own messaging — have come under increasing criticism from local law enforcement officials. In his inaugural address, he described a raging “American carnage” that he vowed to halt — a turn of phrase that rankled local officials who have prided themselves on crime reduction. Mr. Trump has frequently cited his support for police officers, and he has surrounded himself with local law enforcement officials at any opportunity. His attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has pursued an aggressive approach to crime in major cities. Without citing evidence, Mr. Sessions has claimed that changes imposed by the Obama administration that sought a reduction in mandatory minimum sentences for some drug prosecutions had led to a large increase in crime. Members of the coalition plan to urge Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions to reverse the current course the Department of Justice has taken. "
"Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. scores here. The N.F.L. for now will continue to let players kneel or sit during the national anthem without a penalty, capitulating to demands by the athletes for free expression but potentially further alienating fans who object to the protests and feel they are disrespectful to the flag and the military. But, after a meeting Tuesday with union representatives and players, the league did promise to help support some of the causes targeted by the protesting players, including reform of the criminal justice system. The decision was faulted by President Trump on Wednesday morning. Trump, who has on several occasions criticized players who do not stand for the anthem, said on Twitter: “The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!” The owners’ decision to not toughen the league’s stance on anthem demonstrations showed yet again the contortions they have been going through to display support for their players while wrestling with the political fallout of the sideline protests that have persisted since last season. The players, largely on social media, had made clear they would not abide penalties for sitting or kneeling during the pregame anthem, while legal experts wondered if any punitive change would hold up in court. The gestures began last season, spurred by Colin Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, to draw attention to racial oppression and police brutality against black Americans. "

"It is unclear what possessed Woody Allen, of all people, to comment on the accusations of sexual predation against Harvey Weinstein, when he could have just not said anything, not expressed sympathy for an alleged serial rapist, not accused long-silenced women who said they were sexually assaulted of contributing to “a witch hunt atmosphere” and not felt compelled to issue a pouty follow-up statement in which he didn’t apologize but, in fact, reiterated how “sad” he feels for Weinstein because Weinstein is “sick.” I’m kidding! It’s totally clear why Allen would issue such a statement — why he wouldn’t hesitate to include the astonishing confession that “no one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” implying that people did tell him about Weinstein but he, with that odd omniscience native to the very rich, deemed them insufficiently serious. It’s also totally clear why Allen felt untouchable enough to add that even if he had believed the “horror stories,” he wouldn’t have been interested, let alone concerned, because he is a serious man busy making serious man-art. He said people wouldn’t bother coming to him anyway, because, as he described it: “You’re not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie.” (That last bit is fair, actually. If I’d been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, literally my last instinct would be to go to Woody Allen for help.) It’s clear because the cultural malfunction that allows Allen to feel comfortable issuing that statement is the same malfunction that gave us Allen and Weinstein in the first place: the smothering, delusional, galactic entitlement of powerful men. When Allen and other men warn of “a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere” what they mean is an atmosphere in which they’re expected to comport themselves with the care, consideration and fear of consequences that the rest of us call basic professionalism and respect for shared humanity. On some level, to some men — and you can call me a hysteric but I am done mincing words on this — there is no injustice quite so unnaturally, viscerally grotesque as a white man being fired. Donald Trump, our predator in chief, seems to view the election of Barack Obama as a white man being fired. He and his supporters are willing to burn the world in revenge. This whole catastrophic cultural moment was born of that same entitlement, of Trump’s paws and Weinstein’s unbelted bathrobe, of the ancient cycles of abuse that ghostwrote the Trump campaign’s real slogan: If I can’t have you, no one will. "
"President Trump has made a habit of filling important jobs with people dedicated to undermining the laws they’re supposed to administer while pampering the industries they’re supposed to regulate. His nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency’s top clean air post, William Wehrum, is a retread from the George W. Bush administration with a deep doctrinal dislike of clean air regulations. His choice to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality is borderline comical: Kathleen Hartnett White, a former Texas official who believes that the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is harmless. Yet no nomination has been as brazen, as dangerous to public health and as deserving of Senate rejection as that of Michael Dourson to run the E.P.A. office in charge of reviewing chemicals used in agriculture, industry and household products. Mr. Dourson is a scientist for hire. A toxicologist and a professor at the University of Cincinnati, he has a long history of consulting for chemical companies and conducting studies paid for with industry money. He frequently decided that the compounds he was evaluating were safe at exposure levels that are far more dangerous to public health than levels recommended by the E.P.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. His nomination is enthusiastically endorsed by the chemical industry. It horrifies environmental groups, public health advocates, firefighters and scientists and has inspired many letters in opposition to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which may vote as early as Wednesday. Among the chemicals that received a favorable nod from Mr. Dourson is 1,4-dioxane, which is used by paint and coating manufacturers and is also found in shampoos and other personal care products. His analysis recommended a safe level that was 1,000 times higher than the E.P.A.’s recommended level; the agency considers the chemical “a likely carcinogen.” Another is PFOA, a chemical used by DuPont to make nonstick surfaces. The compound has been linked to cancers, thyroid diseases and other health problems. Working for West Virginia on the recommendation of DuPont, Mr. Dourson in 2002 helped establish a safety threshold of 150 parts per billion for PFOA in drinking water. That is substantially higher than the standard of 1 part per billion that DuPont’s own scientists had recommended more than a decade earlier, and higher still than the health advisory level of 0.07 parts per billion set by the E.P.A. last year. More broadly troubling is that Mr. Dourson, if approved, will set back an arduous, yearslong effort to improve the regulation of chemicals. Last year, after many false starts, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that updated the Toxic Substances Control Act, a 1976 law that had made it very hard for regulators to ban or regulate chemicals by requiring the E.P.A. to meet a very high burden of proof before taking action. The law also made it easy for companies to keep data about their products hidden from the public by claiming the information was a “trade secret.” The new law simplified the task by streamlining it, directing the E.P.A. to review at least 20 substances at a time, giving priority to the riskiest chemicals. The money to do this work will come from up to $25 million in annual fees paid by chemical manufacturers and processors. "
"The leader of United Nations’ peacekeeping operations offered a dire appraisal of South Sudan on Tuesday, saying the world’s youngest nation is sliding further into mayhem with no sign that its antagonists want peace. In a report to the United Nations Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the under secretary general of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, called upon the leaders of South Sudan’s warring factions to “bring the country back from the impending abyss.” Mr. Lacroix said that a diplomatic effort by eight African nations to revitalize a 2015 peace agreement in South Sudan had received only a “lukewarm response” from the government of President Salva Kiir, and that Mr. Kiir’s political adversaries also remained cautious about it. Despite the presence of 17,000 United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan, Mr. Lacroix said that security had deteriorated and that armed clashes, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and other rights abuses had increased in much of the country. His report came a week before the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, is scheduled to visit South Sudan to press for a solution to the four-year-old civil war, which has left tens of thousands dead and has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. More than two million people have fled South Sudan and nearly two million have been displaced, totaling a third of the country’s population. United Nations relief officials have said extreme hunger threatens half the country. At least 200,000 South Sudanese are sheltering at United Nations peacekeeping bases. Ms. Haley, who will be the highest-ranking Trump administration official to travel to Africa, said last month that the eight-nation African diplomatic effort, known as the High Level Revitalization Forum, was “the last chance at salvaging the peace agreement in South Sudan.” She also pledged to the South Sudanese people in a Twitter posting that “we look forward to delivering the message in person very soon that we have not given up on them and have not forgotten them.” The United States is a leading aid provider to South Sudan and was a strong supporter of its independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011. Optimism about South Sudan’s prospects faded within a few years when an ethnic civil war erupted between forces loyal to President Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, and his former vice president, Riek Machar, a Nuer. Mr. Machar now lives in exile in South Africa. "
"Many of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party, led by Bernie Sanders, are advocating wealth redistribution through higher taxes and Medicare for all, and demonizing banks and Wall Street. Memories in politics are short, but those policies are vastly different from the program of the party’s traditional center-left coalition. Under Bill Clinton, that coalition balanced the budget, acknowledged the limits of government and protected the essential programs that make up the social safety net. President Clinton did this, in part, by moving the party away from a reflexive anti-Wall Street posture. It’s not popular to say so today, but there are still compelling reasons Democrats should strengthen ties to Wall Street. As the party has left behind that version of liberalism, it has also found its way to its weakest electoral position — nationally and at the state level — since the 1920s. Hillary Clinton’s lurch to the left probably cost her key Midwestern states that Barack Obama had won twice and led to the election of Donald Trump. After the 2016 election, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, warned that the party’s “broad anti-business rhetoric” distracts its leaders from making growth the goal and “manages to scare off entrepreneurs and small businesses, too.” Democrats should keep ties with Wall Street for several reasons. The first is an ugly fact of politics: money. Maintaining ties to Wall Street makes economic sense for Democrats and keeps their coffers full. "
"Toward the end of the Obama administration, the Justice Department called on judges to end the cash-register system of justice that had taken root across the country. In what is a clearly unconstitutional practice, people in localities nationwide were being sent to jail solely because they were too poor to pay the fines and fees that municipalities increasingly rely on for revenue. Some states heeded the advice, and progress was made. Now, a report from the United States Commission on Civil Rights shows what the Trump Justice Department needs to do to keep the momentum up for reform. The Obama administration brought this issue out into the open in 2015 during its investigation of policing in the racially troubled city of Ferguson, Mo., which exploded in violence in 2014 after a police officer shot and killed a black teenager named Michael Brown. Investigators found that the city’s policing tactics were both discriminatory and driven by a city budget that relied heavily on fines and fees associated with minor violations. In a quest for revenue, Ferguson officers trapped poor and minority citizens in a Kafka-esque cycle that began with fines they could not pay and led to crippling financial penalties, revoked driver’s licenses, jail time, lost jobs and ruined lives. The investigation showed that municipalities had essentially recreated debtor prisons, violating the Constitution by punishing people for being poor. Last year, the Justice Department followed up its Ferguson report with a letter asking court systems nationwide to be vigilant against similar policies. It explained that the courts had an obligation to ask people about their ability to pay before jailing them for nonpayment and were also bound to consider alternatives like community service or extended payment plans. The department also awarded grants to state courts in five states to help develop new approaches to fine and fee enforcement. According to the Civil Rights Commission report, Texas will use some of its grant for an automated system that judges can use to determine inability to pay. Beyond that, a national task force financed by the Justice Department created a blueprint for state reforms, with model laws and ideas about how to prevent local governments and traffic courts from lapsing into unconstitutional practices. Some judges have been outspoken about unfair use of fines. Last year, for example, the chief justice of Arizona issued an administrative order authorizing judges to mitigate mandatory fines and fees if the amount imposed an economic hardship and advised a state task force to take other steps. The chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court went further this year, admonishing politicians for treating the courts like “A.T.M.s,” and pointing out, “No one in America should be sent to jail — or threatened with jail — solely because they are poor.” Unfortunately, most states have done little or nothing to reform justice systems that clearly violate the Constitution. Judges need to keep pressing this point — and the Justice Department has an obligation to help them. "
"Well, it took almost a year, but we now have the “Trump Doctrine.” It’s very simple. And, as you’d expect, it fits neatly into a tweet. On nearly every major issue, President Trump’s position is: “Obama built it. I broke it. You fix it.” And that cuts right to the core of what is the most frightening thing about the Trump presidency. It’s not the president’s juvenile tweeting or all the aides who’ve been pushed out of his clown car at high speed or his industrial-strength lying. It’s Trump’s willingness to unravel so many longstanding policies and institutions at once — from Nafta to Obamacare to the global climate accord to the domestic clean power initiative to the Pacific trade deal to the Iran nuclear deal — without any real preparation either on the day before or for the morning after. Indeed, Trump has made most of his climate, health, energy and economic decisions without consulting any scientists, without inviting into the White House a broad range of experts, without putting forth his own clear-cut alternatives to the systems he’s unraveling, without having at the ready a team of aides or a political coalition able to implement any alternatives and without a strategic framework that connects all of his dots. In short, we’re simply supposed to take the president’s word that this or that deal “is the worst deal ever” — backed up by no serious argument or plan about how he will produce a better one. I’m open to improving any of these accords or institutions. I’m even open to the possibility that by just tipping over all these accords at once, and throwing away his steering wheel, Trump will get people to improve the Iran deal or Obamacare out of sheer panic at the chaos that might ensue if they don’t.

"Richard B. Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, is scheduled to speak at the University of Florida on Thursday, prompting an outcry over whether his views are protected speech, dividing the campus and putting law enforcement officials on high alert. The university denied Mr. Spencer’s original request to speak on Sept. 12, citing the violent clashes in August between far-right demonstrators and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., as well as threats on social media of a “blood bath” if the speech were allowed. But the university has since relented. On Monday, reacting to Mr. Spencer’s coming appearance, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in Alachua County in North Florida, where the university is. The order helps coordinate law enforcement from various jurisdictions. The governor also activated the National Guard, so it can be called if necessary. The University of Florida president, Kent Fuchs, posted a YouTube message denouncing Mr. Spencer’s “message of hate and racism,” and urging students to stay away from his event and deprive Mr. Spencer of the attention he seeks. Far-right rallies and the counterprotests they engender on the left have become a vexing problem for universities, especially public ones, which are struggling to balance their mission of promoting free speech and the exchange of ideas with their responsibility to keep students safe.

"WASHINGTON — Until Tuesday, the North American Free Trade Agreement looked like it might be headed for a quick demise. Now, it could be headed for a slow, painful one. The United States, Canada and Mexico said on Tuesday that they would extend Nafta negotiations into next year, with the parties citing “significant conceptual gaps” in how to rewrite the 1994 trade pact. Negotiators, struggling to find agreement on some of the thorniest provisions of the trade deal, will take an extended break to consult with politicians and interest groups before convening again in Mexico City for the fifth round of talks in mid-November. The trade talks, which were supposed to wrap up by year-end, have now been extended into the first quarter of 2018, the parties said. The extension signals the potential demise of a trade pact that, while critical to North American commerce, has come under withering criticism from the Trump administration as a bad deal for American workers. The three countries, which will meet again on Nov. 17, have been unable to reach agreement on a range of issues, including what percentage of a product should be made in the United States and whether the trade pact should expire every five years. Finding agreement on the outstanding provisions will get even trickier in the coming months, as negotiations collide with political events in all three countries that will only harden each nation’s stance. The Mexican presidential race will begin in earnest leading up to a July 1 election, raising the risk that President Trump’s proposals for revising Nafta will become a sensitive topic that Mexican candidates will shy away from supporting.

"Changes loom near remote Dinosaur National Monument in Utah. It’s a rough region of 1,000-foot cliffs and canyons, two wild rivers — the Green and the Yampa — ancient rock art and archaeological evidence of 10,000 years of human history. The park, which straddles the Utah-Colorado border, affords visitors backcountry camping, white-water rafting and, most famously, spectacular dinosaur fossils. The Bureau of Land Management has announced that in December it will auction gas and oil drilling rights on 94,000 acres, or 146 square miles, of land, some of it near the park’s entrance road. Pumpjacks, drill rigs and other equipment would be visible from the park’s visitor center, which is 2.5 miles from one lease parcel, according to critics. The B.L.M. has said that equipment would not intrude on the average visitor’s field of view. The agency said it would take steps to minimize visibility, including light shields, noise mufflers and “placement of exhaust systems to direct noise away from noise sensitive areas” and “avoiding unnecessary flaring of gas.” Ozone pollution from such energy development already exceeds federal Clean Air Act limits in the monument area. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican who supports fossil fuel development on public lands, initially said he worried that the new leases would bring eyesores too close to the park. “The state wishes to ensure leasing of these parcels does not impact visual resources or cause light or sound disturbances,” he said in comments submitted to the B.L.M. in July. The monument’s National Park Service administrators have also expressed concern about dust, night lights, air and water pollution and threats to endangered species. The 330-square-mile, high-desert park is visited by about 300,000 people a year. It was designated a national monument by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915, using powers granted him under the Antiquities Act of 1906. "
"WASHINGTON — One after another, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to provide information. And again and again in nearly five hours of testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions refused. The lawmakers asked for more details about his conversations with President Trump before he fired James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff in Arizona. They wanted to know what the two had discussed about Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible links to Mr. Trump. The senators also asked about topics not involving the president, like whether Mr. Sessions had conversations with the attorney general of Texas about an immigration program the state had threatened to sue over, and whether any evidence supported Mr. Trump’s claim that the Cuban government was behind sonic attacks on American diplomats. “I’m just not able to comment,” Mr. Sessions said. Mr. Sessions’s demurrals — and Democratic anger over them — were a recurring theme during his first appearance before the panel for an oversight hearing in the eight months since he became the nation’s top law enforcement officer. The attorney general had testified in June before the Senate Intelligence Committee and refused then as well to answer questions about his conversations with Mr. Trump, saying they were potentially subject to an assertion of executive privilege by the president. The privilege provides a legal basis to avoid answering questions. Bracing for more of the same, Democrats had sent Mr. Sessions a letter last week arguing that he would not have a legal basis to continue to refuse to answer unless Mr. Trump invoked the privilege. They demanded that Mr. Trump do so, or that Mr. Sessions be prepared to answer. But from his opening statement, Mr. Sessions made clear that he would frustrate their ambitions. "
"Down the street from my home in Bangkok, next to a tailor and a nail salon, sits a peculiar outpost of the North Korean state. Inside the Pyongyang Okryu restaurant, five tall, pale waitresses float among the tables in sparkly dresses and carefully cultivated smiles. “Are they really North Korean?” my wide-eyed young son asked, a bit too loudly, on a recent visit. He’d been reading about the country’s isolation and the fusillade of insults and threats exchanged by President Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader. A waitress overheard him and nodded, but her blank smile — a rictus of nonrevelation — never wavered. This is one of the smallest, but in some ways most visible, tentacles of a secretive global-trade network that sustains the North Korean regime and its hereditary dynasty. Despite the tightening of international sanctions meant to brake the country’s development of nuclear weapons, North Korea generates about a billion dollars in invisible income every year by selling everything from arms and coal to seafood and textiles — and the labor of exported workers. For a regime denied access to international financial institutions, the foreign cash is crucial to offset deficits, buy loyalty and luxury items and acquire components for Kim’s nuclear arsenal. “North Korea needs hard currency for nearly everything,” says Go Myong-hyun, a researcher with the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “And the only way to get it is through foreign trade.” In Bangkok, kitsch is on the menu as well as kimchi: On an earlier visit, the hostesses — indentured servants chosen from the most loyal of Pyongyang families — urged me to spend nearly $10,000 on a gaudy tapestry depicting Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea. (I declined.) Tonight, as we ate beef belly barbecue and spicy cold Pyongyang noodles, the waitresses disappeared at one point to get ready for the nightly musical show. It was sobering to know that the profits that night and up to 90 percent of the workers’ salaries would be sent home as “loyalty payments” to Kim Jong-un himself. The West can’t seem to shake the image of North Korea as the Hermit Kingdom. Diplomatically and culturally, the place is indeed isolated, and its state ideology of juche, or self-reliance, reinforces the feeling that North Korea is going it alone. But the country is not cut off economically, at least not yet. Over the past decade, as the Kims père and fils pursued their nuclear program, North Korea’s external trade boomed, more than doubling in volume. Economists believe that the country’s trade dependency has risen to higher than 50 percent, just shy of the global average. Nor is North Korea as ossified as outsiders might imagine. Kim still wields the instruments of totalitarian power, but he has relaxed the state’s grip on the economy, allowing officials and ordinary citizens greater autonomy to make money and engage in trade, so long as a chunk of the profits flows to Kim’s inner circle. As a result, the North Korean economy grew 3.9 percent last year. Food prices have stabilized. Mobile phones have proliferated. And construction cranes now dot Pyongyang’s rising skyline. “North Korea is no longer a communist country,” says Justin Hastings, the author of the book “A Most Enterprising Country.” “Every state entity has been deputized to make money.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: “In my view, this agreement avoids chaos, and I don’t know a Democrat or a Republican who benefits from chaos.” That’s Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican, summing up a deal he reached with Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, to try to stabilize health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. President Trump indicated support for the plan, which would fund subsidies to insurers for two years. Separately, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is testifying at 10 a.m. Eastern today before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Here’s what to expect from the hearing, which we’ll cover live. And the president’s third attempt to block travelers from several countries — most of them predominantly Muslim — was blocked on Tuesday just hours before it was to take effect. “We have hot soup, we have bread: Come out and surrender,” one of the fighters said on a loudspeaker. “The ISIS members and their families who surrendered to us are safe.” "
"Thirteen years ago, in the midst of a different Republican administration, the liberal book of the moment was Thomas Frank’s “What’s the Matter With Kansas?” In answering his title’s question, Frank argued that hardworking heartland Americans were being duped by a Republican Party that whipped up culture-war frenzy to disguise its plutocratic aims. Middle-class and working-class Republican voters, he insisted, were voting against their own economic self-interest and getting worse than nothing in return. At the time, Frank’s analysis had two flaws. First, it minimized the importance of social issues, both their inherent moral stakes and their role in shaping the ecology of everyday life, of work and family and community. You don’t have to be a dupe to be a “values voter” of one sort or another: Whether you live in Topeka or Manhattan, you just have to believe that some moral questions are more important than where to set the top tax rate. Second, Frank minimized the extent to which Republicans, in the Bush era and before, did make a concerted effort to deliver for the middle class. The modern G.O.P. was certainly solicitous of the interests of wealthy donors and corporations and always eager for an upper-bracket tax cut. But as Henry Olsen points out in his recent book “The Working Class Republican,” Ronald Reagan also accepted the New Deal settlement and sought to balance his donor base’s interests with his voters’ pocketbook concerns — and George W. Bush did likewise. Yes, the Republican in the White House while Frank was writing his jeremiad was the president of dividend tax cuts and a lower top rate. But Bush was also the president of Medicare Part D, No Child Left Behind, a big homeownership push and a larger child tax credit and lower rates for almost everyone, not just the upper class. So Frank was wrong … or maybe he was prescient. Because he was writing just before Bush won re-election to a second term without a clear middle-class agenda, which led to the unpopular pushes for Social Security reform and an immigration amnesty and to the collapse of Bush’s political position. Then after Obama’s election the G.O.P. lurched away from the middle class in a more stark way than it ever did under Reagan or Bush or the Newt Gingrich speakership, embracing theories about how the working class was actually undertaxed, rallying around tax plans that seemed to threaten middle-class tax increases and promoting an Ayn Randian vision in which heroic entrepreneurs were the only economic actor worth defending. The success of Donald Trump’s populist candidacy seemed like a partial repudiation of this Randian turn, and a possible return to the middle-class-focused politics that had made Reagan and Bush successful — albeit in a more aggressively nationalist and mercantilist form. But as president, Trump has essentially become the Frankian caricature in full, draping the rhetoric of populism over an agenda that so far offers little or nothing to the middle class, making appeals to the religious right that are notable in their cynicism, and rallying his base through culture-war controversies distinguished mostly by their ginned-up phoniness.

"The defendant was elsewhere, stirring and twittering in his new city, his name rarely spoken — just the title sufficed — but always top of mind inside an overstuffed Manhattan courtroom. “The president” is a businessman, the plaintiffs’ lawyer reminded the judge. “The president” refuses to leave the marketplace. This is hardly a fair fight, the logic goes, for those who are not “the president.” “I want to address the government’s view,” said the lawyer, Deepak Gupta, “that the president is above the law.” Such was the civic exercise on Wednesday — part liberal catharsis theater, part constitutional drama of the highest order — aimed at answering a simple question: Is a sitting president, disinclined to relinquish his gilded empire, violating the Constitution by continuing to own and profit from his businesses? The proceedings were the most prominent turn yet in a nearly yearlong legal effort to shine a light on President Trump’s business ties and press him to divest. At issue is a lawsuit filed this year in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a legal watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. The group argues that Mr. Trump is violating a constitutional provision that a president may not accept any economic benefit from foreign governments or the United States government beyond a salary. Other plaintiffs in the case include a group representing restaurants, the owner of a hotel business in New York and a woman who books hotel events in Washington. The hearing concerned the government’s effort to have the case dismissed. "
"DUMFRIES, Va. — President Barack Obama will hit the campaign trail on Thursday to rally black voters behind candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey amid stern warnings that African Americans may not come out in force on an Election Day that is just three weeks away. Mr. Obama’s appearances on behalf of Virginia’s lieutenant governor, Ralph S. Northam, in Richmond and the financier Philip D. Murphy in Newark — two white candidates in predominantly black cities — come as Democrats struggle to inspire African-Americans to vote this year. While Mr. Murphy appears comfortably in the lead in New Jersey, the race in Virginia is close. And in Alabama, where voters go to the polls on Dec. 12, Doug Jones, a former prosecutor, is running a surprisingly competitive race for the Senate against the firebrand social conservative Roy S. Moore. “There is not one person in Birmingham who disagrees we need Doug Jones,” said Randall Woodfin, the newly elected mayor of Alabama’s largest city, which is predominantly black. “The issue is motivating them to come out and vote for him.” The party’s dilemma echoes a challenge that Democrats have faced in elections since Mr. Obama’s rise to the presidency: how to persuade some of the most loyal voters to show up for elections when the Democrat they most love is not a candidate. In 2017, antipathy for President Trump could be a new motivation, but Mr. Trump is not on the ballot either. Phillip E. Thompson, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. in Virginia’s Loudoun County, said he was worried that black voters were simply not engaged. "
"It’s been a little over two years since you removed a Confederate flag from the flagpole on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse. Are you surprised that we’re still having a debate over monuments to the Confederacy? Is it possible to not be surprised in retrospect? There was a point when it was shocking — maybe a year and a half ago, as I saw the ascendance of Donald Trump. But looking back, it makes sense to me that, given the history of America, there would be this backlash that accompanies the election of the first black president. When you took the flag down, you said: “I come against you in the name of God. This flag comes down today.” I was struck by your statement because it seems as if the right has tried to monopolize the language of faith, particularly Christianity, in the public square. Coming on the heels of the massacre at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, having that flag fly was just such an act of evil, and to me, there are certain moments when it’s not even a question of politics. It’s about a moral compass. I’m offended by the notion that Christianity can align only with the conservative movement. As a Christian, I don’t agree. I don’t think that taking health care from children aligns with my Christian values. I don’t think that a tax policy that basically gives more to the rich while placing greater tax burdens on the poor aligns with my Christian beliefs. Politically, we’re seeing all the ways it becomes problematic when one party proclaims itself a theocracy. A huge number of evangelicals voted for Trump. Do you think that a vote for him is a vote against their faith? I don’t know. We know that there are times when the teachings of Jesus lose out to racism. Look at how segregated the churches are. I can’t judge what is in people’s hearts, but I’m not surprised that white evangelicals might side with Donald Trump, even if a lot of things that he does could arguably not line up with Christian values, while at the same time he accuses Obama of being a Muslim. I think there has to be a way to acknowledge both the positive and negative aspects of Christianity, or else there’s no real reconciliation with the history there, right? "
"Few landscapes remain virtually untrammeled by the growing impact of the planet’s seven and a half billion inhabitants — places where the natural environment is so overwhelmingly intact and truly wild that coming across so much as a boot print is a surprise. It seems unlikely in this day and age, but such areas do still exist. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one such place. Lies and misrepresentations have characterized this Arctic region as a “barren wasteland.” In fact, this is a landscape of surprising beauty and biological diversity: 31,000 square miles of the craggy Brooks Range, valleys of spruce forest and flower-filled tundra extending north to the Arctic Ocean. In this terrain and the adjacent Arctic Ocean, you’ll find roughly 700 kinds of plants and a multitude of different species: 200 bird, 47 mammal and 42 fish species. It’s a place of living grandeur. Those of us who have explored the Arctic refuge treasure seeing grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep and thundering herds of caribou. With awe we have watched golden eagles and flocks of migrating birds from across the globe, many of which nest there in the summer after a winter spent in such faraway places as the Amazon, the coastal wetlands of Patagonia or the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bangladesh. Yet this stunning landscape is now in the cross hairs of the United States Congress. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to allow oil drilling in the refuge in order to generate revenue to offset the cost of tax reform. This expedited process allows Republicans in the Senate, where they hold a narrow edge, to pass a reconciliation bill with a simple majority, bypassing a filibuster from the Democrats. This is not the way we should consider a measure that threatens irreversible damage to our wilderness heritage. The refuge was originally suggested for protection in the early 1950s, when Alaska was not yet a state. To investigate its conservation value, Olaus Murie, the president of the Wilderness Society, and his wife, Mardy, who both had spent years in Alaska, suggested a biological survey to Fairfield Osborn, president of the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society). The Sheenjek River Valley and surrounding areas on the southern slopes of the Brooks Range were selected as the focus of the expedition. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump’s attempt to show camaraderie with Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, might have backfired on Monday: He spent most of a 45-minute news conference in long-winded exchanges with reporters, while Mr. McConnell looked on awkwardly. On “The Daily Show,” broadcasting this week from Chicago, Trevor Noah said he was surprised Republicans hadn’t begun to prevent Mr. Trump from public speaking altogether. David Letterman, who will receive a Mark Twain Prize on Sunday, sat down with Jimmy Kimmel to talk about — what else — hosting late-night TV. They took a few good-natured shots at other hosts: Mr. Letterman talked through his decision to send Conan O’Brien a horse as a gag gift, which he regrets, and he hinted at who his least-favorite late-night host is. On the weekly “Jim Jefferies Show,” the host took aim at Harvey Weinstein. He ridiculed Fox News for pushing a narrative that tied Hillary Clinton to Mr. Weinstein’s acts of alleged sexual harassment. "
"Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders face off on taxes. And Abbi’s mom appears on “Broad City.” BROAD CITY Comedy Central at 10:30 p.m. When a mom shows up on a sitcom, it’s usually bad news for the child and great news for the audience. From Elaine Stritch as Colleen Donaghy (“30 Rock”) to Shelley Long as DeDe Pritchett (“Modern Family”), mom roles have given great older actresses a chance to dole out some tough love and questionable advice and make humiliating life decisions that perhaps strike a little too close to home. One of the two “Broad City” moms has already appeared: Susie Essman as Ilana’s brash mother. Now it’s Abbi’s turn, and her mom is played by sitcom royalty: Peri Gilpin (Roz from “Frasier”). CMT ARTISTS OF THE YEAR 8 p.m. on CMT. Country music has expanded and mutated in surprising ways in the last decade: It has leaned jauntily into hip-hop, opened the door for rebellious female songwriters, and swerved back into masculine Strait-and-narrow balladry. But while a new era of “nice guys” rises up the charts, as the critic Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted last month, the genre’s mainstream center is still held by charming rogues like the ones being celebrated at this performance in Nashville: Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban. Because of the deadly attack at Mr. Aldean’s festival appearance in Las Vegas this month, the program’s award presentations will be shelved in favor of additional performances. “It doesn’t feel right to be patting ourselves on the back that night like we would normally do,” Margaret Comeaux, the show’s executive producer, said in an interview. DEBATE NIGHT WITH TED CRUZ AND BERNIE SANDERS 9 p.m. on CNN. The former presidential candidates couldn’t be more different in their political stances, oratorical approaches or hometowns. But they are both forcefully persuasive and more than willing to wade into substantive policy discussions, as seen in their health care debate in February. On Wednesday they will face off on another contentious issue coming before Congress: President Trump’s tax reform plan. Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump’s plan “encouraging”; Mr. Sanders called it “morally repugnant and bad economic policy.” Sparks and grimaces will fly. (You can also catch Mr. Sanders on Wednesday’s “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” at 11:30 p.m. on CBS.) THE SCORE (2001) 10 p.m. on FLIX.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Cheering and celebratory gunfire erupted in the streets of the Syrian city of Raqqa after a U.S.-backed militia composed of Kurdish and Arab fighters said they had seized the Islamic State’s de facto capital. Here’s what our photographer saw when he entered the city with Kurdish fighters. Analysts say the militant group is preparing for a new phase: morphing back into the kind of underground insurgency it was at the start. Trying to defeat its ideology will probably vex President Trump as it did his predecessors. In Iraq, Kurdish independence aspirations appeared to stall — at least for now — as government forces seized oil facilities near Kirkuk that supply most of Iraqi Kurdistan’s revenue. _____ "
"All year, President Trump had threatened to release a metaphorical bomb into the Obamacare markets — canceling a certain type of payment to health insurers. Everyone was convinced it would destroy the marketplace. Late last Thursday, he carried out his threat, later saying that “the gravy train ended the day I knocked out the insurance companies’ money.” Congress is responding. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, the chairman and ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, announced on Tuesday that they had reached a deal on legislation that would undo the president’s order and bring back the subsidies. But now it looks as if Obamacare markets won’t face wholesale devastation, regardless of whether that legislation passes. In 2018, at least, insurers may be made whole and consumers protected — even without the subsidies. How could that be? The details are complicated, but the crux is that insurers and state regulators worked together to find a way to funnel more federal money into the Obamacare insurance markets. The insurer-regulator hack will mean that navigating the Obamacare marketplace will be more complicated for consumers (more on that later). And the change will cost taxpayers more money — perhaps $21 billion more in 2018 alone. But, in the end, most customers will be unharmed by the president’s decision, and a substantial fraction will be better off, able to buy plans for about the same price they pay now, yet with lower deductibles.

"RED FAMINE
Stalin’s War on Ukraine
By Anne Applebaum
461 pp. Doubleday. $35. The Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum has long lived in and written about Eastern Europe and is best known for her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Gulag: A History.” But my favorite of her books is the quirky and original 1994 “Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe,” in which she travels from the Baltic to the Black Sea, entirely through regions and cities that had found themselves situated, over the course of the 20th century, in several different countries. Today’s Lviv, for example, in western Ukraine, was previously Lvov in the Soviet Union, and before that Lwow in interwar Poland, and prior to 1914 was Lemberg in Austria-Hungary. And that’s not even counting its occupation by czarist Russia in World War I, Nazi Germany in World War II and a short-lived Ukrainian nationalist group in 1918. Most of the people she spoke to on that journey shared a sense of ethnic identity under threat by a nation in which they were now absorbed, or had been oppressed by in the past. They felt themselves to be unfairly Lithuanianized Poles, or Belarusified Lithuanians or Ruthenians denied a country when everyone else seemed to be getting their own. The book was prescient, for it is exactly that sense of aggrieved, wounded ethnic or national pride that has been cultivated so skillfully by politicians who have emerged in recent years, from Viktor Orban in Budapest to Vladimir Putin in Moscow to Donald Trump in Washington. The specter of clashing nationalisms also runs through Applebaum’s new book, “Red Famine: Stalin’s War on Ukraine,” a richly detailed history of the great famine, peaking in 1933, which killed an estimated five million or more Soviets, more than 3.9 million of them Ukrainian. Stalin, beginning several years earlier, had ruthlessly forced millions of independent small farmers into the new collective farms that he was certain would increase production and feed Soviet cities. The farmers understandably resisted giving up their land, often slaughtered and ate the animals they were ordered to bring with them, and had little incentive to work once they were taken, sometimes at gunpoint, to the collectives. This is certainly part of the story, but Applebaum puts more emphasis on something that has great relevance for today: Russia’s prolonged fear of losing a territory it had long treated as a lucrative colony. Even Alexander II, the reformer czar who freed the serfs, outlawed Ukrainian books and magazines and forbade the use of the language in theaters and opera. Schoolchildren generally had to be educated in Russian even when, despite the many ethnic Russians in Ukrainian cities, in the countryside most people spoke Ukrainian. In the chaos of dissolving empires toward the end of World War I, Ukraine declared itself independent, but its famously fertile black earth and Black Sea ports were tempting prizes for rival independence movements, for both White Russians and Bolsheviks, and for the territory’s neighbors. After several extremely bloody years of fighting (Kiev changed hands more than a dozen times in 1919), Ukraine was divided between two newborn states: Poland and — taking the lion’s share — the Soviet Union.

"WASHINGTON — On the eve of his first trip to South Asia as secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson made an impassioned plea on Wednesday for closer ties with India while casting China as a threat to the world order and saying Pakistan needed to do more to fight terrorism. The pro-India tone of his speech, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, was clear when Mr. Tillerson began by wishing everyone a “Happy Diwali,” a reference to the fall Hindu festival of lights that is often marked by fireworks displays. But he asked the audience to refrain from lighting any. “I don’t need any fireworks,” he said to audible chuckles. “I’m getting too many fireworks around me already.” Rumors about whether Mr. Tillerson has been considering leaving the Trump administration have surrounded him for months. His relationship with President Trump is thought to be rocky, with Mr. Trump posting messages on Twitter that undercut Mr. Tillerson’s diplomatic efforts and Mr. Tillerson openly disagreeing with the president on important policy matters. But top American officials have been calling for closer ties with India for most of India’s seven decades as an independent nation, and little was new about Mr. Tillerson’s calls for improved military and economic relations between the two. “The Trump administration is determined to dramatically deepen ways for the United States and India to further this partnership,” he said.

"BEIJING — As Xi Jinping’s first five-year term as China’s leader ends, he gave himself a shining report card on Wednesday — and a big to-do list for his next five years. Speaking at the start of a Communist Party congress in Beijing, Mr. Xi gave a work report that summed up his achievements so far, while also laying out where he wants to take China in his second term, which starts after this congress. Sitting on a podium before 2,300 delegates, he spoke for 205 minutes, long enough that his predecessor, Hu Jintao, pointed at his watch when Mr. Xi finally finished. Mr. Xi did not mention Donald Trump or North Korea or other specific policy headaches. Party congresses are held every five years, and always start with China’s leader giving a work report that is a broad outline of policy, not a detailed blueprint. Even so, Mr. Xi’s priorities shone through. This is a leader who believes China is on the cusp of greatness, but who worries about domestic security threats and maintaining ideological control. Here are some key takeaways from Mr. Xi’s report: Mr. Xi said he would put China on a sounder economic footing by containing financial risks, encouraging innovation and increasing consumer spending. But he also refrained from calling for the liberalizing overhauls that earlier leaders like Deng Xiaoping used to bring China roaring growth in the 1980s and ’90s. Since then, the Chinese leadership’s enthusiasm for allowing market forces to pick winners and losers has wilted as social inequalities have grown, and Mr. Xi’s speech confirmed that trend. He used the word “market” only 19 times, compared with 24 times by Mr. Hu at the previous congress in 2012, and 51 times by then-President Jiang Zemin at the congress in 1997. Mr. Xi emphasized making state-owned enterprises stronger and bigger, yet more efficient. He also called for stricter regulation of banks and other parts of the financial system amid a surge of borrowing by companies and local governments. But he did not mention using market tools like improving the disclosure of information by banks and companies alike, which many economists advocate. Still, Mr. Xi did raise some points dear to economic reformers. He called for breaking up monopolies, even though he oversaw the merger of the two largest rail equipment manufacturers to prevent them from competing against each other for overseas projects. And he made a fleeting promise to “support the growth of private businesses.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Top General’s Grief Becomes a Political Talking Point for the President” (news article, Oct. 18): Lacking the grace, skill, empathy, humor, work ethic, knowledge, tact, thick skin and fitness for the job, all of which former President Barack Obama possessed in depth, President Trump displays his envy by lying about Mr. Obama: suggesting that he did not tend to fallen and wounded soldiers when Mr. Obama did so constantly; suggesting that the Iran nuclear deal is terrible and that the Affordable Care Act is a failure — both untrue, and Mr. Trump is unable to explain what is wrong with either. Mr. Trump is the same man who led the “birther” charge against Mr. Obama and accused the former president of wiretapping his office — both charges false. Mr. Trump’s obsession with Mr. Obama seems abnormal. JOHN E. COLBERT

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Xi Jinping’s extraordinarily long opening speech set the tone for China’s weeklong Communist Party congress. He declared a “new era” and stressed the country’s “great power” in comments that effectively claimed a stature as significant to today’s China as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping held in theirs. Here are five takeaways. Mr. Xi’s rise has been marked by rekindled enthusiasm for traditional culture. Witness how his embrace of the Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming prompted one city to build a theme park, construct a museum and even commission a robot to bring him to life. _____ "
"Global bank watchdogs are acting as a line of defense against an American deregulatory push. The Treasury Department will soon decide whether to recommend scrapping the Dodd-Frank Act’s rules for liquidating failing banks, as some Republicans are urging. But foreign regulators are threatening to impose new curbs on American firms if it’s ditched. What’s known as Orderly Liquidation Authority was established in Dodd-Frank to avoid confusion if a complex financial institution fails, like Lehman Brothers did a decade ago. The act gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. the power to unwind bank holding companies, systemically important nonbanks and other financial firms, and set up a fund to pay for the associated costs. The F.D.I.C. would initially borrow from the Treasury, and recoup the expenses with a fee imposed on big banks. Some congressional Republicans decry this arrangement as another taxpayer-funded bailout. They have introduced bills to eliminate the liquidation procedures and replace them with an improved bankruptcy code. The criticisms prompted President Trump in April to order the Treasury Department to review those procedures and assess whether bankruptcy was a better method. The debate in Washington ignores the global nature of big banks and the role that international regulators play. The F.D.I.C.-supported method would deal with a failing bank at the holding company level, eliminating the need for each division — including overseas units — to have their own wind-down plans. Overseas watchdogs would defer to regulators in the United States and work in close cooperation with them. Bankruptcy judges don’t have those relationships and the process, even with improvements, would be too slow to handle the fast-paced chaos of a large, failing bank. Overseas regulators have smartly worked to get ahead of the decision, warning that without the Dodd-Frank rules, overseas subsidiaries of American banks could be subject to higher capital requirements, restructuring and ring-fencing. Wall Street also supports maintaining the liquidation authority. Despite Mr. Trump’s threats to gut Dodd-Frank, the Treasury Department under the leadership of Secretary Steven Mnuchin has so far been levelheaded in its recommendations for revising bank regulations and rules overseeing capital markets. The threat from global watchdogs is another reason to discount the odds of a major rollback of financial rules. "
"During nearly seven years as a Republican in the New York State Assembly, Nicole Malliotakis earned a reputation for embracing unpopular stances in the Democrat-controlled chamber, opposing minimum wage increases, paid family leave, gay marriage and public financing of elections. But some of her most heartfelt declarations were reserved for issues relating to immigration. At an Assembly hearing in January, she jousted with Mayor Bill de Blasio over a sanctuary city law that delineates which undocumented immigrants, when convicted of major crimes, can be turned over to federal authorities for possible deportation. “Why would you protect individuals who are here illegally committing these crimes,” Ms. Malliotakis said then, “instead of putting your citizenry first and foremost?” Ms. Malliotakis, who is from Staten Island, is now running as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, seeking to unseat Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. She will be an understandable long shot on Election Day in November, given the power of incumbency, the six-to-one edge that Democrats hold over Republicans in New York City, and the 44-point lead that Mr. de Blasio enjoys over her in a recent poll. And her conservative record is not likely to pull Democratic voters to her side. She has sued the city over a program that provides identification cards to residents, trying to block officials from destroying records that might be used to identify people for deportation. "
"The Trump administration escalated a bitter confrontation with Iran on Wednesday, demanding that the United Nations Security Council punish the Iranian government for what the American ambassador called its “outlaw behavior” across the Middle East. “The United States will not turn a blind eye to these violations,” the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, told a Security Council meeting that had been meant to focus on developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ms. Haley used her speaking time instead to deliver a critique of Iran. Her remarks were among the most strident denunciations Ms. Haley has made of Iran since she became President Trump’s ambassador in January. The remarks seemed timed partly to respond to international criticism of the administration over Mr. Trump’s avowed hostility to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers, including the United States, which he has described as an embarrassment and a disaster. She spoke less than a week after Mr. Trump announced that he would disavow the nuclear agreement and might withdraw the United States from the accord altogether unless it was strengthened to his satisfaction. That decision has deeply angered Iran — which has ruled out any renegotiation — and has raised alarms among many American allies, including Britain, France and Germany, which were among the parties to the agreement.

"Let’s get this out of the way first: Ted Cruz is not the Zodiac killer. We’re pretty sure. The infamous serial killer’s last confirmed murder was in 1969, while the senator from Texas was born in 1970. We feel the need to be very clear about this: Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, is almost surely not the Zodiac killer. It’s just about impossible. But that’s long been a joke on the internet. And on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz, who evidence suggests is unlikely to be the Zodiac killer, posted the following on Twitter: You might recognize the image as a coded letter the Zodiac killer once sent. This does not, any reasonable person would conclude, offer definitive proof that Mr. Cruz is the Zodiac killer, who was blamed for at least five murders in the San Francisco Bay Area and has never been identified. But it did make for a suitable distraction on Wednesday, as people on Twitter erupted at what appeared to be Mr. Cruz’s first acknowledgment of the long-running joke. Did the one-time presidential candidate score a few points for being in on the joke? Did he ruin what was once a fun joke? Others — surely including those hearing about it for the first time through this article — were all sorts of baffled. Why did he tweet the Zodiac note? Why do people say he’s the Zodiac killer?

Wilson, Democrat of Florida who accompanied the young widow. “Myeshia, the entire time, was in a ball, rolled up almost like in a fetal position crying,” Ms. Wilson said on Wednesday. “What he said was, ‘I guess he knew what he was signing up for but it still hurts.’ That’s how he said it.” Ms. Wilson offered a harsh critique of the president’s words about the soldier’s death in an ambush in Niger, which she said were not comforting. “So in other words, when you sign up when you go into the military, you are really signing up to die,” she said of the president’s comments. “That is not what you say to a grieving widow, a woman who just learned that her husband cannot have an open casket funeral. In fact, she will probably not even be able to see his body.” "
"After a tumultuous month of hearing from the president and some football fans who are angry at players who do not stand for the national anthem, the N.F.L. owners left a two-day meeting agreeing to let their players protest, but to work with them on the social issues they are trying to address. A day after meeting players and union officials, the owners spoke among themselves for several hours on Wednesday in Manhattan. No specific resolution was proposed to strengthen the league’s rules on the anthem, and only a handful of owners expressed a desire for measures that would penalize players who did not stand. Most owners, though, said they wanted every player to stand for the anthem, but recognized that it would be misguided for the league to mandate it. “Look, we all want the players to stand, but as far as I’m concerned, because they want to stand as opposed to me having to tell them that,” John Mara, a co-owner of the Giants, said. Mara said there was some conversation about changing league rules, which say players should stand for the anthem, but he said “the policy is not going to change.” Mara was one of about a half-dozen owners who spoke to reporters after the meetings ended. Mara, the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank and the San Francisco 49ers co-owner Jed York said the owners were trying to move past the controversy, which has prompted fans to turn in season tickets, burn football jerseys and fly a plane over a stadium with a banner calling for a boycott of the N.F.L. The owners said that while they knew some fans were unhappy with the protests — which began more than a year ago as a way to highlight issues affecting black Americans — it was important for them to listen to their players and the reasons they have been protesting.

Its sponsors say yes, and a number of influential Republicans are backing it. President Trump appeared to qualify his support. House Speaker Paul Ryan came out against it. The bill, engineered by Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, would continue payouts to insurance companies for discounts they give to low-income people under Obamacare. _____ 2.

"WASHINGTON — Since Janet L. Yellen became the Federal Reserve’s chairwoman in February 2014, unemployment in the United States has steadily declined while inflation has remained low. Few Fed chairmen have achieved comparable success. Yet President Trump, who is scheduled to meet Ms. Yellen on Thursday, says he is still considering whether to nominate her for a second four-year term, and key White House aides are pressing for her to be replaced. Ms. Yellen’s peril reflects the polarization of American politics. The three previous Fed chairs were reappointed at least once by a president of the opposite political party, but some Republicans are eager to oust Ms. Yellen, a registered Democrat who has strongly defended post-crisis financial regulations. She may also become a victim of her own success. Steady economic growth and the tranquillity of financial markets have emboldened some critics, who see an opportune moment for a transition to new leadership. But Mr. Trump also faces warnings that replacing Ms. Yellen is an unnecessary risk to the economic growth the president has repeatedly pointed to as a primary success of his young administration. “The economy is humming along,” said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, a New York economic research firm. “The markets are humming along. Given all the other stuff that’s going on, why mess with that?” "
"President Trump’s ban on people from a handful of countries entering the United States, though worded as a national security measure, appears to be a veiled, unconstitutional bid to bar Muslims based on their religion, a federal judge in Maryland ruled on Wednesday in an order that cited the president’s own words at length. The order was the second in two days blocking the travel ban, which was set to go into effect on Wednesday; a judge in Hawaii on Tuesday ruled against the president’s action, and another challenge is pending in Washington State. The Trump administration said it would appeal the rulings. Judge Derrick K. Watson, in Federal District Court in Honolulu, ruled that opponents of the ban were likely to succeed in arguing that it violated federal immigration statutes, and issued a temporary restraining order against the administration pending a hearing on whether to grant a permanent injunction. In Federal District Court in Greenbelt, Md., Judge Theodore D. Chuang raised the stakes, finding that the president’s ban was suspect on both statutory and constitutional grounds, and granting an injunction for an indefinite period of time. “It’s significant that the two judges who examined it found that the ban violated the law in several ways, which gives the appellate courts and ultimately the Supreme Court more options for striking it down,” said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case. The district judges, both appointed by President Barack Obama, had ruled against an earlier attempt at a travel ban, as had the federal appellate courts for their regions of the country, and the appeals were consolidated and taken up by the Supreme Court, which allowed some parts of the ban to go into effect, pending consideration of the case. That became moot after Mr. Trump issued a revised ban last month. The new version was the one blocked by the two judges this week, and with the same issues still in play, the high court appears likely to consider the matter again. In response to Wednesday’s ruling, a Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, referred to his statement the day before: “Today’s ruling is incorrect, fails to properly respect the separation of powers, and has the potential to cause serious negative consequences for our national security.” "
"President Trump and Republicans in Congress have brought chaos to the American health care system by trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act and failing to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which, with bipartisan support for the past 20 years, has provided care for millions of children. Over the next few weeks they can choose to set things right or to destroy them. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray on Tuesday announced a bipartisan deal that could help stabilize the A.C.A.’s insurance markets and undo some of the damage Mr. Trump has done through administrative actions. In an ideal world, Congress would quickly pass that bill, which includes several Republican priorities, and, at the same time, reauthorize CHIP, which now covers nearly nine million children. But with Mr. Trump in the White House and feckless Republicans leading Congress, it’s possible that none of this will get done, health care costs will be driven up and millions of children will be left without health insurance. First up, the Alexander-Murray deal represents real progress. These two no-nonsense lawmakers — the leading Republican and Democrat on the Senate health committee — have done yeoman’s work trying to fix a mess created largely by Mr. Trump. Their bill would appropriate money for payments to insurance companies that the president said he was stopping last week. He said they amounted to an illegal corporate bailout — a blatant lie. These payments, authorized by the A.C.A., or Obamacare, compensate insurers for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income families. Further, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray would require the administration to spend $106 million on advertising and on people to help people sign up for insurance when open enrollment begins on Nov. 1. Mr. Trump’s minions at the Department of Health and Human Services slashed spending on outreach efforts in recent months. The deal also advances two Republican health care ideas: giving states more flexibility to make changes to the A.C.A. and letting more people sign up for high-deductible health care policies. Thankfully, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray have made sure that neither of these changes undermines Obamacare’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions and the requirement that insurers cover essential health services like maternity care and cancer treatment. These changes could make the law function better by allowing sparsely populated states to attract more insurers by, for example, making it easier for them to set up reinsurance programs that protect companies from losses from a few customers. And the proposed high-deductible plans could work well for a small subset of people who buy A.C.A. policies but do not receive subsidies because they earn too much money. While these compromises provide some hope for the A.C.A., CHIP’s fate, and health care for nine million children, is being held hostage by Republican extremists in the House. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Finance Committee — Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden — have worked together to extend the program, which expired on Sept. 30. But Republican House members such as Greg Walden of Oregon and Fred Upton of Michigan are demanding that spending on CHIP be offset by cuts to A.C.A. costs and unnecessary changes to Medicare and Medicaid. Of course, these same lawmakers who are so tightfisted with children’s medical care want to slash taxes on wealthy families with no effort to offset that loss of revenue. "
"WASHINGTON — Most people think of the term “bailout,” as a political pejorative, often involving hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars being funneled to failing companies. It’s now become one of President Trump’s oft-repeated rhetorical cudgels against the Affordable Care Act and federal payments to insurance companies. In April, the president accused Democrats of wanting to “bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare.” In July, he threatened to end “BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies” if Congress did not repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. And in a speech Tuesday night to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Mr. Trump urged Congress to “find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.” But his use of the word is misleading. “Bailout” typically refers to financial assistance offered to prevent the bankruptcy of a company or industry. The 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (which Mr. Trump largely supported) was a bailout because it provided $700 billion for the Treasury Department to buy troubled securities from banks that were at risk of collapse. The funds Mr. Trump now refers to, on the other hand, are more accurately characterized as a reimbursement that the government pays to the insurance companies. It is done not to save the companies from financial ruin — unlike the banks in 2008, they are not in danger of failing — but to cover the cost of cheaper health care for low- and moderate-income Americans. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers must offer plans with reduced out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles and co-payments, for people who have purchased a silver-level plan and who have incomes of 100 to 250 percent of the poverty level (about $24,600 to $61,500 for a family of four). About seven million people, or about 58 percent of all marketplace enrollees, qualified for that financial assistance this year. "
"For decades, America has waged an ineffective war on drug pushers and drug lords, from Bronx street corners to Medellin, Colombia, regarding them as among the most contemptible specimens of humanity. One reason our efforts have failed is we ignored the biggest drug pushers of all: American pharmaceutical companies. Our policy was: You get 15 people hooked on opioids, and you’re a thug who deserves to rot in hell; you get 150,000 people hooked, and you’re a marketing genius who deserves a huge bonus. Big Pharma should be writhing in embarrassment this week after The Washington Post and “60 Minutes” reported that pharmaceutical lobbyists had manipulated Congress to hamstring the Drug Enforcement Administration. But the abuse goes far beyond that: The industry systematically manipulated the entire country for 25 years, and its executives are responsible for many of the 64,000 deaths of Americans last year from drugs — more than the number of Americans who died in the Vietnam and Iraq wars combined. The opioid crisis unfolded because greedy people — Latin drug lords and American pharma executives alike — lost their humanity when they saw the astounding profits that could be made. It used to be in America that people became addicted to opioids through illegal drugs. In the 1960s, for example, 80 percent of Americans hooked on opioids began with heroin. "
"Alaska is “open for business!” With these words, delivered before an appreciative audience of oil producers in Anchorage in May, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reaffirmed the Trump administration’s determination to open Alaska’s fragile environment to commercial exploitation. Here are the particulars of that assault, at least so far: In April, President Trump signed an order that to allow oil drilling in United States waters in the Arctic Ocean that President Barack Obama had declared off limits. In May, Mr. Zinke made clear his plan to reverse the Obama administration’s decision to protect environmentally delicate areas of the National Petroleum Reserve. Also in May, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, always eager to join in the environmental mayhem, reversed an Obama policy that had blocked a proposed gold mine in the headwaters of Bristol Bay, one of the most productive wild salmon fisheries. Mr. Pruitt made the decision after meeting with the chief executive of the mining company. But wait — there’s more. As early as Thursday, with Mr. Zinke and the rest of the administration cheering from the sidelines, the Senate could vote on opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s oil-rich coastal plain for drilling. Unlike the rest of the 19.6-million-acre refuge, mostly protected since its creation under President Dwight Eisenhower, the fate of the 1.5-million-acre plain — the refuge’s biological heart — is up to Congress. Congress has twice come within a hair of consigning the coastal plain and its abundant wildlife to the drillers — in 1995, when President Bill Clinton vetoed a budget bill that contained a drilling provision, and in 2005, when moderate Republicans in the House rose up against a similar plan. This time the threat comes wrapped in a giant budget package that, without mentioning the coastal plain explicitly, instructs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to find $1 billion in revenue to offset the bill’s giant tax cuts. This invites the committee chairwoman, Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, to write language in the budget legislation to allow development. Assuming that Senate Democrats mobilized by Ed Markey of Massachusetts hold firm, only a few Republicans are needed to block this maneuver. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine have voted against drilling in the refuge before; it would be astonishing if they did not do so again. It should not be hard to find at least one more who sees this bill for what it is — a budget scam that puts the wildest place left in America at risk. "
"RIO DE JANEIRO — Federal prosecutors in Brazil on Wednesday charged a Brazilian partner in the former Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro with paying bribes to propel the city’s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. The businessman, Arthur César de Menezes Soares Filho, is a fugitive in the United States, according to Brazilian prosecutors. They expressed frustration over what they characterized as Washington’s reluctance to help in the investigation, contending that American officials did not extradite him, freeze his bank accounts or search his Miami residence as part of an international attempt to bring him to justice. The 157-page criminal complaint made public on Wednesday charts what prosecutors called a “win-win” kickback scheme masterminded by a powerful trio: the former Rio de Janeiro governor, Sérgio Cabral; the recently-ousted head of Brazil’s Olympic Committee, Carlos Arthur Nuzman; and Mr. Soares, who ran several companies that were awarded multimillion government contracts. The complaint does not suggest that anyone in the Trump Organization was involved in, or aware of, the kickback scheme. The Trump Organization pulled out of the project last December, soon after the hotel came under scrutiny in a separate criminal investigation involving investments by public pension fund managers. The Trump Organization on Wednesday declined to comment on the record to questions submitted by email about its relationship with Mr. Soares and whether it had been contacted by investigators. According to the charging document in the Olympic bribery case, Mr. Soares, a longtime associate of the former Rio governor, was the source of at least $2 million in bribes paid to Lamine Diack, the former president of the International Association of Athletics Federations who had a vote in the selection of the 2016 Summer Games. "
"WASHINGTON — People trying to express sympathy to the families of fallen troops say the wrong thing all the time. When Marine First Lt. Travis Manion was killed by sniper fire during the Iraq troop surge in 2007, one well-wisher told his family that it was “such a waste.” Another called it a shame for him “to die in vain like that.” But usually, such comments do not come from the president. Asked amid an outcry over President Trump’s telling a soldier’s widow that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” families of slain troops described on Wednesday a range of encounters with him and his six immediate predecessors, from sympathy and sincerity — including from Mr. Trump — to awkward distances. Mr. Trump has denied making the comment, which was described by both the mother of the soldier and Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, who was present for the call. Mr. Trump spoke to Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, killed in an ambush in Niger this month, as she was being taken to receive her husband’s body, according to his mother. Several military families whose loved ones were killed this year did describe phone calls from Mr. Trump that they said gave them solace. Another spoke of a promised call from him that never came. Together, the episodes underscore one of the most difficult duties of a president — comforting family members of Americans killed carrying out the orders of a commander in chief. “I picture myself in that limo — the last thing you’d want to hear is something like that,” said Nadia McCaffrey, whose only child, Sgt. Patrick McCaffrey, was killed in an ambush in Iraq in 2004. She was furious with President George W. Bush after her son was killed, she said, and refused to take calls from the White House. Families of slain service members who have had exchanges with past presidents decried the timing of Mr. Trump’s phone call, which they said came at what was most likely one of Mrs. Johnson’s most vulnerable moments. And while a number of relatives said they were subject to verbal punches dressed up as sympathy, none came from the presidents who sent their sons and daughters to war. "
"BAGHDAD — When the Iraqi military battled Kurdish forces this week to reclaim the contested city of Kirkuk, the spectacle of one American-backed ally fighting another with American-supplied weapons was not the only incongruous sight. Another was the United States turning its back on a crucial ally in the fight against the Islamic State, the Kurds, as Washington’s goals aligned with those of a regional nemesis, Iran. While the military action in Kirkuk on Monday and Tuesday was carried out under the banner of the Iraqi military, the ground forces included Iranian-backed Shiite militias. American officials, including President Trump, insisted that the United States was not taking sides in the dispute, but some analysts say that the United States approved the Iraqi plan to enter Kurdish-held areas and that Iran helped broker the agreement with a Kurdish faction to withdraw its fighters from Kirkuk, allowing the Iraqi forces to take over largely unopposed. “Abadi would not have attacked without informing the U.S.,” said David L. Phillips, a former State Department adviser who worked on Iraq for 30 years, referring to the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi. “At a minimum, the U.S. knew that the attack was coming.” Maria Fantappie, senior analyst for Iraq at the International Crisis Group, said, “The United States gave a green light, and that was essential.” "

Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, will go to the White House Thursday to interview for the job she currently holds. Her term ends early next year, and President Trump is deciding whether to reappoint her or pick someone else. When her name first appeared on the reported list of finalists, I assumed it was only for show. Trump likes to inject drama into an appointment process, as you may recall from the secretary of state bake-off. Including Yellen — the first woman ever to be Fed chair and originally an Obama appointee — as a finalist adds intrigue. In the end, I assumed Trump would choose a conservative man for the job, as he does for most big jobs. And he may well. But there is a strong case that Trump would be serving his own political interests by reappointing Yellen, and if we know one thing about Trump, it’s that he cares about his own interests. Think about the chaos that surrounds this administration: the Russia investigation, the struggling Cabinet secretaries, the West Wing leaks, the failure to pass significant legislation, the rebukes from Senate Republicans, the botched response to Hurricane Maria, the stymied Muslim ban, the nuclear tensions in North Korea and Iran and, underscoring it all, the 38 percent approval rating. What is the single biggest exception? The economy. It’s doing just fine. It’s not booming, but it is growing steadily, with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate. As Trump repeatedly notes, the stock market is indeed booming. "
"In a sign of mounting frustration among Republicans in Washington, Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a senior lawmaker with close ties to his party’s leaders, is expected to resign and take up an executive post with a business group in his home state, according to three Republicans briefed on his plans. An abrupt departure by Mr. Tiberi, who is an influential member of the House Ways and Means Committee, would signal a deepening level of discontent among mainstream Republicans in Congress. Despite holding Congress and the White House, Republicans have so far failed to achieve longstanding policy goals like overhauling the tax code and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Tiberi, 54, could announce his plan to leave Congress as soon as this week, Republican officials said, though it is unclear when he intends to vacate his seat. Two Republicans who were briefed on Mr. Tiberi’s decision said he had indicated that he plans to join the Ohio Business Roundtable, a business consortium that announced this summer that it was searching for a new president. Mr. Tiberi did not respond to a phone call or a text message seeking comment on Wednesday night. But some of Mr. Tiberi’s colleagues said that the grind of their jobs had gotten no better since Donald J. Trump’s election last year, giving Republicans full control of Washington. “This is a harder life in terms of being away from home and putting up with the pace and the public battering that one sometimes must endure,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. “And no raises in a decade is hard on many members with families.” Of Mr. Tiberi, Mr. Cole said that he was “happy for my friend, but Congress will be a poorer place without him.” "
"RALEIGH, N.C. — Republicans with a firm grip on the North Carolina legislature — and, until January, the governor’s seat — enacted a conservative agenda in recent years, only to have a steady stream of laws affecting voting and legislative power rejected by the courts. Now lawmakers have seized on a solution: change the makeup of the courts. Judges in state courts as of this year must identify their party affiliation on ballots, making North Carolina the first state in nearly a century to adopt partisan court elections. The General Assembly in Raleigh reduced the size of the state Court of Appeals, depriving Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, of naming replacements for retiring Republicans. And this month, lawmakers drew new boundaries for judicial districts statewide, which critics say are meant to increase the number of Republican judges on district and superior courts and would force many African-Americans on the bench into runoffs against other incumbents. “Instead of changing the way they write their laws, they want to change the judges,” Mr. Cooper said as he sat in a 19th-century, high-ceiling library at the Executive Mansion, which he has occupied uneasily since succeeding Pat McCrory, a Republican. The legislature has overridden nearly a dozen of his vetoes. The latest was on Monday, when lawmakers sustained a bill to eliminate judicial primary elections, which Mr. Cooper called part of an effort to “rig the system.” Republicans say their goal is to correct yearslong imbalances from shifts in population, ignored while Democrats held power, and to give voters more information about little-known judges in down-ballot races. “This is about making good policy,” Representative Justin Burr, who unveiled the proposed new judicial maps in a series of Twitter messages one Sunday in June, has said. North Carolina’s evolution comes in the context of longstanding but increasing politicization of federal courts. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, blocked President Barack Obama’s appointment of Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court for 10 months until Mr. Obama’s term expired. In the end, President Trump appointed Neil M. Gorsuch to the court instead. On Monday, appearing at the White House with Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell said he favors ending the tradition of giving senators a veto — known as a “blue slip” — over judges for appellate courts in their home states.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday backed away from his endorsement of a bipartisan Senate proposal to stabilize health insurance markets, throwing the legislative effort into doubt even as the chief architect of the deal predicted that it would become law before the end of the year. The latest actions by the White House confused Republicans on Capitol Hill and irked Democrats — but in the end, their effect was not clear. The effort to calm roiled insurance markets appears destined for a showdown in December, when supporters of the compromise, drafted by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, will have the most leverage. The mixed signals began Tuesday, when Mr. Trump appeared to give his blessing to the deal to restore subsidies to health insurers that he said days before he would cut off. Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray agreed on legislation that would continue federal payments to insurance companies through 2019 to reimburse them for discounts that they are required to provide to millions of low-income people who have coverage under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. On Wednesday, the White House sent a different message. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said later that Mr. Trump did not support the deal in its current form but indicated that changes could win him over. “We want something that doesn’t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all Americans,” she said, adding that the deal was “a good step in the right direction.” "
"WASHINGTON — When Trump administration officials travel to Germany next month for United Nations climate change discussions, they will face a fundamental contradiction: how to negotiate the terms of a deal they say they’re walking away from. Like a spouse who demands a divorce but then continues to live at home, the relationship between the United States and other parties to the Paris agreement is, at best, awkward. The Trump administration has declared it will abandon the global climate change pact and make no effort to meet its voluntary target to curb planet-warming emissions. On Tuesday, President Trump repeated his claim that former President Barack Obama’s diplomats agreed to bad deals. “I will always put the needs of our country first,” Mr. Trump said. “That is why we are withdrawing from one-sided international deals,” he added, citing the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris agreement. Yet the United States cannot formally leave the accord until 2020, and in the interim administration officials have said they will continue to protect American interests, which essentially translates into helping to write the Paris agreement’s rule book. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have both dangled the possibility that some as-yet undefined improved terms might one day persuade the president to reconsider. "
"Good morning. Today’s introduction is by Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) There has been no shortage of women eager to sign a letter denouncing a culture of sexual harassment in the state Capitol. After more than 140 initially lent their names, dozens more contacted organizers Tuesday asking to take part. In the letter and detailed comments to reporters, several lawmakers and lobbyists spoke of their experiences being groped and cornered by sexually aggressive men. Many were speaking out for the first time, but some had openly talked about their ordeals to friends and colleagues for years. But so far, none have publicly named the men doing the harassing. Women said the harassment in Sacramento has come from high-ranking staff members, experienced lobbyists and lawmakers. Few have filed formal complaints and even fewer have tried to press charges. In interviews, several women said they thought little good would come from naming specific men. They spoke of watching the intense scrutiny of Anita Hill in the 1990s when she testified against Clarence Thomas, now an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.

First: The bipartisan health care deal in the Senate, announced yesterday, is a very good deal. It undoes two of President Trump’s attempts to sabotage the law, by reinstating reimbursement payments to insurers and by encouraging people to sign up for insurance. It also gives states some more flexibility, a longtime conservative priority. Perhaps above all, it’s a sign that some leading Republicans are finally serious about trying to improve the health care system. The deal, John McCain said, “shows that good faith, bipartisan negotiations can achieve consensus on lasting reform.” Democratic-leaning experts were full of praise for it too, saying that, while it didn’t void all of Trump’s mischief, it was major progress. Jacob Leibenluft, a former Obama adviser, called the deal the “first concession” from Republicans that “they will own health care markets in 2018 and 2020.” The biggest caveat: The deal — between Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, and Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican — is still just a framework. It must pass both houses of Congress and be signed by Trump. An ugly, and close, campaign. Virginia and New Jersey are the only states to hold their governor elections the year after presidential elections, which turns the two states into gauges of a new president’s popularity. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s condolence call to the widow of a slain soldier exploded into a vicious row that swamped the White House on Wednesday, with the soldier’s grieving mother accusing the president of disrespecting her family and a defiant Mr. Trump complaining that his words had been cynically twisted for political purposes. The back-and-forth made a furious spectacle of what is, at the best of times, one of the most emotionally wrenching contacts between the commander in chief and a bereaved citizen. It overshadowed any talk of Mr. Trump’s legislative priorities and instead recalled his history of feuding with military families or even, as in the case of Senator John McCain, a war hero. Twelve days after four Americans were killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger, the president called the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, who was among the slain, and said that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” referring to the soldier only as “your guy,” according to Sergeant Johnson’s mother and a Democratic congresswoman, who both listened to the call. Mr. Trump angrily disputed that account, insisting that he “had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife, who sounded like a lovely woman.” The White House accused the congresswoman, Frederica S. Wilson of Florida, of politicizing a sacred ritual after Mr. Trump initially said she “fabricated” it. It was, to a great extent, a self-inflicted wound. Mr. Trump opened the issue on Monday when he deflected a question about why he had not spoken publicly about the deaths of the four soldiers by falsely accusing his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of not contacting the families of fallen troops. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump dragged his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, into the dispute. He told reporters that Mr. Obama had not called Mr. Kelly, a former Marine Corps general, when his son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in action in 2010 in Afghanistan. Mr. Kelly, who has long been reluctant to talk about the loss of his son, did not comment on the issue. "

Has anyone told you that?” He said no. “Well, you do,” she said. “It’s wonderful!” When she resumed her place, he said, “That’s a new one.” He seemed dismayed. Clearly, this was not the first time a white person told him he looked like a famous person of color. I didn’t want to make his shopping any worse by confronting her, so I said nothing. Was I right? ANONYMOUS So many layers here! I wouldn’t have said anything to the older woman, either. You were all strangers. And it’s a pretty big assumption that she had fallen into an ugly “you all look the same to me” racist stereotype. (Not that she hadn’t just because she was pleasant.) There’s also no telling how she may have reacted to a comment from you. When it comes to confrontations with strangers, I subscribe largely to the Dionne Warwick model: “Walk On By.” But if the man was upset, you missed an opportunity. The older lady was in front, so presumably she left the store before you. After she exited, you might have said: “I’m sorry if she hurt your feelings with that Gandhi comment.” Then let the man respond, and take his lead. (Kindness to strangers is a clear exception to the Dionne Warwick rule.) Yet even absent any racial overlay, it’s a bad idea to comment on strangers’ looks or tell them whom they resemble. There are a million ways to be nice to people without objectifying them. And they may not care for the likeness you see. My husband and I are public interest lawyers. We own our home and paid for our daughter’s college education. We’re starting to have a decent nest egg for our retirement. Our daughter has begun a new relationship with a smart young man who could not afford to attend college. He recently had health problems, and now has medical bills he can’t pay. He and our daughter both earn $15 an hour, but he has no family to call on for help. Our daughter has asked us to pay off his bills. Should we? "
"The Federal Reserve’s inner workings are a mystery to most Americans. Presidents can’t order it around, nor can Congress — that much is generally believed. Along with its reputation for independence, the Fed can seem economically omnipotent. But in truth, our research shows, Fed independence is largely a myth. With President Trump having met with the Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen on Thursday as he considers new leadership, it’s worth examining the idea that the Fed is unfettered in making monetary policy. This notion misjudges the politics of its relationship with Congress. Instead, think of Congress and the Fed as interdependent institutions — a political relationship that constrains the Fed’s conduct. Why interdependent? Congress depends on the Fed to steer the economy and to absorb the blame when the economy falters. Repeated revisions or threats of revisions to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the law that created the Fed, have signaled the costs of failing to meet legislators’ expectations. At the same time, the Fed’s credibility and its capacity to carry out necessary, but often unpopular, policy hinges on maintaining broad political and public support. Otherwise, there’s the risk that Congress or the president may limit the Fed’s autonomy or undermine the economy with counterproductive fiscal policy. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 after the Fed failed to prevent the financial crisis is Exhibit A in a congressional blame game. Congress sought to deflect responsibility for the crisis by saddling the Fed with new regulatory responsibilities, even as it clipped its lender-of-last-resort power. Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul. Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both. Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher. "

"To the Editor: Re “U.S. Auto Giants Stake a Claim to a Future With Less Gasoline” (front page, Oct. 3): That American auto giants have decided to increase electric vehicle manufacturing even as the Trump administration slashes regulations and ignores science looks like a victory for free market demand. It is not. American automakers’ electric vehicle announcements are a response to regulations — just not American regulations. In this case, G.M. and Ford are responding to stricter Chinese and European emissions standards. In our global economy, America’s failure to adequately regulate industry, acknowledge truth or act as a responsible participant on the world stage does not build the United States’ bottom line or benefit our businesses. Instead, it just minimizes America’s influence in the world. The United States is handing the future to Europe and China on a gold-encrusted Mar-a-Lago platter. SAM ROCKWELL, MINNEAPOLIS "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) In 2011, Jerry Brown, the newly minted governor, faced 870 bills to sign into law. Rejecting one that punished children for skiing without a helmet, he provided a glimpse into his thinking on government rule-making. “Not every human problem deserves a law,” he wrote. The bills have kept coming. With the 2017 legislative session now officially ended, Mr. Brown has signed nearly 6,000 measures over his latest two terms, according to government figures. Among the biggest this year were those intended to ease home building, fund road and bridge repairs with a gas tax, and adopt so-called sanctuary policies statewide. But as in 2011, the governor didn’t like everything he saw. He vetoed 118 out of 977 measures. Political analysts identified a few themes. “He puts the brakes, if you will, on the Legislature’s enthusiasm,” said Chris Micheli, a lobbyist who tracks bill-making in Sacramento. "

"WASHINGTON — The detention of a Turkish employee at the United States consulate in Istanbul, the subsequent United States decision to suspend the processing of nonimmigrant visas for Turks, followed by Turkey doing the same to Americans, has sunk United States-Turkish relations to a low point. It is important for the Turks and the Americans to question who stands to benefit from further deterioration of their strategic partnership. To ensure that the current crisis isn’t exploited by geopolitical rivals and strategic interests of the United States and Turkey don’t suffer, it is necessary to use diplomacy and pull the United States-Turkish relations out of their present impasse. The first step should be to insulate the American and Turkish people from the crisis. By denying visas to Turks, the United States has for the first time taken measures that affect ordinary Turks. The decision is aggravating existing resentments toward Turkey in the United States and fueling anti-Americanism in Turkey. Both nations should demonstrate greater sensitivity to each other’s concerns: Turkey needs the United States to show a more nuanced appreciation of its security concerns; the United States needs Turkey to show a strict commitment to governance by the rule of law. The alliance between Turkey and the United States goes back seven decades. Turkey, a NATO member since 1952, was a staunch ally of the West during the Cold War. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey contributed to peacekeeping efforts to stabilize the former Yugoslavia and later help repair churches, mosques, bridges and build schools in Bosnia. Turkey also helped build roads and schools for girls in Afghanistan after the United States intervention. In the 2000s Turkey took crucial steps to improve its democracy and economy that brought it close to European Union membership. The “Turkish Model” was widely praised as the way forward for Muslim countries aspiring for reform. The United States was constructively engaged in this process and saw Turkey as a critical pillar of the international liberal order. This policy ran through the Clinton, George W. Bush and a good part of the Obama administrations. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid political advertisements on television, on radio and in print have been subjected for years. An effort to change that begins today, when a bipartisan bill is to be introduced in the Senate to force Facebook, Google and other companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising. The proposal follows revelations that Russian-linked operatives bought deceptive ads before the 2016 election. For its part, the tech industry — which has fought previous efforts to require such disclosures — is mobilizing lobbyists and lawyers to help shape regulations. We noted on Wednesday that President Trump had indicated support for a Senate proposal that would stabilize health insurance markets by offering short-term funding for subsidies to insurers. Hours later, the president backed away from that endorsement, saying he could “never support bailing out” insurance companies. "
"Will President Trump’s assault on the norms underpinning constitutional democracy permanently alter American political life? On a daily basis, Trump tests the willingness of the public to accept a president who lies as a matter of routine. So far, Trump has persuaded a large swath of America to swallow what he feeds them. Asked whether the media makes up stories about Trump, nearly half the population of the United States, 46 percent, now says yes, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted Oct. 12-16. This compares to 37 percent who say that the media does not fabricate material about the president. While Republicans and Democrats diverge in the directions you would expect, a plurality of independents, 44 percent, says that the media produces false stories; 31 percent say the media is accurate. Trump has flourished at a time when trust in basic institutions — organized religion, banks, medical services, Congress, the media, government, you name it — has eroded. His presidency is a product of this erosion, but it is also proving to be an accelerant of the process. Eight days after Trump was elected, Clare Malone, a senior political writer for the website FiveThirtyEight, put it this way: Or, as Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk write in the July 2016 issue of the Journal of Democracy: The danger, they argue, cannot be underestimated: Trump is the most prominent of the right-wing populist politicians continuing to gain strength both here and in Europe (despite some electoral setbacks), but because the viewpoint he represents is now so widespread, he is in one sense personally irrelevant — a symptom rather than a cause. As Sasha Polakow-Suransky, the author of “Go Back to Where You Came From: The Backlash Against Immigration and the Fate of Western Democracy,” warns in The New York Review of Books: The threat to democracy posed by the current outbreak of populist nationalism has become a matter of concern for both scholars and ordinary citizens. The central topic at a conference at Yale earlier this month was “How Do Democracies Fall Apart,” and the subject will be taken up again in November at a Stanford conference called “Global Populisms: A Threat to Democracy?” "
"WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain and two Democratic senators moved on Thursday to force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, after revelations that Russian-linked operatives bought deceptive ads in the run-up to the 2016 election with no disclosure required. But the tech industry, which has worked to thwart previous efforts to mandate such disclosure, is mobilizing an army of lobbyists and lawyers — including a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign — to help shape proposed regulations. Long before the 2016 election, the adviser, Marc E. Elias, helped Facebook and Google request exemptions from the Federal Election Commission to existing disclosure rules, arguing that ads on the respective platforms were too small to fit disclaimers listing their sponsors. Now Mr. Elias’s high-powered Democratic election law firm, Perkins Coie, is helping the companies navigate legal and regulatory issues arising from scrutiny of the Russian-linked ads, which critics say might have been flagged by the disclaimers. In a two-front war, tech companies are targeting an election commission rule-making process that was restarted last month and a legislative effort in the Senate. “I’m not going to tell you they support this bill right now,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the lead author of the proposed Honest Ads Act. But she and her co-author, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, urged the social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content that lands on their sites, including political ads and other content meant to sow discord or chaos. With Facebook and Google alone capturing an estimated 85 percent of all digital political ads, self-policing won’t cut it, they said. “They have to realize the world has changed,” Ms. Klobuchar said. Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid television, radio and print political advertising has been subject for years. The Federal Election Commission justified the so-called internet exemption rule by declaring the internet “a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.” "
"Capt. Gabriel Lorca (Jason Isaacs), who commands the starship that gives “Star Trek: Discovery” its title, injured his eyes in a battle. This requires him to work in a dimmed light that gives his vessel the techno-noir moodiness of a dystopian dance club. In the fifth episode, his old friend Admiral Cornwell (Jayne Brook) asked him what I’d been wondering: “Why don’t you get your damn eyes fixed?” Lorca had a cagey answer — “I don’t trust doctors.” But the situation sums up “Star Trek: Discovery,” which streams Sundays on CBS All Access. It’s dark — literally and figuratively dark, in the way that ambitious dramas are nowadays. But it’s not clear if all that murk is entirely necessary or productive. “Discovery” has brought the 50-year-old franchise — transporters, replicators and all — into the present by moving into its past, a decade before the events of the original series. The series began with a visually striking two-episode head-fake, which found Capt. Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) and her First Officer, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) in familiar “Trek” territory, on a mission of exploration. It turned into a battle, as a run-in with the hostile Klingons led to Georgiou’s death and all-out war. Burnham was imprisoned on mutiny charges for her actions in the Klingon attack, then conscripted aboard Lorca’s Discovery. The ship’s scientific research has been commandeered for military purposes — especially its experimental “spore drive,” designed by the “astromycologist” Lt. Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp), which uses a galactic network of fungi. (How far “Star Trek” has come! “Traveling across the universe on mushrooms” would have signified something far different in 1967.)

"STALIN
Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941
By Stephen Kotkin
Illustrated. 1,154 pp. Penguin Press. $40. Dictators lend themselves to caricature. We label them sociopaths, paranoiacs or just victims of bad childhoods. We flatten them in order to explain our own times. Saddam Hussein is Hitler; Vladimir Putin is Peter the Great; Donald Trump is Mussolini. Sometimes, we are told, they simply defy explanation. In a 1939 radio address, Winston Churchill conceded defeat in his efforts to understand Stalin’s Soviet Union. “It is,” Churchill said, “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” Stephen Kotkin demolishes such simplicities in his monumental “Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941,” the second part of a projected three-volume biography of the Soviet leader whose reign of cruelty stretched from the mid-1920s to his death in 1953. Drawing on an astonishing array of sources, Kotkin paints a richly variegated portrait, delving into Stalin’s peculiar personality even while situating him within the trajectories of Soviet history and totalitarianism more generally. This multilayered analysis has a downside: The densely packed, 1,154-page tome — roughly a page for every four days of the period it covers — is no easy read. Yet the book unquestionably rewards the patience that it demands. Slowly but inexorably, Kotkin teases out his subject’s contradictions, revealing Stalin as both ideologue and opportunist, man of iron will and creature of the Soviet system, creep who apparently drove his wife to suicide and leader who inspired his people. And a compelling central thread holds it all together: Stalin’s unwavering determination to transform his country into a fully Communist nation capable of holding its own in a world of hostile powers. “Stalin did what acclaimed leaders do,” Kotkin writes. “He articulated and drove toward a consistent goal, in his case a powerful state backed by a unified society that eradicated capitalism and built industrial socialism.” An eminent scholar of Soviet history at Princeton University, Kotkin picks up where he left off in Volume 1 — the eve of Stalin’s 1929 decision to collectivize Soviet agriculture — and carries his story down to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union on June 21, 1941. The narrative moves forward, though, in three distinct stages that highlight different facets of Stalin’s rule. The first section focuses on the Communist Party’s drive to abolish private landholding in the Soviet countryside from 1929 into the early 1930s. Aiming to feed a growing urban work force and increase exports, Stalin’s henchmen forced peasants onto collective farms and eliminated relatively well-off peasants known as kulaks. The human consequences were, in Kotkin’s word, nothing short of an “apocalypse.” Famine resulting from social upheaval and drought killed between five million and seven million people, while five million kulaks were arrested, deported or murdered.

"With recent powerful hurricanes having battered Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands and the West still coping with widely destructive wildfires, the need for action on climate change has never been more obvious. It’s going to take a strenuous, persistent effort at all levels, including international cooperation; federal, state and local action, and private-sector commitments and follow-through. Leaders in the auto industry get this, if their public comments are any indication. This month, Mary Barra, the chief executive, of General Motors, announced her company’s plans to move toward a zero-emissions future with new electric vehicle options. In a letter accompanying the company’s 2016-17 sustainability report, Jim Hackett, the chief executive of Ford, and William Ford, the automaker’s executive chairman, declared their company was “absolutely committed” to reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency. In an increasingly climate-conscious global market, these industry leaders assure us they’re part of the solution. And they need to be: The transportation sector is now the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the United States. But the efforts of the auto industry’s lobbyists in Washington tell a different story. They are trying to undermine one of the country’s most successful policies to fight global warming: the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards that are designed to roughly double the miles per gallon of our passenger car fleet by 2025. G.M., Ford and other automakers agreed to these standards in 2010, but now industry allies in Congress have introduced legislation that would weaken them, and the Trump administration has “reopened” these standards for review, an ominous first step to potentially gutting them and stalling progress on cleaner cars and a healthier environment. As a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and a former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, we know firsthand how important and challenging it is to build good public policies — and why it’s shortsighted to roll back a policy that’s working. According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, since the standards went into effect in 2010, they have saved drivers more than $47 billion on fuel. If we stay the course, the benefits are enormous: By 2030, we’ll cut our oil use by 2.4 million barrels every day, and drivers will save $6,000 over the life of their vehicles. These standards will also reduce global warming emissions by 280 million metric tons and are projected to create 650,000 jobs. "
"It isn’t hard to guess who John McCain had in mind when, in a speech on Monday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia — the finest speech of his storied political career — he denounced the “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.” It’s easy to guess, too, the names of the Senate and House Republicans Stephen Bannon had in mind when, at a Values Voter Summit in Washington over the weekend, he declared “a season of war against the G.O.P. establishment.” McCain and Bannon are the antipodes of the Republican Party. The institutionalist versus the insurgent. The internationalist versus the America Firster. The maverick versus the ideologue. Above all, the hedgehog versus the honey badger. The hedgehog, said the Greek poet Archilochus, knows one big thing. McCain knows honor. He refused early release from prison camp in Hanoi to save his honor. He reproved Republican voters for calling Barack Obama an Arab in 2008 to save his party’s honor. He championed the surge in Iraq when it was least popular, to save the country’s honor. He paid for all of it and will be remembered as a giant among dwarves because of it. Right now, McCain, his allies and their ideas appear to be a waning force in the Republican Party. They are RINOs, cucks, and “globalists.” Many of them, like Tennessee’s Bob Corker, will retire rather than face bruising primary challenges from the ever-farther right. On Monday McCain called America “the land of the immigrant’s dream,” and said: “We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil.” To a large and growing segment of the G.O.P., which thinks magnanimity is for losers, these statements amount to a form of treason. The honey badger, by contrast, will do anything to get what it wants. It is wily, nasty and has as much use for honor as a pornographer has for dress. In the 2016 presidential campaign, according to biographer Joshua Green, Bannon treated white supremacists as useful fellow travelers and urged Donald Trump to persist in what seemed to many to be his use of anti-Jewish tropes. Later he waged a smear campaign against H.R. McMaster on the grounds that the national security adviser was anti-Israel. "
"The rising stock market has recently become one of President Trump’s favorite tropes. “Stock market has increased by 5.2 trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25 percent increase,” he tweeted on Oct. 16. Yet, for most Americans, the larger issue is that this upturn is seldom felt. An equity inequity has driven America’s wealth gap to historic levels. Eighty percent of Americans own only 8 percent of the nation’s stocks. One-third of Americans have saved nothing for their retirement. The scale of the challenge calls for ambitious initiatives to put asset-building power and retirement security into the hands of all Americans. Instead, Republicans and Democrats have played to type, even when all evidence points to the failure of both the traditional left and the traditional right solutions. If anyone wonders why Americans have lost faith in government, the sad saga of the myRA program tells the tale. The recent announcement by Treasury Department that it will shut down this Obama-era program marked the end of a story that began, as is so often the case in government, with the best intentions. The Obama administration announced the myRA program in January 2014 as a no-fee, no-minimum-investment version of a Roth individual retirement account to address the real challenges of Americans without access to an employer-based 401(k) retirement program. The myRA sounded like a good idea. Qualifying workers could put up to $5,500 a year into the account — or $6,500 if they were over 50 years old — which would be invested in government bonds, guaranteeing a modest but dependable return.

"It is a commonly accepted rule among those who are in the business of argument, especially online, that he or she who invokes Adolf Hitler, either in oratory or essays, automatically forfeits the argument. The reference is deemed far too extreme, too explosive, too far beyond rational correlation. No matter how bad a present-day politician, not one of them has charted or is charting a course to exterminate millions of innocent people as an act of ethnic cleansing. Hitler stands alone in this regard, without rival, a warning to the world about how evil and lethal human beings can be, a warning that what he did can never be allowed again. That said, there are strategies that Hitler used to secure power and rise — things that allowed his murderous reign — that can teach us about political theory and practice. And very reasonable and sage comparisons can be drawn between Hitler’s strategies and those of others. One of those lessons is about how purposeful lying can be effectively used as propaganda. The forthcoming comparison isn’t to Hitler the murderer, but to Hitler the liar. According to James Murphy’s translation of Hitler’s “Mein Kampf”: “In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.” "
"The new bipartisan health proposal is far from a cure-all for Obamacare’s problems, but if it passed it would send health insurers a message they have sought all year: that it’s safe to stay in the marketplaces. Insurers have already signed contracts and are making final arrangements to sell their products in time for next year’s enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1. Though the proposal would guarantee payments to health insurers that President Trump canceled last week, and restore funding for Obamacare advertising that his Health and Human Services Department slashed, those changes would probably come too late to lower insurance prices or increase sign-ups significantly. But the deal proposed this week by Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, and Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, has reassured insurance executives. It is aimed at quieting nervous markets and making clear that the Obamacare market will exist beyond this year. “It’s the first signal we’ve seen in a long time to insurers that the government is not going to actively disrupt the market,” said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. While two years of funding may not be critical to the market’s stability, it shows “there is some future market,” he said. A widely circulated draft of the proposed legislation has attracted both compliments and scorn from the president. The legislation is intended to lower premiums and encourage insurer participation. It would guarantee federal payments to insurance companies to offer plans to low-income individuals that reduce their out-of-pocket costs through 2019. The loss of those payments has sent insurance premiums soaring, and is likely to increase federal spending on a different form of Obamacare subsidy, used to help middle-income Americans pay their insurance premiums. It would make it easier for state governments to tweak Obamacare’s rules on how they run their markets, easing the way for more experiments. The draft bill would make the application process for such “state innovation waivers” easier to complete, but would still require that the state plans cover a similar number of residents and offer insurance with “comparable affordability” to plans established under the Affordable Care Act.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump has picked Joseph J. Simons, a veteran antitrust lawyer who has represented tech giants like Microsoft, to lead the Federal Trade Commission at a time of broad bipartisan concern over corporate consolidation and big deals in the waiting, the White House said Thursday. Mr. Trump has also chosen Noah Phillips, chief counsel for Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Rohit Chopra, a fellow at a consumer advocacy group, to fill the remaining two seats at the agency, said Natalie M. Strom, assistant press secretary at the White House. The consumer protection and competition agency has been led by just two commissioners over the last 10 months. Mr. Trump’s other leading antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, was recently confirmed to lead competition cases at the Justice Department. The timing of the official nominations is unclear. They will be reviewed by Congress but are expected to be approved. Under Mr. Simons, who led the competition bureau of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration, the agency is expected take a free-markets and conservative approach to antitrust issues, maintaining decades-long interpretations of competition laws that put consumer welfare and the efficiencies of markets at the center of enforcement actions and merger reviews. But the traditional antitrust perspective could be tested by new skepticism over the power of big internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. Politicians from both parties, and many consumer interest advocates and academics, have called for greater restraints on tech companies that have quickly expanded their dominance in digital advertising, commerce and public opinion, as seen with the role social media firms like Facebook and Twitter played in the 2016 presidential election.

"Chris Long, the Eagles defensive end, will donate his entire salary this season to charity. Long announced this week that he would send his last 10 game checks to educational charities in the three cities where he has played, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Boston. This season he said his first six checks would go to to scholarships at a private school in his hometown, Charlottesville, Va. Long, 32, is to make a base salary of $1 million this season. —- N.F.C. Championship Game: Eagles Dominate Vikings to Reach Super Bowl LII —- “I’m playing the entire 2017 N.F.L. season without collecting income because I believe that education is the best gateway to a better tomorrow for everyone in America,” Long said in a statement. He told The Associated Press on Wednesday, “I think we can all agree that equity in education can help effect change that we all want to see in this country.” Long, the son of the Hall of Famer and broadcaster Howie Long, has been involved in charity and activism for some time. He started a foundation two years ago that supports causes including assuring access to clean water worldwide, fighting homelessness, supporting veterans and helping children in need. Long, who is white, drew attention this season for putting his arm around his black teammate Malcolm Jenkins, who raised his fist during the national anthem to protest discrimination and police brutality. A member of the champion Patriots last season when they won the Super Bowl, Long was among several members of the team who chose to stay away from its White House visit with President Trump. “Some people are tired of hearing me tweet because they want me to stick to football but I like to use social media like I was a regular guy because I think I am,” Long told NBC Sports Philadelphia in August. “I don’t tell people to stick to their job when they want to talk politics.” Referring to neo-Nazis marching in his hometown, he said: “For me, being from Charlottesville, no one wants to see you sit idly by and watch that stuff happen and not say anything. And I wish there was more categorical denial from some very important people in this country who have had the opportunity to strike it down but didn’t.” "
"Neither of them mentioned President Trump by name but two of his predecessors emerged from political seclusion on Thursday to deliver what sounded like pointed rebukes of the current occupant of the Oval Office and the forces of division that propelled him to power. In separate and unrelated appearances, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both warned that the United States was being torn apart by ancient hatreds that should have been consigned to history long ago and called for addressing economic anxiety through common purpose. While not directly addressing Mr. Trump, neither left much doubt whom and what they had in mind. Mr. Bush, the last Republican to hold the White House, spoke out at a conference he convened in New York to support democracy, noting that America first had to “recover our own identity” in the face of challenges to its most basic ideals. While Mr. Trump seeks to raise barriers to trade and newcomers, lashing out at targets with relish, Mr. Bush defended immigration and free trade, denounced nationalism and bigotry and bemoaned what he called the “casual cruelty” of current public discourse. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Mr. Bush said. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” Mr. Obama was more circumspect, returning to the campaign trail for the first time since leaving office to support Democrats running for governor in New Jersey and Virginia. His speeches were mostly get-out-the-vote pleas, but he defended his record on health care at a time when Mr. Trump has been trying to dismantle it, and he, too, pointed to the social, economic and racial schisms cleaving American society. “What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before that dates back centuries,” Mr. Obama told a campaign rally for Philip D. Murphy in Newark. “Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed. That has folks looking 50 years back. It’s the 21st century, not the 19th century. Come on!” "
"The other morning, after too little sleep and with too much to do, Jenna Bush Hager found herself dragging, and kicked herself for it. “I almost called myself Low-Energy Jenna,” she told me. Ring a bell? Low-Energy Jeb was Donald Trump’s taunting nickname for her uncle during the 2016 campaign. I asked her and her twin sister, Barbara, what they made of that. “A bit like bullying on the playground,” Jenna said. “We’d seen it before, but we were in the first grade.” She smiled, then winced, wondering aloud if she’d just been too political, given her job on the “Today” show. “I don’t know,” Barbara said. “I’m not with NBC.” Jenna the irrepressible blonde. Barbara the reserved brunette. In that one exchange, the only two people alive who are both children and grandchildren of American presidents played to the stereotypes that they were assigned long ago. But not during the rest of a recent lunch near their homes in downtown Manhattan. It was Barbara who told me with little hesitation that she’d voted for Hillary Clinton and Jenna who demurred. Jenna’s answers were often the thoughtful mini-essays while Barbara naughtily thrust her smartphone at me to display the text messages that their father, the second President Bush, routinely sends them. Those missives included memes: a cartoon bunny that blew kisses before the words “I Love You” exploded like a Roman candle; a snippet of Jason Alexander as George Costanza in “Seinfeld.” There were long, silly strings of colorful, silly icons. From George W. Bush, who had always worked so hard on that Texas swagger? "

"WASHINGTON — John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, delivered a searing, personal defense of President Trump’s phone call this week to the widow of a slain Army soldier, describing on Thursday the trauma of learning about his own son’s death in Afghanistan and calling the criticism of Mr. Trump’s condolences unfair. In a public relations mission that was part emotional catharsis and part political attack, Mr. Kelly lashed out at Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, for publicizing the call between Mr. Trump and Myeshia Johnson, whose husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, was one of four American soldiers killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. Mr. Kelly accused Ms. Wilson — who was in a car with Ms. Johnson when Mr. Trump called and is a longtime family friend — of being a publicity-seeking opportunist. He said that the congresswoman’s willingness to breach the confidentiality of Mr. Trump’s words is evidence of a broader decline in the values of an American society that no longer treats women, religion, “life” or Gold Star families as sacred. “It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation — absolutely stuns me,” Mr. Kelly said during a somber, 18-minute appearance in the White House briefing room. He said that he was so upset by Ms. Wilson’s appearances on TV news shows that he had to collect his thoughts by walking through the graves at Arlington National Cemetery for more than an hour. Late Thursday night, Mr. Trump assailed Ms. Wilson in a tweet, accusing her of listening “SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!” "
"JERUSALEM — With Egypt brokering a reconciliation between the two rival Palestinian factions, President Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East visited Cairo on Thursday to help move those talks along while trying to ensure that the Egyptians do not take them in a direction unacceptable to the United States and Israel. Hamas, the militant Islamic group that seized power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 and has run it ever since, agreed in Cairo last week to return administrative control of the impoverished coastal territory to the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. The Oct. 12 agreement calls for the Palestinian Authority to lift sanctions that it imposed on Gaza this year to pressure Hamas by cutting electricity supplies to a few hours a day and slashing payment of government salaries. Hamas, in turn, is to give the authority control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, opening up a critical lifeline for imports and for outside travel. But the pact was really an agreement to start talking: The more troublesome issues between Hamas and Mr. Abbas’s Fatah faction — including the merger of two separate work forces in Gaza, and what is to become of the estimated 25,000 Hamas fighters, their arsenal of rockets and network of tunnels — were left for later. For the Trump administration, which has hopes of achieving a grand Israeli-Palestinian bargain, Egypt’s efforts with Hamas and Fatah provided a potentially crucial opening to solve the problem of Gaza, which many see as a prerequisite to reviving the peace process. A key question is whether the talks in Cairo will give Hamas, which the United States designates as a terrorist organization, influence over a consolidated Palestinian government of both the West Bank and Gaza Strip — and how much.

"A wave of asylum seekers entering Canada this year has exacerbated a backlog of refugee claims that the government is struggling to manage, leaving tens of thousands of people stuck in bureaucratic limbo even as they try to build new lives. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board says it has a backlog of 40,700 cases. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have crossed illegally into Quebec from the United States since July alone. But the board has the money and staff to process just 24,000 cases a year, meaning that many people will have to wait around 16 months for their case to be heard. “The strain on the organization to handle this many people’s hearings is enormous,” Shereen Benzvy Miller, the head of the board’s refugee protection division, told a parliamentary immigrations committee this month. “The math is clear,” she added. “Unless you put more resources to this problem, then it takes longer time to schedule, so there will be longer wait times.” The delay also increases the amount of money Canada spends on asylum seekers’ medical care, education and public assistance, said Richard Kurland, a former national chairman of the Canadian Bar Association’s citizenship and immigration section. “The longer they stay, the more Canadians pay,” he said. The immigration board set up a special task force in August to respond to the influx of asylum seekers who crossed illegally into Quebec. By the end of September, the task force had finalized around 300 claims, rejecting about 50 percent of them. "
"At the start of a City Council meeting in Ann Arbor, Mich., this week, the 11 elected officials who represent the city’s residents turned to the flag for the Pledge of Allegiance. Seven of them stood. Four of them knelt on one knee. It was the latest manifestation of a gesture that has spread in the United States in the last year, migrating from its first appearance on the football field to concert stages, schools and sports arenas, even crossing borders to places including soccer fields in Germany, where athletes have knelt as a protest against racism. But along the way, the question about what it means — and what it does not mean — has been continually challenged. Some supporters defend it as a peaceful way to object to racial and social injustice. Others say it shows a lack of patriotism or support for those in the military who have fought to defend the country. The controversy over the pose reached the White House, where President Trump called it an act of “disrespect” during the playing of the national anthem. As the gesture became the subject of national conversation, it also took root on the local level. In New York City on Sept. 27, 16 City Council members knelt in front of City Hall. On Oct. 10, more than a dozen people knelt during the Pledge of Allegiance during a San Diego City Council meeting, partly over incidents of racial profiling there, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. At the Ann Arbor council meeting on Monday, there was general business at hand: medical marijuana licensing, whether a deer cull would affect property owners, and locations for solar panels. "
"Two weeks ago, my smartphone shut down because of a low battery as I was about to board a flight to Europe. That seemed odd, given that I had barely used it that day. I plugged it in on the plane, but seven hours later, it still wasn’t functioning. When I arrived at my hotel I tried a different charger, to no avail. The phone was dead — terminally so, it turned out. I hadn’t brought a laptop, so I had no access to the internet or email. I had no camera, no guidebooks, no maps. I took a deep breath and decided to make the best of it. I’m hardly a smartphone addict. I rarely look at social media. I had happily traveled in Europe in the years before cellphones. I decided to emulate the movie star Eddie Redmayne, who last year said he had given up his smartphone in order to live “in the moment.” For the next 10 days I lived without my phone or any other connection to the digital world. There were indeed many compensations. But it was hard to shake a free-floating anxiety that some disaster loomed. (How would I retrieve my return flight reservations from a nonworking cellphone?) Lately the big internet companies have come under a barrage of criticism for invading privacy, carrying fake news, spreading hate messages (and selling ads against them) and undermining American democracy. What I learned is that, for better or worse, they have already so changed the world that life without them is all but impossible outside a monastery. Road maps, a mainstay of my pre-cellphone trips to Europe, were nowhere to be found, nor were the bookstores that used to sell them. The rental car agency in Milan offered a guide for getting out of the airport, but that was about it. Everyone assumes you have access to Google Maps. "
"To the Editor: Re “Condolence Call to Widow Ignites Trump Imbroglio” (front page, Oct. 19): The fact that President Trump did not acknowledge the deaths of four servicemen in Niger until asked about it 12 days later was certain to raise legitimate questions regarding his sensitivity. But Mr. Trump seems to have no sense of when and how to put controversy to rest and when not to be combative. Whether it’s North Korea, the National Football League, Puerto Rico or now condolences, the president can be relied on to maximize and sustain controversy. His job as commander in chief is to dampen controversy, not incite. ROGER HIRSCHBERG
BONDVILLE, VT. To the Editor: Your report of another presidential misspeak degrades your journalistic standard. Truth be told, it’s not a front-page story, just a gossipy attempt to satisfy a much larger quest. In 2016 the media warned voters that Donald Trump was unfit to be president. The voters didn’t listen. The Times and other media have never stopped taking every opportunity to validate that Mr. Trump is not just unfit, but despicable as well. The current reporting model feeds the nation’s frustration about and loathing of Mr. Trump. Confidence in our system of government is already wounded — we allowed a train wreck to become the president. Anti-Trump venting as the reporting model is tiresome and will become intolerable for another three years. We made a big mistake, and you remind us of that daily. It’s time for a reset. Stick with the big stories, and stop dignifying Mr. Trump by reporting his insults, lies and stupid phone calls. WILLIAM GOLDMAN
PALOS VERDES ESTATES, CALIF. To the Editor: The name of “the woman” is Myeshia Johnson. While watching the television coverage of “him,” taking no responsibility for his actions regarding his phone call to the recently widowed Mrs. Johnson, I did not once hear him refer to her by name. “Had a very nice conversation with the woman.” “Sounded like a lovely woman.” He is alleged to have not even known the name of her husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, during his phone call to Mrs. Johnson. First he disrespects a fallen American soldier, then compounds the insult by not referring to his widow by her name and denying accounts of the conversation. The guy is not only a supremely insensitive liar; he can’t even lie competently. PAUL IREMONGER, SEATTLE To the Editor: I agree with the expert quoted in your article that President Trump was not purposefully disrespectful, but merely clumsy, when speaking to Sgt. La David T. Johnson’s widow. He is simply inarticulate. And, yes, he lacks the kind of intelligence that promotes tact, sensitivity and good taste. But, hey, nobody’s perfect! GILBERT SCHECHTMAN

Michael Warren in The Weekly Standard: Mr. Warren gives President Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to interpreting what he intended in his comments to the widow of Sgt. La David T.

In 2004, her father, a Marine Corps helicopter pilot, was shot down in Iraq. She explains how she received a letter from President George W.

Johnson sounded “horrible in isolation,” there’s no way to properly judge without hearing the entire phone call in context. Moreover, Mr. Lowry believes that controversies over condolence calls should be entirely left “out of our poisonous political debate.” Read more » "
"WASHINGTON — Almost no one on or off Capitol Hill has seen the tax overhaul bill that Republicans are drafting behind closed doors. Congressional staff members have not settled on many key details. Yet party leaders are preparing to move ahead on a timeline even more aggressive than their unsuccessful attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The swift pace to complete, release and quickly vote on a tax cut is aimed at leaving little time for the type of dissent that has scuttled previous tax proposals. Senators approved a budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year on Thursday night, setting up a rapid series of hearings and votes with the aim of getting a bill to President Trump by Christmas. Republicans have been meeting for weeks in closed-door sessions to debate details of the tax plan, including two half-day retreats for House members late last month. House leaders will hold two smaller-group sessions next week, scheduled to last three to four hours each. The speed is striking — and strategic — for tax legislation that lobbyists believe could span 1,000 pages. Republicans hope the breakneck pace will help hold their narrow Senate majority together against what will almost certainly be a deluge of lobbying and Democratic criticism. The last major tax overhaul, which passed in 1986, took nearly 11 months from introduction to presidential signature. "

He knew what the possibilities were, because we were at war.” He said that Mr. Trump was trying to make the same point in conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson this week.

"WASHINGTON — Mitch McConnell and Lamar Alexander go way back. The two Southern Republicans met in Washington in 1969 when Mr. Alexander was a promising young aide at the Nixon White House and Mr. McConnell an up-and-coming legislative assistant to Senator Marlow W. Cook of Kentucky. The story goes that Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. suggested to Mr. Alexander, his fellow Tennessean, that he should look up Mr. McConnell, that he was a “smart young man and I think you’d like him.” A nearly 50-year friendship and political alliance was born. In his book “The Long Game,” Mr. McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, says of Mr. Alexander: “Lamar would go on to become one of my closest confidantes and a very good friend.” Not many people are considered a close, let alone the closest, confidant of the notoriously reticent leader. But deep friendship aside, Mr. McConnell will be extremely cautious in moving ahead with the health care compromise that Mr. Alexander struck with Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, in an effort to stabilize the insurance exchanges for those buying coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And considering that President Trump is giving mixed signals on the proposal and that many Republicans in both the Senate and House are already opposed to it, the outlook for the rare bipartisan deal is murky at best. With Mr. McConnell’s blessing, Mr. Alexander engaged in a concerted effort to find a compromise with Ms. Murray, the senior Democrat on the health committee that Mr. Alexander leads. The goal was for Congress to officially appropriate the subsidies paid to make insurance more affordable for lower-income Americans while giving states more freedom in regulating insurance — an approach favored by Republicans. The subsidies, estimated at $7 billion this year, were challenged in federal court by the House in 2014 and found unconstitutional because Congress had not approved them. Mr. Trump announced last week that he was cutting them off and Mr. Alexander said he feared millions of people could now find insurance out of their financial reach. "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate’s proposed budget blueprint stretches 93 pages, sketching out trillions of dollars in spending over the coming decade on areas ranging from the military to Medicare. But perhaps all that really matters — and why senators are preparing to stay up late on Thursday night — is a few sentences buried deep into the document. A pair of congressional committees, it says, are to come up with “changes in laws within its jurisdiction” that would increase the deficit by not more than $1.5 trillion over a decade. On those few cryptic words rest the success or failure of President Trump’s top legislative goal, overhauling the tax code. (Another parliamentary instruction could pave the way for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling — another potential flash point down the line.) The rest, even Republicans admit, is filler. “Everything in here can be ignored, basically,” Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia and a member of the Budget Committee, said at a meeting of the panel this month. He described the budget process as “a fraud being perpetrated on the American people.” The budget resolution does do one big thing: It unlocks special procedures that will allow Congress to pass a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul with only Republican votes. It is the same approach that Republicans used in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. "
"WASHINGTON — The envelope was innocuous enough, addressed to me at the “NY Times” in New York, though some soul in the mail department had obviously opened it, marked it “personal” and forwarded it to our Washington office. It was May 3 — five months ago. I was strangely happy to receive the letter, since most hate mail comes via email and Twitter, and handwritten (or hand-typed) letters — at least the ones that aren’t from people in correctional facilities — usually say nice things. Wrong. “Dear Helene: You have the worst wardrobe of all the newscasters, male or female, on all of the networks and cable channels. Could you PLEASE get some help and start wearing jackets to cover up your fat arms? Could you not wear beach wear on Sunday a.m. talk shows? What are you thinking? Get a consultant to help you, please!!” It was signed: “A viewer who is driven insane by your attire.” What the heck? Okay, so I am not Tyra Banks, but I have always considered myself a fashionista by the low standards of the print journalism profession. That was one of the reasons I went the newspaper route instead of TV. I had taken a TV course in college and realized quickly that the time I was spending working to modulate my voice, put on lipstick and pour myself into shift dresses was time away from actual reporting. I quickly scurried back to print, where I — alongside my kinky locks, dangly earrings and cargo pants paired with Prada-outlet-purchased heels — was not only accepted but viewed as fashionable. Except now, as more print newspaper reporters are showing up on TV talking about stories, new avenues of criticism are opening up. It’s not just emails complaining that I spelled “sergeant” wrong or called a Marine “soldier.” (I cover the Pentagon so there’s a lot of that in my bloopers file.) "
"LONDON — An opposition lawmaker called on the British government on Thursday to investigate suspicions of Russian interference in Britain’s referendum on quitting the European Union, adding that there were “questions” about Arron Banks, one of the chief financial backers of the leave campaign. Speaking in Parliament, the lawmaker, Ben Bradshaw of the Labour Party, said there was “widespread concern over foreign, and particularly Russian, interference in Western democracies.” He asked for assurances that “all the resources spent in the referendum campaign were from permissible sources.” Mr. Bradshaw’s intervention follows the publication of what he called “very worrying” reports “on the role of dark money” in the plebiscite, which was held in June 2016 and in which 52 percent of those who voted opted to leave. Those who opposed Britain’s withdrawal, or Brexit, argued during the referendum that it would delight Moscow by weakening the European Union, which placed sanctions on Russia. But no links to Russian money have been proved. The investigative reports into the financing of the leave campaign were published by the Open Democracy website and included a detailed examination of Mr. Banks’s finances. Mr. Banks is a friend and political ally of Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and one of President Trump’s biggest supporters in Britain. A businessman who made his money from insurance, Mr. Banks is thought to have spent about $12 million in cash, loans and other support for Brexit causes. He was the primary supporter of Leave.EU, for which Mr. Farage campaigned. "
"YANGON, Myanmar — Nearly a decade into Myanmar’s transition out of military rule, the country’s once-celebrated transition toward democracy is hardening into something very different from what activists and world leaders had hoped for. Citizens select their leaders, but without the robust institutions or norms like pluralism, universal rights or tolerance necessary for democracy to function. They express, in surveys and social media, desire for a strongman-style leader and raw majority rule. Democracy, many say, should be guided by religious strictures and nationalism. The military’s ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group, is popular, as are social controls against journalists and minorities. The civilian state, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is rapidly centralizing power as checks and balances erode. It is growing oppressive in some areas and weak in others, ceding public space to extremists. Meanwhile, the military still controls important government functions and a perpetual quota of Parliament seats. The country appears to be converging on a democratic-authoritarian hybrid, formally known as illiberal democracy, which often resembles mob rule. It is a version of majority rule that excludes minorities, curtails freedoms and governs arbitrarily. "

KELLY, White House chief of staff: Well, thanks a lot. And it is a more serious note, so I just wanted to perhaps make more of a statement than an — give more of an explanation in what amounts to be a traditional press interaction. Most Americans don’t know what happens when we lose one of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, our Coast Guardsmen in combat. So let me tell you what happens: Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud, puts them on a helicopter as a routine, and sends them home. Their first stop along the way is when they’re packed in ice, typically at the airhead. And then they’re flown to, usually, Europe where they’re then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the medals that they’ve earned, the emblems of their service, and then puts them on another airplane linked up with a casualty officer escort that takes them home. A very, very good movie to watch, if you haven’t ever seen it, is “Taking Chance,” where this is done in a movie — HBO setting. Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me, and it’s worth seeing that if you’ve never seen it. So that’s the process. While that’s happening, a casualty officer typically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on. And then he knocks on the door; typically a mom and dad will answer, a wife. And if there is a wife, this is happening in two different places; if the parents are divorced, three different places. And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member and stays with that family until — well, for a long, long time, even after the internment. So that’s what happens. "
