"Russia’s Parliament approved legislation on Wednesday that could require foreign media organizations operating in Russia to label news they produce the work of a “foreign agent,” the latest step in the unraveling of relations since the United States accused Russia of meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The measure will become law if passed by the Russian Senate and signed by President Vladimir V. Putin. Over the weekend, however, Mr. Putin expressed some doubts, saying the rule may go too far. The proposed new regulation is evidently intended as retaliation for reporting requirements imposed by the Department of Justice on the American affiliate of RT, the Russian state-run TV news outlet that American intelligence agencies say is a propaganda tool of the Kremlin. Last week, acting in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a 1938 law that was aimed at Nazi propaganda organs, the Justice Department required RT to identify itself as a “foreign agent.” Under that law, foreign agents are required to file reports on the sources of their funding and on all activities intended to influence a lawmaker or other government representative. It is not clear what that would mean for RT’s reporters. The law is typically applied today to lobbyists representing foreign governments or state-owned companies, though some foreign state-run news outlets have been required to register. Pressure to take action against RT grew after American intelligence agencies accused it of playing a role in what they say was a Kremlin-directed campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton and elect President Trump in 2016. The proposed Russian law appears far broader in its potential application, covering all foreign media organizations, not only state-run outlets. That has news organizations scrambling to see how it would affect their operations, and Russian rights groups are fearful of another crackdown on freedom of speech. "
"LONDON — “Reality is actually harder to work with, because it’s less believable,” the composer Nico Muhly said in a recent interview at the Coliseum theater here. Mr. Muhly’s first two operas, “Dark Sisters” and “Two Boys,” were based on real-life events. But his new one, “Marnie,” which opens at English National Opera on Saturday and comes to the Metropolitan Opera next season, takes its inspiration from a novel: Winston Graham’s story about an enigmatic, identity-changing, kleptomaniac young woman, the source for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1964 film with an icy Tippi Hedren. “This was the first time I was adapting from fiction,” said Mr. Muhly. “ ‘Marnie’ was so attractive because you could make a psychological profile without the constraints of a real person.” Directed by the Tony Award winner Michael Mayer (“Spring Awakening”), with a libretto by the playwright Nicholas Wright and starring the elegant mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, “Marnie” has high stakes for Mr. Muhly and the two companies producing it. New operas are artistic and financial risks, and the gamble is particularly significant for English National Opera, which has suffered funding cuts and major management upheaval over the last two years. But Mr. Muhly, 36, has built a reputation and fan base that stretch across traditional genre lines. In college he worked as an assistant to Philip Glass, and he has collaborated with pop artists like Björk and Anohni, the songwriter and singer formerly known as Antony Hegarty, while producing a considerable and well-regarded oeuvre of orchestral and chamber works, as well as numerous scores for dance.

"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — As an evangelical Christian, an Alabamian and a Republican, I’m ashamed of Roy Moore and upset that so many people are determined to defend him against sexual assault allegations, no matter what. I’m even more bothered, however, by what Mr. Moore’s popularity says about the sorry state of evangelical Christianity. Evangelicalism is a Christian movement committed to the authority of the Bible, the necessity of personal conversion and evangelism and the exaltation of Jesus Christ, especially his death on the cross. (I’m paraphrasing a definition offered by the British theologian Alister McGrath.) Evangelicals believe, among other things, that Jesus offered himself as a “full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice” for the sins of the world. After his resurrection, he ascended into heaven, and he will come again to judge the living and the dead, and he will reign “forever and ever.” What does this have to with Roy Moore, the Republican running for Senate in Alabama? To begin with, sin is a problem from which no one is exempt. If God’s love required the suffering and death of the Son of God in order to redeem us, we should not underestimate the consequences of sin in our own lives. The world is not divided into “good people” and “bad people”; to quote St. Paul, “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Or, as the Russian novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote, “the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either, but right through every human heart, and through all human hearts.” It is thus wrong to attack one’s critics, as Mr. Moore did recently on Twitter, as “the forces of evil” and attribute their questions about serious allegations to “a spiritual battle.” It is wrong to excuse one’s own moral failings while rushing to judgment over the sins of others, as he also did. We are to love and forgive our enemies, as God has loved and forgiven us. "
"The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Wednesday that he would leave the federal agency this month, removing a major opponent to the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle business regulations and unfetter Wall Street. As the bureau’s first director, Richard Cordray, a Democrat appointed by President Barack Obama, has been an active watchdog whose role took on outsize significance in an increasingly partisan Washington. To many Republicans, he embodied the kind of overaggressive policing that they contend hamstrings businesses and quashes innovation. To Democrats, he was a champion of the public, fighting predatory companies and abusive practices that rip off ordinary people. Established six years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the agency has unusually broad power to combat abuses in a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans. Mr. Cordray, 58, pursued that mission with zeal. Under his leadership, the bureau extracted nearly $12 billion in refunds and canceled debts for 29 million consumers. It cracked down on abusive debt collectors, strengthened protections for mortgage borrowers and created a complaints system that helped hundreds of thousands of people resolve disputes with financial companies. Just hours after Mr. Cordray told his staff of his planned departure, the agency sued a debt collector that it said had broken state usury laws by charging illegally high interest rates. “The agency has gotten a lot done,” said Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a liberal advocacy group. “The mission of the bureau and the work it has done is incredibly popular, across party lines, with the public.” "
"WASHINGTON — Uncertainty gripped the Senate on Wednesday over efforts to pass a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut after a Wisconsin Republican became the first senator in his party to declare that he could not vote for the tax bill as written, and other senators expressed serious misgivings over the cost and effect on the middle class. The House is set on Thursday to pass its own version of the tax bill, which would cut taxes by more than $1.4 trillion over 10 years and broadly rewrite the business tax code. But as with the health care debate earlier this year, the Senate emerged as the inconstant ally in President Trump’s pursuit of a major legislative accomplishment in his first year. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, came out against both chambers’ tax plans on Wednesday, saying that the bills favored corporations over small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals. “These businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind,” he said in a statement. “Unfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions.” Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee have voiced their own concerns about the tax overhaul and have not committed to voting for the tax bill. “I’m still working with folks to see if there’s some way to be assured as it relates to the deficit issue that we’re not going to create harm,” Mr. Corker said. “There’s other senators who themselves want to ensure that we’re doing something to strengthen our country relative to the deficits.” "
"President Trump appeared to offer his condolences for the wrong mass shooting on Tuesday in a late-night Twitter post, which was later deleted. “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived,” Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post at 11:34 p.m., soon after arriving back in the United States from his 12-day trip through Asia. That attack occurred more than a week ago, on Nov. 5, when a gunman opened fire at a church, killing 26 and wounding 20 others. Another mass shooting took place early Tuesday, as a gunman in California opened fire at an elementary school and other locations, killing at least four people and injuring several others before he was fatally shot by the police. It was not immediately clear whether the error was caused by a sloppy cut-and-paste job by a jet-lagged president or some other issue. A spokesman for the White House did not respond to emails seeking an explanation. But Tuesday’s tweet was very similar to a Twitter post by Mr. Trump on the day of the Texas shooting. Critics on Twitter pointed out that the F.B.I. and law enforcement were in fact needed in California. Tuesday’s shooting in Northern California was the 17th mass shooting this month, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • China is sending a top diplomat to North Korea for the first time in two years. There was no guarantee of a meeting with the leader, Kim Jong-un, but Chinese experts said the envoy would have been sent to urge the North to enter nuclear negotiations and to convey the discussions President Xi Jinping held with President Trump during his Beijing visit last week. We also looked at the so-called truce village, above, where a North Korean defector on Monday made a bold dash through gunfire. _____ • Rex Tillerson, the U.S. secretary of state, speaking in Myanmar, called the Rohingya crisis “horrific” and said it involved “crimes against humanity.” Mr. Tillerson urged the nation’s military leader and Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of its civilian government, to conduct a credible investigation into the violence that has driven more than 615,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh since late August. "
"After the financial crisis in 2008, the Obama administration turned one of the banking industry’s friendliest regulators into one of its toughest. But that agency is now starting to look like its old self — and becoming a vital player in the Trump administration’s campaign to roll back regulations. The regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the nation’s biggest banks, has made it easier for Wall Street to offer high-interest, payday-style loans. It has softened a policy for punishing banks suspected of discriminatory lending. And it has clashed with another federal regulator that pushed to give consumers greater power to sue financial institutions. The shift, detailed in government memos and interviews with current and former regulators, is unfolding without congressional action or a rule-making process. It is happening instead through directives issued at the stroke of a pen by the agency’s interim leader, Keith A. Noreika, who — like the nominee to fill the post going forward — has deep connections to the industry. Even in his few months on the job, Mr. Noreika has made the new direction clear. At a meeting with staff members over the summer, he declared that the agency was returning to what he called its natural state, according to one of those who attended. The shift could help revive some of the policies and practices that arose on the agency’s watch amid the financial crisis and banking scandals of a decade ago — and that led congressional investigators to accuse it of “systemic failures.” The recent changes under Mr. Noreika are part of a concerted effort by the Trump administration to unwind Obama-era rules and install a set of regulators who come from the financial industry itself.

"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. BONN, Germany — If world leaders are angry at the United States for rejecting the Paris climate change agreement, few at United Nations climate talks here are openly showing it. Delegates from the largest industrial countries to the smallest island states are tiptoeing around the single largest topic of discussion here — the American retreat from leadership on climate change and the Trump administration’s moves to undermine domestic global warming policy and international climate diplomacy. President Emmanuel Macron of France on Wednesday challenged Europe to “replace America” in financing the United Nations climate change science body, though he did not directly criticize President Trump’s decision to eliminate American contributions to it. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, praised a coalition of American governors and mayors who, in contrast to the White House stance, are still working to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Leaders of other nations, from the island of Nauru to landlocked Niger, barely alluded in public remarks to the new posture of the United States, historically the world’s largest emitter of planet-warming gases and now the only country to reject a global solution to climate change.

"The three U.C.L.A. men’s basketball players who were entangled in an international incident in China that compelled President Trump to get involved admitted on Wednesday that they had shoplifted in Hangzhou. They were suspended from the team indefinitely. “They will have to earn their way back,” Coach Steve Alford said of LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill. The players, who returned to the United States on Tuesday after President Trump interceded with President Xi Jinping of China, apologized for their actions at a news conference. Ball, the highest-profile player involved, said: “I’d like to start off by saying sorry for stealing from the stores in China. I’m a young man, but it’s not an excuse for making a really stupid decision.” The team said the players had stolen from three stores, not just one as originally reported. Earlier Wednesday, President Trump tweeted about his intervention, saying: “Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!” "
"Many of our loftiest ideals — like love, or honesty — seem relatively straightforward until the moment we try to define them and their baffling complexity is revealed. It was in this spirit that the American philosopher Josiah Royce attempted, early in the 20th century, to pin down the true meaning of loyalty. Royce believed loyalty to be the cornerstone of human goodness, the quality that allowed us to rise above individual squabbles and gather together with communal purpose. It required, in his estimation, “the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause.” This is an interest the current president may share: Loyalty and devotion are among his most persistent fixations. In his ghostwritten memoir, “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” he valorizes the loyalty of his mentor Roy Cohn and complains indignantly about disloyal people — those who “think only about what’s best for them and don’t think twice about stabbing a friend in the back if the friend becomes a problem.” In his remarkable address to the Boy Scouts’ National Jamboree in July, he even singled out this quality from among others in the Scout Law — “thrifty,” “brave,” “reverent” — for special praise: “We could use some more loyalty,” he said. “I will tell you that.” The cause to which Trump desires such devotion, of course, generally seems to be the success and popularity of Donald Trump. This was clearest during his presidential campaign, when he asked audiences at rallies to raise their right hands and solemnly swear that they would vote for him. At one rally, in Vermont, people were required to profess their support before even being allowed inside. “I’m taking care of my people, not people who don’t want to vote for me or are undecided,” he said in a statement. “They are loyal to me, and I am loyal to them.” When you ask someone to be loyal to you personally, as Trump does, what you’re concretely requesting is that they choose your cause over other, competing interests. This is what Jesus was describing when he said, “You cannot serve two masters” — loyalty is revealed only in conflict, when you have to pick one thing over another. Loyal people aren’t just devoted. Their allegiances are durable — and as a consequence, their options are limited. But Trump himself prefers to keep his options open, and his allegiances can be quite malleable. His tendency to wash his hands of ties is widely noted, running all the way back to the 1980s, when, according to a secretary employed by Cohn — the mentor whose loyalty Trump so praised — Trump responded to Cohn’s learning of his own H.I.V. infection by severing professional ties. Trump’s ideology is just as famously flexible. Sixteen years before he ran for president as a Republican, he nearly ran under the flag of Ross Perot’s Reform Party, telling Larry King that his desired vice-presidential pick was Oprah Winfrey. He may vow to end DACA in one conversation and to work to salvage it in another. There’s no clear pattern to his changing sympathies, which means that when he demands your loyalty, you cannot quite know what it is that you’re signing up for. You can’t even count on his disloyalty: In August, he cashed in a good deal of political capital to extend a pardon to Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. — partly out of what seemed, to genuinely surprised observers, like an earnest sense of obligation to an ally. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s isolationist approach to trade is rattling what little uneasy peace remains within the Republican Party as the White House pursues policies at odds with longstanding conservative orthodoxy about the benefits of free and open markets. Republicans have long championed free trade, believing that by allowing markets to operate unhindered, nations can boost domestic industries, lift their wages and improve living standards. That view is not shared by Mr. Trump, who has taken a much more critical approach to trade, sowing concern among many Republicans and business groups that the United States will wind up on the losing end of an integrated global economy. The divergence was on display last week, with Mr. Trump proclaiming during a trip to Asia that the United States will no longer enter into the type of multination trade agreements that America has long led the world in creating. “I will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade,” the president said in Vietnam on Nov. 10. “What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible.” In a speech at the White House on Wednesday, the president recounted the warning he had given to other leaders as he traveled across Asia about exploiting America’s open trading system for their economic gain. He proclaimed that his tougher approach to trade had begun to take effect, and that nations around the world have renewed respect for the United States. “The days of the United States being taken advantage of are over,” Mr. Trump said. But despite the president’s declarations of progress and his promises to make one-on-one deals, he appeared to have returned from the trip empty-handed, without any new trade deals in process. At the same time, several of the nations he visited announced they were moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an 11-country trade deal that had support from Republicans but which Mr. Trump jettisoned during his first days in office. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has pledged to take a tougher stance toward China’s purchases of American know-how in its quest to compete more forcefully with the United States. So few people expected that, during Mr. Trump’s visit to Beijing last week, a major Wall Street bank would announce it had teamed up with an arm of the Chinese government to make up to $5 billion in deals in the United States. That deal — between Goldman Sachs and China’s sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation — illustrates the deep divisions in Washington over China’s trade and investment practices, as well as the complexities of policing the flow of Chinese money into the United States. On Wednesday, a week after some Trump administration officials praised the deal as one of many that would help American businesses, a congressional commission recommended that lawmakers consider prohibiting entirely the acquisition of United States assets by Chinese state-owned entities — a move that could stop buyers like C.I.C. from reaching major American deals. “I don’t think any of us expected that easing the way for China to participate in the acquisition of U.S. companies was going to be part of the president’s plans,” said Michael R. Wessel, a member of that group, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “It seems directly counter to the policies he was promoting and, quite frankly, the interests we have.” The commission, which is charged by Congress with monitoring the security implications of trade with China, released a more than 600-page report Wednesday criticizing activities by Chinese entities in the United States.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Ligaya Mishan, a food writer for The Times. As an Asian-American born in Los Angeles and raised in Honolulu, I’ve thought a lot about what it means to grow up in multiple cultures at once — my Filipino mother’s, my British father’s, and my America. For a recent piece on how Asian-American chefs are changing the American palate, I spoke with some two dozen chefs and restaurateurs of Asian descent from across the country — many in California — who came to the U.S. as children or were born here to parents who were immigrants or refugees. The details of their biographies are different, but the sense of duality is shared. And for many, that sense was heightened, early on, by food. “When friends came over and it smelled like sour fishy things, it was weird,” said Chase Valencia, a Filipino-American who runs Lasa in Los Angeles with his brother Chad. Niki Nakayama, the Japanese-American chef of n/naka in Los Angeles, remembers lifting the lid of her bento box in the school cafeteria to find little neck clams staring up at her, “with eyes it felt like,” she said. Some chefs resisted the claims of their heritage. Corey Lee, the Korean-American chef of Benu in San Francisco, once threw out his mother’s painstakingly made stores of kimchi when he was a teenager. Now he ferments his own kimchi at Benu — then transforms it into a membrane-thin, crispy glass to hold a single bite of pork belly and oyster. Is this “authentic”? It’s a question Asian-American chefs often have to field, as if “we’ve been sullied by American culture,” said Diep Tran, the chef of Good Girl Dinette, a Vietnamese diner in Los Angeles. More important to many chefs is a commitment to season and place: Chad Valencia of Lasa makes sinigang (a Filipino soup) with local rhubarb and pickled Fresno chile peppers. Preeti Mistry, whose Indian-inflected restaurants include Juhu Beach Club in Oakland, adds nectarine to her chaat sev puri in summer and sweet potato in the fall. “When people ask what region of India the food is from, I say Oakland,” she said. For Deuki Hong, who makes Korean fried chicken at Sunday Bird, a pop-up in San Francisco, the question of what to cook is entirely personal. “I cook Korean food not because I have to or because it’s my heritage,” he said. “I have to cook what I love to eat.” "
"NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson briefly visited Myanmar on Wednesday and urged its two most influential leaders to investigate “credible reports of widespread atrocities” by the country’s security forces against Rohingya Muslims. In a five-hour visit in Myanmar, Mr. Tillerson met with Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the nation’s military commander, and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and head of the country’s civilian government. He urged both to investigate and halt the violence that has driven more than 615,000 Rohingya to flee over the border to Bangladesh since late August. Less than one-third of the 1.1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar last year are thought to remain in the country. Mr. Tillerson called the situation “horrific,” and at a news conference after the meeting said that there had been “crimes against humanity.” And while he said he advised against “broad-based economic sanctions” against Myanmar, he said targeted sanctions against individuals might be called for. Members of the mostly stateless Muslim minority are still flooding into Bangladesh from Myanmar’s Rakhine State. They bring with them accounts of villages burned to the ground, women raped and children flung into fires. The accounts have been borne out by human rights investigators and, in the case of the villages, satellite evidence. A senior United Nations official has called the campaign against the Rohingya a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” And on Sunday, Pramila Patten, a special representative of the United Nations secretary general, accused the Myanmar military of systematic sexual violence against the Rohingya, noting that rape is a weapon of genocide. “The key test of any democracy is how it treats its most vulnerable and marginalized populations,” Mr. Tillerson said in Naypyidaw, the capital. “It is the responsibility of the government and the security forces to protect and respect the human rights of all persons within its borders and to hold accountable those who fail to do so.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump got an early start on his first day back from his Asia trip, criticizing his longtime foe CNN before 6 a.m. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he had been “forced” to watch CNN while in the Philippines and was reminded “how bad, and FAKE, it is. Loser!” During Mr. Trump’s 12-day trip to Asia, it was disclosed that CNN is a central component of a dispute between the administration and AT&T, which is seeking approval to buy Time Warner. Accounts of the negotiations vary; in one, the Justice Department urged AT&T to sell Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of cable channels including CNN, or to sell DirecTV, the satellite television provider. While it is normal for the Justice Department to be involved in antitrust issues, the fate of CNN in this particular case raises questions about whether the president is trying to influence the outcome, given his very public opinion of the news network. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump said his administration would not let such a deal go through. Shortly before criticizing CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Trump promoted an upcoming report about his Asia trip on Fox News Channel, a network much more to his liking. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Republican leaders in the Senate somehow needed to find an extra few hundred billion dollars. They needed to find that money because they want to cut taxes on the wealthy — and cut them deeply. By the time the Senate leaders had finished coming up with all of their top-end tax cuts last week, their bill was projected to cost more than the House had previously committed to spending. So how could the Senate solve its shortfall? One option would have been to cut taxes a little less for the wealthy. That is not the option the Senate leaders chose. Instead, they said yesterday that they would be getting rid of the individual mandate — the federal rule, in the Affordable Care Act, that requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine. The politics of scrapping the mandate have long been tempting. Many people don’t like being required to buy anything. But health economists believe the mandate to be important. Without it, more people will choose to risk not having insurance. Others won’t even realize they are eligible for Medicaid or federally subsidized insurance plans, because they won’t be nudged to look for a plan. The net result will be fewer middle- and low-income people signing up for insurance. Because fewer of them will sign up, the federal government will spend less money on their medical care. And because the federal government will spend less on them, it will have more money to spend on — you guessed it — tax cuts for the wealthy. "

It was the biggest corporate proxy fight in history. The activist investor Nelson Peltz wanted a seat on Procter & Gamble’s board, arguing that the company should be broken up. He and the company waged very expensive campaigns to sway investors to their point of view. Last month, after a nail-biting vote, the company announced that Mr. Peltz did not get enough votes to prevail. He disputed the result, leaving unresolved his bid to bring about change at a company whose share price has lagged that of its peers for a decade. On Wednesday evening, the fight gained another level of intrigue. Both Procter & Gamble and Trian Fund Management, Mr. Peltz’s investment firm, announced another preliminary vote count by the independent inspector of elections had found that Mr. Peltz may have, in fact, been elected to the board.

"Back when congressional Republicans were rolling out one unpopular health care bill after another, it was a challenge to come up with constructive advice on how to fix their efforts. That’s because Republicans had set themselves an impossible task with health reform: They were trying to do something sweeping enough to be called “repeal,” modest enough to keep most of Obamacare’s beneficiaries on the insurance rolls and also money-saving enough to provide some extra budget room for the eternal dream of tax cuts. No plan could satisfy all three requirements; as they say in Susan Collins’s Maine, you can’t get there from here. With the tax reform that the House and the Senate are now considering, though, the task of advice-giving is easier. For one thing, this time there is no longstanding “repeal” promise that the base demands Republicans fulfill; there’s just the generic promise to cut taxes that every Republican politician makes. For another, the party has decided not to even try to for deficit-neutrality (taking my advice, so send your angry deficit-hawk missives to my address in, ah, Manitoba), giving themselves $1.5 trillion over 10 years to play with and no inherent requirement to offset any of their cuts. Sadly, despite this simplifying improvidence, the G.O.P. still ended up with a pair of bills that look, once again, like the caricature of Reagan-era Republicanism the party has become: heavy with tax cuts for corporations and the heirs of millionaires, lighter on relief for the middle class, lighter still for the working class, with a complicated slew of provisions and score-gaming expiration dates that have made it hard to discern whether lots of non-rich Americans (including the plan’s supposed model beneficiary, a family making $60,000 with multiple kids) even get a tax cut at all. But if the initial House and Senate bills were flawed, it’s also been very easy to see what would make them better. The Republicans seem to be trying, in their none-too-competent and ideologically straitjacketed way, to cut taxes for two major constituencies, employers and middle-class families, while paying for some of these tax cuts by goring well-off professionals in high-tax liberal states. This would not be a bad way to design a right-of-center tax bill. There’s nothing wrong with going after the other party’s constituencies if those constituencies enjoy unearned privileges, which professionals in blue states (this columnist included) emphatically do. Yes, in an ideal world there would be a grand bipartisan tax reform that gores everyone’s ox, but that world ain’t this one, and the fact that the Republicans are trying to cut the home-mortgage deduction and the state and local tax deductions is a good thing because those deductions are bad — subsidies for the rentier class, benefits that flow overwhelmingly to the affluent, an obvious place for a limited-government egalitarianism to seek reform. The (much more modest) Republican proposal to tax the richest university endowments is admittedly more of a targeted culture-war jab — but it’s also a good idea, notwithstanding the complaints from some conservatives that it’s a tax on academic excellence.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • In their effort to rewrite the U.S. tax code, Republican senators announced changes to their proposals on Tuesday to address two problems: math and politics. The alterations would repeal the Affordable Care Act’s so-called insurance mandate, which would save hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade. (Our health care correspondent explains the reason for the mandate, one of the most unpopular parts of Obamacare.) The Senate bill’s tax cuts for individuals would expire at the end of 2025, a provision that could secure the votes of the most conservative senators. The plan’s deep cut in the corporate tax rate would be permanent. Separately, we examined every cut and increase in the House tax plan, and what they would cost. A vote on that proposal is expected on Thursday. • TimesTalk today: Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, will talk with The Times about the withering of bipartisanship.

"A Democratic victory in an Alabama Senate race would rank as one of the most improbable, astonishing outcomes in the last few years of improbable, astonishing political events. So, yes, this could happen. The Roy Moore-Doug Jones contest can be seen as a mad experiment to test the limits of Republican strength in Alabama, perhaps the toughest for Democrats in the country. It might be reasonable to say that if Democrats can’t win it here and now, they just can’t win it as long as the country remains so divided by race, religion and education. Mr. Moore, the Republican, was an electorally weak nominee even before allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls led Republican leaders to call for him to leave the race. He’s running at a moment when the president’s approval rating is in the 30s and when the state Republican Party remains bruised from the resignation of Robert Bentley as governor last spring because of a sex scandal. Perhaps most concerning for Republican hopes, this is a special election. Mr. Moore will be the only reason for Republican voters to show up and vote. A Republican defeat in Alabama would jeopardize the party’s Senate majority in the midterms in 2018. Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take the chamber, but in 2018 they have only two good opportunities, in Arizona and Nevada, and must defend 10 seats in states that voted for Donald J. Trump. A Democratic victory in Alabama would hand the party that third, tough-to-find state even before the beginning of the cycle. It is probably far too soon to get a good sense of where the race will end up, especially since it is not clear whether a write-in candidate will enter the race. Recent polls have not been of the highest quality, but they suggest a tight race. There’s a simple reason Mr. Moore is still very competitive: Alabama is just that conservative. Alabama voted for Mr. Trump by 28 percentage points in 2016, but even this doesn’t do justice to the Republican strength there. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Stephen Colbert devoted a full segment of Tuesday’s “Late Show” to the sexual misconduct allegations that have been lodged against Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Alabama’s open Senate seat. Mr. Colbert focused on reports that when Mr. Moore was in his 30s, he was known to spend time in Alabama shopping malls, chatting with teenage girls. Mr. Colbert was especially outraged when he heard that Mr. Moore had reportedly flirted for years with a young woman who dressed up as Santa’s helper at a mall, eventually asking her out when she was 16. Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified on Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee as part of the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election. As he had in testimony in October, Mr. Sessions often said that he could not answer questions being posed to him because he could not remember the issue in question. Mr. Colbert parodied Mr. Sessions for repeatedly saying that his memory had failed him. President Trump on Tuesday concluded his 12-day tour of Asia. On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah took the opportunity to discuss the region’s geopolitics. He pointed out that Mr. Trump has not only refused to sign onto the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a Pacific Rim trade deal that he has long opposed; he’s refused to fashion a replacement for it. Mr. Noah said this opened up opportunities for China to take a leading role that the United States historically would have occupied. "

We’re Lisa Friedman and Brad Plumer, two writers for The New York Times covering climate change. It’s a giant topic that touches on everything from science to global politics to energy markets to the way we eat and drive and plan our cities. Our hope here is to make climate issues more accessible, bit by bit. Each week, we’ll discuss ideas, trends and news that help make sense of our warming planet and what humanity plans to do about it. We’ll answer reader questions, interview experts in various fields and share things we find interesting — and think will interest you. Send us your thoughts on what’s working, what isn’t and what you’d like us to write about at climateteam@nytimes.com. This week, we’re in Bonn, Germany, for the latest round of United Nations climate talks, where nations are hoping to start turning their gauzy promises to halt global warming into something a bit more meaningful. Most countries say they’re pushing forward on the issue even without the Trump administration (which has rejected the Paris climate deal). But as we found this week, that’s easier said than done. One of the strangest dynamics at the Bonn climate talks so far has been the fact that everyone is trying to pretend the Trump administration doesn’t really exist. A whole bunch of American politicians, like Al Gore and Michael R. Bloomberg, have showed up this week to loudly insist that Mr. Trump’s dismissal of climate policy doesn’t really represent the country writ large, that plenty of cities and states are still doing their part to cut emissions and that Americans still very much want to tackle this problem.

"Minutes after winning re-election to a third term as Manhattan district attorney last week, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a celebratory drink in hand, was asked how he would rebuild the trust of voters angry about large donations to his campaign from defense lawyers with cases before his office. “It’s very important that we address this public concern,” he said. “And we will. We will institute sensible, progressive and effective fund-raising policies and limits.” Much had changed in Mr. Vance’s world since his campaign sent out an invitation last May for his last big fund-raiser, a “Women for Cy” luncheon. Mixed in among the boldface names of politicians, actors, socialites and real estate developers on the host committee were two criminal defense lawyers who often represent people in Manhattan. Donations to district attorney candidates from defense lawyers are legal in New York and have been going on since the 19th century. Yet the practice has drawn new scrutiny in recent weeks, after critics raised conflict-of-interest questions about Mr. Vance’s decisions not to prosecute Harvey Weinstein and members of the Trump family in separate cases. The defense lawyers in the two cases were big contributors to Mr. Vance’s campaign. So fierce was the public reaction that two write-in candidates jumped into the race and took a combined 9 percent of the vote — some 18,000 protest votes that marred what was supposed to be an unopposed glide to re-election.

"WASHINGTON — Tax overhaul, Russian election meddling and whether Republicans and Democrats might ever reach a political détente during the Trump presidency were among the top topics on Wednesday during a TimesTalks conversation with Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. The two traded good-natured barbs as they discussed the era of waning compromise in Washington. Here are the takeaways. As Southern senators who were used to cutting deals when they were businessmen, Mr. Corker and Mr. Warner have as good a reason as any to have faith in bipartisanship. But their forecasts on Republican and Democratic compromise were far from rosy. High-priority policies like health care and tax overhaul have been handled by Congress in way that has been anything but bipartisan. “I know people back home don’t like to hear this,” Mr. Corker said. “But Washington, more fully than people want to think, reflects the country and the country is divided.” Their theories for the split included the news media and activists on the extremes of both parties. “We’ve ended up concentrating too much power in respective Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate,” Mr. Warner said. But, the senators agreed, President Trump has served to unify lawmakers in both parties in some cases — including whether to impose economic sanctions on Russia. “In some ways — I want to be careful about my comments — but there isn’t really the kind of direction coming out of the White House that would typically come out of a White House,” said Mr. Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. “I see the Senate kind of rising to the occasion.” "
"WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers have largely dismissed concerns about how their $1.5 trillion tax cut would add to the federal deficit. Now, some Democrats are warning that the tax rewrite would ultimately be financed by gutting entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The possibility of cuts to safety net programs appeared more likely on Tuesday, as the Congressional Budget Office warned that the tax bill could set off an arcane budget rule that would make deep cuts to Medicare over the next decade. Republican lawmakers have turned a blind eye to the effect of the tax bill on the deficit, saying the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves through increased economic growth. But the party of deficit hawks is beginning to once again complain about the ballooning federal deficit, suggesting that spending cuts must be enforced to reduce the national debt, which has surpassed $20 trillion. At a town hall-style event in Virginia on Tuesday night, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, said the most important steps that could be taken to reduce the national debt were spurring economic growth and making changes to entitlement programs. “You cannot get the national debt under control, you cannot get that deficit under control, if you don’t do both: grow the economy, cut spending,” said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.

"To the Editor: I’m shocked by “President Trump’s Thing for Thugs” (editorial, Nov. 14). Not by your central thesis, with which I agree. But by the casualness with which you seem to have seen fit to group together and label — dismissively and contemptuously — as “thugs” a rather diverse group of foreign leaders with quite different track records. Do you really believe that Xi Jinping should lead off your list of villains? We Americans have every right to prefer a different way of organizing our society to the Chinese domestic system, whatever our current travails. And when China conducts itself externally in a manner that we consider unhelpful or even hostile to our own national interests, we have the right to assert ours. But your labeling Xi Jinping a “thug” struck me as outrageous. Consider the damage you may be doing by extending this epithet so seemingly offhandedly to the leader of the nation making, arguably, faster progress for its people than any in human history. ANDY ZELLEKE, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. "
"Seven and a half years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and five years after the Supreme Court gave its central provision a stamp of legal approval, America is still fighting over the individual mandate. The debate over the requirement to maintain health coverage or pay a penalty has become a permanent feature of American political life — a debate from which we seemingly cannot escape. At the moment, much of the debate revolves around the mandate’s potential impact on tax reform: Senate Republicans, prodded by President Trump, will include a repeal of the mandate in their tax legislation. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is reportedly at work on an executive order to weaken the mandate if Congress does not take action. Democrats are warning that to do so would be to undermine the health care law and end coverage for millions. The accuracy of the Congressional Budget Office model estimating the provision’s cost and coverage effects is a major point of contention. To the sort of casual observer who is blessed to not follow legislative markups and daily Twitter skirmishes over C.B.O. scores, these debates might look both predictably partisan and boringly technical — and often they are. But they also serve as recurring reminders of the many ways in which the mandate has inserted itself into our national political consciousness, its ripple effects touching not only health care but also tax legislation and federal debt and deficit calculations. Why has the mandate become so central to our politics? And why has the debate about it persisted with such intensity? To answer those questions, it helps to understand how its supporters and opponents view the provision. To its supporters, the mandate is the linchpin of a comprehensive regulatory framework intended to improve the national health care market — and, in particular, to increase the number of people with health insurance. More than anything else, the goal of Obamacare was to expand the ranks of the insured, and supporters see the mandate as one of the keys to that goal. "
"ALBANY — It had not even been a week since the Democratic Party scored wins across New York on Election Day, and already pressure was building. What was Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo going to do about the eight rogue Democrats who collaborate with Republicans to help give that party control of the State Senate? It’s an alliance that has threatened Mr. Cuomo’s own popularity with New York liberals and national progressives, which are demanding that he broker an accord between the warring Democratic factions to give the party full control over one of the nation’s biggest and bluest states. And it is clear that efforts to dismantle the so-called Independent Democratic Conference — either forcing its eight members to rejoin the mainline Democrats, or attempting to defeat them in primaries next year — are building, and with them pressure on the governor. On Sunday, the leader of the mainstream Democrats, Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, helped headline an event in the Bronx district of the leader of the I.D.C., Senator Jeffrey D. Klein. On Monday, Mr. Cuomo’s new pick as executive director of the state Democratic Party, Geoff Berman, went to Harlem for a town-hall meeting and heard an earful of frustrations about the I.D.C. from attendees.

"BEIJING — China announced on Wednesday that it would send a high-level diplomat to North Korea for the first time in two years, in a move less than a week after President Trump’s visit that is likely to resume pressure on the North to curb its nuclear arms program. The head of the Communist Party’s external affairs department, Song Tao, is scheduled to leave for Pyongyang on Friday, China’s state-run news agency, Xinhua, reported. The official announcement said that Mr. Song would inform North Korea of the results of the 19th Communist Party congress last month that reappointed President Xi Jinping to a second term. Xinhua also reported that Mr. Song would “visit” the north, a phrasing that Chinese specialists on international relations called an oblique way of saying that Mr. Song would carry a message from Mr. Xi. They said the message would most likely urge the North to join negotiations to halt its nuclear program, and convey the contents of Mr. Xi’s discussions with Mr. Trump about North Korea. Last week in Beijing, the talks between President Xi and Mr. Trump focused heavily on North Korea. After he left Beijing, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was impressed with China’s efforts to push for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But it was unclear whether Mr. Xi had promised to take any new steps, as denuclearization has long been China’s policy goal there. “I believe Song Tao will take a very clear message on the Trump summit with Xi Jinping,” said Cheng Xiaohe, professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing. “He will focus on North Korea needing to talk about denuclearization.” North Korea’s KCNA news agency on Wednesday confirmed Mr. Song’s trip, a signal that after month’s of rebuffing Chinese attempts to send envoys to Pyongyang, the government of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had agreed to Mr. Song’s visit.

"To the Editor: Re “U.S. to Consider Special Counsel in Uranium Deal” (front page, Nov. 14), about a possible investigation into donations to the Clinton Foundation: By seeking to weaponize the Justice Department to distract from the ongoing investigations into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign, President Trump now imitates the autocrats he so much admires: Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. A politically motivated investigation and prosecution would be yet another of Mr. Trump’s norm-breaking threats to American freedom and democracy. Too many in our country will cheer this further breach of our sacred tradition of a politically independent criminal justice system without even understanding what it portends for America. That’s the ignorance and shortsightedness that Mr. Trump preys upon. IRA BELSKY, FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J. To the Editor: Re “ ‘Lock Her Up’ Becomes More Than a Slogan” (news analysis, front page, Nov. 15): More than the “banana republic” politics of retribution are at play in President Trump’s demands for a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton’s supposed crimes. He is positively obsessed with the woman he beat in the last election. Like Raskolnikov in Dostoyevsky’s “Crime and Punishment,” he keeps circling around the scene of the crime — the 2016 presidential election — even though this is undoubtedly creating complications in the special prosecutor’s investigation of Russian interference. But Mr. Trump can’t help himself. It’s as if he has to keep proving to himself and the public at large just how guilty and undeserving of the high office Mrs. Clinton really is.

"An F.B.I. report leaked in October and scrutinized during an oversight hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday warns of an emergent domestic terror threat sweeping the nation and threatening the lives of law enforcement officers: the “Black Identity Extremist” (“B.I.E.”) movement. This designation, just recently invented by the F.B.I., is as frightening and dangerous as the bureau’s infamous Cointelpro program of the 1960s and ’70s, under which J. Edgar Hoover set out to disrupt and destroy virtually any group with the word “black” in its name. Today, entirely nonviolent black activists face violations of their civil liberties and even violence if they’re deemed part of B.I.E. The 12-page report, prepared by the F.B.I. Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August, and later made public by foreignpolicy.org, both announces the existence of the “Black Identity Extremist” movement and deems it a violent threat, asserting that black activists’ grievances about racialized police violence and inequities in the criminal justice system have spurred retaliatory violence against law enforcement officers. It links incidents of violence by a handful of individual citizens like Michael Johnson, who shot 11 Dallas police officers in July 2016, to “B.I.E. ideology” and predicts that “perceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement.” This is fiction. Daryl Johnson, a former Department of Homeland Security intelligence agent, when asked by Foreign Policy in October why the F.B.I. would create the term “B.I.E.,” said, “I have no idea” and “I’m at a loss.” Michael German, a former F.B.I. agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice’s liberty and national security program, said the “Black Identity Extremists” label simply represents an F.B.I. effort to define a movement where none exists. “Basically, it’s black people who scare them,” he said. “Could you name an African-American organization that has committed violence against police officers?” Representative Karen Bass asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions at Tuesday’s hearing. “Can you name one today that has targeted police officers in a violent manner?” It’s no surprise that he could not. Mr. Sessions, who confessed that he had not read the report, said he would need to “confirm” and would reply in writing at a later time. The F.B.I. itself admits in the report, that, even by its own definition, “B.I.E. violence has been rare over the past 20 years.” The Black Identity Extremist designation erroneously presumes a broad and disparate group of organizations with concerns about the criminal justice system represent a movement with a unifying ideology. This reflects ignorance — or denial — of the reality on the ground: There are dozens if not hundreds of groups with primarily black members that take issue with racial injustice but have distinct areas of focus, mandates, missions and memberships, and which are just as likely to conflict with one another as they are to overlap.

"WASHINGTON — The director of the National Counterterrorism Center will step down next month, the Trump administration said on Wednesday. The director, Nicholas J. Rasmussen, is one of the few individuals in the American government who has served continuously in counterterrorism jobs since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Rasmussen, 52, had served three years as the country’s top counterterrorism official. He had previously worked to combat extremism while at jobs at the White House and at the counterterrorism center, where he served as deputy director from 2012 until taking over as director in December 2014. “Nick is deeply committed to the counterterrorism mission and has skillfully guided the nation through an evolving and complex terrorism threat environment,” Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement on Wednesday announcing the departure. “His deep understanding of the intelligence needed to support senior decision makers has been invaluable.” Friends and associates said Mr. Rasmussen told colleagues that he decided to remain in the job for about another year after the Trump administration had asked him to stay. Mr. Rasmussen has served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, and 27 years in government overall, and he has not decided what to do next, colleagues said. Russell Travers, the deputy director of the counterterrorism center, will serve as acting director upon Mr. Rasmussen’s departure in late December and until President Trump nominates a successor, Mr. Coats said.

"President Trump and North Korea have prompted Congress to do something it hasn’t done in more than four decades: formally consider changes to the law that gives American presidents the sole authority to launch nuclear weapons. In a governing system that relies on checks and balances, that may strike some people as odd. But the uncomfortable truth is that Mr. Trump, like all his post-World War II predecessors, is uniquely empowered to order a pre-emptive strike, on North Korea or anywhere else. We’re talking about the authority to unleash thousands of nuclear weapons within minutes. And with scant time to consult with experienced advisers. As the first formal hearing on the issue in 41 years unfolded before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, Senator Christopher Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, bluntly outlined the stakes with a president who “is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests.” Republicans were not as harsh nor so Trump-centric. But Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who is the committee’s chairman, and recently expressed concern that Mr. Trump could lead the country to World War III, said it was important to examine the “realities of this system” by which the use of nuclear weapons is decided. He’s right. Mr. Trump has brought on himself this examination of his authority to order the launch of the world’s most deadly weapons. His erratic, taunting threats to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea and even destroy the country, his glib talk about nuclear weapons and his impulsiveness generally raise serious questions about his willingness to incite war. "
"President Trump’s hostility toward the news media, and CNN in particular, has been so extreme that it is calling into doubt whether his appointees at the Department of Justice can fairly evaluate a merger involving the cable news channel’s parent company, Time Warner, and AT&T. The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division has reportedly asked AT&T to sell the Turner Broadcasting division of Time Warner, a unit that includes CNN, or sell its DirecTV unit to gain approval for the deal. On its face, this is not an unreasonable request. Combining AT&T and Time Warner in their present form would create a vertically integrated telecom-media goliath. It would have the market power to hurt competitors and consumers by raising prices of popular shows like “Game of Thrones” and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT. Smaller rivals like Dish Network and regional cable-TV companies might have no choice but to pay or risk losing their customers to AT&T. For these and other reasons, experts and lawmakers have been saying for months that a merger raises serious problems, and some sort of divestment seems necessary before it can be approved. But asking Time Warner to sell Turner Broadcasting and its CNN unit raises its own questions. Given Mr. Trump’s repeated attacks on CNN, there’s ample cause to suspect that the Justice Department scheme is a ploy to force a sale of the news organization to owners that will strip away its editorial independence and turn it into a house organ of the Trump administration. Officials at the White House and the Justice Department insist they haven’t discussed the case with one another. They also say that political considerations have played no role in the department’s review. But it’s interesting, and to some people suspicious, that the chief of the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has changed his mind about the deal. In October 2016, he said he did not see a “major antitrust problem” with an AT&T-Time Warner marriage. Now he does, and he supports the divestiture of Turner and CNN. Reasonable people are bound to ask if he changed his mind because economists and lawyers at the Antitrust Division persuaded him, or because he was influenced by Mr. Trump’s tweets and public statements. Justly or not, Mr. Delrahim suffers from the same suspicions that attach to just about all of Mr. Trump’s appointees. By firing a director of the F.B.I., by demanding that the Justice Department investigate his political opponents and by attacking judges, Mr. Trump, unlike other presidents of the modern era, has shown little but contempt for the independent, honest judgment of government departments and agencies. In a more insidious fashion, he has undermined the integrity of public service by appointing people to important jobs who have glaring conflicts of interest. He has stacked the Environmental Protection Agency with officials who have long ties to the fossil fuel and chemical industries; a similar bias infects the Interior Department. "
"SEATTLE — Amazon and the tax man are back at it again. For years, the company and state governments scuffled over Amazon’s resistance to charging state sales tax, which helped keep prices low on its e-commerce site and angered politicians and other retailers. Eventually, Amazon began adding the tax in states across the country. But there was a loophole. Amazon added the tax only when the item came from its own inventory, not from the millions of independent merchants who sell products through Amazon’s website. Amazon left it up to those sellers — who account for half of all items sold on the site — to collect sales tax on their own. But, according to sellers, tax lawyers and accountants who work with them, most do not. Now states, thirsty for the millions of dollars in unpaid sales taxes revenue, are coming for their money. Amazon recently warned its sellers that the company, as of Jan. 1, would be collecting sales tax from merchants who ship orders to its home state, Washington, as it seeks to comply with a state law signed in July. That will be the first time Amazon has collected a state sales tax for the merchants known as marketplace sellers on its site. It is a grudging concession by the online retail giant. In South Carolina, the company is fighting an effort by the state’s Department of Revenue to use existing laws to force Amazon to collect tax on marketplace sales. The state is arguing that Amazon owes it $57 million in such taxes from last year. A judge’s decision in the case is pending. Other states are going after Amazon’s sellers, a much less powerful target, for unpaid sales taxes. In Massachusetts, a judge in late September ordered Amazon to give the state information about merchants who stored goods in the state. Sellers have reported receiving letters from tax investigators in California, too. "
"It is so hard to be a billionaire these days! A new yacht can cost $300 million. And you wouldn’t believe what a pastry chef earns — and if you hire just one, to work weekdays, how can you possibly survive on weekends? The investment income on, say, a $4 billion fortune is a mere $1 million a day, which makes it tough to scrounge by with today’s rising prices. Why, some wealthy folks don’t even have a home in the Caribbean and on vacation are stuck brooding in hotel suites: They’re practically homeless! Fortunately, President Trump and the Republicans are coming along with some desperately needed tax relief for billionaires. Thank God for this lifeline to struggling tycoons. And it’s carefully crafted to focus the benefits on the truly deserving — the affluent who earn their tax breaks with savvy investments in politicians. For example, eliminating the estate tax would help the roughly 5,500 Americans who now owe this tax each year, one-fifth of 1 percent of all Americans who die annually. Ending the tax would help upstanding people like the Trumps who owe their financial success to brilliant life choices, such as picking the uterus in which they were conceived. Now it’s fair to complain that the tax plan over all doesn’t give needy billionaires quite as much as they deserve. For example, the top 1 percent receive only a bit more than 25 percent of the total tax cuts in the Senate bill, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. "
"A year ago, I was finalizing plans to leave a chemical engineering Ph.D. program and join the tech sector. But as Inauguration Day approached, I became so disgusted by President-elect Donald Trump’s behavior that I felt it would have been negligent to remain a bystander. So I traveled from Baltimore to join hundreds of thousands of protesters at counterdemonstrations around Mr. Trump’s swearing-in. Little did I know that I would be swept up into a legal nightmare that demonstrates how prosecutors intimidate and manipulate defendants into giving up their rights. Minutes after I got to downtown Washington on Jan. 20, police officers used pepper spray, “sting-ball” grenades and flailing batons to sweep up an entire city block in a mass-arrest tactic known as “kettling.” I was among the more than 230 people confined at 12th and L Streets with no access to food, water or bathrooms for up to eight hours. That much can be gleaned from public legal filings connected to our criminal prosecutions, as well as a lawsuit filed on behalf of me and three other plaintiffs by the American Civil Liberties Union. (One of this case’s many paradoxes is that I’ve been advised not to talk publicly about what happened before my arrest.) Next, prosecutors at the United States Attorney’s Office in Washington took the highly unusual step of indicting more than 200 of those arrested. Most of the people in the group, which includes journalists, legal observers and volunteer medics, face charges of engaging in a riot, inciting a riot, conspiracy to riot and property damage. In addition to seizing the contents of at least 100 cellphones, prosecutors secured broad warrants for Facebook pages and records relating to a political organizing website. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump marked his return from a five-country tour of Asia by recounting on Wednesday its “tremendous success” and that of his other trips abroad. Deterred only by a struggle to quench his thirst, Mr. Trump listed numerous achievements against terrorism and for United States workers in claiming that “America is back.” But some of those statements don’t hold much water. Here’s an assessment. In detailing his May trip to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump said he spoke about “our strategy to defeat terrorists by stripping them of financing, territory and ideological support” and urged Arab states to drive terrorists from their societies. It is true that the Islamic State has lost significant territory, including its de facto capital in Syria, “since that time,” as Mr. Trump said. But the extremist group had begun losing territory well before Mr. Trump’s trip to Riyadh, and he has largely kept to plans laid out under President Barack Obama. After repeatedly criticizing other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for not paying their fair share to the military alliance, Mr. Trump has since claimed credit for changing the trend. He said on Wednesday that “NATO, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.” Under NATO guidelines, member states agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product to the organization’s defense efforts, but few nations actually do so. The secretary general of the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said in July that five countries contributed at least 2 percent of their G.D.P. He said he expected Romania to reach the benchmark this year, and Latvia and Lithuania to next year. "

"Donald Trump is back from Asia. What do you think he’ll be doing next? A) Pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey. B) Urging Congress to pass a clean, simple, middle-class-friendly tax bill. C) Pardoning Sean Hannity. The answer is A, obviously. Turkey gets a reprieve on Tuesday. And rumors that the president has ordered the execution of all turkeys previously pardoned by Barack Obama are not true. It was a joke on a website. Stop telling people that! But about the tax bill — things are getting a whole lot grislier than they are on the turkey front. Republicans desperately need to pass some kind of tax cuts, just to prove their majority is capable of doing something more exciting than renaming post offices. Voting starts this week, but now they’ve really muddied up the game. People, if you were advising the Republicans on how to get a tax bill passed despite their infinitesimal majority in the Senate, would you suggest they: A) Get Roy Moore to endorse it. B) Add an assault on Obamacare. C) Get rid of the part where you raise taxes on teachers who buy supplies for their classes. O.K., you’re a terrible politician. Republican leaders thought carefully and decided the best strategy was to attack Obamacare. Which worked so well for them last time around. "
"Time Inc. is said to be in talks to sell itself to the Meredith Corporation, in a deal backed by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers known for supporting conservative causes. Talks between Time Inc., the publisher of Time and People, and Meredith, the publisher of Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, fizzled this year. The new round of negotiations, motivated by the surprise entry of the Kochs, could lead to a quick deal, according to people involved in the discussions. The Kochs have tentatively agreed to back Meredith’s offer with an equity injection of more than $500 million, the people with knowledge of the talks said. A spokesman for the brothers’ business, Koch Industries, declined to comment on Wednesday. Time Inc. also declined to comment. Meredith did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have been negotiating over the past several days, and Meredith is reviewing the latest Time Inc. financial information. Although it is unclear whether the proposed deal will reach fruition, both sides hope to move quickly enough to be able to announce a transaction soon after Thanksgiving. "
"Like the best mimics, John Leguizamo administers large but precisely calibrated doses of exaggeration to make his impersonations pop. In “Latin History for Morons,” a panoptic survey of two millenniums of oppression in the Americas, he tosses off dozens of quick character sketches that feel exactly as true as they are likely inaccurate. I rather doubt, for instance, that his prissy, nail-filing Moctezuma has any basis in fact. But who cares whether the Aztec emperor really lisped at Cortés, “You leave me no choice ’cause you’re so butch”? What matters is that the laughs are real, in this case suggesting familiarity with the accommodations that proud people make to an overwhelming force. And so it is with almost every character brought to life in Mr. Leguizamo’s long and often hilarious parade of injustice, stretching from Peru under the Inca to Texas under Trump. At their best, his jokes get at something deep, whether he is serving up a Rat Pack Christopher Columbus, a French poodle de Tocqueville, a sassy, cross-dressing Cuban-American Civil War soldier or a deaf uncle with an idiosyncratic way of signing. If only the character at the center of this frenetic one-man show were as convincing. But for the first time in his solo Broadway career, which began with “Freak” in 1998 and reached peaks with “Sexaholix” in 2001 and “Ghetto Klown” in 2011, Mr. Leguizamo is unable to make a convincing cartoon of himself. That’s a big problem in a show that, more than the others, depends on our buying an unlikely conceit that’s presented as fact. When an eighth-grade schoolmate slurs his son as a “beaner” — a Mexican, that is, though Mr. Leguizamo is Colombian — he gives himself the task of buttressing the boy’s Latino pride with a look at the empires and achievements left out of the textbooks. “Latin History for Morons,” which opened on Wednesday evening, is supposedly the record of his research and self-re-education. So on a book-strewn classroom set by Rachel Hauck, the play intercuts cockeyed lectures about the past — from the decimation of the Taíno to the Trail of Tears — with an unlikely current-day family drama.

"In this year’s Editorial Cartoon Contest, more than 800 students submitted cartoons on issues that matter to them — from immigration and gun violence to Harvey Weinstein and standardized testing. You can see the eight winners, 12 runners-up and 22 honorable mentions here. But one topic — one individual, in fact — dominated this year’s submissions: President Trump. By our count, over 40 percent of all submissions included an image of Mr. Trump or his tweets. Students were clearly excited to try their wit in making a commentary on the president’s actions, whether they focused on his exchanging insults with North Korea’s president, calling climate change a hoax, throwing paper towel rolls in Puerto Rico, or grumbling about national anthem protests. But as judges, we also regretted the president’s overwhelming presence in this year’s contest since we worried that it pushed other issues important to young people aside. One of the challenges students have to confront in our editorial cartoon contest is how to make a point, or prompt a realization, primarily through a visual illustration. Though the artistic ability of our 42 finalists varies widely, their skill at providing insightful commentary or criticism does not. You’ll notice, if you scroll through the wonderful collection, that any deficits in artistic ability are more than made up for in cleverness and originality of message and execution. Thank you to all the students who participated in this year’s editorial cartoon contest, and to the teachers who helped. We run student contests all year, so visit our 2017-18 contest calendar to learn more. "
"After nearly 100 applications to renew permits that let immigrants stay and work in the United States legally were rejected because they had been delayed in the mail, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services agency last week said nothing could be done; the decisions were final. But on Wednesday, the agency reversed its position. In light of the delays, it agreed to allow those rejected because of mail delays to resubmit their renewals for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The Department of Homeland Security’s acting director, Elaine C. Duke, told the immigration agency to allow applicants to resubmit their paperwork if they have proof that they mailed their renewal in a timely manner and that the reason it missed the Oct. 5 deadline was because of Postal Service delays. Homeland Security issued the guideline in a statement Wednesday night. Immigration advocates and elected officials were pleased with the turnabout. “We’re glad to see U.S.C.I.S. do the right thing by accepting these applications,” said Camille Mackler, the director of legal immigration policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, an immigrant advocacy group. “This news will come as a huge relief to DACA recipients who had been living with enormous anxiety for weeks now.” The rejection of the delayed applications was reported by The New York Times last week. At least 74 applications from the New York area and Chicago were known to have been rejected as a result of mail problems in Chicago, for which the Postal Service took responsibility. The immigration agency said it was “not responsible” for mail delays. In New York, lawyers reported that 18 out of 34 applications had actually arrived at the Chicago location on Oct. 5, according to postal receipts, and yet they were not accepted by the immigration agency until the next day.

"We all beat ourselves up from time to time. But Elliot took that phenomenon to a brutal new level this week on “Mr. Robot,” throwing himself down stairs and into walls as he worked through the stages of grappling with your alter ego. Season 3 has been largely about denial, as Elliot and Mr. Robot have each thought he could function independently from, or even thwart, the other. Wednesday brought lots of anger in the form of self-abuse, before moving on to bargaining. Help me, Elliot wrote in a message to Mr. Robot. “You’re being played.” Of course at that point Elliot didn’t realize that he had been played, too. Or rather in addition to the way he had already been played, but as his other half. (Yeah I agree — this is confusing.) Because the true goal of Stage 2 turned out to be not the New York recovery building, but at least 71 other E Corp facilities that were targeted in a coordinated Dark Army attack, killing thousands. Which is to say: Everyone was played, by Whiterose and her minions. Angela, so concerned about evacuating the New York E Corp employees, now finds herself an accomplice to an even greater slaughter. Tyrell Wellick is in custody, forced to abandon his Ukrainian dreams and godly aspirations and instead play the chump in New York. Phillip Price’s global currency scheme would seem doomed now that E Corp’s vulnerability has been demonstrated on such a grand scale. Whiterose’s slap on the hand turned out to be more of a hammer to the jaw. For Elliot, the Dark Army blitz is the final confirmation that “your revolution,” as Angela put it, is totally out of his hands. Even after he accepted that Mr. Robot had been working against him, Elliot still believed that he had the ability to counteract the efforts to push it farther, jeopardizing lives. He believed he had forestalled it, in fact, until he realized that he’d been duped. "
"WASHINGTON — Another woman went on national television this week to press her case of sexual assault by a powerful figure. But the accused was not Roy S. Moore or Harvey Weinstein or Donald J. Trump. It was Bill Clinton. “I feel like people are starting to believe and realize that I was truly sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton,” Juanita Broaddrick said on Fox News nearly two decades after first going public with her story. “All victims matter. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican. Who cares if you’re straight or you’re gay, or if you believe in God or not. We all have a right to be believed.” The cultural conversation about women, power and sexual misconduct that has consumed the United States in recent weeks has now raised a question that is eagerly promoted by those on the political right just as it discomfits those on the political left: What about Bill? While Fox News and other conservative outlets revive years-old charges against Mr. Clinton to accuse Mr. Moore’s critics of hypocrisy, some liberals say it may be time to rethink their defense of the 42nd president. Matthew Yglesias, a liberal blogger who once worked at the Center for American Progress, a pillar of the Clinton political world, wrote on Vox.com on Wednesday that “I think we got it wrong” by defending Mr. Clinton in the 1990s and that he should have resigned. Chris Hayes, the liberal MSNBC host, said on Twitter that “Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.” Caitlin Flanagan, a social critic who calls herself a “lifelong Democrat, an enemy of machine feminism and a sexual assault survivor,” wrote on The Atlantic’s website that “the Democratic Party needs to make its own reckoning of the way it protected Bill Clinton.” Michelle Goldberg wrote a New York Times column headlined, “I Believe Juanita.” David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official, said Monica S. Lewinsky “deserves an apology from many of us she has never received.” The emerging revisionism may influence a historical legacy that Mr. Clinton and his allies have spent the past 17 years scrubbing of scandal. Despite his impeachment on perjury and obstruction for covering up sexual liaisons with Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Clinton until lately had made progress in framing the national memory of his presidency as a time of peace and prosperity.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump boasted on Wednesday that nearly 10 months of his “America First” foreign policy had restored strength and respect to the United States on the world stage after years of what he called failed leadership under his predecessors. Hours after returning home from a 12-day, five-country excursion to Asia with few concrete achievements, Mr. Trump made no significant announcements in a speech that he had hyped on Twitter as “a major statement” to be delivered upon his return. Mr. Trump nonetheless declared the trip a resounding success, saying that he had made real progress by uniting the world against North Korea and insisting on reciprocal trade from Asian nations. “America’s renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now,” he said. “This is exactly what the world saw: a strong, proud and confident America.” The speech also provided a made-for-Twitter moment in which a clearly parched president interrupted his broadcast to reach for a bottle of water, struggling until an aide told him where to look. And when he finished speaking, Mr. Trump ignored questions from journalists seeking comment on the sexual assault scandal swirling around Roy S. Moore of Alabama, the Republican nominee for Senate in a special election next month. Announced with little notice and delivered midafternoon from the Diplomatic Room of the White House, the president’s speech was designed to be what his critics have never offered him: a sweeping and positive assessment of his own performance as the nation’s commander in chief and top diplomat. "
"WASHINGTON — Sometimes, you just get thirsty. Never mind that you’re on national television, having hyped a midafternoon speech. Or that you’re the president of the United States, delivering the remarks from the Diplomatic Room in the White House. And just set aside for a moment your past, snarky criticism of other politicians for sneaking a sip during a speech. Whether any of that went through President Trump’s mind or not during an address to the nation on Wednesday afternoon, he clearly was parched. And so he stopped, after speaking for about 11 minutes, reaching down to his left for the water he expected to be there. He came up dry. “They don’t have water. That’s O.K.,” the president said, taking about a 20-second pause from his remarks extolling his own achievements during his recent visit to Japan. “What? No, it’s O.K.” Flummoxed for a moment, an aide told him to look on the other side, and he finally found his refreshment. The big swig from the iconic, squarish Fiji Water bottle seemed to hit the spot, and Mr. Trump continued delivering his remarks on the success of his “America First” foreign policy. He no doubt hoped that the interruption would not detract from his message. Twitter had other ideas. The medium that Mr. Trump has long embraced was quick to poke fun — and to note the irony. It was not that long ago, after all, that Mr. Trump, then just a real estate tycoon and reality TV star, mocked Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, for a similar television water episode during a State of the Union response in 2013. At the time, Mr. Trump did not give Mr. Rubio any benefit of the doubt. He also frequently raised the issue of Mr. Rubio’s parched-mouth moment when the two of them were running against each other for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Now, having been likewise afflicted, the president may know what Mr. Rubio felt like at the time. One person who noticed? Mr. Rubio, who took a mild, good-humored shot at his onetime rival. Mr. Trump continued to take a few sips of the water throughout the rest of the speech on Wednesday, though none interrupted his rhythm quite like the initial search for the water bottle. But everything a president does reverberates far and wide, and a made-for-television gaffe like the water episode is no exception. Within seconds, the Wikipedia page for Fiji Water was edited by someone to include the fact that the water is “the official thirst quencher of Donald Trump.” It was removed a few minutes later. "
"GADSDEN, Ala. — Alabama’s increasingly bizarre Senate race was convulsed again as four more women came forward on Wednesday to describe encounters with the Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, and Mr. Moore’s campaign sharply questioned the credibility of another accuser. The newest accusations came from women who ranged in age from about 18 to 28 at the time. They complained of being groped, forcibly kissed or subjected to unwanted advances. One of them, Becky Gray, now 62, a retired teacher living in Gadsden, Ala., said in an interview that she was puzzled by Mr. Moore’s repeated overtures when she worked in the Gadsden Mall. “I just couldn’t figure out why a man of his age spent every Friday and Saturday at the mall,” said Ms. Gray, who was then in her late teens or early 20s. She said she frequently saw Mr. Moore, then in his 30s, talking with young women and did her best to avoid him. Ms. Gray said she eventually complained to her manager that he would not leave her alone and was later told that Mr. Moore had been banned from the mall. Nine women have now come forward with accusations, and state Republican leaders were pondering increasingly baroque mechanisms that have the potential to deny their own candidate a Senate seat. Party leaders met Wednesday evening, but no decision was announced. "
"WASHINGTON — The moment the last of Fred Vautour’s five children walked across the stage as a Boston College graduate was priceless. Not only did Mr. Vautour have the rare distinction of handing each of his children their diplomas, but he was also able to pay for their nearly 18 years of schooling by collecting trash, scrubbing toilets and mopping floors while the campus slept. “As much as I struggled, it was incredible to be able to do that for them,” said Mr. Vautour, 64, who has worked the graveyard shift as a custodian at Boston College for 17 years. “I took this job for benefits, but never imagined this would be one of them.” It may not be one for long — or at least could be severely curtailed. The sprawling House tax bill, set for a vote on Thursday, would tax the value of college tuition benefits conferred on thousands of university employees like Mr. Vautour, one of several provisions that would hit colleges, universities and their students, hard. Republicans drafted the bill with the premise that it would simplify the nation’s tax code and cut rates for middle-income Americans. To help pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut, lawmakers eliminated many individual tax breaks, arguing the overall plan would compensate for any lost benefits. The result: while many families and businesses would see tax cuts, a large percentage of undergraduates and graduate students would see their tax bills increase, some dramatically. In addition to campus employees, many doctoral students would see huge tax increases, since the tuition that universities waive for them in exchange for working on campus as researchers and teaching assistants would be deemed taxable income. At expensive research universities like Stanford and Harvard, the new tax bills could swamp graduate-student stipends. "
"TOKYO — The first time Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, met President Xi Jinping of China, the body language told the story. Mr. Xi looked dour and stiff, turning away from Mr. Abe with pursed lips, as if someone had forced him into it after months of escalating tensions between their two nations. In the years since, relations have improved but the two leaders have always kept at a distance. This past weekend, they met again on the sidelines of a regional summit meeting in Vietnam. This time, they shook hands and Mr. Xi flashed a grin. It was a sign, the Japanese news media suggested, of a potentially momentous shift in the region, with two longtime adversaries drawing closer as the United States under President Trump has created unease among allies about the role the United States will take in the region. To compensate, Japan and China are inching toward a possible reconciliation as they recognize the altered dynamics around the Pacific Rim. But with the two Asian powers long divided by disputes over history and territory, as well as testiness over influence in the region, it will take more than a few handshakes — or a smile — to cement a genuine realignment. In gesturing toward a new friendliness, Japan is motivated in part by the recognition that as the United States retreats, it needs stronger trade with China. Having watched Mr. Trump heap praise on Mr. Xi in Beijing last week, Japan is also propelled by fear that the United States may develop a closer rapport with China that would exclude Japan. "
"HARARE, Zimbabwe — A day after the Zimbabwean Army detained President Robert Mugabe, representatives of South Africa and the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday sought to defuse the crisis in closed-door negotiations aimed at producing some kind of transitional settlement. President Jacob G. Zuma of South Africa told lawmakers in his own country that the situation “very shortly will be coming clear,” as an array of activist groups and political opponents of Mr. Mugabe urged him to step aside peacefully. Feeling their way through uncharted territory after the military placed Mr.  Mugabe under house arrest, Zimbabweans ventured into streets patrolled by armored vehicles and awaited some kind of signal of what a new era might bring. Many in this country of 16 million people have known no president other than the 93-year-old Mr. Mugabe, a onetime leader of the country’s anticolonial struggle who traded the liberator’s mantle for the iron fist as one of Africa’s most enduring autocrats. Early Wednesday, the military announced that soldiers had confined Mr. Mugabe and his flamboyant and ambitious wife, Grace Mugabe, to their home. "

"Dravosburg, Pa., is a small — population 1,746 — working-class suburb that lies along the Monongahela River 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. If we want to understand what actually propelled Donald Trump to victory last November, presidential voting patterns there provide a vital clue. In 2012, Dravosburg backed Barack Obama over Mitt Romney 441 to 312, or 53.4 percent to 44.8 percent. Four years later, the men and women of Dravosburg abandoned their Democratic loyalties and backed Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, 56.3 to 41.1. What is so interesting about this working-class community, with its strong ties to organized labor? It is one of thousands of white enclaves across the nation that provided Trump with his margin of victory. The election of Donald Trump revealed that in some of the nation’s whitest municipalities and counties — the communities arguably most insulated from urban crime, immigration and gangs — Trump did far better than Romney had done four years earlier. The 2016 results suggest that residents of a diminishing number of decisively white American towns and small cities — even those which supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 — can now be politically mobilized around race, ethnicity, multiculturalism and immigration.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. An important, and often overlooked, part of the Republican tax plan is the change to the tax code’s inflation adjustment. I realize that “inflation adjustment” may not be one of the more exciting phrases you will find in your inbox this morning, but stick with me for a moment. The federal government calculates a handful of different inflation measures, the best known being the Consumer Price Index. The other measures tend to show a slower rate of economywide inflation than the Consumer Price Index does. With a slower inflation rate, real incomes — that is, incomes after adjusting for inflation — rise more quickly. (An example: If you got a 4 percent raise last year and inflation was estimated to be 2 percent, your real income rose about 2 percent. If inflation was only 1 percent, your real income rose about 3 percent.) Tax brackets are based on inflation-adjusted incomes, and they currently use the Consumer Price Index. But the tax bill in Congress would switch to one of the other measures, which tends to show less inflation. By doing so, the Republicans’ plan makes incomes appear to be rising faster than they otherwise would — and pushes more households into higher tax brackets over time. This change is effectively a tax increase on families who are not already rich enough to be in the top tax bracket. In the latest version of their tax plan, Senate Republicans have made the change in the inflation measure permanent. But all of the plan’s middle-class tax cuts are temporary. To summarize: The middle-class tax cuts vanish, while the middle-class tax increases (and an enormous tax cut for corporations) remain. "
"To the Editor: Re “Alone and Adrift in a Warming World” (editorial, Nov. 10): President Trump lies about climate change. Unlike the rest of us, he dismisses the obvious changes in the climate we all experience. Based on misguided ideology and a commitment to protect failing economic interests, his appointees dismantle actions that could reduce the climate-altering gases we are adding to the atmosphere. By contrast, beginning in the 1980s, scientists predicted that rising emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and other gases would cause most of the recent changes we have experienced: record heat, sea-level rise, intensified hurricanes and precipitation events, and more droughts and wildfires. Whose approach provides us with the information we need to develop effective means for slowing climate change and creating resilient cities, agricultural systems and economic opportunities? Mr. Trump and his powerfully positioned climate deniers are harming billions of people and the natural world upon which we depend by defending the indefensible. WILLIAM R. MOOMAW

"WASHINGTON — A growing national outcry over sexual harassment reached the Senate on Thursday, when a radio newscaster accused Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of kissing and groping her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office. Mr. Franken, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, almost immediately released an apology to the newscaster, Leeann Tweeden, who said that Mr. Franken forcibly kissed her during a rehearsal and groped her for a photo as she slept. After initially apologizing without fully acknowledging all of her accusations, he then released another lengthier, more contrite statement that contested nothing. “The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,” Mr. Franken wrote. “I respect women. I don’t respect men who don’t,” he continued. “And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.” "
"NEWARK — The federal corruption trial of Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey ended in a mistrial on Thursday after jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict, leaving Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, free to return to Congress but injecting uncertainty as he faces re-election next year and his party faces a difficult battle to retake the Senate. After interviewing jurors individually in his chambers, Judge William H. Walls emerged to tell the court that, after nine weeks of testimony, the jury was deadlocked and that, as a result, “there is no alternative but to declare a mistrial.” One juror told reporters that 10 of the 12 jurors supported finding Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, not guilty, saying that prosecutors had not made the case that the favors and gifts exchanged between the senator and a wealthy eye doctor went beyond what good friends do for each other. Following the ruling, Mr. Menendez seemed both relieved and defiant, denouncing prosecutors who pursued criminal charges against him. “The way this case started was wrong, the way it was investigated was wrong, the way it was prosecuted was wrong, and the way it was tried was wrong as well,” he said. The decision leaves Mr. Menendez, 63, safely in the Senate, denying Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey the opportunity to appoint a replacement and further tip the scales for Republicans in the Senate. But Mr. Menendez, who has been in the Senate for 12 years, emerges from the trial politically wounded as he prepares to campaign for a usually safe Democratic seat. Now, whoever challenges him will surely make Mr. Menendez’s ethics a key attack line. Throughout the trial, poll after poll found that his approval numbers were plummeting, and a Quinnipiac poll released in September showed that 50 percent of likely New Jersey voters said that Mr. Menendez did not deserve to be re-elected.

"The question has transfixed classical music for months: Who would the Los Angeles Philharmonic tap to fill the very large shoes of Deborah Borda, who helped make it one of the nation’s most vibrant and financially sound orchestras? A member of her team? An outsider from the world of business — or Hollywood? The question was answered on Thursday, when the Philharmonic announced that it had reached beyond its ranks — but not beyond the orchestra field, or even the West Coast — for its next chief executive: Simon Woods, the innovative president of the Seattle Symphony. Mr. Woods said in a phone interview that he hoped to build on the accomplishments of Ms. Borda, who left Los Angeles to lead the New York Philharmonic, and that he looked forward to working with his new orchestra’s music director, Gustavo Dudamel. “I think that everybody has watched over the past 20 years as this organization evolved into this extraordinary artistic entity which is redefining how we think about orchestras,” said Mr. Woods, 54, who was born in London. Since his arrival in 2011, the Seattle Symphony has raised its artistic profile, commissioning and presenting the premiere of “Become Ocean” by John Luther Adams, which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize. It established its own recording label, and worked with the city’s homeless. It raised some eyebrows in classical circles by performing the bawdy anthem “Baby Got Back” with Sir Mix-A-Lot. And after one of President Trump’s travel ban proposals this year, it responded with a free concert, “Music Beyond Borders,” that highlighted works by composers from nations that were targeted. "
"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to allow a single company to own a newspaper and television and radio stations in the same town, reversing a decades-old rule aimed at preventing any individual or company from having too much power over local coverage. The Republican-led F.C.C. eliminated the restrictions, known as a media cross-ownership ban, in a 3-to-2 vote along party lines. As part of the vote, the agency also increased the number of television stations a company could own in a local market. A company will more easily be able to own two of the four largest stations in a market, instead of only one. The vote was the latest action in a deregulatory blitz at the agency cheered on by media, broadband and cable corporations, but opposed by many Democrats and consumer advocates, who say Americans will be hurt from greater consolidation in those industries. In April, the agency relaxed other limits on television ownership. Shortly after, Sinclair Broadcast Group reached a deal with Tribune Media for a $3.9 billion merger that would allow Sinclair to reach 70 percent of American households. Some lawmakers have called for an investigation into the relationship between the agency’s chairman, Ajit Pai, and Sinclair. Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, has said the media ownership rules — including the cross-ownership ban between newspapers and television and radio stations — was outdated. He said most Americans get their news from a variety of sources and, most prominent among them, online platforms like Facebook and Google. Local media organizations, he has argued, would have a greater shot at competing against those internet giants by combining resources in local markets. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Marc Tracy, who covers college sports for The Times. The U.C.L.A. sunglasses-stealing saga concluded Wednesday, not with a bang, but with a whimper. Last week, three Bruin freshman basketball players — including LiAngelo Ball, the middle son of a famous and aptly named basketball-playing family — were arrested in Hangzhou, China, apparently for stealing designer sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store. This happened two days before they were to play in an annual showcase game in Shanghai put on by the Pacific-12 Conference. The players’ passports were revoked, U.C.L.A.’s athletic director, Dan Guerrero, said Wednesday, and U.C.L.A. dictated that they stay in the team hotel while their teammates left for Shanghai, beat Georgia Tech and departed the continent. President Trump, who was in China on diplomatic business, raised the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping, asking, according to John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff: “Do you know anything about these knuckleheads that got caught allegedly stealing?” Mr. Trump’s intervention appeared to work. The players admitted they had broken the law, according to Mr. Guerrero, and were told that the charges had been dropped. Paparazzi gave them a Los Angeles welcome when they arrived at L.A.X. Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, at a time when many in the sports world have been outspoken in opposition to him, Mr. Trump asked on Twitter whether credit would be given where it seemed to be due: "
"I have lived my whole life with a Republican Party with which I disagreed, but at least understood. The first election I can remember was the presidential election of 1980. I was 10 years old. I didn’t know much about politics or party platforms. I only knew that the former peanut-farmer president, Jimmy Carter, was running against a former actor, Ronald Reagan. But it was in that election that Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority reintroduced religious activism into American politics. Speaking at a Dallas convention of Christian fundamentalists, Falwell proclaimed: “During the 1980s, preachers, we have a threefold primary responsibility. No. 1: Get people saved. No. 2: Get them baptized. No. 3: Get them registered to vote.” The religious activism was in many ways a direct response to the strides made in the 1960s and 1970s on racial equality, women’s rights and gay rights. In a way, their driving motivation was to make religious law into American law, really not so unlike the Shariah law they so fear and despise. My brothers and I stayed up late with my mother to watch the returns on election night in 1980. When it was clear that the actor had beaten the farmer, my mother quietly left the room, and an air of solemnity and sadness filled it. For the three decades that followed, I could count on one thing: the conservative right was the religious right. That was its branding, if not always its behavior. It was as if the foot soldiers for the conservative right had read only half of the Bible they thumped. They were harsh and vindictive like the God of the Old Testament, not generous and inclusive like the Jesus of the New Testament. "

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. On this week’s edition of “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee used the Roy Moore controversy as a jumping-off point to talk about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in industries across America. “Each community has to kick out their own creeps,” Ms. Bee said. She added that in Hollywood, outing Harvey Weinstein should be seen as only the beginning of a larger effort. Upon returning to the United States after a 12-day tour of Asia, President Trump took to Twitter to criticize a longtime favorite adversary: CNN. Stephen Colbert feigned excitement at seeing Mr. Trump back in familiar territory.

"SIERRA CITY, Calif. — The fragrant firs had given way to jagged, rocky peaks, and the composer John Adams climbed a vertiginous metal staircase to a fire lookout high atop the Sierra Buttes, an aerie perched 8,587 feet above sea level. “All this was heavily mined,” Mr. Adams said, surveying a seemingly serene landscape of glacial lakes and Ansel Adams evergreens that had once been torn apart by frenzied prospectors during the Gold Rush. “There were shafts into the interiors of the mountains.” These days Mr. Adams is mining some of the real-life tumult that churned beneath the oft-mythologized surface of the California Gold Rush of the early 1850s — the ethnic tensions, ugly bursts of nativism and brutality toward women — for his latest opera, “Girls of the Golden West,” which will be given its premiere Nov. 21 at the San Francisco Opera. The opera’s mid-19th-century setting (its title archly evokes Puccini’s more melodramatic “La Fanciulla del West,” or “The Girl of the Golden West”) is a departure for Mr. Adams, whose pathbreaking operas “Nixon in China,” about a 1972 presidential trip, and “The Death of Klinghoffer,” his still-controversial exploration of a 1985 hijacking, were so contemporary that some critics initially sniffed that they were “CNN operas.” But Mr. Adams said that the new work, with a libretto assembled from historic texts by Peter Sellars, his longtime collaborator, had come to feel disturbingly of the moment — especially its scenes of white miners whipped into anti-immigrant frenzies. “They all came here looking for gold,” he said at one point during a drive through the Sierras along State Route 49, which links many of the old mining sites of the 49ers. “And when it became not so easy to find gold, they all started sounding like Donald Trump.” "
"A landmark pledge seven years ago by the world’s richest nations to spend billions to help developing countries tackle climate change seemed like a godsend for Kiribati, the Pacific island nation threatened by rising seas. The result of that promise was the Green Climate Fund. But Kiribati — like many of the poorest countries most vulnerable to climate change — has yet to see any project funding. Instead, many of the projects that have won early backing were approved despite concerns raised by current and former observers on the fund’s board over whether officials had done due diligence on projects — especially on those involving the private sector, which make up half of the approximately $2.6 billion in project financing authorized so far. “We raised our objections, but the gavel just came down,” said Liane Schalatek, one of two civil society observers on the fund’s board and associate director at the Heinrich Böll Foundation North America, an environmental group associated with the Greens party in Germany. “There’s a real lack of transparency,” she said. The observers took issue, for example, with a proposed project that would hand out $265 million in equity and grants to Geeref Next, a Luxembourg-based investment fund that proposed to finance renewable energy or energy efficiency projects in about 30 countries — with no explicit plan to disclose what those projects would be.

"WASHINGTON — With 227 Republican votes, the House passed the most sweeping tax overhaul in three decades on Thursday, taking a significant leap forward as lawmakers seek to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals and deliver the first major legislative achievement of President Trump’s tenure. The swift approval came two weeks after the bill was unveiled, without a single hearing on the 400-plus-page legislation and over the objections of Democrats and 13 Republicans. The focus now shifts to the Senate, where Republicans are quickly moving ahead with their own tax overhaul, which differs in substantial ways from the House bill. After four days of debate, members of the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 12 along party lines to approve their version of the tax package late Thursday night. The approval helps clear the way for the full Senate to consider the bill after Thanksgiving, although it remains to be seen whether it has the support to pass the chamber. “We’ve taken a big step today, but of course there are many more steps ahead,” Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said after the vote. Several Senate Republicans have expressed concerns about the legislative effort, and if Democrats are unified in opposition, Senate leaders can afford only two Republican defections in order to win passage through the narrowly divided chamber. In a blow to Senate Republicans, an analysis of their plan released Thursday projected the bill would actually raise taxes on low-income Americans within a few years. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.S. hails its battle against the Islamic State as the most precise air campaign in history. But far more Iraqi civilians are being killed than previously recognized. Over 18 months, two reporters visited the sites of nearly 150 airstrikes across northern Iraq; interviewed hundreds of witnesses, survivors, family members, and local officials; mapped destruction through satellite imagery; and held meetings at the U.S. air base in Qatar, where the coalition directs the air campaign. Their detailed, sometimes heartbreaking report concludes that one in five of the strikes results in civilian death, a rate more than 31 times higher than acknowledged. _____ "
"Updated on Dec. 11. That a Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama would cruise to victory seemed almost a foregone conclusion. But after a series of women came forward to accuse that candidate, Roy S. Moore, of sexual misconduct, less is certain in an unlikely nail-biter of a race that could have major implications for the party’s ability to govern in Washington. President Trump has gone from largely avoiding mention of Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, to unequivocally endorsing him. Many Senate Republicans distanced themselves from the candidate, and some called on him to withdraw from the race. Democrats, for their part, are contemplating the near-impossible: flipping a seat in a deeply red state that last elected a Democratic senator in 1992. As voters prepare for the special election on Tuesday, here is a breakdown of The New York Times’s coverage on the race since the accusations emerged. On Nov. 9, The Washington Post reported that four women said Mr. Moore had pursued them sexually or romantically when they were 18 or younger and he was in his 30s. One of them said that he touched her sexually when she was 14, below the state’s age of consent. Over the next several days, a woman accused Mr. Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 (read her statement here), and four more women accused him of sexual misconduct or unwanted overtures. "
"WASHINGTON — There are tough choices at the heart of the Republican tax bills speeding through Congress, and they make clear what the party values most in economic policy right now: deep and lasting tax cuts for corporations. The bill that sailed through the House on Thursday chooses to take from high-tax Democratic states, particularly California and New York, and give to lower-tax Republican states that President Trump carried in 2016, particularly Florida and Texas. It allows for tax increases on millions of families several years from now, if a future Congress does not intervene, but not for similar increases on corporations. The version of the bill that the Senate Finance Committee approved along party lines late Thursday chooses to give peace of mind to corporate executives planning their long-term investments. That comes at the expense of added anxiety for individual taxpayers, particularly those in the middle class, who could face stiff tax increases on Jan. 1, 2026. A consistent conservative philosophy underpins all those decisions. So does a very large bet — economically and politically — on the power of business tax cuts to deliver rapid wage growth to United States workers. There is also the appearance, to liberal critics in particular, of Republicans seeking to reward their prized constituencies first, while leaving others to bear the consequences if their most optimistic scenarios do not play out. The tax plans have evolved rapidly since House leaders first introduced their bill at the beginning of the month. Amendments in the Ways and Means Committee restored some cherished tax breaks that had been targeted for elimination, including those for adoptive parents, and expanded the bill’s tax breaks for owners of businesses that are not organized as traditional corporations.

"As Republicans and the Trump administration continue trying to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Service has begun, for the first time, to enforce one of the law’s most polarizing provisions: the employer mandate. Thousands of businesses — many of them small or midsize — will soon receive a letter saying that they owe the government money because they failed to offer their workers qualifying health insurance. The first round of notices, which the I.R.S. began sending late last month, are being mailed to companies that have at least 100 full-time employees and ran afoul of the law in 2015, the year that the mandate took effect. Large companies, defined in the law as those with 50 or more workers, are required to offer their employees affordable insurance or pay stiff tax penalties. The I.R.S. held off for years on assessing those fines, saying that it needed more time, and money, to build its compliance systems. Now, the agency says it is finally ready to go after scofflaws. “As the I.R.S. has publicly stated, the agency is obligated to enforce the Affordable Care Act’s employer shared responsibility provision,” said Bruce Friedland, an agency spokesman. Ten months ago, in his first executive order, President Trump directed government agencies to waive, defer or delay carrying out as much of the law as possible. This week, the Treasury Department said that it objected to the employer mandate but was legally compelled to enforce it. “Treasury lawyers see no ground for the secretary to direct the I.R.S. to not collect the tax,” the agency said in a written statement. “The A.C.A.’s employer mandate unfortunately remains the law of the land.” "
"Though much has been made of the glowing glances with which Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and his wife, Louise Linton, ogled the first sheets of $1 bills with his signature during a trip to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on Wednesday, for my money it was Ms. Linton’s choice of dress that really made a statement. Actresses of a certain fame are generally pretty canny about their visual messaging: They understand that every time they step out of their doorway they are potentially on show, and they tend to dress accordingly, as if every moment is a potential photo op. Certainly, Ms. Linton, a former actress (guest appearances on “CSI: NY,” “Cold Case” and the like), should understand this, especially given her last major public appearance, in August. At that time she came under fire for Instagramming a photo of herself on a trip with her husband to Kentucky stepping off a government aircraft in lots of Hermès, and got into a social media spat in which she appeared to brag about her ability to buy such designer names while denigrating those who could not. So what does it say that for her recent close-up Ms. Linton dressed in black, with long leather dominatrix gloves, a long leather skirt, wide black belt, black blouse and black stilettos? That either she is the most tone-deaf image maker in the administration or its most Machiavellian. Black leather, after all — unlike, say, brown leather — is one of the most emotive sartorial symbols in the wardrobe, imbued with a host of cultural and historical associations for almost everyone. It is the de facto outfit of villains everywhere, from generic Nazis with their black leather trench coats to Hermann Goering’s black leather boots, The Terminator (Version 1), Darth Vader and assorted Disney witches.

"Yemen would suffer “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims” if Saudi Arabia did not immediately allow food and medicine to be offloaded at all of Yemen’s seaports, and permit the resumption of air services to the cities of Sana and Aden, the United Nations official Mark Lowcock warned Security Council diplomats last week. Saudi Arabia tightened its blockade against Yemen on Nov. 5 after Iran-backed Houthi rebels threatened Riyadh with a ballistic missile. The Saudis have since partly lifted the blockade, but only of ports controlled by its allies. That is not nearly enough to get urgently needed food to nearly seven million Yemenis facing famine. Misery has been Yemen’s lot after more than three years of unrelenting war. At least 10,000 people have been killed, many by Saudi-coalition bombings carried out with military assistance by the United States. A raging cholera epidemic has sickened some 900,000 people, and 17 million Yemenis are now completely dependent on humanitarian aid for survival. Ships and cargo planes ferrying food, medicine and vital fuel to Yemen’s war-ravaged civilians are inspected by the United Nations to make sure they are not transporting arms. Impeding humanitarian assistance and using famine as a weapon are war crimes, and Saudi Arabia must realize that the world is finally taking notice. On Monday, the United States Congress passed a resolution denouncing the targeting of Yemeni civilians and calling for all parties involved to “increase efforts to adopt all necessary and appropriate measures to prevent civilian casualties and to increase humanitarian access.” The vote should serve as a warning to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is intent on expanding Saudi Arabia’s regional influence, that while he may have the unreserved blessing of President Trump, American lawmakers are less tolerant of flagrant violations of international law and of basic humanity. The only way to end the Yemeni people’s hell is for Congress and the United Nations to keep pressing all parties for a political solution. "
"This essay has been updated to reflect news events. I still remember my sense of indignation when my high school French teacher told us about the rule: French nouns have a gender, even seemingly sexless ones like “table.” And if you had a mixed group of masculine and female nouns — say, a bunch of male students (étudiants) and female students (étudiantes) — you had to describe them, as a group, in the masculine. “What if there are 99 female students and one male student?” I demanded. It didn’t matter, the teacher said. What’s more, if you wrote a sentence about attractive (beaux) étudiants and attractive (belles) étudiantes, the adjective used to describe them had to be masculine, too: “Les étudiants et les étudiantes sont beaux.” That was just the way French was, she said. The sexism of that stung. And that was even before I discovered that one of the rationales for this rule in which one man trumped an infinite number of women was that “the masculine gender is deemed more noble than the feminine gender because of the superiority of man over woman.” That line, from a 1767 grammar book, was cited this month in a declaration signed by 314 teachers in France that they would no longer teach the rule that “the masculine prevails over the feminine” when it came to plural nouns. The teachers’ objection was not just philosophical; it was philological. The rule, they said in the French version of Slate, was a parvenu (it was enunciated in the 17th century and became widely taught only in the 19th century) and politically motivated (it buttressed French laws that denied women equal rights). Besides that, they said, the rule encourages children “to accept the domination of one sex over the other” to the detriment of women. In its place, the teachers suggested using “the rule of proximity,” in which the adjective matches the gender of the noun closest to it, which was common practice for centuries. Or they said, people could use “majority agreement,” with the adjective matching the gender of the noun with the biggest number of members. Or even, they said, writer’s choice. "
"The pending merger of AT&T and Time Warner has attracted a significant amount of attention, for precisely the wrong reasons. Politics have apparently intruded on a transaction that until recently was considered relatively uncontroversial. Combining AT&T, which distributes digital content over its wireless networks, with a news and entertainment provider like Time Warner is what economists and antitrust experts consider a classic vertical merger. Because the companies don’t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries. For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one. Typically more problematic for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy. Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies — benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days — including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones — the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat. If anything, it would create an attractive set of new options for the viewing public. "
"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Consumers here at first did not believe the health insurance premiums they saw when they went shopping for coverage this month on HealthCare.gov. Only five plans were available, and for a family of four with parents in their mid-30s, the cheapest plan went typically for more than $2,400 a month, nearly $30,000 a year. With the deadline for a decision less than a month away, consumers are desperately weighing their options, dismayed at the choices they have under the Affordable Care Act and convinced that political forces in Washington are toying with their health and well-being. “I believe in the Affordable Care Act; it worked for me under the Obama administration,” said Sara Stovall, 40, who does customer-support work for a small software company. “But it’s not working as it was supposed to. It’s being sabotaged, and I feel like a pawn.” Ms. Stovall said she might try to reduce her hours and income, so her family could qualify for subsidies on offer to poorer families to help pay for premiums. Heather Griffith, a 42-year-old real estate broker, said she would put aside much less money for her retirement and the education of her two young children so she could pay the premiums. And even though he does not need an assistant for his work as a developer of mobile apps, Ian Dixon, 38, said he might hire an employee just so he could buy health insurance as a small business, at a cost far below what he and his family would have to pay on their own.

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Cambodia’s highest court on Thursday dissolved the main opposition party, eliminating the most popular and viable challenger to the country’s authoritarian leader before elections next year. Human rights groups and the United Nations said the decision to shutter the Cambodia National Rescue Party, or C.N.R.P., would render the country essentially a one-party state, ending its post-Khmer Rouge experiment with pluralistic democracy. The ruling followed a lawsuit filed last month by the government against the opposition, asserting that it was involved in a United States-backed plot to overthrow the Cambodian People’s Party and its powerful leader, Prime Minister Hun Sen. In announcing the ruling, Dith Munty, the chief judge of the Supreme Court, said, “It is a serious crime, so the party will be dissolved according to Article 38 of the Law on Political Parties.” The judge is also a high-ranking member of the governing party and a close associate of Mr. Hun Sen. There is no right to appeal. The decision, which will see scores of opposition officials barred from politics and their party stripped of its parliamentary seats, was the culmination of a crackdown in which the opposition leader was jailed, media outlets closed and activists harassed, with a particular focus on groups linked to the United States. The International Commission of Jurists, a nongovernmental rights group, said the hearing and Judge Dith Munty’s role in it made “a mockery of justice.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Attacks Teddy Roosevelt’s Legacy” (editorial, Nov. 7): We are dismayed by the Trump administration’s plans to reduce the areas of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments in Utah, and by the possibility that other national monuments may be in jeopardy as part of the Interior Department’s continuing review. Both areas have long been known for their rich paleontological troves of marine and terrestrial fossil species central to investigations of the history of life. We are therefore keenly concerned about the potential loss to science and our national heritage of species yet to be discovered on lands excised from the national monuments. We stand ready to work constructively with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in safeguarding the natural resources and heritage of the United States. We also hope that our federal leaders come to understand how best to ensure the future well-being of Earth and its environments, including the precious resources provided in our national parks and monuments.

"NAIROBI, Kenya — A month after the Trump administration formally lifted decades-old sanctions against Sudan, a top official said on Thursday that the United States would consider removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that has been in place since 1993. The step, which is contingent on further cooperation by Sudan with Washington, would further demonstrate the striking turnabout in relations between the countries, a thaw that began under the Obama administration and a rare area in which the Trump administration has continued the approach of its predecessor. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said the United States was willing to consider removing Sudan from the its list of state sponsors of terrorism if Sudan continued to make progress on counterterrorism cooperation, human rights and other key issues. Syria, since 1974, and Iran, since 1984, are the other countries on the list. Mr. Sullivan said he raised those issues in a two-day visit to Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. He is one of the highest-level officials to visit Sudan in a decade. Revoking the sanctions is the latest in a series of steps the nations have taken to improve relations. In late September, Sudan was dropped from the list of countries affected by the Trump administration’s travel ban. The Sudanese government also affirmed the end of diplomatic relations with North Korea, a move that pleased Washington. Mr. Sullivan said the travel-ban decision was unrelated to the latest moves. “That is an immigration issue,” he told reporters in Khartoum. "

He wonders, for instance, why Mr. Franken’s accuser, Leeann Tweeden, kept an incriminating photograph of Mr. Franken for so long. “Was it because she was told when she woke up that Franken had ‘assaulted’ her and she wanted evidence of this for future use,” he asks, “or, perhaps more likely, did someone send it to her because it was a funny keepsake from their trip which is now being used to create a completely different impression of what happened?” Read more » _____ Kevin D. Williamson in National Review: This week, before the Franken accusations emerged, Democrats and liberals in the news media were beginning to reassess their feelings about former President Bill Clinton. According to Mr. Williamson, the rejection of the Clintons now, years after Mr. Clinton was accused of rape and a year after Hillary Clinton ran for office, are merely a cynical political ploy: “Our progressive friends have discovered their consciences on the Clinton matter at the precise moment the Clintons ceased to be useful instruments of political power.” The same cynicism, he argues, should be applied to liberals who have been swift to condemn Mr. Franken. It costs them nothing, politically, to remove a Democratic senator from a state likely to put another Democrat in his seat. Read more » "
"Looking at the reactions to Republican tax plans, I found myself remembering what people used to say about former Senator Phil Gramm, whose presidential ambitions never went anywhere but who did help cause the 2008 financial crisis: “Even his friends don’t like him.” So it is with G.O.P. tax “reform,” especially the Senate version, which would raise taxes on most individuals, especially in the middle and working classes, and add around 13 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured, all to pay for big cuts in corporate taxes. The general public strongly disapproves — by a 2-1 majority, according to Quinnipiac, although the majority would be even bigger if people really understood what’s going on. But surely at least C.E.O.s like the plan, right? Actually, not so much. A few days ago Gary Cohn, Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser, met with a group of top executives. They were asked to raise their hands if lower taxes would lead them to raise capital expenditures; only a handful did. “Why aren’t the other hands up?” asked Cohn, plaintively. The answer is that C.E.O.s, living in the real world of business, not the imaginary world of right-wing ideologues, know that tax rates aren’t that important a factor in investment decisions. So they realize that even a huge tax cut wouldn’t lead to much more spending. And with that realization, the rationale for this tax plan, such as it is, falls apart, leaving nothing but a scheme to make the rich — especially those who rake in investment income rather than working for a living — richer at everyone else’s expense. For what it’s worth, here’s the story the Trump administration and its allies are telling. Their claim is that cutting taxes on corporate profits would lead to an explosion in private investment and faster economic growth. Furthermore, the fruits of this growth would trickle down to American workers in the form of higher wages — and rising incomes would raise tax receipts, so the tax cuts would end up paying for themselves.

"About 5,000 barrels of oil, or about 210,000 gallons, gushed out of the Keystone Pipeline on Thursday in South Dakota, blackening a grassy field in the remote northeast part of the state and sending cleanup crews and emergency workers scrambling to the site. “This is not a little spill from any perspective,” said Kim McIntosh, an environmental scientist with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources. No livestock or drinking water sources appeared to be threatened, Ms. McIntosh said, and no farm buildings or houses are within a mile. The spill, near Amherst, S.D., comes just days before regulators in neighboring Nebraska decide whether to grant the final permit needed to begin construction on a different pipeline proposal, the Keystone XL, which would be operated by the same company. An announcement in Nebraska is expected on Monday. The pipeline company, TransCanada, said in a statement that the South Dakota leak was detected around 6 a.m. local time on Thursday. The pipeline was shut down, and the cause of the leak was under investigation. “TransCanada appreciates the collaborative support of local officials, emergency response personnel and commissioners in Marshall County, as well as the landowner who has given permission to access land for assessment, identification and cleanup activities,” the company said in its statement. A photo of the spill, which was posted to the company’s Twitter account, showed a large, darkened area in a field. The Keystone Pipeline is part of a 2,687-mile system that carries crude oil from Alberta to several points in the United States, including Illinois and Oklahoma. "
"The Trump administration is expected to name Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, as the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a regulator that has emerged as one of the most aggressive banking watchdogs, according to an administration official. Mr. Mulvaney — who as a Republican congressman was the co-sponsor of legislation to shut down the consumer bureau — is expected to remain in his position at the Office of Management and Budget and oversee both agencies until a permanent director of the consumer agency is approved, said the official, who requested anonymity because the decision had not yet been made public. Mr. Mulvaney replaces Richard Cordray, who said on Wednesday that he would step down from his position later this month. Mr. Cordray, a Democrat appointed by President Barack Obama, served as the bureau’s first director. During his tenure, the agency gained a reputation as an active watchdog for the financial rights of consumers. The agency’s actions drew resistance from Republicans, who viewed it as overly aggressive. Before Mr. Mulvaney arrived at the Office of Management and Budget, where he is responsible for guiding the president’s spending requests through Congress, he was a conservative House Republican, representing South Carolina. He is known in Washington as a fiscal hawk. With a new director of the consumer agency, President Trump will be free to make major changes, just as he has done at other federal regulators. Many of those are now run by former industry executives. Established six years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad power to combat abuses in a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans. One of the individuals being mentioned as a candidate for the permanent position is Todd J. Zywicki, a conservative law professor at George Mason University. Democrats have said they would fight any nominee they view as too closely aligned with the financial industry. "
"WASHINGTON — Concerned that the missile defense system designed to protect American cities is insufficient by itself to deter a North Korean attack, the Trump administration is expanding its strategy to also try to stop Pyongyang’s missiles before they get far from Korean airspace. The new approach, hinted at in an emergency request to Congress last week for $4 billion to deal with North Korea, envisions the stepped-up use of cyberweapons to interfere with the North’s control systems before missiles are launched, as well as drones and fighter jets to shoot them down moments after liftoff. The missile defense network on the West Coast would be expanded for use if everything else fails. In interviews, defense officials, along with top scientists and senior members of Congress, described the accelerated effort as a response to the unexpected progress that North Korea has made in developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear bomb to the continental United States. “It is an all-out effort,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who returned from a lengthy visit to South Korea last month convinced that the United States needed to do far more to counter North Korea. “There is a fast-emerging threat, a diminishing window, and a recognition that we can’t be reliant on one solution.” For years, that single solution has been the missile batteries in Alaska and California that would target any long-range warheads fired toward the American mainland, trying to shoot them down as they re-enter the atmosphere. Such an approach, known as “hitting a bullet with a bullet,” remains of dubious effectiveness, even after more than $100 billion has been spent on the effort. Antimissile batteries on ships off the Korean coast and in South Korea protect against medium-range missiles, but not those aimed at American cities. So the administration plans to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the two other approaches, both of which are still in the experimental stage. The first involves stepped-up cyberattacks and other sabotage that would interfere with missile launches before they occur — what the Pentagon calls “left of launch.” The second is a new approach to blowing up the missiles in the “boost phase,” when they are slow-moving, highly visible targets.

"WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee has uncovered evidence that Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, was forwarded a document about a “Russian backdoor overture” that Mr. Kushner failed to hand over to the panel’s investigators, according to a letter that the committee released on Thursday. The Senate letter did not say what type of back channel communication the Russians were trying to set up. But it noted that “other parties have produced documents concerning the matter.” Mr. Kushner also failed to provide investigators with a September 2016 email he was sent about WikiLeaks, nor did he hand over other communications with a Russian-born businessman that were forwarded him, according to the letter. The businessman, Sergei Millian, a former head of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, has long claimed to have ties to Mr. Trump and his associates — ties that Mr. Trump’s advisers have said are overstated. WikiLeaks has been identified by American intelligence agencies as acting as a conduit for information that Russian intelligence operatives had stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, had repeated communications with the anti-secrecy group on Twitter. The Senate panel said that Mr. Kushner has also not produced phone records that investigators believe exist, although the letter gave no specifics about the records. The letter was signed by Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, the two senior members of the Judiciary Committee. “We appreciate your voluntary cooperation with the committee’s investigation, but the production appears to have been incomplete,” said the letter, which was sent to Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The House passed its version of a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut, moving Republicans closer to a signature victory. The bill cuts the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, collapses the number of tax brackets and eliminates deductions for state and local taxes. It would also result in bigger tax bills for many students. We tracked how every member voted. Attention now turns to the Senate, where another version of the bill is struggling. An analysis by Congress’s bipartisan referee on tax policy found it would raise taxes on lower-income people. _____ "
"The Trump administration will begin allowing hunters to bring into the United States “trophy” elephants killed in Zimbabwe, reversing a 2014 ban on a practice that has received intense scrutiny in recent years. Though African elephants are protected under the Endangered Species Act, the law allows the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to authorize imports of trophies if the agency finds that the hunts in which the animals were killed contribute to the survival of the species. The United States banned such imports from Zimbabwe in 2014 because of a lack of data on conservation efforts there. Now the United States agency says it is satisfied with Zimbabwe’s actions and believes such hunts can be beneficial for the species by bringing money to local communities and providing incentives to conserve elephants. “Since our 2014 and 2015 findings, there are strong indications that the efforts of private landowners and consortiums to manage elephants within their areas of control have received greater support,” the federal agency said in a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday. The Zimbabwean government, it added, was contributing to efforts to combat poaching and working with partners to improve elephant management. The reversal of the ban comes less than two weeks after the agency moved to allow imports from Zambia. Both decisions generally apply to elephants hunted in either country between 2016 and 2018. Hunters are allowed two imports per year. "
"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The Alabama Republican Party on Thursday offered unqualified support to the embattled candidacy of Roy S. Moore, ignoring the condemnation of national Republican leaders and brushing aside worries that he could lose a Senate race in a solidly conservative state — or be expelled from Congress if he wins. Invoking the need for guidance from God, a statement from the party’s chairwoman, Terry Lathan, referred only indirectly to the allegations of sexual misconduct and unwanted overtures against women that have upended the Senate race here. Ms. Lathan said the party trusted voters to make the right decision and backed Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the State Supreme Court, as a conservative supporter of President Trump running against the Democrat, Doug Jones. “Judge Moore has vehemently denied the allegations made against him,” Ms. Lathan said in her statement, issued one day after a committee of party leaders opted behind closed doors to reaffirm their support for the Republican nominee. “He deserves to be presumed innocent of the accusations unless proven otherwise.” The state party’s decision was a crucial, if mostly expected, procedural victory for a campaign roiled by the public comments of nine women who described conduct varying from uncomfortable to unlawful. Although Mr. Moore on Thursday called the allegations “scurrilous” and “untrue,” the state party’s statement came minutes after he refused to answer questions here about whether he had improper sexual contact with a 14-year-old or, as a prosecutor in his 30s, dated high school girls. It also came about the time on Thursday afternoon when the White House was offering Mr. Moore little support and Mr. Trump was largely skirting the issue. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, repeated Mr. Trump’s previous statement that said Mr. Moore should drop out of the race if the allegations against him were true. She would not say whether Mr. Trump stood by his previous endorsement of Mr. Moore, but said the president backed the Republican National Committee’s decision to end its financial support of Mr. Moore’s campaign.

"If the government goes to court to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, as seems increasingly likely, it may well be the antitrust case of the decade, even without the claims of presidential meddling that have already engulfed the deal in partisan controversy. A lawsuit by the Justice Department, along with its earlier, widely reported demands that AT&T sell either DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting to gain approval for the deal, would mark a radical departure from decades of antitrust enforcement policy, both in defining what is an unlawful anticompetitive merger and in fashioning a remedy to cure the problems. That’s because the combination of AT&T and Time Warner is what’s known as a “vertical” merger, meaning that the two companies don’t compete to any significant degree in their primary lines of business, which are telecommunications (AT&T) and entertainment (Time Warner). There would be the same number of competitors in both fields after the merger as there were before it. This week, two Barclays analysts, Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski, called the government’s threat to block the deal “unprecedented” and said they were “perplexed” given the Justice Department’s longstanding leniency toward vertical mergers. Larry Downes, an antitrust expert and a fellow at the Georgetown McDonough School of Business, told me flatly this week: “If the government goes to court, it will lose. There’s no case law to support them.” Court challenges to vertical mergers on antitrust grounds have been extremely rare in recent decades. (Mr. Downes said the most recent example he could find dated to 1964.) But in the past few years, as the internet has disrupted traditional media companies and prompted some high-profile mergers, there has been a growing sense “that antitrust enforcement has been too lenient,” said Maurice Stucke, an antitrust professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law and a co-author of the article “Antitrust and the Marketplace of Ideas.” "
"To the Editor: Re “House Passes Tax Bill in Major Step Toward Overhaul” (news article, nytimes.com, Nov. 16): I am one of the millions of middle-class Americans who would experience a significant increase in my tax bill under the Republican tax plans. A higher tax bill is disappointing, but what is infuriating is that I will be paying higher taxes and no common good will come from it. My higher taxes are not going to reduce the deficit. My higher taxes will do nothing to invest in the future of our country through education, research and development, infrastructure or health care. My higher tax bill has one purpose only, which is to provide revenue to enable tax breaks for the wealthy while staying within the allowed boundaries for deficit increases. I am happy to pay my fair share of taxes. I am even happy to pay more taxes to invest in education, health care and infrastructure. It is shameful that I am paying higher taxes to give tax breaks to the 1 percent. DONNA NAWALKOWSKY, CINCINNATI To the Editor: The Republicans’ tax proposals seem to indicate that they don’t care if their deficits drive the government toward bankruptcy. But they enable the Democrats to get in the game and lay claim to the populist mantle that is rightly theirs. Democrats should continue to oppose the give-more-to-those-who-need-it-least proposals, including the end of the alternative minimum tax, weakening of the inheritance tax and lower rates for high earners. But the Democrats should make clear what they could support and vote for: Republican proposals for a much higher standard deduction, lower corporate taxes and a simplified tax code. One conclusion from the recent state elections is that voters are desperate for a functioning government. The Republicans’ self-immolation on health care demonstrates the sterility of “just say no.” Saying “yes” to acceptable parts of the Republican tax agenda could focus the debate on the other parts.

"The Republican tax proposals were bad from the get-go. But they have become steadily worse as they have been turned into bills, which seem so cartoonishly evil they could have been dreamed up by Mr. Burns from “The Simpsons.” Consider the latest changes to the Senate tax-cut bill being championed by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and his merry band. It lavishes generous permanent tax breaks on corporations, while modest tax cuts for the middle class would vanish into thin air after 2025. Millionaires would enjoy average tax cuts of $5,580 in 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, at which point families earning less than $75,000 a year would pay more taxes. Let that sink in. This tax bill would take money from working families and give it to the world’s wealthiest people. The hardest hit would be in high-cost states like California, New Jersey and New York because the bill gets rid of important deductions and the credit for state and local taxes. Further, it calls for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate for most people to have health insurance. This would leave 13 million people without insurance and drive up premiums for many others who are already struggling to afford coverage, all in the interest of reducing spending by $338 billion so Republican lawmakers can cut taxes for big businesses, despite Democratic opposition.

"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. BONN, Germany — The senior American diplomat at the United Nations climate talks here told world leaders Thursday that the United States would remain engaged in global climate change negotiations even as it planned to exit the Paris agreement “at the earliest opportunity.” Judith G. Garber, a State Department acting undersecretary, gave the first official American remarks to the United Nations climate body since President Trump announced in June that he would abandon the Paris deal. It was a far more conciliatory message than a presentation earlier in the week by White House officials promoting fossil fuels, which drew catcalls and a walkout. “President Trump has made clear the U.S. position with respect to the Paris agreement,” Ms. Garber said. “Although he has indicated that the United States intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people.” Ms. Garber’s address made no mention of coal while promising to help other countries “adapt to the impacts of climate change.” It was the only mention of climate change in the three-minute presentation, but that was one more than many Trump administration critics had expected. And in contrast to the noisy protests that greeted the White House fossil fuel event, Ms. Garber’s speech in a tightly-controlled plenary hall was met with polite applause. "
"Supporters and critics of the Republican tax bills argue over their effect on middle-class Americans, but there is one group that everyone agrees would come out ahead: the millionaires and billionaires who have to reckon with the estate tax. As Steven Mnuchin, President Trump’s Treasury secretary, bluntly declared last month, “Obviously, the estate tax, I will concede, disproportionately helps rich people.” As it is now, the estate tax affects a small set of wealthy Americans, applying only when someone leaves assets worth more than $5.49 million to heirs. Together, parents can leave $11 million to their children without paying a penny in estate taxes. Last year, for example, more than 2.6 million people died in the United States. Of the estates filed with the Internal Revenue Service, 5,219 — or 0.2 percent of the total — were large enough to qualify for the tax. The kind of households that could potentially owe money, however, include Mr. Trump’s, Mr. Mnuchin’s, and those of several cabinet members and advisers, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Gary Cohn, chief of the National Economic Council. (An analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund concluded that the estate tax repeal could save Mr. Trump’s estate more than $1 billion, and those of his cabinet members $3.5 billion.)

"R. J. Barrett is only 17 years old, but he is already a world traveler. Raised in suburban Toronto, he plays basketball for a high school in Montverde, Fla. Last summer, he led Canada to the gold medal in the under-19 world championship in Egypt, and next month, he and his teammates at Montverde Academy, which has one of the nation’s top basketball programs, will travel to Beijing for a high-profile international tournament. But before they go, Montverde Coach Kevin Boyle plans to have a long, serious talk with everyone. And after the recent incident in which three U.C.L.A. basketball players were detained in China for a week, accused of shoplifting and then freed only after the intervention of President Trump, Boyle expects to have his players’ full attention. “It’s definitely going to be a point that we’re going to bring up,” Boyle said in a telephone interview this week. “It’s a different culture and there are expectations of your family and the school, and then, furthermore, you’re in a Communist country. If you do something dumb, you’re not in the United States.” He added, “It’s not the American justice system, so it’s definitely going to be something that you want to point to that this is not a joke, and don’t think you can steal a pack of gum.” In a reflection both of basketball’s increased appeal to China and the way top-tier high school basketball has become big business, Montverde Academy will be joined in Beijing by two other American high school teams: Providence Day School of Charlotte, N.C., and Chaminade College Prep of Canoga Park, Calif. The teams will play in a round-robin format against one another and six Chinese teams from Dec. 6 to 9 at various sites. Montverde’s presence in China is only partly about basketball, though. Like U.C.L.A. and other colleges that have sent teams abroad, Montverde is using the trip to sell itself. A private school housed on a lush campus just west of Orlando, Montverde has an extensive international presence in its corridors, including more than 60 students from China. And like the American college programs that have visited China, or plan to, it hopes to attract even more. "
