"When Walmart invited me to visit one of its job training programs in late June, I wasn’t sure it was a story. But new to the retail beat, I decided to take the chance and visit Fulton, N.Y., a small city near Syracuse, where the giant retailer runs one of its regional training centers called Walmart Academy. I wanted to understand how the nation’s largest private employer was imparting new skills on its vast work force of 1.2 million people. When I got there, an academy teacher stood at a whiteboard discussing various inventory and merchandising challenges with about a dozen store supervisors. After only a few minutes, I was lost in soup of corporate acronyms, slogans and minutiae — and no closer to determining whether this training will actually help Walmart workers get ahead in life (or just make them better at selling things). I feared the trip had been a waste. But it turned out — as it so often does — that the story was somewhere else entirely. As we left the academy class, one of the managers pointed out a pile of bricks displayed on a cabinet in the back of the store, painted with the yellow Walmart sunshine logo. One of them had a plaque that read “Walmart Academy: Building a Solid Foundation for Our Future Leaders.” “Where did the bricks come from?” I asked. The manager said they had been pulled out of the former Nestlé factory that was being demolished in Fulton. It had made chocolate for generations and employed hundreds of people before it closed in 2003, devastating the local economy. Many of the employees working in the Walmart, he said, are the grandchildren or relatives of former Nestlé workers. And from there, the story began to take shape: It wasn’t so much about job training, but about what it looks like when Walmart becomes the equivalent of the new factory in a ruined factory town. "
"The culture wars that have consumed politics in the United States have now landed on Silicon Valley’s doorstep. That became clear this week after Google on Monday fired a software engineer, James Damore, who had written an internal memo challenging the company’s diversity efforts. The firing set off a furious debate over Google’s handling of the situation, with some accusing the company of silencing the engineer for speaking his mind. Supporters of women in tech praised Google. But for the right, it became a potent symbol of the tech industry’s intolerance of ideological diversity. Silicon Valley’s politics have long skewed left, with a free-market’s philosophy and a dash of libertarianism. But that goes only so far, with recent episodes putting the tech industry under the microscope for how it penalizes people for expressing dissenting opinions. Mr. Damore’s firing has now plunged the nation’s technology capital into some of the same debates that have engulfed the rest of the country. Such fractures have been building in Silicon Valley for some time, reaching even into its highest echelons. The tensions became evident last year with the rise of Donald J. Trump, when a handful of people from the industry who publicly supported the then-presidential candidate faced blowback for their political decisions. At Facebook, Peter Thiel, an investor and member of the social network’s board of directors, was told he would receive a negative evaluation of his board performance for supporting Mr. Trump by a peer, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix. And Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus VR, a virtual reality start-up owned by Facebook, was pressured to leave the company after it was revealed that he had secretly funded a pro-Trump organization.

"WASHINGTON — The impending release of a key government report on climate change will force President Trump to choose between accepting the conclusions of his administration’s scientists and the demands of his conservative supporters, who remain deeply unconvinced that humans are the cause of the planet’s warming. A White House official said on Tuesday that it was still reviewing the draft document that was written by scientists, some of whom have said they fear Mr. Trump will seek to bury it or alter its contents before it is formally released. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the administration would not comment on the report before its scheduled release this fall. But the looming publication of the climate report — which concludes that “evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans” — once again raises a contentious policy issue that has deeply divided Mr. Trump’s closest advisers since he arrived in the Oval Office. Like his June decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Mr. Trump’s response to the scientific conclusions in the forthcoming Climate Science Special Report will have broad implications for the American scientific community; local and state governments; and the global effort to combat the effects of rising temperatures that are already unfolding. “We’ll be watching the administration very carefully on this,” said Kassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity, which sued President George W. Bush after his administration repeatedly stalled the release of a previous climate change assessment. Ms. Siegel said her group would be “assessing all legal options, and returning to court at the earliest possible time to ensure that this essential report is released as required.” "
"The sexual harassment scandal at Fox News has cost its parent company 21st Century Fox tens of millions of dollars, untold reputational damage and some of its biggest personalities. And the drama is far from over. At a confidential mediation proceeding in late July, the lawyer Douglas H. Wigdor asked for more than $60 million to settle several disputes with Fox News and 21st Century Fox, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Wigdor proposed that the settlement be paid in a lump sum, giving him the discretion to distribute the payments, according to one of the people. Those cases included gender- and racial-discrimination lawsuits against the company that Mr. Wigdor had filed on behalf of more than 20 current and former employees in the last several months and at least one explosive complaint that had not yet been made public. The company would not accept Mr. Wigdor’s offer and no resolution was reached, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. Mr. Wigdor’s proposal to settle the disparate cases altogether is considered unusual, as it is rare that there are multiple suits with the same lawyer against the same party. Also, cases typically vary greatly in their merit, making them difficult to value as a group. After mediation failed, Mr. Wigdor went public last week with that explosive case, filing a defamation and racial-discrimination lawsuit against 21st Century Fox and Fox News that focused on an article about the death of Seth Rich, a young aide for the Democratic National Committee. The suit included accusations that the White House and a wealthy Trump supporter pushed Fox News to publish an article on its website as part of a scheme to end speculation about the president’s ties to Russia. Mr. Wigdor brought the suit on behalf of Rod Wheeler, a private detective involved in the case who said that Fox News had fabricated quotations from him in the article. Fox News, which later retracted the article, has denied the claims. Mr. Wigdor then announced on Monday that he had sent a letter to the British authority scrutinizing 21st Century Fox’s $15 billion bid for Sky, a European satellite giant. In the letter, he outlined evidence that he said showed that the company had not been transparent during the regulatory review; failed to adequately clean house after its harassment scandals; knowingly disseminated fake news, including the Seth Rich article; and did not live up to an earlier agreement to change its corporate culture.

"Tensions with North Korea escalated on Tuesday as the nuclear-armed state toughened its criticism of the United States and its allies and threatened retaliation in response to United Nations sanctions. In response, President Trump warned that the country would “be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continued to threaten the United States. What follows is a collection of partisan writing from across the political spectrum in response to the developments. Have feedback on this series? Let us know. Email us at ourpicks@nytimes.com. • Noah Rothman in Commentary: “The time for good options is passed.” Mr. Rothman argues that the United States is at a “tipping point” in its relations with North Korea. The American government has two choices before it, neither of which is good. Either policy makers implicitly allow the Asian country to continue developing nuclear weapons, and pin hopes on a program of deterrence, or they pursue the “near impossible task” of neutralizing North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, Mr. Rothman writes.

He enumerates the risks of preventive action against North Korea, writing that we cannot be sure such pre-emptive moves won’t start a second Korean War. Read more » "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s warning on Tuesday that North Korea would experience “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continued threatening the United States was a remarkable escalation of military rhetoric with little precedent in the modern era, historians and analysts said. Mr. Trump’s menacing remarks echoed the tone and cadence of President Harry S. Truman, who, in a 1945 address announcing that the United States had dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, urged the Japanese to surrender, warning that if they did not, “they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.” It is not clear whether Mr. Trump intended the historical parallel — White House officials did not respond to questions about how much planning went into his brief statement, or what was intended by the alliterative language — but it was a stark break with decades of more measured presidential responses to brewing foreign conflicts. “It’s hard to think of a president using more extreme language during crisis like this before,” said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. “Presidents usually try to use language that is even more moderate than what they may be feeling in private, because they’ve always been worried that their language might escalate a crisis.” Mr. Truman delivered his muscular message at a time when the United States had an overwhelming military advantage over Japan, which did not have a nuclear weapon; Mr. Trump’s threat was aimed instead at a government that has developed nuclear weapons and has been testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. President Dwight D. Eisenhower used to say that the more shrill the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was in the language he used against the United States — promising “we will bury you” and “we’re turning out missiles like sausages” — the more tempered he would be, Mr. Beschloss said. "
"I was talking the other day to a wise executive friend and he recalled for me something his favorite boss liked to say: When people rise to the top of an organization and get power, they usually do one of two things: “They either swell or they grow.” Donald Trump has swollen. Every character flaw he had before taking office — from his serial lying to his intellectual laziness to his loyalty just to himself and his needs — has grown only larger and more toxic as he has been president. He seems not to have grown a whit in the job. He has surprised only on the downside — never once challenging his own base with new thinking or appearing to be remotely interested in being president of all the people, not just his base. What strikes me most about Trump, though, is how easily he still could become more popular — fast — if he just behaved like a normal leader for a month: if he reached out to Democrats on health care, taxes or infrastructure; stopped insulting every newsperson who writes critically about him; stopped lying; stopped tweeting inanities; and actually apologized for some of his most egregious actions and asked for forgiveness. Americans are a forgiving people. With the Dow at 22,000 and unemployment at 4.3 percent, oh my God, this guy could actually become more popular outside his base without much effort. That’s scary. But, as I said, it would require Trump doing something he has shown no ability or willingness to do — to grow in office, not just swell. Still, Democrats would be wise not to count on Trump swelling forever or on Robert Mueller taking him down. Whatever happens, Democrats need to win the argument with at least some Trump/G.O.P. voters. There are many ways for Democrats to counter any new and improved Trump. I’d start by acknowledging a simple fact: Some things are true even if Donald Trump believes them! That is, Trump’s core base of support — those people who he says would stick by him even if he shot someone “in the middle of Fifth Avenue” — are people who have heard and appreciated all his nativist dog whistles: from his slur that Barack Obama was not born in America to his focus on voter suppression to his restricting transgender people in the military to his reversing affirmative action and imposing immigration restrictions. That white nationalist constituency is beyond the reach — for good reason — of any Democratic candidate. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump intervened Tuesday in the special Senate election in Alabama, bestowing a coveted endorsement on Senator Luther Strange a week before a Republican primary that has been fought, in part, over who has been most loyal to the president. In a surprise move that caught many in the Republican Party off guard, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. Strange “has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama.” Mr. Trump’s decision to wade into the race to fill the seat left vacant by Attorney General Jeff Sessions will test just how much clout the president enjoys among Republicans in a state where he remains highly popular. Mr. Strange has been locked in a close race with Representative Mo Brooks and Roy Moore, the controversial former state Supreme Court justice. There are also a number of other, lesser-known Republicans vying for the nomination. If nobody gets over 50 percent in the Aug. 15 vote, the party’s nominee will be decided in a September runoff. Mr. Strange, who heard from the president about his plans earlier Tuesday, had been lobbying for weeks to win Mr. Trump’s support, singing the president’s praises in TV ads, online and through as many Fox News appearances he could schedule. Mr. Strange and his allies also have made Mr. Brooks’s attacks last year on Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign a centerpiece of the primary. "
"The Sinclair Broadcast Group’s proposed acquisition of Tribune Media has ignited expected opposition from left-leaning advocacy groups that deplore news media consolidation and the right-leaning commentary the company pushes out to its local television stations. But a more unlikely group has recently joined the chorus of critics: conservative media outlets that say that the merger will limit competition and wipe out independent voices. This week, Newsmax, whose founder, Christopher Ruddy, is a close associate of President Trump, filed a petition urging the Federal Communications Commission to deny the Sinclair-Tribune combination. One America News Network, a cable network that has championed the Trump administration’s agenda, and The Blaze, a news and entertainment network started by Glenn Beck, have also pressed for a careful assessment of the merger. “A free and diverse press, a bedrock principle of American democracy, will be crippled by this proposed merger,” Newsmax said in its filing. “The level of media concentration proposed by this transaction will homogenize the content available to U.S. consumers, eliminate unique viewpoints and reduce press diversity, especially in the delivery of local news.” In a separate filing, One America News Network and The Blaze, along with several other independent programmers from across the political spectrum, presented a similar case. “Regardless of political affiliation, we should agree that robust democracy demands a variety of viewpoints from a myriad of sources,” they wrote. “Yet the wave of consolidation across the industry threatens this core value. And the Sinclair-Tribune merger would exacerbate this troubling tendency.” "
"Nearly 25 years after a nationwide chain of beauty and secretarial schools was closed for defrauding students, the Department of Education has agreed to help victims wipe clean their burdensome federal student loan debts. More than 36,000 students — mostly low-income, immigrant women — who attended schools run by Wilfred American Educational Corporation could potentially be affected by the settlement, which was approved by a federal court judge on Tuesday. “The department has been collecting on these loans for decades, including by garnishing wages and intercepting income tax refunds,” said Jane Greengold Stevens, the director of litigation at New York Legal Assistance Group, a nonprofit representing the former students. “Finally, by entering this settlement, the department is providing the students an opportunity to get out from under the burden of these loans.” The case underscores how long the federal government has been wrestling with the issue of corrupt for-profit vocational schools that deceive vulnerable and poor students about the costs of training programs and the prospect of landing jobs. Even as this decades-old case is being resolved, Education Department officials, attorneys general, lawmakers, advocates and former students are battling over more recent cases involving the erasure of billions of additional dollars in federally guaranteed loans that were taken out by students who were defrauded. “We hope the lawsuit, and the settlement, will encourage the department to take steps in the future to prevent for-profit schools from engaging in fraudulent activity, to keep borrowers from becoming victims in the first place,” Ms. Greengold Stevens said. The last of Wilfred Academy’s for-profit beauty and vocational schools was shuttered in 1994 after federal investigations into crimes that included financial aid fraud, false certification, racketeering, wire fraud and embezzlement. The company’s president and other employees were convicted of fraud. "
"WASHINGTON — Five transgender people serving in the United States military sued President Trump and top Pentagon officials on Wednesday, asking that transgender troops be allowed to stay in the military. The lawsuit was filed in response to Mr. Trump’s ban abruptly announced last month on Twitter. The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit under pseudonyms — “Jane Doe” Nos. 1-5 — in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was organized by two rights groups, the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, or GLAD. Other rights groups — like Lambda, Outserve and the American Civil Liberties Union — have also said they are preparing lawsuits but are holding off until the Trump administration takes a step to put the ban into effect, such as issuing formal guidance to the military or beginning the process of changing military rules. But Shannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said he believed the case was already ripe for a lawsuit because active transgender service members — such as those deciding whether to re-enlist — were already being harmed by the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s statements on Twitter. “It is critical to act now because the harms are happening now,” Mr. Minter said. “These service members deserve to know where they stand.” A 2014 study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimated that about 8,800 transgender people were serving on active duty, with thousands more in the National Guard and reserve; a 2016 study by the RAND Corporation estimated that there were about 2,450 such active-duty troops.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s aides knew he planned to deliver a tough message to North Korea on Tuesday, but they did not expect a threat that rivaled the apocalyptic taunts often used by his target, Kim Jong-un. The president’s language, which aides say he had used in private, escalated the long-running dispute with North Korea to a new level and left members of the Trump administration scrambling on Wednesday to explain what he meant. But the process, or lack of one, that led to the ad-libbed comments embodied Mr. Trump’s overall approach to foreign policy, an improvisational style that often leaves his national security team in the dark about what he is going to say or do, according to several people with direct knowledge of how the episode unfolded. The president was in a confrontational mood on Tuesday afternoon after The Washington Post reported that Pyongyang had developed nuclear warheads small enough to be placed on ballistic missiles. His team assumed that he would be asked about North Korea during a scheduled media appearance tied to a meeting the president was planning to hold at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., about the opioid epidemic. But during a conference call beforehand that focused on North Korea, Mr. Trump did not offer a preview of what he planned to say — and aides did not press the president, who resists being told what to say, even on a tinderbox issue that has induced his predecessors to seek the safety of a script. He told his aides only that he wanted to signal to Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, that he was not backing down — while turning up the pressure he has tried to place on China to tame its troublesome neighbor and on-and-off ally.

"The United Nations on Wednesday named Alison Smale, a veteran correspondent and editor at The New York Times, as its most senior official in charge of shaping the 193-member organization’s global public image. As the next under secretary general for global communications, Ms. Smale, 62, will join the cabinet of the United Nations’ top leader, Secretary General António Guterres, and be among a small circle of influential women around him. Mr. Guterres has been under enormous pressure to show that he can deliver gender equity in the leadership of the United Nations. Having defeated several women for the organization’s top job last year, he had promised to appoint women to senior posts. Ms. Smale, a British citizen, is currently The Times’ bureau chief in Berlin. She had been the executive editor of The International Herald Tribune, based in Paris, for four years, before it was renamed The International New York Times in 2013. She was the first woman to head that newspaper. After joining The Times in 1998, Ms. Smale became deputy foreign editor in 2002. Before that, she had reported extensively across Europe for The Associated Press, covering the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and war in the Balkans in the 1990s. She was posted in Moscow from 1983 to 1987 and is fluent in Russian. Ms. Smale’s appointment to the United Nations is unusual partly because she comes directly out of journalism. Her recent predecessors had come mainly from government service, including Cristina Gallach of Spain, who was under secretary general for communications and public information until mid-April. One of Ms. Smale’s major challenges will be to explain to the world why the United Nations matters, at a time when its effectiveness, and even its relevance, are under increased scrutiny. The organization also faces acute pressure from its biggest funder: the United States, which under President Donald J. Trump, has threatened to cut funding. Washington pays 22 percent of the United Nations’ core budget and 28 percent of its peacekeeping budget. The Department of Public Information, which Ms. Smale will head, was criticized last year for a campaign to promote Wonder Woman as its mascot for gender equality. Women’s rights advocates, including many United Nations staff members, were angry that a cartoon character had been chosen to promote the idea instead of real women in real leadership posts. "
"American anxiety over North Korea spiked on Tuesday when President Trump warned that, if the country makes any more threats against the United States, it “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” Social media filled with nervous jokes and at times outright panic over whether Mr. Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, could bluster their way into unintended nuclear war. Some posted maps showing what the blast areas of a nuclear strike in Washington or New York might look like. Others asked whether it was time to build a bomb shelter. The Trump administration seemed to cultivate this sense of alarm. Sebastian Gorka, a White House adviser, told Fox News that the standoff was “analogous to the Cuban missile crisis,” which nearly brought the United States and Soviet Union to war. North Korea’s nuclear program is deadly serious, but research on the nature of foreign threats and nuclear weapons, as well as North Korea’s own track record, suggests that Americans can hold off on building those bomb shelters. Here are five reasons the danger may not be as scary as you’ve heard. The George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations both threatened war, setting red lines that Pyongyang almost always went on to cross. Mr. Bush even declared North Korea to be one third of the “axis of evil,” along with Iraq, which the United States military invaded the next year. "
"Smashing things may not seem at first blush to be a winning idea to wrap a business around. Since March, however, nearly 1,500 people have shown up to break housewares, electronics and furniture at the Wrecking Club, two reinforced rooms in the basement of a building in the garment district of Manhattan. Many of this number are couples looking for something more piquant than the usual date-night fare, said Tom Daly, the Wrecking Club’s proprietor. But rage is not confined to matrimony and other romantic unions, as Mr. Daly has also found. “That’s the cool thing about addressing an instinct,” he said on a recent steamy afternoon. “Everyone’s got it.” The Wrecking Club is not the first rage-based enterprise. Last fall, politics drove the business at the Anger Room, which opened in Dallas in 2008. Clients showed up by the hundreds to batter human effigies of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. Three Trump mannequins and two Clintons were utterly destroyed, according to the owner, Donna Alexander, and had to be replaced. The Rage Room, which first opened in Toronto in 2015, now has licensees in Budapest, Singapore, Australia and Britain. “We’ve helped a lot of angry couples,” said Stephen Shew, the owner. (His date-night package, $70 for two electronic devices and 20 items of crockery, from lawn gnomes to ceramic vases, is wildly popular on Valentine’s Day.) "
"For decades North Korea threatened American “imperialists” and our South Korean allies with a “sea of fire” and retribution for trying to contain their conventional and nuclear weapons programs. North Korean leaders have made as much noise as a small yappy dog confronting a placidly tolerant Rottweiler trying to take away its nuclear bone. President Trump, seemingly oblivious to America’s dominant military, economic and political status, has borrowed from North Korean state media scripts by bombastically threatening Pyongyang on Tuesday with “fire and fury” and an unspecified assault “the likes of which this world has never seen before.” Since the world has witnessed the horror of atomic bombs used by the United States on Japan at the end of World War II — weapons much smaller than the nuclear weapons being built by North Korea — these words are alarming. Unfortunately, we can’t simply dismiss the president’s words out of hand. He is on the record in a 1999 NBC interview noting that “the biggest problem this world has is nuclear proliferation,” but then appearing to entertain a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea before they have “warheads, every one of them pointing to New York City, to Washington.” He dismissed an observation by his interviewer, Tim Russert, that military commanders have warned against such pre-emptive military action. The president’s cabinet therefore needs to emphasize the human cost of trying to eliminate North Korea’s plutonium- and uranium-based nuclear facilities and weapons. The costs would be staggering — possibly millions of South Korean and thousands of American lives. And because we presumably don’t know where all the nuclear facilities, material, scientists and weapons are hidden, and because North Korea has mobile ground launchers, a major military strike might not even succeed. The only solution is a multipronged strategy aimed at containing the threat posed by North Korea. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, came to power at the end of 2011 with three main objectives: consolidate his power, prevent international actors from overthrowing his regime and carrying out gradual economic reform so the Kim dynasty could retain power over the long run.

"ROME — It would be an understatement of the obvious to say that Europeans cherish their summer break. But after an intense spring of negotiations over Britain’s impending exit from the European Union, the incessant influx of illegal migrants, repeated terrorist attacks alongside banking crises and populist uprisings, can the Continent’s political class really afford weeks of slow and steady recharging? Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and much of the European Union leadership in Brussels have, as in years past, decamped for extended getaways. But others, perhaps more mindful of the negative optics of frolicking as crises loom, have left the long beach holidays of yore to quiver like mirages in the Mediterranean sun. Emmanuel Macron, the newly elected president of France, who is already suffering a postelection plunge in the polls, will take but a “few days of vacation in France” after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to the Élysée press officer. Mr. Macron’s aide declined to specify exactly when or where the president would go, but insisted he would remain “available at any time.” The daily Le Parisien wrote Tuesday that the young leader, who seeks to upend the nation’s labor code by September, must avoid the “bling bling” holidays enjoyed by his predecessors, and noted, “The president is applying to himself the same self-denial that he has demanded of the French people.” Mr. Macron gave his cabinet ministers two weeks off along with instructions to remain within striking distance of Paris in case of emergency. They are apparently unaffected by a new law allowing workers to disconnect from work email when out of the office. "
"WASHINGTON — The head of the Veterans Affairs Department told lawmakers he intends to try out a new law that makes it easier to fire — and keep fired — deficient department employees. The test case: the former director of the agency’s main medical center here. The center’s director, Brian Hawkins, oversaw an operation that the department’s inspector general said was plagued by the “highest levels of chaos.” After the inspector general findings were released in a rare interim report in April, the department immediately transferred Mr. Hawkins to a job at its nearby headquarters. It then fired him in late July, saying in a statement that he had “failed to provide effective leadership at the medical center” or live up to the department’s values. But now, the government’s Merit Systems Protection Board has issued a stay on the removal proceedings, buying Mr. Hawkins time to build a defense that he was wrongly terminated and return to work. That, in turn, has opened the door for David Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs, to put to a high profile test the powers of the new law, signed in June by President Trump. The law is meant to help the secretary remove bad actors and restore trust in the more than 350,000-person agency. To do so, Mr. Shulkin has indicated to congressional leaders that he plans to abandon the earlier effort to oust Mr. Hawkins. Instead, he would remove Mr. Hawkins with fresh evidence from the inspector general and do it using the new law, which affords fewer protections for the accused. It was unclear when Mr. Shulkin intends to make such a move. Mr. Hawkins could challenge the action in court or appeal it to a new, internal review board composed of his fellow senior executives. A lawyer representing Mr. Hawkins could not immediately be reached for comment. "
"When James Damore, a Google engineer, was fired this week for writing a 10-page manifesto spelling out his grievances with the company’s progressive values and positing that biological differences explained the tech industry’s gender gap, it might have seemed like the end of a bizarre, short-lived morality tale. But for the alt-right, the battle was just beginning. Minutes after Mr. Damore’s firing was announced, a flurry of right-wing websites, message boards and social media cliques sprang into action, eager to paint the episode as another example of liberal political correctness run amok. A headline on Breitbart, the conservative news site, screamed in capital letters about “blacklists.” Users on Twitter and 4chan, the message board beloved by pro-Trump types, began to organize a boycott of Google’s services. Milo Yiannopoulos, the alt-right provocateur, called Mr. Damore’s firing “disgusting” in a Facebook post, and offered to help him land on his feet. For alt-right activists, who occupy the rightmost flanks of a powerful conservative internet subculture, Google’s response to Mr. Damore’s memo was low-hanging fruit for mockery. But there is another reason that the alt-right’s opposition campaign appeared so quickly, with such well-practiced maneuvers. For the last several months, far-right activists have mounted an aggressive political campaign against some of Silicon Valley’s biggest players. Extending their attacks beyond social networks like Facebook and Twitter, tech’s typical free-speech battlegrounds, they have accused a long list of companies, including Airbnb, PayPal and Patreon, of censoring right-wing views, and have pledged to expose Silicon Valley for what they say is a pervasive, industrywide liberal bias. Complaints like these might once have been easily dismissed. But in the Trump era, as the right wing’s internet warriors have refined their tactics and gained legitimate political influence, they are putting Silicon Valley in an uncomfortable position. "
"Back in January, when I wrote a profile of Sean Spicer, President Trump’s first press secretary, I wanted to introduce readers to the man occupying a key position in the White House, the public face of the administration and its chief liaison to the news media. I didn’t expect to be writing about his replacement so soon. Last week, I returned to the West Wing — a little more than six months since Mr. Spicer told me he was “not here to be someone’s buddy” — and sat down with his former deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was promoted to press secretary in July after Mr. Spicer abruptly resigned. It was Ms. Sanders’s final meeting before the West Wing closed for a summer renovation, and her office was almost bare. A lone houseplant, a holdover from the Obama administration, drooped from a high shelf. “I’ve kept it alive until the last month and now it’s just fallen apart,” she told me. Was that a metaphor? She laughed. “No, the plant — it just didn’t make it.” As a media correspondent for The Times, I cover the intersection of journalism and politics, a juncture that has seen its share of pileups this year. The president labeled the mainstream media “the enemy of the American people.” The White House briefing turned into a daily grudge match over the nature of transparency and truth. Alarms are sounding about an erosion of press freedoms once thought sacrosanct in a democracy. The White House press secretary plays a central role in that debate. Ms. Sanders, who at 34 is among the youngest people to hold the title, must manage the message of her administration and liaise with dozens of reporters, while also acting as a frequent vessel of Mr. Trump’s anti-media ire.

"President Trump threatened nuclear war with North Korea, and the markets yawned. While stocks in Asia sold off initially, the main market measures in the United States fell less than half a percent on Wednesday and ended the day nearly unchanged, as investors stuck to focusing on buoyant economic fundamentals and ignoring the chaos of American politics. But beneath the calm there were signs that investors — who have been conditioned since the presidential election in November to embrace risk instead of running from it — are becoming more cautious. The price of gold, a traditional safe investment, has been rising, and on Wednesday it continued its march, increasing more than 1 percent on the day. Gold’s strong move pushed it just barely ahead of the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index for the year — up 10.75 percent, compared with 10.69 percent for the S.&P., according to Y Charts, a data-gathering company. On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 and the narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended the day virtually flat. Earlier, the Nikkei index in Japan closed down 1.29 percent, while the Kospi index in South Korea ended down 1.10 percent. European stocks were also lower, with London down 0.56 percent and Frankfurt down 1.12 percent. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • With alarm spreading across Asia, some U.S. officials continued to follow President Trump’s tough — and apparently improvised — line against North Korea’s nuclear belligerence. But Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, sought to ease the sense of crisis as he returned from a regional trip. “Nothing I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours,” he said at a refueling stop on Guam, the very island the North threatened to attack. Pyongyang said it was drawing up plans to launch missiles into waters near Guam to teach President Trump a lesson. Here’s a video that explains more about the island, which is home to a U.S. air base. If you live there, we’d like to hear how you feel about the threat. Here are answers to four crucial questions about the standoff, and five reasons the danger may not be as scary as it seems. "
"WASHINGTON — In an early-morning tweet Wednesday, President Trump claimed undue credit for revamping the nation’s nuclear arsenal, wrongly suggested tremendous progress had been made since he took office, and misrepresented the sequence and scope of his executive actions. “My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before,” he wrote on Twitter, after exchanging escalating statements with North Korea this week. Efforts to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal — including intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, strategic bombers, warheads and infrastructure — began under President Barack Obama, and will span three decades at a cost of about a trillion dollars. The size and strength of the United States’ nuclear arsenal remains virtually unchanged since Mr. Trump took office. Since January, when the United States had a stockpile of 4,018 warheads, “a small number of warheads are thought to have been retired for an estimated 4,000 remaining in the stockpile,” according to the Federation of Atomic Scientists. The Arms Control Association, a Washington-based group, has reported no change in its estimate since January. Many of the modernized weapons will not be available for use until the 2020s or later. A July report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute notes that a new intercontinental ballistic missile is scheduled to replace the Minuteman III in 2028, a next-generation ballistic submarine is expected to supplant the Ohio class in 2031 and the successor to B-52 bombers will become available in the 2030s and 2040s. There has been no significant change in nuclear modernization plans under Mr. Trump, said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “In fairness, there has not been time for such plans to have been prepared, reviewed and implemented, so this is not a surprise,” he said. Mr. Trump’s “first order” refers to a Jan. 27 presidential memorandum ordering a new Nuclear Posture Review, characterized by the Pentagon as “legislatively mandated” and the basis of nuclear policy. While the review may recommend changes, as a 2010 review by Mr. Obama did, it has yet to be completed. Eight other memorandums and four executive orders — including ones terminating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, calling for the construction of a border wall and urging the repeal of the Affordable Care act — preceded it. Similarly, it is also premature for Mr. Trump to consider his proposed 11 percent increase to the National Nuclear Security Administration’s budget a fait accompli. Even if Congress passes Mr. Trump’s budget without changes, it does not apply until the beginning of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1. Kingston Reif, who researches nuclear disarmament at the Arms Control Association, pointed out that the United States has long had powerful nuclear capabilities. “The U.S. nuclear arsenal was second to none even before the ambitious upgrade project launched by the Obama administration,” Mr. Reif said.

"To the Editor: Re “In Chilling Nuclear Terms, Trump Warns North Korea” (front page, Aug. 9): I understand why President Trump foments furor over North Korea; it is his modus operandi, and it works. But the notion that North Korea is preparing an offensive war seems an utter fantasy divorced from historical precedent or logic. This third generation of family rule in North Korea is interested in self-preservation, period. It is a nasty regime, but not unintelligent. It recognizes that any external aggression would mean its extinction, and it remembers well the Muammar el-Qaddafi example in Libya. It rattles its sabers. For evidence that any imminent war is fantasy we need look no further than the reaction of the South Koreans. There calm largely prevails, and new initiatives for dialogue with the North have lately begun. The danger, it seems to me, would lie in so impoverishing the North with sanctions that it sells atomic weaponry to nonstate actors that are our real enemies. DAVID ROHN, PUTNEY, VT. To the Editor: On Tuesday, in the midst of the week that marks the 72nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, President Trump warned North Korea that any further threats to the United States “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” Really, Mr. Trump? Never? I understand that you are not much of a reader, but might I suggest one exception to peruse during your working vacation: “Hiroshima,” by John Hersey, a firsthand account of the devastation of that city.

"“If you can remember anything about the ’60s,” the musician Paul Kantner (among others) said, “you weren’t really there.” In “Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001–2011” ($26.99), Lizzy Goodman chronicles another gauzy decade in an evocative and gossipy oral history that’s over 600 pages. Not only was Ms. Goodman there (she worked as a waitress in the same restaurant as Nick Valensi, the lead guitarist for the Strokes), but as our revelatory tour guide, she shrewdly jogged the memories of her protagonists. Covering the mid-1990s through 2011, Ms. Goodman offers up interviews with the Strokes, Interpol, Kings of Leon and lesser-known groups (not so much real bands as “co-conspirators, comrades in the pursuit of ‘youth and abandon’”) with whom she mixed at night in her early 20s while her day job was teaching at the Buckley School. The result is an affectionate, idiosyncratic narrative of the rock scene’s erratic evolution: the migration from the Bohemian pre-gentrified Lower East Side (where she lived) to Williamsburg in Brooklyn; the dispiriting impact of 9/11; and the demise of the record industry as a result of illegal downloading. Ms. Goodman, a journalist who has written for The New York Times, convincingly leaves readers (as she told The Observer) as if they’re “overhearing the raddest cocktail party ever, with everyone who shaped that world chatting freely, as if there’s no journalist in the room.” That’s the upside of verbatim interviews. “The nature of memory is imprecise even though we’re sure about all sorts of things,” she told Rolling Stone. “That goes 100 times for complex and emotional drug- and booze-soaked and years-ago memories. What’s rad about an oral history is that all those memories can coexist.” "
"As a federal commission searches for evidence of voter fraud and many states try to impose new voting restrictions, a city in Maryland may move in the opposite direction: allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. In College Park, home to the University of Maryland’s flagship campus, the City Council is debating a measure introduced by Councilwoman Christine Nagle that would give noncitizens — a broad category that includes green card holders, students with visas and undocumented immigrants — the right to cast ballots for the city’s mayor, council members and other local officials. Startling though it may seem, the proposal has extensive precedent both in the United States and worldwide: Forty states used to allow noncitizen voting, and dozens of countries currently do. “The mayor and City Council are not deciding national policy,” Ms. Nagle wrote in an email. “We make decisions about trash pickup, snow removal and equipment for the parks. I think we have shared concerns with our neighbors regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens.” She added: “Our neighbors have children in school, work, pay property taxes and income taxes, and make their home in College Park just like we do. As residents of our community, I think, they also should be able to have a say in electing the city’s leadership.” From 2011 to 2015, according to the United States Census Bureau, 21.1 percent of College Park’s population was foreign-born. That number includes naturalized citizens as well as the residents affected by the proposal. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who suggested this week that the president harbored “excessive expectations” about the pace of congressional progress. “Senator Mitch McConnell said I had ‘excessive expectations,’ but I don’t think so,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon, as he and lawmakers took time away from Washington during the August recess. “After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?” The executive scolding followed the president’s bitter disappointment with the Senate’s failure to dismantle the Affordable Care Act last month — and supplied perhaps the most potent evidence yet that Mr. Trump, seething over the lack of major achievements in his first year, will not hesitate to train fire on allies. Before Mr. Trump’s tweet, he spoke by phone with Mr. McConnell to express his disappointment in the senator’s comments, according to a person with knowledge of the call. Growing animated, Mr. Trump emphasized that he would continue to push for a repeal, the person said, and suggested Mr. McConnell do the same. Mr. McConnell’s office declined to confirm the call or address questions about it. His message echoed the criticisms in recent days from many conservative news media figures and activists, who blame Mr. McConnell for failing to corral the necessary 51 votes to keep the repeal effort alive.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on his way back from a trip to Asia, said war with North Korea is not imminent, despite the heated exchange of warnings between President Trump and Pyongyang. “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days,” Mr. Tillerson said as his plane stopped to refuel in Guam, the very island North Korea threatened to target.

"TAMUNING, Guam — It is a small slice of America. It just happens to be in the middle of the Pacific. And within striking range of North Korean missiles. That’s why the island of Guam was thrust into the spotlight Wednesday after North Korea threatened a strike that would create “an enveloping fire” around it and said an attack would come this month. But on the island, home to a strategic American air base, life continued as normal. Patrons packed local restaurants, barely glancing at televisions bearing news of Pyongyang’s latest threat against their home. Residents of the tiny territory — just 12 miles at its widest point and circled with beautiful beaches — find themselves again caught in the middle of a war of words as a volley of hostile rhetoric was launched between North Korea and the United States, including pointed threats of nuclear action.

"Eric Bolling, the suspended Fox News host, initiated a $50 million defamation lawsuit on Wednesday against the author of a HuffPost report that said Mr. Bolling had sent lewd photographs to three female colleagues. The article, by Yashar Ali, cited a dozen unidentified people who said that Mr. Bolling had “sent an unsolicited photo of male genitalia via text message to at least two colleagues at Fox Business and one colleague at Fox News.” On Saturday, a day after the article was published, Fox News said it had suspended Mr. Bolling pending an investigation into the accusations. The network said it had learned about the allegations following an inquiry from HuffPost. Mr. Bolling is seeking at least $50 million in reputational, monetary and punitive damages and other costs, according to a summons filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The summons cites what it calls Mr. Ali’s “efforts to injure the plaintiff’s reputation through the intentional and/or highly reckless publication of actionable false and misleading statements about the plaintiff’s conduct and character.” Mr. Bolling, who was most recently a host of “The Fox News Specialists,” is represented by Michael J. Bowe of the law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres. Marc E. Kasowitz, one of the firm’s partners, is a longtime personal lawyer for President Trump who has also represented Bill O’Reilly, the former Fox News host who was ousted in April amid allegations of sexual harassment. “This anonymously sourced and uncorroborated story is false, defamatory, and obviously intended to destroy this good man’s career and family,” Mr. Bowe said in a statement. “We will defend Eric aggressively in court, where actual facts, based on evidence, testimony and cross-examination, will belie these anonymous accusations.” Mr. Ali, in a series of messages posted on Twitter on Wednesday, said he stood by his reporting and would protect his sources.

"SEATTLE — The weather forecast for Seattle on Wednesday reads “89 degrees, smoke.” We first noticed the smoke, drifting down from wildfires still burning in British Columbia, around Aug. 2, just as a heat wave sent temperatures spiking well into the 90s (the historical average for that week is 77) and the ubiquitous Pacific winds dwindled to a standstill. “Nature’s air-conditioning is broken,” the National Weather Service told the Seattle Times. The sky turned brown and opaque. The neighboring city of Bellevue, which normally glitters above Lake Washington to the east, disappeared. The mountains disappeared. I haven’t seen a tree move in a week. It’s as though a giant cloche has been placed over the whole region, like God is playing molecular gastronomy and we are her smoked langoustine cotton candy duck balloons. You can feel the air on your skin, powdery and wrong, somehow both sweltering and clammy. Residents have been warned not to exercise; people with asthma are clutching their inhalers, white-knuckled. There’s a mental health impact, too. To live in Seattle is to exist, perpetually, in the bargaining stage of grief. From October through May, generally speaking, it drizzles. Every day. This past fall and winter, we broke a 122-year-old record for rain and had only three sunny, mild days in six months. What gets us through the gray, like a mantra, is the promise of summer. Summers in Seattle are perfect, bright blue and fresh, and all winter long we assure ourselves, over and over, “This is worth it, for that.” Please let this one be a good summer, a long summer, a real Seattle summer. We need it. It’s our medicine. This smoke is stealing our summer. People are on edge. Traffic seems worse. Yesterday, in the car, my husband was telling me about two guys he saw fighting on the street, when I got distracted by two guys fighting on the street. It’s been a freaky, tense time. It was evocative, to put it mildly, to read in The Times about a forthcoming federal climate change report while choking on hot, brown smoke. Not only are human behaviors “primarily responsible” for climate change, the report says, but the repercussions are not some vague abstraction for distant equatorial communities or our faceless descendants to deal with. Americans are feeling the impacts of climate change right this second. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It was a sucker punch, The Los Angeles Times said. After the University of California, Irvine, withdrew admissions offers for nearly 500 students, the outrage spread far beyond the campus community. But the practice is not unusual among California’s public universities. According to figures from the University of California, since 2015 more than 4,000 applicants to U.C. campuses, aside from Irvine, have had their offers of admission rescinded — the bulk of them over paperwork problems. Among the most notable examples was two years ago, when U.C. Santa Cruz informed more than 500 incoming freshmen that their offers were canceled because they missed a deadline to send in their transcripts. An outcry led the campus to reinstate many of the students and adopt more forgiving admissions policies. "
"Carla del Ponte has spent most of her professional life busting war criminals and fighting organized crime, so when she quits the United Nations panel investigating atrocities in Syria in disgust, she deserves a hearing. “I am frustrated. I give up,” she told a Swiss newspaper. Everyone in the Syrian civil strife was on the “bad side,” she said, the murderous Assad regime and the “extremists and terrorists” fighting it, and the United Nations Security Council has failed to act on the reports on war crimes and crimes against humanity her panel produced. Ms. del Ponte knows the bad side. After making her name as a mafia-busting attorney general in her native Switzerland, she was appointed prosecutor for the war-crimes courts, for the former Yugoslavia and then for Rwanda. The crimes she has investigated over the past five years on what is formally known as the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, she said, were worse than anything she had seen in Rwanda or Yugoslavia. It is impossible not to share her frustration. The Syrian war has taken over 400,000 lives and displaced millions of people since erupting in 2011; all sides have committed innumerable war crimes, including murder, torture and rape; civilian populations have been massacred by barrel bombs, gassed and deliberately denied food and health services; the Islamic State has spread unspeakable terror in areas it conquered. But the Security Council’s inaction has not been for lack of trying. It is because Russia, often joined by China, has obstinately propped up President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, using its veto eight times in the Council so far to block measures against him. The latest veto came on April 12, blocking a resolution introduced by the United States, France and Britain demanding that Mr. Assad cooperate with an investigation into a deadly gas attack. "
"There are an infinite number of questions to ask of history. For instance, is Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more? (Yes, partly because he’s doing an amazing job but mostly because he’s dating Taylor Swift.) Or here’s a basic question we as a species should pose to the 20th century every Aug. 6 (the anniversary of Hiroshima) through 9 (Nagasaki): What if fewer children were killed? On Aug. 10, 1945, that query was on President Harry Truman’s mind. According to a cabinet secretary’s diary, the day after the five-ton nuclear weapon nicknamed Fat Man obliterated Nagasaki, Truman “didn’t like the idea of killing, as he said, ‘all those kids.’ ” Lately, President Truman has been in my thoughts. Not because Franklin Roosevelt’s death drop-kicked him into the Oval Office unprepared, though that does resonate, but because of his secretary of war, Henry L. Stimson. He had visited Kyoto in the 1920s and persuaded the president to take the city off the list of potential targets for atomic bombs. As Stimson recalled in Harper’s in 1947: “Although it was a target of considerable military importance, it had been the ancient capital of Japan and was a shrine of Japanese art and culture. We determined that it should be spared.” Kyoto happens to be my favorite foreign city. I don’t know how other Americans are coping with watching our government disintegrate in real time, but one way I lower my blood pressure after reading the news is to get out one of my books on the gardens of Kyoto and scrutinize photos of artfully arranged clumps of rocks and moss. Especially the dry gardens designed by Mirei Shigemori, who is, to me, the Rolling Stones of stationary stones. But for me to indulge in this harmless hobby of studying Buddhist landscape architecture, about a quarter of a million mostly civilian inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had to die. On his Restricted Data blog, about nuclear issues, the historian Alex Wellerstein suggests that when Stimson urged Truman to remove Kyoto from the list of target cities because of its cultural and therefore civilian heritage, the president may have gotten the impression that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were more appropriate industrial and military targets. In his diary on July 25, Truman, either too preoccupied or too oblivious to consider that even industrial cities are packed with noncombatants, records that he instructed Stimson to proceed “so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.” Anyone who has ever visited the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima and lingered over the frayed shoe of slaughtered 12-year-old Kazuhiko Sasaki knows how that turned out.

"Saber rattling between the United States and North Korea sent stock markets lower on Wednesday as investors shifted their money into assets considered to be havens in times of trouble. Stocks in the United States opened lower, following on from declines in Europe and Asia earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent in early trading in New York, while the Nasdaq dropped nearly 1 percent. The declines came after stock markets in Britain, France and Germany fell in the European afternoon, and share indexes in Japan and South Korea closed down. Investors appeared to be moving their money into the relative safety of bond markets. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, as well as British and European bonds, which move inversely to the price, were lower on Wednesday morning. The price of gold, which tends to perform well in times of high tension, was also up. The weaker markets followed President Trump’s warning to North Korea that it would see “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continued to threaten the United States. Several hours later, North Korea said it was considering a strike that would create “an enveloping fire” around Guam, the Pacific island where the United States stations military personnel. France’s CAC 40 share index dropped 1.5 percent by the afternoon in Europe, while Germany’s DAX fell 1.3 percent. Earlier, Japan’s benchmark stock index closed down 1.3 percent and South Korea’s declined 1.1 percent. Still, the limited reaction suggests investors have not yet become alarmed by the escalating rhetoric. North Korea has long loomed as a potential disruptive force in Asia, and even South Korean investments have been largely stable during past provocations. Most Asian markets have made significant gains in recent months as part of a strong performance worldwide, thanks to improving corporate profits in the United States and elsewhere. Perceptions that China has managed problems like heavy debt and capital outflows fairly well for now, as well as slow but steady economic growth in Japan, have helped stocks in the region. "
"In 2015, Barack Obama nominated you to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Are you surprised that health care isn’t more of a uniting issue? If you give me 15 minutes, I can create a common bond around a story of the health care system with almost any American. Have you ever actually changed someone’s mind about health care? I was at a town hall in Ohio: There was a family with a child with a number of severe illnesses, and one of the attendees basically apologized for voting for Trump. I don’t think that’s the answer — I hope people who continue to support Trump find that they cannot see eye to eye on the political approach he has taken on health care — but I think people’s minds are changed not by fact but by something that they feel and discover themselves, and you have to allow that opportunity to happen. You can’t beat someone up with a baseball bat and tell them they’re wrong. Why don’t you think it’s uniting people on Capitol Hill? Congress is thinking about health care as the issue that brought them into office, so they eat breakfast, lunch and dinner on health care. So many in Congress have chosen to avoid their constituents and town halls, and they’re able to keep themselves removed from reality. What did you make of the most recent efforts to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act? The Senate and the institution of Congress have become a runaway train. We have an administration and a majority party that were conspiring to try to pass a bill that even the people voting for it acknowledged they hoped would never become law, all through a process that only had two hours of review and no evaluation. Forty-­nine senators still voted for it. We are on the brink of allowing ourselves to make bad policy decisions based on obscure political pressures. "
"WASHINGTON — Washington needs a vacation from itself. “Doing nothing is exhausting,” said Jason Chaffetz, the former Republican congressman from Utah, whose head start began with a surprise resignation in June. Yet for those who remain in Congress — and across the city’s motley roster of aides, journalists, consultants and lobbyists — the collective exhaling over this August recess has been complicated, as ever, by President Trump. No commander in chief in recent memory has rendered elected officials more vacation-ready. Nor has any exacted a greater psychic toll on them once they got away. The result has been a recess on edge, with daily prayers to the swamp gods that the president refrain from any sudden movements that would upset the hard-won quiet. “Under this presidency, every hour feels like a day. Every day feels like a week. Every week feels like a month,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York. “Both the American people and the Congress do need a mental health break.” It has indeed been a particularly long seven-twelfths of a year, by any measure except math. Tweets have been tweeted. Resisters are resisting. Bills have rarely become laws, but the journey has been taxing. "
"As he looks to heighten his national profile, criticizing the Republican health care bill and President Trump’s immigration policy, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has been forced to confront a political schism far closer to home. For five years, a group of renegade Democrats has enabled Republicans to control the State Senate, even though they are in the minority. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has at times benefited from that strange reality: Having a divided Legislature allowed him to position himself as a deal-making centrist. But after the election of Donald J. Trump, pressure has mounted on Mr. Cuomo to reunite his party. Reunification was the agenda of a strategy session last month in Mr. Cuomo’s Midtown Manhattan office, attended by nearly two dozen Democratic state senators. When the discussion turned to how to best win elections, Mr. Cuomo suggested to the assembled lawmakers — many of them from New York City — that the leader of eight breakaway Democrats, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, had a better understanding of the suburbs than they had. That was all Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate minority leader who represents the suburbs of Westchester County, needed to hear. “You look at me, Mr. Governor, but you don’t see me. You see my black skin and a woman, but you don’t realize I am a suburban legislator,” Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, according to the accounts of five people who were in the room. “Jeff Klein doesn’t represent the suburbs,” she said. “I do.” Mr. Cuomo reacted in stunned silence. The pointed exchange, which has not previously been reported, captures the raw tensions around the fractured Democratic coalition in Albany that threaten to dog Mr. Cuomo as he looks to his 2018 re-election, and possibly beyond.

"BOWIE, Md. — Under the clinical white lights of a Maryland conservation center on Tuesday, Mansour Omari carefully laid out five scraps of worn material that had traveled within the collar of his shirt — past Syrian government forces and across oceans — covered in blood and rust, and in the fading names of the disappeared. A human-rights activist fighting for freedom of speech and chronicling the missing, Mr. Omari was arrested in February 2012 in his Damascus office and went on to spend about a year in a series of prisons, including nine months in a brutal facility under the supervision of Maher al-Assad, the brother of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. It was in that fetid underground jail that Mr. Omari and four of his fellow inmates set out to record the names of all 82 prisoners there, in the hope of informing their families and documenting the atrocities. “When I was inside, I saw myself, what I was documenting,” he said. “I saw it firsthand. I felt it was my duty, actually.” The resulting lists, which included the prisoners’ contact details, were sewn into the collar and cuffs of a shirt and smuggled out by Mr. Omari, who was the first among the group to be released. The scraps of material are now being lent to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum for an exhibition in Washington. "
"LONDON — It is the closest thing to a certainty in the global economy. When trouble flares and anxiety mounts, people who manage money traditionally entrust it to a seemingly indomitable refuge, the American dollar. Yet on Wednesday, in the hours after President’s Trump’s threat to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea if it continued to menace the United States, global investors sold the dollar. The same dynamic played out in June, as Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations imposed an embargo on Qatar, delivering a fraught crisis to the oil-rich Persian Gulf. And the dollar dipped in July after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia expelled 755 American diplomats, ratcheting up tensions between the two nuclear powers. Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has surrendered nearly 8 percent against a basket of major currencies. The dollar remains the dominant instrument for global trade, a role it is unlikely to surrender anytime soon. Yet those who trade in currencies see tentative signs that the dollar may be losing some status as markets grapple with the unorthodox actions of the man leading the nation printing the money. Donald J. Trump’s presidency has been so full of departures from the norms of international relations that uncertainty has seeped into the calculation of America’s plans. That has subjected the dollar to additional skepticism, enhancing the fundamental factors pulling it down, from worries about the strength of the American economy to improved fortunes in Europe and Asia.

"HONG KONG — The decades-long war of words between the United States and North Korea escalated on Tuesday, when President Trump threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” if the rogue state continued its bellicose missile and nuclear tests. Hours later, Pyongyang warned of a strike that would create “an enveloping fire” around Guam, the Pacific island on which the United States has a crucial Air Force base. Keeping track of all of the weapons tests, sanctions and diplomatic talks can be dizzying. But The New York Times has been covering the situation closely. Here is the background, along with some highlights of our coverage if you want a more in-depth look at the situation: Yes. Intelligence reports suggest that the North Koreans have figured out how to miniaturize a weapon, but not how to deliver it intact to the United States. In 2016, Pyongyang released a photograph of its leader, Kim Jong-un, posing with the country’s first miniaturized nuclear warhead. We took a careful look at that image and concluded that the bomb — about two feet in diameter, with a destructive yield equivalent to the atomic bombs that the United States dropped on Japan in World War II — could be carried by a long-range missile. The North has steadily been building and testing such missiles, and in July it launched a rocket that experts said was capable of reaching the mainland United States. Officials say they believe the North already possesses medium-range missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to much of South Korea and Japan. "

"Men and women are different. On this, almost everyone acquainted with reality agrees. How different is the more controversial question, to which there is one particularly interesting answer: A little more different than they used to be. This growing difference seems to be a striking aspect of modern Western life. In societies where both sexes have greater freedom — and women have more educational and professional opportunities relative to men than in the past — the sexes’ academic interests tend to diverge relative to more traditional societies. And not only their interests but their personalities as well: The more officially egalitarian a society, a credible body of research suggests, the stronger the differences in stereotypically male and female personality traits. Conservatives sometimes worry that our society features an unhealthy blurring of sexual identities, an androgyne confusion. The left tends to be more optimistic about such blurring, seeing it as a liberation from the rule of patriarchy and the prison of heteronormativity. But the opposite trend, the divergence of the sexes, might be more important. Some of our present difficulties may flow from an excess of feminine and masculine differentiation, from the sexes growing apart and losing common ground, from the decline of marriage’s male-female partnership and the rise of a singlehood that’s often more sex-segregated than family life. Certainly the frontiers of sexual license often feature strong male-female differentiation rather than androgyny or gender-neutrality. Think of the clichés that prevail in internet pornography, or the gendered kinks of “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Even our culture’s highest-profile gender transition had a highly sex-specific presentation — Bruce Jenner was the ultimate male Olympian; Caitlyn Jenner, a busty, hyper-feminized Vanity Fair cover model. So too with political trends. The idea of a “Mommy Party” and a “Daddy Party” goes way back, but the Trump-Clinton election made the increasingly gendered nature of the parties seem ridiculously stark. As Ed West, a columnist for The Week, pointed out last week, the social justice left and the alt-right are among the most gendered movements imaginable — “the political equivalent of the Lego Friends Heartlake Cupcake Cafe and the Lego Nexo Knight’s Clay’s Falcon Fighter Blaster, examples of where greater freedom of association and self-actualization has led men and women.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Americans should sleep well at night.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to reassure Americans about North Korea today, after a recent exchange of threats between Pyongyang and President Trump. “Nothing I have seen and nothing I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours,” said Mr. Tillerson, who was returning from Asia. He made the comments during a refueling stop in Guam, the U.S. territory that North Korea warned that it might strike. Tensions with Pyongyang have escalated into perhaps the most serious foreign policy challenge yet for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump’s warning on Tuesday that North Korea would experience “fire and fury like the world has never seen” has little precedent in the modern era, historians and analysts told us. (You can watch his remarks here.) The columnists behind our Interpreter newsletter give five reasons things aren’t as frightening as you might think, and we answered some questions about how we got here. "

"Stock markets in Europe and Asia were modestly lower on Wednesday as increased tensions between the United States and North Korea sent investors looking for havens. President Trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea if it took action against the United States and its citizens. The chilling language came less than two weeks after North Korea successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile: Experts said the device appeared capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States. Stocks were down nearly 1 percent in early trading in France and Germany on Wednesday, and the FTSE 100 index declined 0.7 percent in London. That came as stocks fell a little more than 1 percent in Japan and South Korea and as futures suggested that markets could open lower in the United States. Investors appeared to be seeking the relative safety of bonds, and the price of gold rose as it which tends to do during global tensions.

"WASHINGTON — I last visited Russia in October to do research for a study of American-Russian relations. I returned home just before the election of President Trump, recognizing that the relationship was in terrible shape and heading steadily downhill. It continues on that trajectory, with Russia’s demand that the American diplomatic mission reduce its staff by 755 employees, in response to new sanctions imposed by Congress that were signed last week by President Trump. That October trip and succeeding events raise important questions: Where does the United States want this to go? What is our vision of an acceptable end point? More than six months into the Trump administration, there are no answers. A week before my trip, on Oct. 7, James R. Clapper Jr., then the director of national intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security issued the first official American statement that Russia was interfering in our election process. When I and my colleagues confronted Kremlin and Foreign Ministry officials with this, they (as expected) adamantly denied it. They launched into the Kremlin narrative, arguing that the United States is responsible for any problems in the Russian-American relationship. They denounced American policies on NATO enlargement, the Balkans, Libya, democracy in former Soviet states and Syria, to mention just a few. Added to this, Russia’s state-controlled media was full of war talk: If Hillary Clinton was elected, Russia and the United States would be on the verge of war and Russians should prepare their bomb shelters. Really. This reminded me of a lesson I took away from earlier dealings with Russians: They always know what they want, so you’d better know what you want or they will roll right over you. And in today’s Russia, the question is what does Vladimir Putin want, because he calls the shots on anything of consequence. And his goals are quite clear: unchallenged dominance at home; heavy influence over his neighbors; a weakening of Western institutions like NATO and the European Union; and “great power” influence in key regions like the Middle East. Pardon the phrase, but it’s all about making Russia great again. Now, what do we want? Of course, we dare not let Russia have its way, whether it’s messing with our elections or violating borders of independent nations that look to us to enforce international agreements that we and they have signed. Still, we must avoid a shooting war with a country whose threshold for resorting to nuclear weapons is lower than ours. "
"BRIDGEWATER, N.J. — Senior American officials sent mixed signals on North Korea on Wednesday as President Trump’s “fire and fury” warning rattled allies and adversaries alike, a sign of his administration’s deep divisions as the outcast state once again threatened to wage nuclear war on the United States. The president’s advisers calibrated his dire warning with statements that, if not directly contradictory, emphasized different points. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson stressed diplomacy and reassured Americans that they could “sleep well at night,” while Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said North Korea risked “the end of its regime and the destruction of its people” if it did not “stand down.” North Korea gave no indication that it would do so. In a statement late Wednesday, the North Korean military dismissed Mr. Trump’s fire-and-fury warning on Tuesday as a “load of nonsense” and said only “absolute force” would work on someone so “bereft of reason.” The military threatened to “turn the U.S. mainland into the theater of a nuclear war” and added that any American strike on North Korean missile and nuclear targets would be “mercilessly repelled.” The statement also said that the North Korean military would finalize a plan by mid-August to fire four midrange missiles into the waters off the Pacific island of Guam, a United States territory used as a strategic base, to create a “historic enveloping fire.” The spiral of fighting words left the Trump administration debating how to handle a standoff that has defied three presidents and only grown more ominous in recent weeks as North Korea successfully tested intercontinental ballistic missiles for the first time. Neither Mr. Tillerson nor Mr. Mattis had reviewed in advance Mr. Trump’s threat on Tuesday, when he said North Korea “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” And the dissonance in their own follow-up statements reflected the struggle inside the Trump administration. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Until recently, the world considered North Korea largely a menace on the Korean Peninsula, its military most threatening to the 25 million people of Seoul and the sprawling area around the South Korean capital. But with President Trump warning of unleashing “fire and fury” against North Korea and the North demonstrating its missiles can fly far beyond the peninsula, people across Asia are reconsidering. Increasingly, countries in the region, especially those hosting American military bases, are asking: Are they potential targets of North Korean retaliation? On Wednesday, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, singled out the American territory of Guam as a potential target. North Korean missiles have also recently landed not far from the coast of Japan, a crucial United States military ally. South Korea remains the most likely target of any North Korean counterattack should the United States take military action to try to stop the North’s nuclear and missile programs. North Korea warned on Wednesday that it was considering a strike that would create “an enveloping fire” around Guam, a United States territory that is home to vital American military operations. Guam’s governor, Eddie Baza Calvo, played the down threat of a North Korean attack in a video address on Wednesday. “I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island or the Marianas,” he said, referring to the nearby Northern Mariana Islands chain, a United States commonwealth. Mr. Calvo said officials and military commanders were “prepared for any eventuality.” "
"BEIJING — President Trump’s threat to unleash “fire and fury” against North Korea sent a shudder through Asia on Wednesday, raising alarm among allies and adversaries and, to some observers, making the possibility of military conflict over the North’s nuclear program seem more real. With North Korea responding that it would, if attacked, strike American military forces on Guam, analysts warned that the escalating statements increased the likelihood of war — perhaps one based on miscalculation, should one side’s fiery statements be misread by the other. Some played down Mr. Trump’s remark on Tuesday as simply a warning not to attack the United States, albeit one whose tone was more typical of North Korean propagandists than it was of past American presidents. Officials in South Korea and Japan said that while the situation was tense, it had not reached a crisis point. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson played down any imminent threat from North Korea, saying Wednesday, “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days.” Still, some in the region said the danger of war had not seemed as clear and present in decades. What was unthinkable just years ago no longer seems so, they said. "
"WASHINGTON — Investigators for the special counsel leading the Russia inquiry executed a search warrant late last month at the Northern Virginia home of President Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort, for tax documents and foreign banking records, according to a person familiar with the matter. The search is a sign that the investigation into Mr. Manafort has broadened, and is the most significant public step investigators have taken since the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed in May. Investigators are expected to deploy a wide array of similar measures — including interviews and subpoenas — in the coming months as they move forward with the intensifying inquiry. It was not clear why Mr. Mueller did not simply ask Mr. Manafort’s lawyers for the documents. Executing a search warrant is considered among the most aggressive steps used by authorities, who must first demonstrate they have probable cause to believe they will find evidence that a crime occurred. The searches also often become public. Legal experts said that Mr. Mueller might be trying to send a message to Mr. Manafort about the severity of the investigation, and to pressure him into cooperating. A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment. The person familiar with the inquiry spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be identified discussing a continuing federal investigation. The warrant, demanding tax and foreign banking records, suggests that investigators are looking at criminal charges related to the federal Bank Secrecy Act, which requires Americans to report their foreign banking accounts.

"There is finally some good news for New York commuters in this summer of hell: Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Albany lawmakers are at last talking about how to pay for vital improvements to the city’s crumbling subways. On Monday, the mayor said he wanted to raise taxes on the richest New Yorkers and use the money to upgrade the signaling system, buy new subway cars and give half-price MetroCards to the poor. The governor and the State Senate majority leader, John Flanagan, quickly rejected the idea, saying the Legislature would never go for it. They floated various half-measures of their own, including — predictably — telling the mayor to use some of the city’s budget surplus to cut a check to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which Mr. Cuomo controls, as well as increasing surcharges on taxis and other for-hire cars. This might not sound like progress, but at least New York politicians are publicly tossing around ideas. Let’s start with the details of Mr. de Blasio’s plan. It would raise about $700 million a year by increasing marginal tax rates on individuals who earn more than $500,000 and couples who make more than $1 million. In addition to paying for physical improvements to the subways, it would address a growing problem by making mass transit more affordable for the city’s poorest residents. And it would raise taxes modestly on 32,000 affluent people who can clearly afford to pay more — a single person earning $1 million annually would pay $2,700 more a year in taxes, or about $7 a day, according to the mayor’s office. The mayor, who is up for re-election in November, proposed a similar tax during his 2013 campaign to fund a universal prekindergarten program. That said, there are other proposals out there, among them the Move NY Fair Plan, which would raise $1.35 billion a year through bridge tolls, congestion pricing and a per-mile surcharge on taxi rides. The obvious advantages are that it would cut traffic and greenhouse gas emissions in addition to helping pay for mass transit improvements. The plan would also include money to finish the Second Avenue subway and build lines to transit-starved neighborhoods. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Let’s start today with news from Asia: President Trump said North Korea would be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continued to threaten the U.S. through its development of more sophisticated nuclear and ballistic weapons. There is little precedent for Mr. Trump’s harsh language. In response, North Korea reiterated that it was reviewing plans to strike the island of Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific. The North’s increasing defiance drew not only Mr. Trump’s extraordinary threat — made at a golf club in New Jersey — but also raised the prospect of a regional arms race. _____ "

"For years, beginning in the 1990s, aggressive enforcement of minor offenses, like riding a bike on a sidewalk or drinking in public, was a fundamental part of policing in New York. But one of the lasting consequences of that enforcement has become a major policy dilemma, as more and more people lived with the threat of jail time for long-ago, low-level charges. On Wednesday, in a sweeping coda to those policing practices, more than half a million outstanding warrants for minor charges dating back at least 10 years were dismissed in a coordinated effort by New York prosecutors to ease the enduring effects of that era. The district attorneys for Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens collectively moved to dismiss about 644,000 warrants, the latest in a string of actions to reduce the number of people passing through the criminal courts and city jails on charges that would otherwise merit little more than a fine or community service. The Police Department, in the face of a federal lawsuit, has greatly scaled back its practice of stopping and searching people in high-crime neighborhoods. The police and the district attorneys have reduced the number of people prosecuted on minor marijuana charges; the City Council passed a law last year creating civil tickets for minor offenses that used to lead to criminal summonses; and in June, the Manhattan district attorney’s office announced it would no longer prosecute most people arrested on fare-beating charges. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said in court on Wednesday that the outstanding warrants had driven apart the police and the communities they serve and created unnecessary obstacles for people seeking jobs and apartments. “New Yorkers with 10-year-old summons warrants face unnecessary unemployment risk, housing and immigration consequences,” Mr. Vance told Criminal Court Judge Tamiko A. Amaker in Manhattan. “And because they fear they will be arrested for the old infraction, they often don’t collaborate with law enforcement.” "
"SACRAMENTO — For Democrats across the nation, California has offered a bright if lonely light this year. The party controls every statewide office and commands supermajorities in the Legislature. Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative leaders have become national voices, steering the party as it pushes back against President Trump on issues as varied as the environment and immigration. But in recent weeks, California Democrats have emerged as something else: a cautionary tale for a national party debating how to rebuild and seize back power. Even at a time of overall success, state Democrats are torn by a bitter fight for the party leadership, revealing the kind of divisions — between insiders and outsiders, liberals and moderates — that unsettled the national party last year and could threaten its success in coming years. “What we are seeing in California is similar to what we are seeing on the national level,” said Betty T. Yee, the Democratic state controller. “If we don’t do our work to really heal our divide, we are going to miss our chance to motivate Democrats.” The fight pits Eric C. Bauman, a longtime party leader, against Kimberly Ellis, a Bay Area activist. Mr. Bauman won the election by just over 60 votes out of 3,000 cast at the party convention in May, but Ms. Ellis has refused to concede, claiming voting improprieties, like permitting ineligible people to vote for Mr. Bauman. The party is expected to issue a final ruling on Ms. Ellis’s allegations by Aug. 20; in an interview, she said she would go to court if the party ruled against her. This has left Mr. Bauman, who encountered a barrage of shouts of “not my chairman” when he delivered his victory speech, struggling to put behind him a contest that has been the subject of recounts even as he seeks to position Democrats for a challenging congressional election in 2018. “The truth of the matter is, Kimberly Ellis cannot accept that she lost the election,” Mr. Bauman said. “She’s willing to allow the party to be torn asunder in an effort to prove that she really did win. My attitude about this is, I was elected chair under the rules. I have attempted to be the most open and transparent chair this party has ever seen.” "
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Thursday that it was drawing up plans to launch four intermediate-range ballistic missiles into waters near Guam in the Western Pacific to teach President Trump a lesson, after the president warned of “fire and fury” against the North if it persisted in threatening the United States. If the North were to follow through on its threat to launch an “enveloping strike” in the vicinity of Guam, it would be the first time that a North Korean missile landed so close to an American territory. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported that, according to the plan, four of the country’s Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missiles would fly over the three southern Japanese prefectures of Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi before hitting the ocean about 19 to 25 miles from the coast of Guam. In addition to serving as a warning to the United States, the proposed missile firings would also be a challenge to Japan. Some of the North Korean missiles launched in recent months have fallen in waters near Japan, but none of them have actually flown over the country. The North has said it launched its previous test missiles at highly lofted angles so that they would not fly over Japan. North Korea will fine tune its launching plans by the middle of this month and wait for a final order from its leader, Kim Jong-un, the North’s official news agency said, citing Gen. Kim Rak-gyom, commander of the Strategic Force of the Korean People’s Army. General Kim’s remarks came after Mr. Trump warned that North Korea would be met with “fire and fury, and frankly power the likes of which the world has never seen before” if it continued to expand its nuclear and missile programs. The North test fired two intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, last month, demonstrating an ability to fire a missile that eventually could hit the continental United States with a nuclear payload.

"Regulators are seeking to delay the deadline for financial advisers to fully comply with a rule that would require them to act in their customers’ best interest, according to a federal court filing on Wednesday. The Labor Department, which sent the proposal to the Office of Management and Budget, said it wanted to push back the full implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule to July 1, 2019, from Jan. 1, 2018, according to a court document filed in Federal District Court in Minnesota. The first part of the fiduciary rule took effect in June, and requires brokers, financial advisers and insurance agents to put their customers’ interests ahead of their own, at least when they are handling their retirement accounts. But the final pieces that are not yet in place are what gives the rule its teeth: Among other things, the rule would require financial professionals with conflicts of interest to sign a contract with customers, making the rule legally enforceable. The court document had few details, but was part of a lawsuit filed by Thrivent Financial for Lutherans against the Labor Department, which oversees retirement accounts. A spokesman said the proposal would be published in the Federal Register on Thursday, but declined further comment. Just a month after President Trump took office, he ordered a review of the regulation, which has been strongly opposed by the financial services and insurance industries. Some consumer advocates said they were not surprised by the proposed delay but were concerned the move would give the Trump administration more time to weaken the fiduciary rule, which was crafted by the Obama administration over roughly six years. “American workers want and expect retirement advice in their own best interest, and this further and unwarranted enforcement delay does not serve anyone who is working hard to save for retirement,” said Cristina Martin Firvida, director of financial security at AARP. A research note circulated by Compass Point Research & Trading, which provides analysis on the financial services sector, said the 18-month window “sets the stage for a substantial rewrite” — and should provide sufficient time for the Labor Department to “meaningfully soften the rule.” "
"On some emotional level, one might be able to see why Donald Trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” against North Korea if it endangered the United States. The North’s nuclear program is a growing menace, its warmongering tirades are unquestionably unnerving, and peaceful solutions to the threat it poses have been maddeningly elusive over many years and many American administrations. But Mr. Trump is president of the United States, and if prudent, disciplined leadership was ever required, it is now. Rhetorically stomping his feet, as he did on Tuesday, is not just irresponsible; it is dangerous. He is no longer a businessman trying to browbeat someone into a deal. He commands the most powerful nuclear and conventional arsenal in the world, and any miscalculation could be catastrophic. Even if Mr. Trump’s provocative remarks were part of a deliberate strategy for ratcheting up pressure on North Korea — and on China, which as the North’s main food and fuel supplier has more influence on it than any other nation — they would be at odds with the measured approach of his predecessors. This is a president with no prior government or military experience who has shown no clear grasp of complex strategic issues. As The Times reported Wednesday, his inflammatory words were entirely improvised and took his closest associates by surprise. Intentionally or not, they echoed President Harry Truman’s 1945 pledge to inflict a “rain of ruin from the air” if Japan did not surrender after the first atomic bomb was dropped at Hiroshima, which made them seem even more ominous. Mr. Trump and his aides must have anticipated that he would be asked by reporters about North Korea after the United Nations Security Council tightened sanctions on Saturday after the North’s latest missile tests. Why, then, didn’t his team of generals — John Kelly, the new chief of staff; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, who know well the perils of war — caution him about the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy, about better ways to signal toughness and about the dangers of idle threats?

"Americans may be tempted these days to worry a bit, what with the bellicose language being lobbed between President Trump and the North Koreans. But Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has some advice: Relax. “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days,” he says. For those who, despite the reassurance, find it hard to slumber, their minds dwelling perhaps on sleep-unfriendly topics like throw weights and re-entry trajectories, we offer some advice of our own: Try a nice bedtime book. Here are some suggestions. THE BIG SLEEP, by Raymond Chandler. This classic American detective novel chronicles the travails of P.I. Philip Marlowe in 1930s Los Angeles. It’s a tale of murder, blackmail and intrigue. What does the title mean? Oh, well, the “big sleep” is a metaphor for — wait! Never mind. Let’s try another entry from the bookshelf. SLEEP NO MORE, by Greg Iles. Next! DOCTOR SLEEP, by Stephen King. Now this is more like it. It’s a story about a kindly physician who helps patients who have trouble getting enough rest. Hold on. It appears to actually be a sequel to Stephen King’s terrifying novel “The Shining.” The character known as Dr. Sleep “helps the dying to reconcile themselves to their often misspent lives,” Margaret Atwood noted in The New York Times Book Review. So once again, “sleep” would seem to mean .... Moving on. SOME WILL NOT SLEEP, by Adam L.G. Nevill. No. DEAD SLEEP, by Greg Iles. No, no. LET THE DEAD SLEEP, by Heather Graham. No, no, no. Well, we tried, Secretary Tillerson, but even the most cursory of glances suggests that the literature of sleep may not in fact be the least bit restful at all. So we may be in for a few toss-and-turn nights ahead. Still, let’s close with one last suggestion: GO THE F**K TO SLEEP, by Adam Mansbach — a work that bills itself as “a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world.” And who knows? It may offer the secretary of state a message he can try on the American people next time. "
"ST. LOUIS — Color is powerful. It can stop traffic, sell a product, make art sing. It’s also political. The color of your skin can lock you into a history; end your life. It did so in the case of Michael Brown, the unarmed African-American killed by police bullets in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson three years ago this week. Racially, the city has been on the alert since. Tensions surfaced last September in protests against the Contemporary Art Museum here around a show of work by a white artist, Kelley Walker, that included images of black bodies smeared with chocolate and rainbow-colored toothpaste. A large group exhibition this summer called “Blue Black” at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, mere steps from the contemporary museum, is entirely about color, and might have seemed ripe for controversy. Yet, as far as I know, it has not caused a stir. This is not because it lacks self-consciously political art. The curator is the African-American artist Glenn Ligon, whose work of the last 30 years has been grounded in black history. That history is everywhere here. But so are other histories. Roughly half the 70 pieces are by artists who don’t self-identify as African-American; much of the work, across ethnic and generational lines, is abstract. The result is a show that isn’t reductively “racial” but includes race on a spectrum of meanings that runs from polemical to personal and poetic. Yet, culturally as well as chromatically, race is where things start in the opening gallery. A terra-cotta bust by Simone Leigh, its gray-beige head topped by an Afro composed of blue porcelain cowrie shells, is a homage to a specific person: the choreographer Katherine Dunham, who incorporated African styles in modern American dance and opened a performing arts school in East St. Louis in the 1960s.

"Move over, FANG stocks — the listings powered by Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google. Here’s a one-word explanation for why the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index hit a new high on Monday despite geopolitical tensions, turmoil in the White House and the threat of higher interest rates: Boeing. While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they’ve gained 50 percent this year. That’s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent. And it’s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent, can’t match it, either. When it comes to valuation, there’s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing’s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights. Boeing had Wall Street analysts scrambling to upgrade their recommendations late last month after it reported $2.5 billion in earnings for the second quarter and raised estimates for future earnings and cash flow. The company reported an order backlog that totaled 5,700 aircraft, or about seven full years of deliveries. That will lock in profits and cash flow for years to come. Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a “watershed.” Dennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings — and stock prices — of many of the biggest components of the market indexes. Here are the key elements. “Boeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,” said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “We’re having a more global, synchronized recovery.” "
"KFAR SIRKIN, Israel — Israel is building another wall to protect itself from its enemies. But rather than a major eyesore, much of this one will be invisible. In the coming months, military officials say, the army will be accelerating construction of a subterranean barrier around the Gaza Strip, designed to cut off tunnels running beneath the border into Israel like the ones Hamas militants used to ambush Israeli military posts during the summer-long war of 2014. Challenged by hostile forces on most of its fronts, Israel is already pretty much walled in. Aboveground fences and sections of concrete wall run along and through parts of the West Bank, a legacy of Palestinian suicide bombings during the second intifada. Formidable steel fences also stretch along the northern frontiers with Lebanon and Syria, the southern borders with Jordan and the Egyptian Sinai, and around Gaza, the isolated Palestinian coastal enclave controlled for the past decade by Hamas, the Islamic militant group. The approach seems to have caught on internationally. President Trump invoked Israel’s “wall” — without specifying which one — as a model for the barrier he has vowed to build along the United States’ border with Mexico. And the migrant crisis has spurred European interest in Israeli fence-building techniques. Israeli military officials are being understandably cagey about how the new underground barrier will work, other than to say it will also include an aboveground section and incorporate layers of advanced technological systems. The cost is expected to be about 4 billion shekels (more than $1 billion), according to Israeli news reports, which suggest it will plunge to a depth of about 130 feet. Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the commander of the military’s Southern Command, told reporters this week that it would be completed within about two years. "
"HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — In a sleek laboratory at Marshall University last month, four high school teachers hunched over a miniature steam-electric boiler, a tabletop replica of the gigantic machinery found in power plants. They hooked the boiler to a small, whirring generator and tinkered with valves and knobs, looking for the most efficient way to turn coal, natural gas, nuclear or solar energy into electricity. The teachers, who were attending a summer training program, are helping West Virginia in another kind of transformation. Long one of the poorest states, it is now leading the way in turning vocational education from a Plan B for underachieving students into what policy makers hope will be a fuel source for the state’s economic revival. Simulated workplaces, overseen by teachers newly trained in important state industries like health, coal and even fracking, are now operating in schools across the state. Students punch a time clock, are assigned professional roles like foreman or safety supervisor, and are even offered several vacation days of their choice in addition to regular school breaks. (Many take time off during deer hunting season.) Traditional math and English teachers have been reassigned to technical high schools, to make sure students on the vocational track still gain reading, writing and math skills. And this fall, students enrolled in simulated workplaces will need to participate in one of the program’s boldest elements: random drug testing. "
"To the Editor: Susan E. Rice is correct about the longstanding “belligerent and colorful rhetoric” of North Korea (“It’s Not Too Late on North Korea,” Op-Ed, Aug. 10). But missing is a sense of why North Korea became this way in the first place. North Korean leaders developed their paranoid worldview in the wake of the devastation of the Korean War, when the United States carpet-bombed the North, using more bombs than in the Pacific theater of World War II. Its leaders subsequently developed a bunker mentality, vowing never again to be such a target. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the North Koreans developed nuclear weapons to ensure their country’s survival. This strategy has worked so far. One can condemn the regime and still try to understand its perspective in order to engage in meaningful diplomacy. The stakes are too high. MARNIE ANDERSON
NORTHAMPTON, MASS. The writer is an associate professor of history at Smith College. To the Editor: I disagree with two statements in Susan E. Rice’s otherwise excellent analysis of the situation in North Korea. First she says, “By most assessments, Mr. Kim is vicious and impetuous, but not irrational.” Kim Jong-un is paranoid and for little reason; no one wants to invade the North, for there is nothing to gain. The economy is in shambles, poverty reigns, the people live in fear, and they produce nothing of value save some natural resources. Her second point with which I take exception is: “History shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea — the same way we tolerated the far greater threat of thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons during the Cold War.” At that time both the United States and the Soviet Union had leaders in charge who knew from experience the horrors of both conventional and nuclear war. I strongly believe that knowledge, above all, acted as a pause button in both countries. I do not believe that Mr. Kim has such self-control. I think he just wants to blow something up. TOM PERKINS
NEW FAIRFIELD, CONN. To the Editor: The juxtaposition of articles on the front page of The New York Times on Thursday regarding President Trump’s bellicose language about North Korea and the F.B.I. search of Paul Manafort’s home is telling. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s vow to ignite an “enveloping fire” of test missiles near the American island of Guam is the first time it has specified a target with so much detail, escalating a showdown between Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and President Trump. For Mr. Kim, failure of the plan announced on Thursday, which includes precise details like splashdown points and exact travel times for four test missiles, would be a potentially costly blunder that could subvert his authority. For Mr. Trump, whose dire warnings to North Korea — which he further escalated on Thursday — have echoed Mr. Kim’s own screeds, a successful North Korean test would be an embarrassment that could force him into exceedingly difficult choices about military action. But North Korea’s prospective test also includes some maneuvering room for a possible compromise, South Korean analysts said. North Korea said the missile launches were still in the planning phase and would not be finalized until later this month, raising the possibility of delay or cancellation. The four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missiles to be aimed toward the vicinity of Guam, home to a strategic American base, would fly 2,085.7 miles in 17 minutes, 45 seconds, North Korea said in announcing the plan. The missiles would splash down 18.6 to 24.8 miles from Guam’s coast, the North said. “By revealing this detailed plan, North Korea is trying to show that its Hwasong-12 missile is a reliable system and that it has capabilities of operating nuclear missiles,” said Shin Beom-chul, a security expert at the government-run Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul.

"To the Editor: Re “Sorry, Mike Pence, You’re Doomed,” by Frank Bruni (column, Aug. 9): Doomed? Hardly. He’s the only person in President Trump’s inner circle who can’t be fired. If Mr. Trump is forced out of office before his term is up, Mike Pence will succeed him and be better positioned than anyone to secure the Republican presidential nomination for himself in 2020. If Mr. Trump survives to 2020 and decides to run for re-election, Mr. Pence could challenge him and snatch the nomination for himself. He’s definitely not in a “no-win situation” — more like a win-win. JOHN F. DAVENPORT, NEW YORK "

"BRIDGEWATER, N.J. — President Trump escalated his war of words with North Korea on Thursday by declaring that his provocative threat to rain down “fire and fury” might not have been harsh enough, as nuclear tensions between the two nations continued to crackle. Rejecting critics at home and abroad who condemned his earlier warning as reckless saber-rattling, Mr. Trump said North Korea and its volatile leader, Kim Jong-un, have pushed the United States and the rest of the world for too long. “Frankly, the people who were questioning that statement, was it too tough? Maybe it wasn’t tough enough,” he told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. “They’ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it’s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn’t tough enough.” Mr. Trump noted that North Korea, which has made significant progress toward developing long-range nuclear weapons, responded to his original warning by threatening to launch a missile strike toward the Pacific island of Guam, an American territory and strategic base. “If he does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before, what will happen in North Korea,” he said. Asked if that was a dare, Mr. Trump said: “It’s not a dare. It’s a statement. Has nothing to do with dare. That’s a statement. He’s not going to go around threatening Guam and he’s not going to threaten the United States and he’s not going to threaten Japan, and he’s not going to threaten South Korea. No, that’s not a dare, as you say. That is a statement of fact.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Thursday that he was preparing to officially declare the United States’ worsening epidemic of opioid overdoses as a national emergency, accepting an urgent recommendation from a national commission that he appointed. “The opioid crisis is an emergency, and I’m saying officially right now it is an emergency,” Mr. Trump told reporters before a security briefing at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. “It’s a national emergency.” The president’s commission concluded last month that such a declaration was its “first and most urgent recommendation.” Led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Mr. Trump’s one-time presidential rival, the commission said that such a declaration would help direct more resources and attention on the crisis plaguing communities across the country. Mr. Trump’s top health care official had played down the likelihood of an emergency declaration. Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, told reporters on Tuesday that the crisis “can be addressed without the declaration of an emergency, although all things are on the table for the president.” Since then, Mr. Trump has come under criticism from Democrats, who accused him of failing to adequately respond to the growing number of overdoses. A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said the president had “done nothing” for the people affected by the drug crisis. In his comments to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Trump made clear that he was drafting paperwork and intended to issue a formal declaration that the opioid crisis was a national emergency — much the way the federal government officially recognizes the need for a national response to natural disasters.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump refused to back down from his threat to rain down “fire and fury” on North Korea, despite his own advisers’ efforts to modulate his message. “We’re backed by 100 percent by our military,” he said. “And we’re backed by many other leaders.” (Don’t worry: The photo above just shows people walking in front of a news monitor in Tokyo.) Our Seoul correspondent’s profile of North Korea’s 33-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un, offers plenty of evidence that he is not to be underestimated. _____ "
"WASHINGTON — State Department officials are investigating health-related incidents that caused some American diplomats and their families to leave Cuba, but they refused on Thursday to identify any particular country or cause as a source for the ailments. Officials also did not release the number of Americans affected. “Some Americans chose to go home, come home as a result of that,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said of the health issues. In response, the State Department expelled two Cuban diplomats from the embassy in the United States on May 23. “We’ve asked two Cubans to leave the United States, and they have,” Ms. Nauert said. Cuban officials vehemently denied any involvement in the health incidents. “Cuba has never, nor would it ever, allow that the Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic agents or their families, without exception,” the officials said in a statement. Ms. Nauert told reporters that last fall some diplomats and staff members at the embassy in Havana began reporting “a variety of physical symptoms.” She did not elaborate, but said that the issues were not life-threatening and that the officials had since been screened and treated. “We can’t blame any one individual or country at this point yet,” she said on Thursday. American officials told The Associated Press that the symptoms were primarily severe hearing loss, possibly caused by a covert sonic device. The Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday that it learned of the health issues on Feb. 17, and opened a “comprehensive, priority and urgent investigation” and formed a committee to investigate. The ministry also increased security around the American Embassy and diplomatic residences. “Cuba is universally considered as a safe destination for both visitors and foreign diplomats, including Americans,” the ministry said in the statement. Ms. Nauert said no cases involving private American citizens had been reported. “The safety and security of American citizens at home and abroad is our top priority,” Ms. Nauert told reporters on Wednesday when the news broke. “We’re taking that situation seriously.” On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Canada’s Foreign Ministry, Brianne Maxwell, confirmed that some Canadian officials in Cuba had also been affected. “We are aware of unusual symptoms affecting Canadian and U.S. diplomatic personnel and their families in Havana,” Ms. Maxwell said in an email. “The government is actively working — including with U.S. and Cuban authorities — to ascertain the cause.” She said officials did not believe there was any threat to Canadian tourists or other visitors to Cuba.

"SEOUL, South Korea — In China, the man threatening to fire missiles at the United States is often derided as a chubby brat. In the United States, a senator recently referred to him as “this crazy fat kid.” President Trump once called him “a total nut job.” But the target of all that scorn, Kim Jong-un, the 33-year-old leader of North Korea, has long been underestimated. Mr. Kim was the youngest of three sons yet leapfrogged his brothers to succeed his father, Kim Jong-il. Many analysts dismissed him as an inexperienced figurehead when he took power at 27; some predicted he would never last. But almost six years later, there is little doubt he is firmly in control. Now, against long odds, Mr. Kim is on the verge of making his isolated, impoverished nation one of very few in the world that can hit the United States with a nuclear missile — defying not only the Trump administration but also international sanctions and North Korea’s traditional allies in Beijing. Some have urged President Trump to open negotiations with him. But it is unclear whether Mr. Kim is interested in talking, or what if anything he might demand in exchange for freezing or abandoning his nuclear program. He has made building a nuclear arsenal a top priority, arguing that it is the only way the North can guarantee its security and develop its economy. His ultimate motives, like many details of his life, are uncertain. Since taking power, Mr. Kim has yet to travel abroad or host a visit from another head of state. Only a few people outside North Korea have been allowed to meet him, among them the former basketball star Dennis Rodman, a Japanese sushi chef and the vice presidents of Cuba and China. "
"BRIDGEWATER, N.J. — President Trump offered gratitude rather than outrage on Thursday for Russia’s decision to force the United States Embassy in Moscow to slash its personnel by 755 people, despite bipartisan condemnation from other American leaders who protested the Cold War-style move. President Vladimir V. Putin last month ordered the seizure of two American diplomatic properties and directed the American Embassy staff in Russia be cut by more than half in retaliation for sanctions imposed by Congress because of Russia’s meddling in last year’s presidential election in the United States. “I want to thank him because we’re trying to cut down on payroll, and as far as I’m concerned, I’m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people, because now we have a smaller payroll,” Mr. Trump told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. “There’s no real reason for them to go back. So I greatly appreciate the fact that we’ve been able to cut our payroll of the United States. We’ll save a lot of money.” Mr. Trump said it with a somewhat light tone, but it was not clear if he was joking. A request to his spokeswoman for clarification was not immediately returned. Either way, Mr. Trump’s comment was in keeping with his practice of not criticizing Mr. Putin — no matter how tense relations between the two countries have grown. Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Putin as a strong leader who has done good things for Russia. Challenged once by a Fox News interviewer about whether Mr. Putin was actually a killer, given the repeated slayings of opposition leaders and independent journalists in Russia, Mr. Trump defended the Kremlin leader by saying, “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?” "
"MONTREAL — The crowd of asylum seekers who gathered the other day outside this city’s Olympic Stadium, their temporary home, hailed from across the globe. They had fled violence, poverty, persecution and, some say, President Trump, often with only a suitcase to their name and a wisp of hope that Canada will allow them to stay. They are part of a new surge of mostly Haitian migrants who have illegally crossed into Quebec by the hundreds every day over the past several weeks, walking over a ditch at the end of a dead-end road in upstate New York. They are seeking to benefit from a loophole in a treaty between the two countries that allows them to make refugee claims in Canada if they do not arrive at legal ports of entry. “I lost everything in Haiti, but now I’m afraid the U.S. will send me back,” said Jonathan Luima, 44, a Haitian migrant who arrived in the United States last year. “Canada is my only hope.” This recent influx of asylum seekers poses a political and diplomatic test for the government of Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, as it seeks to balance its publicly compassionate statements toward refugees with a strict immigration system. The Canadian government lifted a temporary protection policy for Haiti in 2014 and resumed deportations in March. And despite the widespread impression among the would-be immigrants that Canada is a safe haven, there is no guarantee they will be allowed to stay. "
"North Korea burst into the news early this week when President Trump threatened to meet any acts that endangered the United States with “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” raising the specter of nuclear warfare. Here is an overview of The New York Times’s coverage. The United States and North Korea have been in conflict for decades. Here is a look at how it has built to this point. Last month, North Korea successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that appeared capable of hitting Alaska and Hawaii, prompting the United States to toughen its military pressure. Weeks later, it tested a missile that experts said was capable of hitting California. The tensions spiked on Tuesday when Mr. Trump told reporters: “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, responded in similarly apocalyptic tones, threatening to create “an enveloping fire” around Guam, a tiny American territory in the Western Pacific that is home to a United States Air Force base. (Here is a look at Guam and its strategic importance.) On Thursday, North Korea said it was preparing plans to fire four ballistic missiles near Guam. Mr. Trump sustained the rhetoric, suggesting on Thursday that his earlier statement “wasn’t tough enough.” "
"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says Americans who are concerned about the situation in North Korea “should sleep well at night.” Of course! Donald Trump and the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un — neither of whom has any aides who can stand up to them — are trading fire and brimstone threats with their fingers cocked on nuclear weapons. What could possibly keep a person up at night? Surely Tillerson jests or is high on Ambien. Have we already become so inured to the madness of the Trump administration that we have simply forgotten over these six months what it would be like if America had a real president to manage this crisis — not the historically ignorant, erratic, petulant boy king we’re stuck with? A serious president wouldn’t be leveling unscripted threats at North Korea — uncoordinated with his secretaries of state and defense and unconnected to any larger strategy — or sanction a few no-account Chinese entities, desperately seek negotiations on terms sure to fail and threaten a war that would be catastrophic politically, militarily and morally. A serious president would seize the diplomatic initiative with a strategy that serves our interests, protects our stakes in the Asia-Pacific theater, solidifies and keeps faith with our allies, doesn’t harm American-Chinese relations but also doesn’t discard 70 years of post-World War II American leadership in that region waiting for China to rescue us. A serious president would follow the rough outline laid out by one of America’s most seasoned Asia-China hands, Jeffrey Bader, which is summarized in a smart paper on Brookings.edu titled “Why Deterring and Containing North Korea Is Our Least Bad Option.” Bader, who has served multiple administrations in diplomatic and policy jobs related to China and is now a private consultant, begins by asking the best question any American strategist could ask when thinking about how to deter a nuclear-armed foe: What would George Kennan do?

"Can the courts fix climate change? Several groups and individuals around the United States have gone to court to try to do what the Trump administration has so far declined to do: confront the causes and effects of global warming. In California, two counties and a city recently sued 37 fossil fuel companies, seeking funds to cover the costs of dealing with a warming world. In Oregon, a federal lawsuit brought on behalf of young people is moving toward a February trial date, though the so-called children’s suit could be tossed out before that. And more than a dozen state attorneys general have sued to block Trump administration moves to roll back environmental regulations. Efforts in the United States are part of a wave of litigation around the world, including a 2015 decision in which a court in the Netherlands ordered the Dutch government to toughen its climate policies; that case is under appeal. A 2017 report from the United Nations Environment Program found nearly 900 climate litigation suits in more than 20 countries. In Switzerland, a group of nearly 800 older women known as Senior Women for Climate Protection have sued their government over climate change. In New Zealand, a court recently heard a climate case brought by a law student, Sarah Lorraine Thomson; a decision is pending. But in the United States, lawsuits to get American courts to take on the climate fight have until now gone nowhere. In 2011, the Supreme Court threw out a case filed by eight states and New York City against electric power producers. A lawsuit brought by inhabitants of Kivalina, Alaska, against fossil fuel companies over the diminished buffer of sea ice that had protected the town was dismissed by a federal judge in 2009. A federal appeals court and the Supreme Court declined to reinstate the case. The new California cases resemble the state tobacco lawsuits of the 1990s, which argued that the industry knew and concealed the dangers of smoking, leaving the states with enormous health care bills. In the new suits, Marin and San Mateo Counties and the City of Imperial Beach are accusing the oil companies of knowing that their industry would cause catastrophic climate change and covering up the evidence.

"People in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are worried. They are citizens of the United States who live in the middle of the Pacific — and now they are at the center of the world’s attention. President Trump told North Korea on Tuesday to expect “fire and fury” if it continued its provocations; North Korea responded with threats to launch an “enveloping strike” of missiles around Guam. Journalists have descended on the island. The New York Times asked readers in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands for their thoughts. Several themes emerged: frustration that many Americans are ignorant of their more than 200,000 fellow citizens in the Western Pacific; fear about the exchange of bellicose words; and a strong sense of home and identity. Here are excerpts from their comments, some of them edited for length and clarity. Teresita L. Perez, 49, a teacher who lives in the Agana Heights community in Guam, said the island’s history since 1898, when it became part of the United States after the Spanish-American War, “has been about maneuvering through, around, and under the West.” She said that both “everything and nothing” was different after the harsh dialogue: “We are geopolitical playthings. We know too well the consequences of war and have perfected our responses. So what’s different? For me? This time I cried. And I keep crying because a new truth emerged for me that has amplified the feeling of death: Not only are we political pawns, we are inconsequential to most of the U.S.” She added: “What else is different? The reactions are so much more. More vocal. More fierce. More stoic or nihilistic or Catholic. So much more.” "
"At the Stefano Ricci boutique on Park Avenue, Filippo Ricci, the brand’s creative director, was recounting a story about one of his clients, a wealthy industrialist. “He had his first son’s wedding one year, so he bought a pair of three-carat diamond cuff links that we made in our workshop,” said Filippo, the younger son of the label’s founder. The cuff links, he added, cost $100,000. “A year later,” he continued, “his other son got married. So we presented him with an $80,000 tie, with 100 diamonds on it. We made six of them. One of them is owned by Elton John. When we went personally to deliver it, we said, ‘Are you happy with the cuff links?’” The father responded with a shrug. “‘You know what?’” he said, according to Filippo, 34. “‘I lost them at the wedding. I partied too much.’” Such mishaps are bound to arise when your client base is the 0.001 percent. After nearly four decades, the Stefano Ricci label has come to occupy a unique place in the fashion firmament. Makers of hypermasculine, hyperexpensive men’s wear and accessories, this tightly held family business has outfitted Kremlin power brokers, Middle Eastern oil scions, celebrities (Andrea Bocelli, Tom Cruise) and world leaders (Nelson Mandela, Helmut Kohl). It is not so well known in the United States as its fellow Florence-based luxury brands Gucci and Salvatore Ferragamo, given its focus on emerging markets like Russia, China and the Middle East. "

"The Trump administration is moving to deny Americans their day in court when they have been wronged. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services want to reverse an Obama-era regulation that bars most nursing homes from forcing residents to agree to resolve disputes in private arbitration, instead of in court. The Department of Education recently announced that it was working to reverse an Obama-era rule that prevents most for-profit colleges and other schools from enforcing arbitration agreements when resolving loan disputes by students. Now, congressional Republicans are getting into the act by attacking a new rule, issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that will let Americans bring class-action lawsuits against banks instead of being forced into arbitration. Without the rule, which is scheduled to apply to transactions next year, banks could continue to profit from abusive products and practices without ever facing a court challenge, and aggrieved customers would continue to be shunted into arbitration. Class-action lawsuits are often the only way to hold corporations to account for wrongdoing in which thousands or millions of customers lose amounts that may be meaningful for each customer, though not enough to warrant an individual fighting a corporation. Arbitration, in contrast, is so clearly stacked against customers that most people don’t even bother. And yet, arbitration has been the only recourse even in cases where customers were defrauded, like those caught up in the still-unfolding scandals at Wells Fargo who could not sue because of the bank’s mandatory arbitration requirement. The first attempt to derail the rule failed recently, but it underscored the administration’s support for industry arguments. Keith Noreika, a bank lawyer appointed by President Trump to oversee national banks until a Senate-confirmed regulator is in place, asked the financial protection bureau to delay the rule on the ground that more time was needed to determine if it would destabilize the banking system. The bureau refused, for good reason. The rule — which will cost banks about $1 billion a year out of more than $171 billion in profits, according to analysis by the bureau — does not threaten the banks’ survival; it only threatens their impunity. Moreover, neither the agency that Mr. Noreika temporarily heads, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, nor other financial regulators raised safety-and-soundness concerns during the long rule-making process.

"CHICAGO — Imagine that a senior government official takes to Twitter, makes a call to a national news outlet or goes on national television to disparage you. Imagine that he tells lies about you to a national audience, lies harmful to your professional or personal future. What could you do to remedy the situation? You might seek a retraction. Perhaps you would go to colleagues and friends to privately plead your side of the case. Or if you were lucky enough to have a national platform of your own, maybe you would try to correct the defamatory statement in public. But one thing you couldn’t do is sue. No judicial remedy exists when a federal official defames someone. This gap in the law isn’t a result of a conscious decision by Congress or federal judges to protect the government’s ability to defame you. It was created inadvertently. In an age when the political lie is being weaponized to increasing effect, it’s an oversight Congress should redress. Today, if a news outlet like The New York Times, CNN or Breitbart News utters a slander, or if a private citizen campaigning for office does so, the courts stand open. Certainly, remedies are not unlimited. Worried about defamation’s chilling effects on the press, the Supreme Court has rightly erected high hurdles to defamation damages. But if a government official makes an intentional, false and harmful utterance, there is nothing to be done. In February, for example, hours after reporting critically on the Trump administration’s press operations, Alex Isenstadt of Politico found himself accused (apparently falsely) by anonymous White House officials of jeering at and dismissing the death of a Navy SEAL — the sort of cruel and vulgar act that might get a journalist fired. Under current defamation law, Mr. Isenstadt would have no recourse in that event. How did this gap in defamation law arise? When the government harms someone, a 1946 law called the Federal Tort Claims Act generally provides a judicial remedy. In 1988, in the Westfall Act, Congress amended the earlier act to cover most personal injury claims brought against federal officials. These laws, however, carve out immunities for government officials when it comes to “libel, slander, misrepresentation” as well as “deceit.” "
"After decades of getting out-organized and outspent in battles to control state legislatures, Democratic strategists have woken up to the importance of defending against Republican gains at the grass roots. The anger and fear provoked by the advent of President Trump have led to explosive growth for progressive advocacy groups determined to oppose the president’s agenda and, crucially, to elect Democrats to local office — groups like Indivisible, Run for Something, Emerge America and Color of Change (through its PAC). The number of Democratic candidates filing for office at all levels of government has surged; the trickle of money into liberal grass-roots programs has become a flood; and turnout in post-2016 Democratic primaries has reached record levels. Until this year, liberals and Democrats have been notoriously neglectful about building local organizations to back candidates for school boards, City Councils and state legislatures. And in fact the differing levels of participation by the right and the left remain striking. The electoral effects have been stark. In 2009, according to the National Council of State Legislatures, there were 4,082 Democrats serving in state legislatures and 3,223 Republicans. By 2016, the numbers had reversed: 3,135 Democrats and 4,177 Republicans. In 2009, Democrats controlled both the state senate and house in 27 states, the Republicans 14. After the 2016 elections, Republicans controlled both branches of the legislatures in 32 states to 14 for the Democrats. "
"President Trump’s apocalyptic admonishment to North Korea over its threats to annihilate America suggested that he might be closer than ever to ordering an attack — without waiting for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, to strike first. Mr. Trump’s supporters have said that such a strike, should there be one, would be legally justified as an act of self-defense by the United States against a dangerous and irrational adversary. Others disagree, and many scholars of international law say the legal issues surrounding attacks in self-defense are complicated and subject to interpretation. Here are some questions and answers on what can be considered legitimate self-defense under international law, and what the United States would need to demonstrate were it to invoke self-defense as the reason for attacking North Korea first: How can a country even claim self-defense when attacking another country that has not attacked it? The self-defense argument for such an attack is generally not recognized as valid. But there are situations in which a first strike can be interpreted as legally justified. Michael N. Schmitt, a professor at the United States Naval War College and an affiliate at the Harvard Law School Program on International Law and Armed Conflict, said three basic requirements must be met: The other country must have the ability to attack; the other country’s behavior must show that an attack is imminent; and there must be no other ways to forestall it. North Korea’s military power appears to have satisfied the first requirement. But under the second requirement, “we have to determine whether the statements by Kim are bluster or he actually intends to carry them out,” Mr. Schmitt said. Under the third requirement, he said, “you can only act in self-defense when if you don’t act, it’s going to be too late — there are no other options.” Have those requirements been met yet? While North Korea may have an ability to attack the United States, there is widespread skepticism that an attack is imminent. And many officials, including some of Mr. Trump’s senior aides, have said other options have not been exhausted. "
"ANDERSON, S.C. — At age 14, Latavia Burton knows something about teenage pregnancy. Her mother gave birth to her at 18 and couldn’t attend college because of it. And Latavia’s former best friend became pregnant at 16. So a pregnancy prevention program in eighth grade and another in her neighborhood this summer hit home. Latavia hasn’t had sex yet, and said if she were asked to she’d say, “Let’s just wait a little longer.” But to be safe, she plans to get an intrauterine device at a clinic for teenagers the program introduced her to. And since she learned that it would not protect her from sexually transmitted diseases, but that condoms would, she said she would “just go to the teen clinic and get some for free” if a boyfriend claimed he couldn’t afford them. The pregnancy prevention projects Latavia attended are among hundreds across the country, reaching more than a million youths, that are funded by a program the Trump administration has scheduled for elimination in its proposed budget. If Congress concurs, it will end the Obama-era effort to shift away from decades of reliance on abstinence-only programs, which showed little to no evidence of effectiveness. Most projects begun under the Obama administration’s Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program teach about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases in addition to abstinence. Even before the budget is voted on, the Health and Human Services Department is curtailing the projects, which it funds through grants of $89 million a year to 81 organizations. As reported last month, officials told all the groups their pregnancy prevention grants would end in June 2018, two years early. But only recently did the department offer a reason for the elimination, attributing it in a statement to “very weak evidence of positive impact of these programs.” A department spokesman, Mark Vafiades, said officials wanted to ensure “the program provides youth with the information and skills they need to avoid the many risks associated with teen sex.” He did not answer whether the department would revert to abstinence-only programs. Health commissioners from 20 large cities are protesting, writing to Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, that cutting funding “will not only reverse historic gains made in the U.S. in reducing teen pregnancy rates, but also make it difficult to truly understand what practices are most effective.” "
"The sprawling free photography festival known as Photoville returns to Brooklyn Bridge Park on Sept. 13 with a pop-up village of repurposed shipping containers. This year’s festival programming will address issues like immigration and climate change — and include a conversation with President Obama’s White House photographer. Photoville will run through Sept. 24 and feature work by more than 500 visual artists, talks, outdoor projection shows and workshops. Now in its sixth year, the festival has expanded: in its physical footprint, in its number of artists and in including a second weekend. The festival is organized by the Brooklyn-based nonprofit United Photo Industries with a number of partners. Exhibitions include “Stories of Survivors,” a project by the photographer Malin Fezehai in conjunction with the United Nations Development Program that documents survivors of violent extremist attacks in five African countries, and “Redefining Gender” by Lynn Johnson, which explores gender identity through science and culture. A number of the exhibitions have a modern political bent. But Laura Roumanos, one of the organizers, said she was also excited about an exhibition that looks at the past. In a vintage Shasta camper R.V., “Lost Rolls America” will display old, forgotten rolls of film mailed from across the country to the photojournalist Ron Haviv. At St. Ann’s Warehouse, next door to the makeshift shipping container village, there will be a series of talks — including a conversation with Pete Souza, who was the chief White House photographer under Mr. Obama. Since the end of the Obama presidency, Mr. Souza has gained internet fame for subtly trolling President Trump on his personal Instagram account. On July 20, for instance, not long after revelations of a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin surfaced, Mr. Souza posted a photo of Mr. Obama with Mr. Putin in 2014. Mr. Souza, who has a book coming out in November, will be at St. Ann’s Warehouse on Sept. 16. He will be in conversation with Michael Shaw, who runs the website Reading the Pictures, which analyzes news images and media photos. “Pete will be talking about his work over eight years, photographing Obama and discussing some of the key photos,” Ms. Roumanos said. “He had more access than anyone else.” For visitors, there is the added draw of a summer beer garden run by Smorgasburg, with beer from Brooklyn Brewery and food from vendors. “And people can bring their dogs, which I think is really key,” Ms. Roumanos said.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Seth Meyers expressed some concern on “Late Night” about a report that President Trump has trouble digesting more than a few paragraphs of information at any one time. Mr. Meyers dreamed up a new way for Mr. Trump’s aides to communicate with him. One thing the president does seem to read is positive coverage of his own administration. Reports emerged this week about a White House employee whose primary job is to provide Mr. Trump with copies of positive articles about him. On “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee offered a history of how Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, worked to build an online movement of far-right young conservatives. On Wednesday, late-night hosts were still processing the fallout from Mr. Trump’s threats against North Korea this week. "
"HONG KONG — An isolated, authoritarian state in Asia races closer to becoming a nuclear power. An American president contemplates how to stop it. Rhetoric escalates on both sides, and the risk of a deadly conflict looms large. Guam makes a rare appearance in the headlines. That is the state of the North Korea standoff today. North Korea has tested ICBMs that could reach the United States, and analysts believe it can make nuclear devices small enough to fit atop the missiles. President Trump said Tuesday that North Korea would “be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it threatened the United States. Pyongyang responded by saying it was considering firing missiles at waters near Guam, a United States territory in the Pacific. But change a few details, and it could just as easily describe the world half a century ago, when China developed nuclear weapons despite American desires to stop it. A look at that time reveals just how perilous such a situation can be, when a new nuclear player emerges and an established power tries to stand in its way. But it also shows that all-out war can be avoided. China and North Korea are, of course, different places. China is vastly larger, and even when it was far poorer, it held more global influence and material and human resources than its neighbor and ally. It was able to develop nuclear weapons far more quickly than North Korea. But there are “major similarities on both sides, a kind of deep sense of vulnerability on both sides, all kinds of very bellicose rhetoric and a kind of coming up to the brink,” said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor at the United States Naval War College. "
"It has all the trappings of a good thriller. Xiao Jianhua, a politically connected Chinese billionaire, disappeared under strange circumstances in Hong Kong this year. Now, Dalian Wanda, the Chinese conglomerate that owns the AMC movie theater chain and Legendary Entertainment, one of Hollywood’s biggest production companies, finds itself under government pressure in China. That may not be a coincidence, according to a Wanda insider — Tony Saich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University who is a director of Wanda’s AMC Entertainment arm. Mr. Xiao was escorted in a wheelchair by unidentified men from a hotel in Hong Kong in the middle of a January night. He is believed to be in mainland China, helping the authorities with investigations into the financial industry. The Chinese authorities have not discussed Mr. Xiao’s situation publicly. Since his disappearance, Wanda, which has sometimes turned to Mr. Xiao’s business network in the past, has begun selling off large portions of its empire of malls, hotels and amusement parks. The sales come as big Chinese companies are under increasing pressure from regulators to shed debt. “I think virtually all these things that are unfolding now are possibly related to Xiao’s trip across the border,” Mr. Saich said.

"BEIJING — With America’s Asian allies unnerved by President Trump’s threat to bring “fire and fury” to North Korea, China sees a chance to capitalize on the fear and confusion and emerge as the sober-minded power in the region, according to analysts who study the Chinese leadership. In dealing with new American presidents — there have been eight since Richard Nixon opened relations with the country — China’s leaders have looked for a few important qualities, mainly reliability and credibility. Even if they had doubts about a president’s affinity for China, if he was deemed “kaopu,” or reliable, Chinese officials could expect some stability during even the prickliest disagreements. Mr. Trump has increasingly been seen in China as unreliable, or “bu kaopu.” His statement this week that North Korea “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continues to threaten the United States with nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles has only deepened that perception, analysts say. But rather than make that judgment public, in the state-run news media or in official remarks, China’s leaders are sitting back, content to watch Mr. Trump’s credibility falter among American allies and adversaries alike, the analysts said. “The Chinese don’t like North Korea’s nuclear program, but the current situation does serve their longer-term interests in eroding American leadership, because it provides a whole new set of circumstances in which America shows its weakness,” said Hugh White, a former senior defense strategist in the Australian government.

In my view, it summed up the best argument against voting for Donald Trump: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” As we’ve learned over the past six months, we can’t even trust him with his own mouth. The threat Mr. Trump issued was entirely improvised, according to Times reporters. But for the vast majority of Americans who still believe that words have meaning, the president’s ad-lib was “alarming,” as Evelyn N. Farkas rightly points out in The Times, “since the world has witnessed the horror of atomic bombs used by the United States on Japan at the end of World War II.” So what can be done? Do we East Coasters need to send for our friends and family in California and Alaska (not to mention Guam and Seoul)? Susan Rice, a former Obama advisor, argues in our pages that it’s not too late for the U.S. to reduce the threat of North Korean nuclear weapons. “While we quietly continue to refine our military options, we can rely on traditional deterrence by making crystal clear that any use of nuclear weapons against the United States or its allies would result in annihilation of North Korea,” she writes. In other words, more of the same. Or in other other words: There is no good solution. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief. One would think these would be happy days again for the Democratic Party of California. For one thing, there is probably no easier place to be a Democrat, given the party’s utter dominance of state government. For another, many of the country’s Democrats have looked to California for hope and leadership in this age of Trump. So it may come as something as a surprise that the Democratic Party is enmeshed in a divisive leadership fight. The new chairman, Eric C. Bauman, won by 57 votes out of 3,000 at the party convention in May, but his main opponent, Kimberly Ellis, has challenged the outcome, saying she will take it to court. This has left a pained Mr. Bauman struggling to put the election behind him even as he tries to move forward. But should this be that much of a shock? That old line — a happy Democrat is an unhappy Democrat; or maybe it’s the other way around — applies as much in California as anywhere (and as much to Republicans as Democrats). There has always been a divide here between liberal and moderate Democrats, and with the party so firmly in control of the state, the stakes here have only become higher. Peter Ragone, who worked for the Democratic Party in New York and California, said the left wing in California was now ascendant, unsettling an uneasy truce and creating the kind of problems Mr. Bauman is facing now.

"Insurers are making final decisions about their Obamacare rates for next year. So far, it looks as if many of them will be building in an uncertainty tax. The Kaiser Family Foundation has compiled proposed insurance prices for coverage in 21 large American cities next year. The rates remain subject to change as insurers and regulators continue to negotiate. But the Kaiser researchers have done similar analyses over the last few years and found the proposed rates to be roughly predictive of the national trend. Two themes stick out: One is that, while insurance premiums will rise substantially in many cities, the increases are generally not bigger than they were last year. The other is that insurers are being quite explicit about citing the Trump administration’s hostile policy messages as a substantial reason for the higher prices. In many states, insurers have said that they are asking for higher prices because they assume the White House won’t enforce the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, its rule that people who can afford it must buy insurance or pay a tax penalty. The carriers are also worried that the government will stop paying them cost-sharing reduction subsidies, payments that are the subject of a lawsuit between the executive branch and the House, and which the president has repeatedly threatened to halt. Alleigh Marre, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, blamed the Obama administration for high insurance prices in a statement about the report. “Since Obamacare went into effect under the previous administration, skyrocketing healthcare costs and fewer choices have become the norm,” she said. “This analysis confirms what we already knew — Obamacare is flawed, failing, and harming the American people. Inaction is not an option.” Ms. Marre indicated that the administration’s preferred course of action would be a legislative overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. She did not provide any additional clarity on the cost-sharing subsidies or the mandate. The insurers don’t agree how big the uncertainty tax should be, but in some cases it’s hefty. CareFirst BlueChoice in Virginia, for example, says worries about mandate enforcement have led it to increase rates by 20 percent. Its overall rate increase proposal is 21.5 percent. "
"As political protest stunts go, this one was hard to miss. A giant inflatable chicken appeared outside the White House on Wednesday morning. Onlookers who saw the 10-foot-by-30-foot bird with the golden coif on the Ellipse, a park directly south of the White House, had no trouble identifying its human doppelgänger: President Trump. The chicken was the brainchild of Taran Singh Brar, an artist and documentary filmmaker who lives in Ladera Ranch, Calif. He said by phone on Thursday that it took four months of planning before he could get permits from the National Park Service to bring his plan to fruition. But it was so worth it, he said. Mr. Brar, 31, told USA Today that he wanted to make a statement about the president being a “weak and ineffective leader.” He added, “He’s too afraid to release his tax returns, too afraid to stand up to Vladimir Putin, and playing chicken with North Korea.” Mr. Brar is not the first to unfurl an eye-popping symbol of political discontent aimed at Mr. Trump. Last year, an anarchist group called INDECLINE displayed orange nude life-size statues of the presidential candidate in several American cities, including in a park in New York. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • North Korea threatens “enveloping strike.” Pyongyang is drawing up plans to launch four missiles into waters near the U.S. territory of Guam to teach President Trump a lesson, the North’s official news agency said today. Here’s a primer on Guam, the tiny Pacific island at the center of a global war of words. On Wednesday, the Trump administration sent mixed signals after the president spoke of “fire and fury” if North Korea persisted in its nuclear threats. Mr. Trump’s language surprised his aides, and it broke with a presidential tradition of carefully calibrated warnings. What if the U.S. struck first? We looked at whether a pre-emptive attack would be legally justified, and our Interpreter columnists outline why things might not be as worrisome as they seem. "
"North Korea’s substantial nuclear arsenal and improving intercontinental ballistic missile capacity pose a growing threat to America’s security. But we need not face an immediate crisis if we play our hand carefully. Given the bluster emanating from Pyongyang and Bedminster, N.J., Americans can be forgiven for feeling anxious. Shortly after adoption of new United Nations sanctions last weekend, North Korea threatened retaliation against the United States “thousands of times” over. Those sanctions were especially potent, closing loopholes and cutting off important funding for the North. August is also when the United States and South Korea conduct major joint military exercises, which always set Pyongyang on edge. In August 2015, tensions escalated into cross-border artillery exchanges after two South Korean soldiers were wounded by land mines laid by North Korea. This juxtaposition of tough sanctions and military exercises has predictably heightened North Korea’s threats. We have long lived with successive Kims’ belligerent and colorful rhetoric — as ambassador to the United Nations in the Obama administration, I came to expect it whenever we passed resolutions. What is unprecedented and especially dangerous this time is the reaction of President Trump. Unscripted, the president said on Tuesday that if North Korea makes new threats to the United States, “they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” These words risk tipping the Korean Peninsula into war, if the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, believes them and acts precipitously. Either Mr. Trump is issuing an empty threat of nuclear war, which will further erode American credibility and deterrence, or he actually intends war next time Mr. Kim behaves provocatively. The first scenario is folly, but a United States decision to start a pre-emptive war on the Korean Peninsula, in the absence of an imminent threat, would be lunacy. We carefully studied this contingency. “Preventive war” would result in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of casualties. Metropolitan Seoul’s 26 million people are only 35 miles from the border, within easy range of the North’s missiles and artillery. About 23,000 United States troops, plus their families, live between Seoul and the Demilitarized Zone; in total, at least 200,000 Americans reside in South Korea. "
