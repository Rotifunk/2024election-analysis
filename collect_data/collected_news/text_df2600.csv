"Senior diplomats from the four Arab countries that have broken ties with Qatar indicated Tuesday that they were no longer insisting on 13 precise demands that the Qataris must satisfy, or on a specific deadline for them to comply. The remarks by the diplomats from Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates seemed to indicate a slight easing in their position and a desire to make some progress in the bitter dispute, which began in early June. No direct talks have been scheduled. Shuttle diplomacy undertaken by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson with the antagonists, all of them close allies of the United States, ended last week in failure. The diplomats told reporters that they remain frustrated over what all four view as Qatar’s support for terrorism and instability in the Middle East, a central theme in the crisis that has created deep fissures between Qatar and its neighbors. Qatar has denied their accusations. Speaking at a news conference convened by the United Arab Emirates at its mission to the United Nations, the diplomats said they wanted and expected to resolve the crisis amicably. “Our aim is to reach a diplomatic solution,” Saudi Arabia’s United Nations ambassador, Abdullah bin Yahya Almouallimi, said of the feud with the Qataris, adding that he hoped “they will come around.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering imposing sanctions on additional Venezuelan officials, one of several options under discussion as a rebuke to President Nicolás Maduro’s government and his efforts to consolidate authority. Administration officials said they were using a number of tactics to persuade Mr. Maduro to hold off on constituent assembly elections seen by critics as a power grab, and more broadly to ease the authoritarian tilt of his government. They stressed that the Trump administration was talking to other governments about how best to proceed. But they said they reserved the right to engage in unilateral actions, if need be. A senior Trump administration official declined in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday to name the potential targets of sanctions. But the announcement came two days after an unusual election organized by opposition parties in Venezuela, in which more than seven million people cast votes to express their disapproval of Mr. Maduro. The government says that vote is illegitimate. “The Venezuelan people again made clear that they stand for democracy, freedom and rule of law,” President Trump said in a statement on Monday. “Yet their strong and courageous actions continue to be ignored by a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.” Mr. Trump went on to preview the new actions against Venezuela and warned against the election scheduled for the end of the month.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump was fed up with the grind of health care legislation, and at a dinner with Republican senators on Monday at the White House, he let them know it. He told the lawmakers how annoyed he was with one Republican who was not there, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who had gone on television over the weekend to oppose a Senate health care bill that once held the promise of victory for Mr. Trump. It is one thing to vote no, Mr. Trump told the group, according to one of the guests. It is another, the president said, to go on all of the Sunday shows and complain about it. The scene on Monday night was an exasperating end for Mr. Trump to a month of negotiations between the White House and Senate Republicans in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic legacy. The Senate bill, which faced a near-impossible path forward after the House passed its version of the legislation in May, was ultimately defeated by deep divisions within the party, a lack of a viable health care alternative and a president who, one staff member said, was growing bored in selling the bill and often undermined the best-laid plans of his aides with a quip or a tweet. Governors, especially Republicans from states that had expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, also played a vital role in the demise of Mr. Trump’s plans. “In our state,” said Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, “many people on Medicaid expansion are on the program for just a year and a half, until they get a job. They are not on it for 20 years. They are not lazy or committing fraud.” The effort by Senate Republican leaders to remake the nation’s health care system — which went well beyond the perimeters of Mr. Obama’s health care law — was in retrospect doomed from the moment it began, even with the wind of an unlikely win in the House at their backs.

"Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister of Iran, charged on Tuesday that the Trump administration’s attempt to reimpose sanctions on his country was a violation of the accord signed two years ago that sharply limited Iran’s ability to produce nuclear material in return for its reintegration into the world economy. “It is not clear what the administration is trying to do,” said Mr. Zarif, the urbane, American-educated diplomat who negotiated the agreement with John Kerry, then the secretary of state. “They have been talking about ‘scrapping the deal,’” he said. “Then they came to realize that would not be globally welcome. So now they are trying to make it impossible for Iran to benefit.” Mr. Zarif spoke in the residence of the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations just hours after the Treasury, State and Justice Departments announced new sanctions on Iran, many aimed at the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The announcement came the morning after President Trump grudgingly recertified Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal. The new sanctions were intended, administration officials say, to emphasize the administration’s determination to find new ways to penalize Tehran for activities not covered by the nuclear accord, which Mr. Trump regularly assailed during last year’s campaign and threatened to tear up at various moments. Iran’s adherence to its commitments within the accord prompted heated arguments inside the administration that continued on Monday before Mr. Trump finally agreed to certify that Iran was in compliance with its obligations.

"AMMAN, Jordan — As next in line to be king of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Nayef was unaccustomed to being told what to do. Then, one night in June, he was summoned to a palace in Mecca, held against his will and pressured for hours to give up his claim to the throne. By dawn, he had given in, and Saudi Arabia woke to the news that it had a new crown prince: the king’s 31-year-old son, Mohammed bin Salman. The young prince’s supporters have lauded his elevation as the seamless empowerment of an ambitious leader. But since he was promoted on June 21, indications have emerged that Mohammed bin Salman plotted the ouster and that the transition was rockier than has been publicly portrayed, according to current and former United States officials and associates of the royal family. To strengthen support for the sudden change in the line of succession, some senior princes were told that Mohammed bin Nayef was unfit to be king because of a drug problem, according to an associate of the royal family. The decision to oust Mohammed bin Nayef and some of his closest colleagues has spread concern among counterterrorism officials in the United States who saw their most trusted Saudi contacts disappear and have struggled to build new relationships. And the collection of so much power by one young royal, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has unsettled a royal family long guided by consensus and deference to elders. "
"WASHINGTON — The State Department office charged with combating war crimes may become the latest casualty of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s plans to restructure his department, former American officials said on Tuesday. Human rights advocates seized on the proposal as another example of what they assert is the Trump administration’s indifference to human rights outside North Korea, Iran and Cuba. They also say that shutting the Office of Global Criminal Justice, as the war crimes bureau is officially known, would hamper efforts to publicize atrocities and bring war criminals to justice. “The promise of ‘never again’ has proven hard to keep,” said Stephen J. Rapp, who led the office during the Obama administration. “If this Office of Global Criminal Justice closes, it will become even more difficult.” Mr. Tillerson has not made final decisions on how to restructure the agency, a State Department spokeswoman said, adding that the goal is not to play down war crimes but to make the department’s efforts more effective, including in combating atrocities. “There are no predetermined outcomes,” the spokeswoman, who under State Department rules would not be identified, said in a statement. “We want to make sure that the responsibility for an issue is appropriately placed and aligned with the resources it needs to meet its mission.” "
"WASHINGTON — It was men who started it. It may be women who finished it. The Senate effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a process that began with 13 Republican men drafting a plan behind closed doors, collapsed Tuesday, as three Republicans said they would not support an ultimately futile attempt to simply roll back the current health care law without a replacement. Though all three are women, their objections have little to do with their sex and more to do with the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid. In a twist, that aligns them with President Trump’s campaign promise not to touch Medicaid, which helps low-income people, pregnant women and people with disabilities, among others, as well as those eligible under the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the program in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Who are these senators, and why did they break with their party’s leaders? Ms. Capito became the first woman elected to the Senate in her state’s history in 2014, after serving 14 years in the House of Representatives. Since then, she has proved open to working with Democrats, particularly when it comes to addressing the acute opioid problem in West Virginia, which has the nation’s highest rate of overdose deaths. The opioid epidemic led to her misgivings with her party’s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. West Virginia expanded Medicaid under President Barack Obama’s health care law, a decision that increased the number of her constituents with health insurance. Ms. Capito expressed reservations in recent months about Republican proposals, calling for a plan that would at least draw out the rollback of federal payments made to states under the health care law over several years. But on Tuesday, she said every Senate proposal had failed to address her concerns. “I did not come to Washington to hurt people,” she said in a statement. "
"The announcement on Sunday that Iran had sentenced Xiyue Wang, an American citizen and Princeton graduate student who was arrested last summer while doing research in the country, to 10 years in prison for being a spy for American and British intelligence, came the day before President Donald Trump was scheduled to recertify the Iran nuclear deal that President Barack Obama had reached in 2015. Mr. Trump had campaigned against the agreement; Mr. Wang’s seizure, like so many other aggressive actions that the Iranian regime has engaged in since the nuclear deal was concluded, should have, some of his supporters surely thought, obliged the White House to abandon the Iran policy advanced by his predecessor. No such luck. And given the administration’s decision Monday to issue only minor sanctions against the Islamic Republic, while recertifying Tehran’s adherence to the atomic accord, it’s doubtful that President Trump intends to seek Mr. Wang’s release any more vigorously than had the Obama administration. Hostage-taking — for that’s what was done to Mr. Wang — in the Islamic Republic is both statecraft and soulcraft. Hostages become pawns and condign punishment in the clerical regime’s endless duel with the West. The odds that this 37-year-old American is an agent of Western intelligence are microscopic. The Central Intelligence Agency and European services would not use someone of Chinese descent, who sticks out like a sore thumb in Tehran, to handle recruited Iranian assets. So why insist that he’s a spy? Part of the answer is internal Iranian politics. The judiciary, which controls Mr. Wang’s fate, takes its orders from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He and especially his praetorians, the Revolutionary Guards, have had, at times, a tense relationship with President Hassan Rouhani, who has tried to check the economic power of the guards, though always unsuccessfully. Mr. Rouhani led the effort to reach a nuclear agreement with the United States. Some senior guard officers were viscerally opposed to this diplomacy, though the supreme leader consistently supported Mr. Rouhani’s efforts to get Western sanctions lifted for a temporary suspension of Iran’s nuclear advance.

"It will come as a huge relief to millions of Americans that Republican lawmakers have struck out in their attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act — at least for now. But this ideological exercise in futility has already done great damage to the health care system. First the good news, which came in two installments: No. 1, the Senate’s health care bill — which would have stripped 22 million people of their health insurance and increased premiums for older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions — collapsed Monday. Then, Tuesday, Mitch McConnell’s plan to repeal much of Obamacare without a replacement also fell apart as senators defected. Now the bad news: While the Affordable Care Act is not collapsing, the Senate and House health bills and President Trump’s promises to sabotage the A.C.A. have destabilized some of the health insurance marketplaces created by that law. Nearly 40 counties in Indiana, Nevada and Ohio are at risk of having no insurers participating in the marketplaces next year; other counties will have only one company offering policies. In addition, policies sold in the marketplaces could cost a lot more if the Trump administration carries out its threats to stop providing subsidies to insurers to lower deductibles for low-income and middle-income people. It can do that through administrative action. House Republicans sued the Obama administration to block the payments on grounds that Congress had not voted separately to appropriate the money, even though the A.C.A. had authorized them. So far, Mr. Trump is viewing health care policy through the same narrow lens he uses for everything: his political standing. On Tuesday, he blamed Democrats for obstructing repeal and said that Republicans should “let Obamacare fail” in order to have another shot at replacing it, as if the health of millions of Americans wasn’t at stake. Compare that to what Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said about her decision not to support a repeal-and-delay bill: “I did not come to Washington to hurt people.” The question now is which approach Congress will take. "
"WARSAW — Step by step, the Polish government has moved against democratic norms: It increased government control over the news media, cracked down on public gatherings and restricted the activities of nongovernmental organizations. Now the party in power is moving aggressively to take control of the last major independent government institution, the courts, drawing crowds into the streets and possible condemnation by the European Union. The party is pushing to jam several bills into law; one would force all the nation’s top judges to resign, except those it appointed. Another bill, already approved by Parliament, would ultimately give the government control over who can even be considered for a judgeship. In Brussels on Wednesday, a top European Union official said that if the changes were made, Poland might slip outside the bloc’s definition of a democracy. “Each individual law, if adopted, would seriously erode the independence of the Polish judiciary,” said Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission. “Collectively, they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government.” The drive to control the courts comes barely two weeks after President Trump paid a triumphant visit to Warsaw and praised the populist and nationalist Law and Justice Party, which controls the government. Now, if the party prevails, its success could be the final chapter in Poland’s long progression from a model Eastern European nation — and one of the first former Communist nations to join the union — to what its opponents are calling an illiberal democracy.

"Tony Kushner — the playwright whose magnum opus, “Angels in America,” painted a kaleidoscopic portrait of the United States’ AIDS crisis while it was still unfolding — is working on a new play about President Trump. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Mr. Kushner, who won a Pulitzer Prize for “Angels,” said that he was planning to write a work set two years before the 2016 election, with Mr. Trump as one of the characters. Still, he said in the interview, it “feels very soon” to grapple with the election, and the play is in its early stages of development. “It certainly feels like folly that I or anyone else has a definitive understanding or comprehensive understanding” of what was going on, Mr. Kushner said. “I have my guesses like everyone else has, but it will take some time and a lot will depend on how it is resolved.” Mr. Trump was close with Roy Cohn, the lawyer who died of complications from AIDS in 1986 and is among the main characters in “Angels in America.” Mr. Kushner portrayed Mr. Cohn, who insisted until his death that he had liver cancer and not AIDS, as closeted and homophobic. Asked whether Mr. Cohn would appear as a ghost in the Trump play, as a spectral Ethel Rosenberg does in “Angels,” Mr. Kushner said: “I think I’ve done all I want to do with him. Maybe not. We’ll see.” Mr. Kushner gave no timeline for the play, and didn’t say whether it would be completed before the end of Mr. Trump’s first term. “I gambled with ‘Angels,’ which is set in the Reagan era but which I felt would be historically significant 30, 40, 50 years later, because something really fundamental had shifted under Reagan,” he said. “The same thing is true with Trump.” Elsewhere in the interview, Mr. Kushner said he was working with Steven Spielberg on a remake of “West Side Story,” the beloved 1961 movie musical directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. He emphasized that he was working on the screenplay, and that Leonard Bernstein’s score — “the greatest score of a musical ever written,” he said — would remain unchanged. The work would also still be set on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in the 1950s. “I’m interested that we see love at first sight, as opposed to lust,” Mr. Kushner said of his version of the screenplay. He added, “By the time they’re singing ‘Maria’ and ‘Tonight,’ things are at a much deeper plane than just two horny kids.” Mr. Kushner, who could not be reached by phone or email for comment on Wednesday, did not tell The Daily Beast when the film would begin production.

"With President Trump’s promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act nearly dead, administration officials are scaling back their ambitions to cut the corporate tax rate sharply, apparently taking a more pragmatic approach as they scramble to secure a major legislative victory this year. In recent days, discussions among Mr. Trump’s economic advisers over promised tax cuts for corporations and individuals have taken on new urgency, a person who has been briefed on the matter said. One crucial point of discussions in the coming days, the person said, will be the proposed business tax rate. In April, a White House policy paper pegged it at 15 percent for corporations and small businesses alike. The current rate is 35 percent. But now the proposed business tax rate is “drifting higher,” this person said, and may end up in the low 20 percent range. With the health care plan seemingly in ruins, this person said, the tax overhaul will very likely take top priority. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, are communicating daily over the tax proposal with the aim of drafting a bill to be introduced on the House floor in early September. To ensure the support of influential lawmakers in both chambers of Congress, the two officials are meeting weekly to discuss the bill’s intricacies in a group being referred to as the Big Six: House Speaker Paul D. Ryan; Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader; and Orrin G. Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The final tax rate will depend somewhat on whether corporations are permitted to deduct their interest expenses — a hot-button issue that has caused great concern for businesses that rely heavily on debt. A White House spokeswoman, Natalie Strom, said: “Discussions between the White House and Congress are progressing in a very positive direction. We have always had more areas of agreement than disagreement, and we feel confident we will develop a unified plan that will deliver on our goals of economic growth and tax relief for hard-working middle-income families.” "
"NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar — When Myanmar’s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, wanted to hold a peace conference to end her country’s long-burning insurgencies, a senior Chinese diplomat went to work. The official assembled scores of rebel leaders, many with longstanding connections to China, briefed them on the peace gathering and flew them on a chartered plane to Myanmar’s capital. There, after being introduced to a beaming Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, they were wined and dined, and sang rowdy karaoke late into the night. A cease-fire may still be a long way off, but the gesture neatly illustrates how Myanmar, a former military dictatorship that the United States worked hard to press toward democracy, is now depending on China to help solve its problems. The pieces all fell into place for China: It wanted peace in Myanmar to protect its new energy investments, it had the leverage to press the rebels and it found an opening to do a favor for Myanmar to deliver peace. China is now able to play its natural role in Myanmar in a more forceful way than ever before as the United States under the Trump administration steps back from more than six years of heavy engagement in Myanmar, including some tentative contacts with some of the rebels. The vacuum left by the United States makes China’s return all the easier. When Myanmar began to adopt democratic reforms in 2011, the Obama administration quickly reciprocated, loosening sanctions as part of a broader effort to strengthen relationships with Southeast Asian nations as a bulwark against China’s rise.

"To the Editor: Re “Lost Paperwork May Erase Student Debt for Tens of Thousands” (front page, July 18): I was nursing our first baby when a collector phoned late at night with threats and demands about a payment on my husband’s student loan. It was the first time in seven years we had been late with a payment. The payment was only a few days late, and I had the canceled check to prove it. And yet, I was frightened. My husband’s degree enabled him to pursue a career that over time made the loan a good investment. But taking out loans is riskier today. Costs are much higher, and steady employment is much more difficult to find. This is why when I read about an industry’s mishandling of loan collections, I worry about all those caught in its machinations. I also worry about the dangers being created by the Trump administration and the Republican Congress as they wipe out consumer protections. ANNLIN KRUGER, BAR HARBOR, ME. "
"The news that Senator John McCain has brain cancer appears — at least momentarily — to have unified sharply divided Republican and Democratic politicians in support of a man some praised on Wednesday night as an “American hero.” Almost immediately after the news was announced, Mr. McCain’s colleagues, past and present, took to social media to wish him well. The praise poured in from politicians on both sides of the aisle who have served under various administrations over Mr. McCain’s decades-long career. Well wishes came from senators who have been at odds for weeks amid a debate about heath care, former presidents and even one of Mr. McCain’s congressional colleagues who is himself recovering from surgery. Representative Steve Scalise, who was critically injured last month during a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice, tweeted his support for Mr. McCain. A former Navy pilot, Mr. McCain, 80, was captured and held as a prisoner during the Vietnam War, and Mr. Scalise was one of several politicians who noted his resolve. “Praying for my friend @SenJohnMcCain, one of the toughest people I know,” he said.

ast July, I spent a night on patrol with Sgt. Michael Hicks, a small-town police officer in Connecticut, for a story about American policing. At one point, I saw him run his hand along the trunk of a car he’d pulled over as he approached the driver, who was an older woman. When I asked why, Sgt. Hicks told me about a case from many years back in Atlanta: a gunman popped out of the trunk and shot an unsuspecting officer. With every traffic stop, he said, the risk of death crossed his mind. “We’re trained for Armageddon,” he told me. I thought about that this week as we reported on the case of Justine Damond, the Sydney woman shot and killed by a police officer in Minneapolis after she made an emergency call to the police about a possible sexual assault in her neighborhood. How or why would the officer shoot? Did he feel threatened somehow? Was his training too focused on risk rather than public assistance, or was there some other reason? "
"The Trump administration says it is moving forward with its aggressive plans to shred government rules and regulations. The White House on Wednesday released its first official report on its rollback efforts, claiming that during President Trump’s first five months in office it had brought about savings for the economy rather than impose regulatory costs. As a comparison, the report said President Obama’s agencies accrued $3.1 billion in regulatory costs during the same period at the start of his administration. The administration also said it was ahead of schedule in implementing President Trump’s pledge to eliminate two regulations for each new one on the books. The report shows how the administration is trying to follow through on a campaign pledge by Mr. Trump to broadly reduce regulation and reverse rules put in place under his predecessor. “The administration is really beginning fundamental regulatory reform,” said Neomi Rao, who was confirmed last week as the administrator of the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a position that puts her at the center of the administration’s regulatory overhaul. “There is a substantial withdrawal and rollback of proposed regulatory actions,” she said. “It is also important to note that what we are doing now is in some ways fulfilling a number of longstanding principles that other presidents have always talked about.” The rollback has been met with strong resistance from critics who say the administration is overlooking health and environmental benefits of regulations in order to appease businesses, which often bear the financial costs of complying with rules. The critics have also raised concerns about a lack of transparency in the deregulation process. "
"WASHINGTON — The Republican health care push was declared dead Wednesday morning. By afternoon it had a breath of life. Legislation in Washington can assume Frankenstein-like qualities. On the cusp of a humiliating and politically disastrous defeat, President Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, took extraordinary resuscitative measures on Wednesday to pump oxygen back into their badly fading effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act. They somehow managed to stave off its imminent demise. It may be only a temporary reprieve, but a fight that seemed finished just hours earlier was renewed and headed for a pivotal vote next week. With his reputation for being a master of the Senate at grave risk, Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, extended a new offer to wavering Senate colleagues leery of scrapping the health care law. He backed away from his earlier insistence that the Senate focus on a plan to repeal much of the existing Obama-era law and allow a two-year window for its replacement — an iffy proposition given the difficulties that Republicans are currently having coming up with a consensus health care policy. Instead, his new selling point was that senators should simply vote next week on a motion to open a rollicking health care floor debate and then let the amendment chips fall where they may — a case of creating national health care policy, which makes up about 20 percent of the United States economy, on the fly. “What I’m telling you is no harm is done by getting on the bill,” Mr. McConnell told reporters outside the White House after a lunch where Mr. Trump hosted most Senate Republicans. “Wide open for amendment.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump rarely says he needs his hand held for anything. Unless he’s around President Emmanuel Macron of France. “He’s a great guy — smart, strong, loves holding my hand,” Mr. Trump joked about his French counterpart in an Oval Office interview with The New York Times on Wednesday. “People don’t realize, he loves holding my hand — that’s good!” the president said of Mr. Macron, who invited Mr. Trump to attend Bastille Day festivities in Paris last week. The budding warmth in their relationship follows an initially awkward first encounter at a NATO meeting in Brussels in May, during which Mr. Macron firmly shook Mr. Trump’s hand to signal that he would not be intimidated. In the weeks after, Mr. Trump said he intended to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, a move he anticipated would frustrate Mr. Macron. Instead, the French president called Mr. Trump a few weeks ago and invited him to join the annual Bastille Day celebration, which also marked the 100th anniversary of the United States’ entrance into World War I. “I said, ‘Do you think it’s a good thing for me?’” Mr. Trump recalled on Wednesday of asking Mr. Macron about attending the festivities, given how his decision on the Paris accord might have been received. But Mr. Macron assured him that it would not be a problem, Mr. Trump said, and urged him to come watch France’s display of military might, including flyovers by warplanes, soldiers in period uniforms and tanks rolling down cobblestone streets. “I have a great relationship with him; he’s a great guy,” Mr. Trump said. He also called the Bastille Day parade “beautiful.” The two presidents watched the parade from a viewing stand, from which Mr. Trump said he could see all the way up the Champs-Élysées to the Arc de Triomphe. Afterward, standing together in a plaza, Mr. Macron grabbed Mr. Trump’s hand, and appeared reluctant to let go. So, Mr. Trump recounted, the two presidents stood there, holding hands for several minutes, as Mr. Macron’s wife, Brigitte, joined them. “It was one of the most beautiful parades I’ve ever seen, and in fact we should do one here down Pennsylvania Avenue,” said Mr. Trump, a military enthusiast who at one point hoped to include a display by the armed forces in his inaugural parade. Mr. Trump also said that his relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had been misinterpreted as chilly. In fact, Mr. Trump said, “We get along very well.” He added that a photograph of him sitting with Ms. Merkel in the Oval Office, without a handshake, had been misread as a stilted encounter. He said that he had not heard someone call out to her to shake hands, and that they had worked well together earlier. Mr. Trump also said he had deeply enjoyed his travels abroad as president. “I have had the best reviews on foreign land,” he said. "

He said the decision was “very unfair to the president.” "
"President Trump spoke on Wednesday with three New York Times reporters — Peter Baker, Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman — in an exclusive interview in the Oval Office. Also in attendance was Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman. At one point, the president’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump appeared at the door, and her daughter, Arabella, entered the room. The following are excerpts from that conversation, transcribed by The Times. They have been lightly edited for content and clarity, and omit several off-the-record comments and asides. Read more coverage and analysis of the interview » _________ TRUMP: Hi fellas, how you doing? BAKER: Good. Good. How was your lunch [with Republican senators]? TRUMP: It was good. We are very close. It’s a tough — you know, health care. Look, Hillary Clinton worked eight years in the White House with her husband as president and having majorities and couldn’t get it done. Smart people, tough people — couldn’t get it done. Obama worked so hard. They had 60 in the Senate. They had big majorities and had the White House. I mean, ended up giving away the state of Nebraska. They owned the state of Nebraska. Right. Gave it away. Their best senator did one of the greatest deals in the history of politics. What happened to him? But I think we are going to do O.K. I think we are going to see. I mean, one of my ideas was repeal. But I certainly rather would get repeal and replace, because the next last thing I want to do is start working tomorrow morning on replace. And it is time. It is tough. It’s a very narrow path, winding this way. You think you have it, and then you lose four on the other side because you gave. It is a brutal process. And it was for Democrats, in all fairness. I mean, you think of Hillary Clinton, and you look, she went eight years — very capable — went eight years as the first lady, and could not get health care. So this is not an easy crack. The one thing I’ll say about myself, so, Obama was in there for eight years and got Obamacare. Hillary Clinton was in there eight years and they never got Hillarycare, whatever they called it at the time. I am not in here six months, and they’ll say, “Trump hasn’t fulfilled his agenda.” I say to myself, wait a minute, I’m only here a very short period of time compared to Obama. How long did it take to get Obamacare? "
"President Trump has ended the clandestine American program to provide arms and supplies to Syrian rebel groups, American officials said, a recognition that the effort was failing and that the administration has given up hope of helping to topple the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The decision came more than a month ago, the officials said, by which time the effort to deliver the arms had slowed to a trickle. It was never publicly announced, just as the beginnings of the program four years ago were officially a secret, authorized by President Barack Obama through a “finding” that permitted the C.I.A. to conduct a deniable program. News of the troublesome program soon leaked out. It joins similar failed efforts to deliver arms and money to groups seeking to overthrow governments that Washington found noxious, most famously the Kennedy administration’s disastrous effort to do away with the government of Fidel Castro in Cuba. The White House had no comment. But the decision is bound to be welcomed by the Russians, whose military has backed Mr. Assad’s government and relentlessly attacked some of the rebel groups that the United States was supplying, under the guise of helping to eradicate terrorists. On Tuesday, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, charged that the United States had helped destabilize the region, and portrayed Iran as merely defending its interests. Washington, instead, views Iran’s aid to the Assad government as part of an effort to restore itself as a major regional power. "
"During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump pointed to his relationship with Deutsche Bank to counter reports that big banks were skeptical of doing business with him. After a string of bankruptcies in his casino and hotel businesses in the 1990s, Mr. Trump became somewhat of an outsider on Wall Street, leaving the giant German bank among the few major financial institutions willing to lend him money. Now that two-decades-long relationship is coming under scrutiny. Banking regulators are reviewing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans made to Mr. Trump’s businesses through Deutsche Bank’s private wealth management unit, which caters to an ultrarich clientele, according to three people briefed on the review who were not authorized to speak publicly. The regulators want to know if the loans might expose the bank to heightened risks. Separately, Deutsche Bank has been in contact with federal investigators about the Trump accounts, according to two people briefed on the matter. And the bank is expecting to eventually have to provide information to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. It was not clear what information the bank might ultimately provide. Generally, the bank is seen as central to understanding Mr. Trump’s finances since it is the only major financial institution that continues to conduct sizable business with him. Deutsche Bank has also lent money to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and to his family real estate business. "
"WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee known for his independent streak over more than three decades representing Arizona in the Senate, has brain cancer, his office disclosed Wednesday night in a statement from the Mayo Clinic. Mr. McCain, 80, has a glioblastoma, one of the most common but also one of the most malignant brain tumors. It can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation, but medical experts said it almost always grows back. Mr. McCain’s office said he was recuperating at his home in Arizona and “appreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days.” His office said Mr. McCain would decide when to return to the Senate as he consults with his medical advisers. Medical experts said the type of tumor Mr. McCain has is particularly aggressive. The median survival of a glioblastoma is about 16 months, said Eugene S. Flamm, chairman of neurosurgery at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts died in 2009 from the same kind of aggressive brain tumor. Mr. McCain learned of the tumor after undergoing surgery late last week at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix to remove a blood clot above his left eye. "
"After efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act collapsed, President Trump pressed Republican lawmakers to keep their seven-year promise by demonstrating a sales pitch they could use: point out the flaws of the current law and “sell our plan.” Here’s an assessment. Mr. Trump kicked off the meeting with an indictment of premium increases under President Barack Obama’s health care law: “In Alaska, they went up over 200 percent recently. In Arizona, they’ve been up 118 percent. And those states are good compared to some of the numbers coming out.” The figure for Alaska comes from a flawed May report from the Department of Health and Human Services that imprecisely compared the cost of premiums in 2013 and 2017. The report ignores the fact that a majority of enrollees receive a subsidy that helps blunt premium costs. The 2017 plans also offer more comprehensive coverage and cover sicker people. And it compares plans in the entire individual market in 2013 to only exchange plans in 2017. Mr. Trump’s figure for Arizona is more accurate. According to an October H.H.S. report, the price of the benchmark plan in Arizona rose by 116 percent from 2016 to 2017. The same report notes that 74 percent of enrollees in Arizona received tax credits, and that 78 percent could obtain coverage for less than $100 a month after subsidies. Neither number is “good compared to” other states. The Alaska figure is the second largest increase in the May report, and the Arizona increase is the highest in the October report. According to the Congressional Budget Office, average premiums will initially rise and then drop by about 20 percent in 2026. But that comes with a few caveats. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he never would have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, calling the decision “very unfair to the president.” [Read excerpts of The Times’s interview with President Trump.] In a remarkable public break with one of his earliest political supporters, Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Sessions’s decision ultimately led to the appointment of a special counsel that should not have happened. “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Mr. Trump said. In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, the president also accused James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in May, of trying to leverage a dossier of compromising material to keep his job. Mr. Trump criticized both the acting F.B.I. director who has been filling in since Mr. Comey’s dismissal and the deputy attorney general who recommended it. And he took on Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel now leading the investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election. Mr. Trump said Mr. Mueller was running an office rife with conflicts of interest and warned investigators against delving into matters too far afield from Russia. Mr. Trump never said he would order the Justice Department to fire Mr. Mueller, nor would he outline circumstances under which he might do so. But he left open the possibility as he expressed deep grievance over an investigation that has taken a political toll in the six months since he took office. Asked if Mr. Mueller’s investigation would cross a red line if it expanded to look at his family’s finances beyond any relationship to Russia, Mr. Trump said, “I would say yes.” He would not say what he would do about it. “I think that’s a violation. Look, this is about Russia.” While the interview touched on an array of issues, including health care, foreign affairs and politics, the investigation dominated the conversation. He said that as far as he knew, he was not under investigation himself, despite reports that Mr. Mueller is looking at whether the president obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey. "
"The Trump administration lost another round on Wednesday in its continuing legal battle over its travel ban against people from six majority-Muslim countries and all refugees. The Supreme Court let stand — pending full review of the ban in October — a Federal District Court ruling in Hawaii that included grandparents and other close relatives of those in the United States within the scope of exemptions to the ban. Last month, the Supreme Court authorized the administration to implement the ban but instructed the government to exempt people with “bona fide” relationships to relatives and institutions (like employers and universities) in the United States. The State Department issued guidelines that narrowly defined those family relations as spouses, parents and parents-in-law, children and siblings. It excluded grandparents, aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and brothers- and sisters-in-law. It also excluded all refugees. These rules struck many as arbitrary and needlessly cruel. The exclusion of grandparents seemed particularly capricious and nonsensical, as did the allowance of a sibling, say, but not that sibling’s spouse. In countries like Syria, where families have been torn asunder by war, a cousin in America may be someone’s only lifeline to safety. In response, the administration said that it was merely following established immigration law. That’s true to the extent that only certain immediate relations are eligible for family-sponsored visas for permanent residence. But the travel ban goes far beyond the treasured green card. It applies those rules to people who would otherwise be eligible for entry, including refugees who have been cleared and accepted by a resettlement agency, and short-term visitors, such as tourists, businessmen and grandparents coming for a family visit. It is true, however, that efforts to define and manipulate the definition of “family” in immigration matters are not new. For more than 100 years the government has done so, often reflecting political exigency and racial bias rather than the real needs and desires of families. "
"Financial records filed last year in the secretive tax haven of Cyprus, where Paul J. Manafort kept bank accounts during his years working in Ukraine and investing with a Russian oligarch, indicate that he had been in debt to pro-Russia interests by as much as $17 million before he joined Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign in March 2016. The money appears to have been owed by shell companies connected to Mr. Manafort’s business activities in Ukraine when he worked as a consultant to the pro-Russia Party of Regions. The Cyprus documents obtained by The New York Times include audited financial statements for the companies, which were part of a complex web of more than a dozen entities that transferred millions of dollars among them in the form of loans, payments and fees. The records, which include details for numerous loans, were certified as accurate by an accounting firm as of December 2015, several months before Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign, and were filed with Cyprus government authorities in 2016. The notion of indebtedness on the part of Mr. Manafort also aligns with assertions made in a court complaint filed in Virginia in 2015 by the Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, who claimed Mr. Manafort and his partners owed him $19 million related to a failed investment in a Ukrainian cable television business. After The Times shared some of the documents with representatives of Mr. Manafort, a spokesman, Jason Maloni, did not address whether the debts might have existed at one time. But he maintained that the Cyprus records were “stale and do not purport to reflect any current financial arrangements.” "

"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily upheld broad restrictions against refugees entering the United States but allowed grandparents and other relatives of American residents to come while legal challenges to the Trump administration’s travel ban move forward. The justices, in a brief unsigned order, let stand part of a ruling from a federal judge in Hawaii that had narrowed the administration’s efforts to limit travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, an effort that has prompted confusion at the nation’s airports, a global outcry and much litigation since President Trump announced it a week into his presidency. But the justices suspended a second part of the lower court’s ruling, standing firm for now against allowing an estimated 24,000 refugees from across the world to resettle in the United States. In the terse order, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch said they would have blocked the judge’s entire order while the case proceeds — including the part that allowed American residents’ grandparents and other relatives to travel to the United States from the six countries: Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Last month, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the travel ban was lawful, and it scheduled arguments for October. In the meantime, the justices temporarily reinstated the travel ban — but only for people without “a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The court did not specify who qualified as a close relative, though it did say that spouses and mothers-in-law “clearly” counted. The Trump administration interpreted the Supreme Court’s decision as excluding most refugees and entry only of American residents’ parents, children, spouses, parents-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, people engaged to be married and siblings.

"MINNEAPOLIS — His hiring by the Minneapolis Police Department was hailed by the mayor as “a wonderful sign.” Hundreds of Somalis attended an event at a local mall welcoming him to the force, lining up to take pictures and shake his hand. But just 14 months after Mohamed Noor became the first Somali police officer to be stationed in his precinct, which has a large immigrant population, he is now under scrutiny for fatally shooting an Australian woman after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home. The encounter has drawn international outrage about American police practices; the Australian prime minister on Wednesday condemned the shooting of Justine Damond as “a shocking killing.” Her loved ones, including her father, John Ruszczyk, who lives in Sydney, have said they were desperate for information about what happened. “Justine was a beacon to all of us,” he said. On Wednesday, more details emerged. In the minutes before being shot on Saturday, Ms. Damond, whose legal name was Justine Ruszczyk, called 911 twice, according to transcripts released by the Minneapolis police. “I can hear someone out the back and I, I’m not sure if she’s having sex or being raped,” she told the dispatcher, “but it’s been going on for a while and I think she tried to say help and it sounds distressed.” The dispatcher said an officer was on the way. Eight minutes later, with apparently no officers yet on scene, Ms. Damond called again to reiterate her concern for the woman, asking whether the police had the wrong address. "

The newsletter originally published these personal stories last week. The writers discussed their stories on The Times’s Facebook page. A barista had just finished preparing an order and then called out “tall, black Marques; tall, black Marques.” Marques, a 6-foot-2 African-American man who works for a demolition company based in Colorado, stood bewildered by what seemed to be a racially charged incident inside a Starbucks. After realizing the misunderstanding — “tall, black” was referring to the coffee, not the person ordering it — he laughed and defused the situation with a joke: “That’s me, tall black Marques!” Everyday life brings awkward moments for everyone, but some of our daily stories are infused with added tension, especially if one or more of those involved perceive that race is a determining factor. We collected three more experiences from colleagues — on the sidewalks of New York, at a restaurant in Kansas City, Mo., and in the business world. Each case carries a different degree of clarity, and what took place can be a matter of perception. That’s where you come in. Have you ever been left wondering whether an experience was racism?

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. After the Republicans’ effort to replace the Affordable Care Act fell through in the Senate on Tuesday, President Trump said he’d now like to simply “let Obamacare fail.” On “The Tonight Show,” Jimmy Fallon suggested that Mr. Trump knew a thing or two about failure himself. This week is the end of the first six months of the Trump presidency. Mr. Fallon took the opportunity to rattle off some pros and cons. Stephen Colbert seemed a bit surprised to discover that Steve Whitmire, who has voiced Kermit the Frog since 1990, was fired by Disney over what the company called his hostile workplace behavior. But relatives of Jim Henson, the founder of the Muppets and the original voice of Kermit, said they agreed with executives. Using a puppet, “The Late Show” imagined how contract negotiations might go with a cantankerous Kermit. The best line from the bit: "
"London — Two court cases in London this week expose the difficulties we have in thinking about what it means to die with dignity. In one, the parents of a seriously ill baby, Charlie Gard, are pleading for judges not to order their son’s life support be turned off, but instead let him travel to the United States for experimental treatment. In the other, a terminally ill man, Noel Conway, suffering from motor neuron disease, wants the court to allow doctors to help him end his life at the moment of his choosing. The tragic case of Charlie Gard has made international headlines, with both Pope Francis and President Trump offering their help. Charlie suffers from a rare genetic condition that prevents his cells from producing sufficient energy to maintain normal bodily functions. His major organs are failing and, according to Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he is being cared for, he has suffered “catastrophic and irreversible brain damage.” He is on life support, which doctors believe should be switched off. Charlie’s parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, strongly disagree. They have pinned their hopes on an experimental treatment called nucleoside therapy. An American neurologist, Michio Hirano, of Columbia University Medical Center, has offered to treat Charlie, and his parents have raised about $1.7 million to fly him to America and pay for the treatment. The disagreement between Charlie Gard’s parents and the London hospital has ended up in the courts. Judges, both in Britain and at the European Court of Human Rights, have sided with the doctors. The High Court in London is considering new evidence about the efficacy of the treatment. Some commentators have presented the case as one of religious norms about the sanctity of life pitted against a secular “throwaway culture” in which notions of “intrinsic worth are falling by the wayside.” Yet the moral theologian Lisa Fullam has drawn on Catholic teachings to defend the decision to end Charlie’s life, while the philosophers Julian Savulescu and Peter Singer, both noted secularist thinkers, have questioned the court rulings. What makes the case particularly intractable is that there are valid arguments on both sides. Some moral questions have no single right answer. But if there is reason on both sides, there is also reason to question the judgments of the courts. "
"To the Editor: Re “As Senate Gives Up, Trump Makes Vow: Care Act Will Fail” (front page, July 19): President Trump’s pronouncement that the Affordable Care Act should be allowed to fail represents a disturbing abrogation of leadership. Presidents are elected to address problems whether or not the problems are inherited when they take office. Presidents Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Obama dealt with big challenges involving the Depression, the Korean War and the economy, respectively, and took action that largely reversed policies of their predecessors. They did so for what they felt was the good of the country. What we need from President Trump now is an understanding of what he signed up for when he took this job: leadership without blame. Health care is a place to start. ROGER HIRSCHBERG
BONDVILLE, VT. To the Editor: President Trump’s callous response to the collapse of the Senate Republicans’ disastrous plans to repeal and replace (or at least repeal) the Affordable Care Act reveals the depths of his depraved indifference to actual human beings: If he sabotages a system that has flaws but that has helped millions of Americans — for instance, by refusing to subsidize payments to insurance companies — many people will die. Apparently, Mr. Trump regards the issue as a win-lose game, and he can’t bear the prospect of losing, even if his winning would jeopardize the lives of millions. Propping up his own fragile ego is far more important to him than those people. DAVID MOORE, NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. To the Editor: President Trump now plans to sabotage the Affordable Care Act while claiming that it will collapse by itself. He says that when it does: “We’re not going to own it. I’m not going to own it.” "
"The transgender night life diva Amanda Lepore is, to quote the filmmaker Joel Schumacher, a “moving sculpture,” a person who has made her own body her life’s work. The night life columnist Michael Musto calls this ubiquitous carnivalesque curiosity, “the missing link between old New York and the current prominence of transgender divas.” Famous largely for the plastic surgery that she brazenly flaunts, Ms. Lepore has been photographed by David LaChapelle while bent over a gurney, receiving a silicone injection. The fashion designer Jason Wu created a doll in her Jessica Rabbit-meets-Jocelyn-Wildenstein likeness. Swatch even put out a timepiece with Ms. Lepore’s face and blowfish red lips emblazoned across the dial. And that’s to say nothing of the ad campaigns for Mac Cosmetics and Armani Jeans. Or the dance single she recorded with the producer Larry Tee (the title of which cannot be repeated in this newspaper). For those who still can’t get enough of this silicone-enhanced creation, there is now, “Doll Parts,” a memoir disguised as a coffee-table book that Ms. Lepore released this spring (with her ghostwriter, Thomas Flannery Jr.) and features many of Ms. Lepore’s most iconic images with collaborators such as Mr. LaChapelle, Marco Ovando, Pierre et Gilles and Roxanne Lowit. Not that Ms. Lepore is aiming to be the next Patti Smith. Sitting in the Gramercy Park hotel room she calls home, decked out in a fire-engine-red dress, her hair blown out like Jayne Mansfield, Ms. Lepore estimated that she’s read all of two books since 1986.

"François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, the French luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Brioni, wore a stretched-out zip-up hoodie. So did Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga. Ron Meyer, vice chairman of NBCUniversal, wore a Mr. Rogers black cardigan and baggy black shorts. Ivanka Trump wore an oversize white shirt, untucked, and skinny jeans. Omid Kordestani, executive chairman of Twitter, wore a Patagonia puffer. Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, wore skinny cargo pants and a cardigan the color of dried mud. These were some of the outfits modeled at that ultimate showcase of mogul leisure wear formally known as the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference 2017 and more colloquially called “summer camp for billionaires.” It may have ended Sunday, but its style preferences will resonate throughout the rest of the season. If you want to know how to dress down like a power player during the coming vacation period, there is no better case study, thanks to the distillation of entrepreneurs, executives and influencers brought together every July by the event’s founder, Herb Allen, the better to deal-make and elephant-bump in the rarefied altitudes of the Idaho aerie. Officially, there is no dress code at the conference beyond “relaxed” — or “humble,” as a regular attendee once told me — though name tags (humble!) are encouraged, along with the gift gear passed out to all attendees: navy or cherry red fleeces, hoodies, vests, polo shirts and baseball caps, so marked by the neat “SV17” logo over the left breast. And while the “no press” policy means less imagery emerges from the event than from, say, red-carpet happenings, enough snaps of schmoozing lords of the universe exiting their cars on arrival or taking the air between meeting sessions get released to provide fairly good intel on how they define off-duty dress. Which can best be characterized as “calculated schlubbiness.” Or “Who can give the impression they care less about what they wear than the next guy?” Apparently, when you’ve reached the top of the mountain, literal and professional, it’s really about the smarts, people, not the suits.

"MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — The rules are a bit of a buzzkill. Drug users must officially register with the government. Machines will scan buyers’ fingerprints at every purchase, and there are strict quotas to prevent overindulgence. But when Uruguay’s marijuana legalization law takes full effect on Wednesday, getting high will take a simple visit to the pharmacy. As American states legalize marijuana and governments in the hemisphere rethink the fight against drugs, Uruguay is taking a significant step further: It is the first nation in the world to fully legalize the production and sale of marijuana for recreational use. “The great responsibility we have in Uruguay is to show the world that this system of freedom with regulation works better than prohibition,” said Eduardo Blasina, the founder of the Montevideo Cannabis Museum. The final stage of Uruguay’s marijuana law comes as voters, lawmakers and courts across the Americas are increasingly leaning toward regulation and away from prohibition. Supporters of the shift say this tiny South American nation, which has low crime, a high standard of living and political stability, is now an ideal laboratory for what the future of drug policy in the region could look like. “This follows from increasing momentum by leaders in Latin America in calling for alternatives to the war on drugs,” said Hannah Hetzer, an analyst at the Drug Policy Alliance, which favors decriminalization. “What’s so important about this is it takes a debate about the need for alternatives and provides an actual proposal for an actual policy.” "
"The television show “Everybody Hates Chris” had no new episodes after 2009, but New Jersey voters are embracing a revived version whose working title could be “Just About Everybody Hates Chris.” This Chris is Chris Christie, the most unpopular New Jersey governor in modern history, according to opinion surveys. The polling institutes of Quinnipiac and Monmouth Universities are barely able to detect his political pulse. In recent weeks, both put his approval rating in the state at a meager 15 percent and his disapproval rating at 80 percent or higher. Even fellow Republicans are holding their noses, with less than a third of them offering approval. And a Morning Consult poll on Tuesday found him to be the least popular governor in the entire country. It is a stunning reversal for a man who, having won re-election in 2013 with more than 60 percent of the vote, dreamed the White House could be next. Now, with his statehouse days dwindling down, he is slouching toward the exit. He even spent two days last week auditioning for a host job on WFAN, the sports talk radio station. What passes for Christie charm came through on air, as when he dismissed an unfriendly caller as “a bum” and one of those “communists” from Montclair, N.J., or when he pronounced Hillary Clinton “a criminal.” A week earlier, he offended many New Jerseyans by sunbathing with his family on a state beach that he had put off limits to everyone else while he fought with lawmakers over the budget. There’s no question, though, Chris loves Chris. Whatever the issue, Mr. Christie manages to make it about himself. His constituents have obviously wearied of it, including the 500-plus days he spent out of state in his fruitless pursuit of higher office. They’re tired of feeling like the backdrop to his ambition. Many also remain appalled by the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane closings — payback to the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee for not supporting Mr. Christie’s re-election campaign. "
"The announcement from the BBC that the next incarnation of the Doctor, title character of the generation-spanning science fiction TV series “Doctor Who,” will be played by a woman (Jodie Whittaker, star of “Broadchurch”), plunged the more cootie-phobic corners of the internet into a tempest this week. “I always knew I wanted the 13th Doctor to be a woman,” Chris Chibnall, the show’s incoming head writer, said. “We’re thrilled to have secured our No. 1 choice. Her audition for the Doctor simply blew us all away.” The previous 12 Doctors — more than a half-century of them — have been played by men, all of them white. In case you’re unfamiliar with the series, the Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey who is hundreds of years old, has encyclopedic knowledge of the universe, can regenerate into a new body (any body) if wounded or killed, and travels through time fighting giant farting lizard babies, evil fire hydrants and occasionally Satan. A slightly different waist-hip ratio, one would think, shouldn’t stretch the imagination too far. Nevertheless, the announcement has yielded a wave of spittle-flecked contempt from certain online communities. A sampling, from Reddit: “Feminists killing of one of the most male dominated shows on the cuck BBC.” “Why don’t they also make her black and transgender so we’ve got all the PC boxes ticked?” “Looking forward to the episode where the doctor has to manage his period for the first time. It will happen.” “Surprised they didn’t pick Caitlin Jenner.” “Dr who was never supposed to be politically correct or girl power it was just Dr Who.” "
"In some alternate America, some Earth-2 (or Earth-27), there is a Republican Party capable of putting together a health care bill that isn’t incoherent and unpopular. In some distant, misty Neverland, there is a G.O.P. capable of balancing fiscal responsibility and limited-government principle with the creativity required to address working-class America’s social crisis. But the world is what it is, and a party that offers nothing, whose ideological sclerosis and internal contradictions allow it to offer nothing, might as well just go pass a tax cut and call it a day. It is no secret that this is what President Trump desires. The only reason we have spent so many months wandering the dark wood of Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that the Republican leadership in Congress persuaded itself that it could pull off a complicated fiscal maneuver, using health care reform to change the budget baseline in anticipation of a tax reform more comprehensive and enduring than George W. Bush’s tax cuts 15 years ago. It couldn’t, because there was never anything close to a Republican consensus about what health care reform should do. But this grand strategy’s failure still leaves the party with a simpler option, one that would satisfy the yearning for tax cuts that remains a divided conservatism’s only certain common ground. Republicans could just go ahead and cut taxes the way Bush did — without major offsets but with a 10-year expiration date, so that all you would need is 50 votes plus Mike Pence to do it. I’m not saying that Republicans couldn’t still do a comprehensive and permanent tax reform in theory. Set health care aside entirely and there are still lots of clever and plausible ways to overhaul and improve the tax code without sacrificing revenue. "
"The Trump administration’s election-integrity commission will have its first meeting on Wednesday to map out how the president will strip the right to vote from millions of Americans. It hasn’t gotten off to the strongest start: Its astonishing request last month that each state hand over voters’ personal data was met with bipartisan condemnation. Yet it is joined in its efforts to disenfranchise citizens by the immensely more powerful Justice Department. Lost amid the uproar over the commission’s request was a letter sent at the same time by the Justice Department’s civil rights division. It forced 44 states to provide extensive information on how they keep their voter rolls up-to-date. It cited the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, known as the Motor-Voter law, which mandates that states help voters register through motor vehicle departments. The letter doesn’t ask whether states are complying with the parts of the law that expand opportunities to register. Instead it focuses on the sections related to maintaining the lists. That’s a prelude to voter purging. Usually the Justice Department would ask only a single state for data if it had evidence the state wasn’t complying with Motor-Voter. But a blanket request to every state covered under that law is virtually unprecedented. And unlike the commission, the Justice Department has federal statutory authority to investigate whether states are complying with the law. These parallel efforts show us exactly how the Trump administration will undertake its enormous voter suppression campaign: through voter purges. The voter rolls are the key. Registration is one of the main gateways to political participation. It is the difference between a small base of voters pursuing a narrow agenda and an electorate that looks like America. Here’s how the government will use voters’ data. It will create a national database to try to find things like double-voters. But the commission won’t be able to tell two people with the same name and birthday apart. Such errors will hit communities of color the hardest. Census data shows that minorities are overrepresented in 85 of the 100 most common last names. "
"I worship Charlize Theron, the “Atomic Blonde” trailer is a hoot, and I love the story she keeps sharing with interviewers about training so hard for the fight scenes that she cracked several teeth. But please stop telling me that “Atomic Blonde,” on the heels of “Wonder Woman,” amounts to some hinge moment for movies, which are henceforth going to shower us with female action leads. I’ve heard that joke too many times before. Let’s talk instead about all the wonderful women — brawlers, bawlers, schemers, dreamers — on the small screen, a nickname that we have to retire because television is proving infinitely bigger in spirit and more in tune with the moment than most of the loud schlock shoveled into multiplexes. And let’s trade the usual, sadly necessary outrage about how poorly a given group of Americans is being represented for a hearty cheer about some heartening progress. The Emmy nominations came out last week, and they affirmed not only that television is indeed enjoying a golden age but also that part of that is its juicy opportunities for female actors. In terms of gender parity, it puts corporate America, the Trump administration and the Senate to shame. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump ordered senators back to the negotiating table on Wednesday for a last-ditch effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, just one day after angrily accepting the measure’s demise and vowing to allow President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement to crater. Mr. Trump, staring down a high-profile defeat on an issue that has confounded him and defied Republican consensus, told the party’s senators they must not leave Washington without acting on a measure to roll back Mr. Obama’s health law and replace it with something better. Simply repealing the bill without an alternative would increase the number of people without health insurance by 17 million in 2018, a figure that would jump to 32 million in 2026, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. At a White House lunch, Mr. Trump warned the senators that any who stood in the way would be telling voters that they backed the current, “failed” program. “I intend to keep my promise, and I know you will, too,” Mr. Trump told them, trying to resurrect a measure that appeared dead on Monday night, after a third and fourth Republican senator declared their opposition. That death was followed on Tuesday by an 11th-hour effort to force a vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, but that, too, failed when three Republican senators came out against it. The budget office report underscored on Wednesday why the idea of repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement lost traction so quickly. Not only would the number of uninsured jump, but average premiums for people buying individual health insurance policies would increase by about 25 percent next year and 50 percent in 2020. By 2026, premiums would double. The president’s demands for more negotiations amounted to his fourth position in three days on the health care bill. He began the week supporting a Senate effort to overhaul the law, but when it became clear late Monday that Republicans would fall short of the votes for that measure, he abruptly declared that lawmakers should simply repeal the law and start from a “clean slate” on an effort to replace it — an approach he had previously ruled out.

"Recently you’ve found internet fame after some of your public appearances went viral. Why do you think you’ve become so popular with young people? They like the way that I don’t camouflage how I feel. They don’t see elected officials act that way. When I first experienced the millennial response to me, I had come out of a classified briefing, and I told the group of media individuals who were there that I didn’t think James Comey had any credibility, and I threw up my hands and walked away — that went viral. How does it feel to be a meme? I have been adopted by the millennials, and I’m enjoying every minute of it! I’m learning a new language. You never think about shade, for example, other than, you know, ‘‘a tree is providing shade,’’ but when they taught me what shade was, I thought: Now, isn’t that creative? I’ve seen a few references to your rhetoric, including the nickname Kerosene Maxine. Do you like — I don’t. I think it was born out of a right-wing group’s description of a person they didn’t like, and they try to tag you with something that would help others believe there’s something wrong with you. I like Auntie Maxine. You’ve actually said that you have a right to your anger. There’s a history of enslaved African-Americans having to make their slave masters comfortable. This business of what we call skinning and grinning — that is something African-Americans are very much cognizant of. Tucker Carlson went after you recently: He used some very loaded language about your home, which he implied you could not afford on a government salary. I own several properties. The way he talked about it is: What right does an African-American woman have to do well? He doesn’t know anything about my investments, about the house that I’ve lived in for 25, 30 years. This idea of ‘‘how could she afford that?’’ is racist, and I just dismiss it. "
"I hired a limo service to drive me to a dinner party at a friend’s house. On the way, I remembered that I was supposed to bring the wine. I spotted a shop and asked the driver to pull over. When we arrived at my friend’s house, I asked the driver if he would help me carry the wine, because I had another bag to carry. He refused, on the grounds that he was a Muslim and was not allowed to touch alcohol. So of course, I carried the wine myself. The next day, I called the owner of the limo service — a close friend of mine who is also an observant Muslim — to apologize for my insensitivity and any awkwardness my request might have caused. He expressed surprise and then outrage at his driver’s behavior. A few days later, my friend told me that he had fired the driver. ‘‘When you are a driver,’’ my friend said, ‘‘you are not a Muslim, a Christian or a Jew — you are a driver, and your job is to deliver service. You didn’t ask him to drink the wine; you asked him to help you carry it into the house. He’s done.’’ I still feel guilty that this man was fired. Help me think the ethics of this through. Name Withheld First, let’s establish a few points. Muslims, like everyone else, take their ethical guidance from more than one source. The Quran, it’s true, doesn’t explicitly say you can’t carry wine, but there’s a well-regarded hadith — from the canonical body of traditions surrounding the life of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions — that records Muhammad condemning not just drinking wine but also making it, buying or selling it and carrying it. Many Muslims, accordingly, think it is wrong to carry wine, even if it’s not for their own consumption. Should it matter that the driver’s objection was religious rather than personal in nature? Well, yes. Liberalism — by which I mean civil liberties, civil rights, tolerance and pluralism: the small-L ‘‘liberalism’’ in ‘‘liberal democracy’’ — emerged from centuries of religious warfare in Europe. Before anything else, it’s a modus vivendi: an arrangement that allows different people to live together in peace. In our multi­religious society, we should make reasonable accommodations for the religious scruples of others. (I’m assuming that the driver’s job description includes providing assistance with packages.) Reasonable accommodation makes cohabitation possible; and, practical considerations aside, it enshrines the value of respect. Such conflicts arise even in states with official religions; recently, an Israeli court decided that an El Al flight attendant was wrong to move a female passenger to accommodate an ultra-Orthodox man, whose religious beliefs prohibited contact with women. Here a concern for civil equality trumped the concern for religious accommodation. Similar issues are posed by a case now before the U.S. Supreme Court involving a Christian baker from Colorado who declined to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. (He offered to supply a premade cake or other baked goods.) A state commission says he is violating the state’s nondiscrimination statute; the baker says the state is violating the free exercise of religion. When civil liberties conflict with civil rights, reasonable people can disagree about where to draw the line. Neither your driver nor his boss seems to have gotten the religious situation right, though. The tradition in question explic­itly forbids carrying wine; you might think that your driver already showed disregard for it when he agreed to transport the wine. I’m not claiming the right to say what his obligations as a Muslim are. But religious arguments are arguments, and if someone wants an argument to be taken seriously, the rest of us are entitled to explore whether it’s valid. Treating other people’s religions with respect doesn’t rule out such responses; it requires them. At the same time, your driver’s boss’s view is difficult to defend. We don’t, as a rule, think people should be required to do things that violate conscientiously held ethical principles. What your friend felt, I suspect, was not that you have to forget you’re a Muslim when you’re a driver, but that it was unreasonable for the driver to refuse to carry your wine because your friend’s own Muslim conscience would have permitted it. (As would many imams’; religions seldom speak with one voice.) But he’s not entitled simply to supplant the driver’s religious judgment with his own. "
"WASHINGTON — A billion-dollar World Bank initiative to advance women’s entrepreneurship, funded in part by Saudi Arabia and championed by Ivanka Trump, might seem a laughably easy target for reproach. There is Saudi Arabia’s treatment of women — they aren’t even allowed to drive alone — and the growing role of the “first daughter” as a presidential adviser. Then there are President Trump’s misogynistic comments. But despite the concerns around governance and ethics, the so-called Ivanka fund might be a sign that — despite its “America First” policy — the White House is not as combative toward multilateral institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as many in Washington expected. “The fact that they were going to the World Bank to begin with shows that they are not completely hostile to the institutions, and it points to more of an open door,” said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, who served as deputy assistant secretary for development finance and debt at the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama. “Not just on this one trust fund but the broader relationship is on pretty good footing going forward.” The future of both Bretton Woods institutions has been looking particularly dim with Mr. Trump’s anti-globalization rhetoric. He has signed an executive order to roll back American involvement in international institutions and proposed a budget that would slash $650 million in funding to multilateral development banks over three years. A House bill, proposed by the Appropriations Committee and expected to change significantly through the legislative process, suggests far deeper cuts. "
"The producers of children’s television know the key to holding a distractible audience’s attention: interactivity. Dora the Explorer asks kids to repeat after her (“Swiper, no swiping!”). Mister Rogers broke the fourth wall to welcome them to his neighborhood. The hosts of “Romper Room” pretended to see them through a “magic mirror,” and read their names on the air. It turns out you can apply the same formula to morning news. “Fox & Friends,” the three-hour wake-up program on Fox News, is an interactive magic mirror for Donald J. Trump. President Trump is the show’s subject, its programmer, its publicist and its virtual fourth host. The stars offer him flattery, encouragement and advice. When he tweets, his words and image appear on a giant video wall. It’s the illusion of children’s TV — that your favorite show is as aware of you as you are of it — except that for Mr. Trump, it’s real. In January the hosts, “Romper Room”–style, even pretended to be watching Potus, showing a video feed of the White House and asking him to flash the lights on and off if he was watching. (Producers added an effect of the lights flickering, a “TV trick” the hosts later acknowledged.) "
"President Trump’s commission investigating voter fraud held its first meeting Wednesday amid a swirl of partisan acrimony and questions about whether it is looking for facts or has already decided which facts it is trying to find. The session featured an early statement by Mr. Trump, whose baseless claim that he would have won the popular vote in 2016 if not for millions of illegal voters hung over the gathering. He said he was told stories during and after his presidential campaign of voting irregularities “in some cases having to do with large numbers of people in certain states.” The meeting’s coda was an MSNBC television interview in which Kris Kobach, the Kansas Republican who is the panel’s vice chairman and de facto head, was asked, “Do you believe Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three to five million votes because of voter fraud?” He replied: “We will probably never know the answer to that question. Because even if you could prove that a certain number of votes were cast by ineligible voters, for example, you wouldn’t know how they voted.” Mr. Kobach, one of the nation’s leading advocates of tougher voting restrictions, later said that he was addressing whether the exact breakdown of legal votes could be known, not who won, and that similar doubts hung over tallies in states that Mr. Trump won. The day’s events nonetheless did little or nothing to silence charges by Democrats and voting-rights advocates that the commission was a sham meant to produce inflated claims of fraud that would pave the way to stricter requirements for registering and casting ballots. In remarks to his Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, Mr. Trump pledged that its work would be open to inspection and would “fairly and objectively follow the facts wherever they may lead.” But he soon swung to an attack on officials who had refused to cooperate with the investigation, twice saying that voter data from their states would be “forthcoming” and raising doubts about their motives.

"Donald J. Trump’s approval ratings are the lowest at this stage of a presidency since modern polling began in the mid-20th century. But his party’s base still appears highly supportive, which has discouraged Republicans in Congress from abandoning the president and his legislative agenda. Even the most recent Russia revelations seemingly haven’t dented support for Mr. Trump among Republicans, who continue to approve of his job performance at very high rates — 82 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sunday, for instance. But numbers like these may mask a decline in support for Mr. Trump among his original party base. A new working paper by the Emory University political scientists B. Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz and Joshua McCrain argues that people who identify as Republican may stop doing so if they disapprove of Trump, creating a false stability in his partisan approval numbers even as the absolute number of people approving him shrinks. Gallup data supports this idea, showing a four-percentage-point decline in G.O.P. identification since the 2016 election that is mirrored in other polling, though to a lesser extent. One example is the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican member of Congress and an increasingly vocal Trump critic who has announced that he is leaving the party. If most people who have stopped identifying as Republicans are Trump disapprovers like Mr. Scarborough, we could observe stable party approval ratings for the president despite waning popularity with his previous party coalition.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Let Obamacare fail,” Trump says. With the collapse of the Republican effort in Congress to replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trump suggested a new plan on Tuesday: manage the health law badly. He has considerable leverage to do so, and could cut off subsidy payments to insurers or stop enforcing the mandate that most Americans have health insurance. We looked at how divisions in the Republican Party led to the failure of the Senate bill, and examined the language in the president’s tweets, which shows that his talent for distilling arguments into compact slogans didn’t work for the health proposal. Mr. Trump also faces the prospect that the most prominent legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama, could remain intact, our chief White House correspondent writes. Last, those seeking a new approach to health care might want to look to Rwanda, our business columnist suggests. "

"Good morning on this brilliant Wednesday. People have strong feelings about feet. We know, because we asked New York Today readers, and an etiquette expert: Are flip-flops or open-toed shoes O.K. at the office? The etiquette connoisseur Lizzie Post, the great-great-granddaughter of the etiquette expert Emily Post, recently published a 700-page book addressing topics including manners, politeness and behavior in public. “Often, what people complain about with any kind of flip-flop or slide — when there is nothing holding a heel in the shoe — is, ironically, about the flip-flop noise, the slapping sound that accompanies that type of shoe,” she said. Karen Boldizar, 59, who works in the cosmetics sector in Manhattan, agreed. “No one wants to hear you coming a mile away with the flip-flip-flip sound of an unsecured foot in a slide or flip-flop,” she told us. Even with the heat, she called for a flip-flop ban at offices. Alison Helfferich, 33, who works in finance in Manhattan, said sandals were fine for a commute, “but once you hit the office it’s time for close-toed shoes — air conditioning means you can’t get away with, ‘But it’s so hot outside!’” Several women who responded also debated the importance of pedicures for those in sandals. Ms. Post said the polish is not nearly as vital as the cleanliness. "
"WASHINGTON — It was supposed to be a straightforward undertaking for a Republican-led government: Start passing conservative, Republican priorities. But the collapse this week of  efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act was the biggest failure so far for Republicans, who began the year with bold visions of conservative change. Instead, they have watched helplessly as those visions fell victim to the intraparty division, dysfunction and gridlock that one-party control had been expected to eliminate. Now, some of the conservative groups that helped Republicans win control of Washington, and that spent large sums of money and political capital pushing for the health care overhaul, are increasingly worried that their party’s inability to pass ambitious legislation will imperil its chances in next year’s elections. And they are beginning an aggressive and expensive campaign to promote new tax cuts, which they see as their last and best shot at enacting a major conservative policy before voters punish them. “Tax reform represents the broadest opportunity to unify quickly,” said James Davis, a senior strategist for Freedom Partners, which oversees political activity for a network of groups funded by the brothers Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch. “Our network is going to be central in that discussion and in trying to push this over the top,” he added. “And I think it’s critically important to do it this year. You push it into next year and it becomes much more difficult to get major legislative accomplishments done.” Americans for Prosperity, the Koch group that will be most involved in the push, says it has spent nearly $1 million so far on lobbying and advertising efforts, including more than 500 meetings with lawmakers and their staff members on Capitol Hill and ads directed at Republicans on the Senate and House committees responsible for tax policy. By the time debate begins on a tax bill, expected later this year, the group will most likely have spent several million dollars more, its strategists said. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Last week, we asked you to tell us about your favorite places in California that are perhaps not widely known but should be. Here are some excerpts from the responses, organized roughly north to south: “Cheatham Grove, in Humboldt County — the finest redwood grove in the world. Nobody ever goes there.” — Cecelia Holland, Fortuna “I nominate the Bizz Johnson Trail, in Lassen County. One of the first rails to trails projects in the country, and a perennial favorite in that category — 25 miles of very lightly used trail with spectacular scenery.” — Erik Jefferts, Janesville “Point Arena — a small town between Mendocino and Bodega Bay.

"WASHINGTON — So it’s a few days before the election last November — just a few more days, surely, before Donald J. Trump would return to his golden tower to start a niche TV venture and fill a sagging Twitter feed with exclamation-pointed despair — and a book agent goes to his client with an idea: How about something on the Trump White House That Wasn’t? The writer — Steve Israel, then a Democratic congressman from New York, now at work on his third political satire — whips up a proposal, “Trumplandia.” Plot lines include a furtive meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, overnight social media rockets fired from Mar-a-Lago and a top administration post for Ben Carson, now the secretary of housing and urban development, who once suggested through a surrogate that he was not qualified to run a federal agency. “Highly implausible,” the agent said of the pitch then. “My pen name could have been Nostradamus,” Mr. Israel says now. Many classes of Washingtonian have struggled with these first six months in President Trump’s thrall: senators, fact-checkers, people who enjoy sleep. But in a city so enchanted by its own history, so practiced in projecting a seen-it-all nonchalance, it has been a particularly trying time for a certain kind of storytelling swamp creature. Novelists linger over blank pages. Historians grope for precedent, and shrug. Even past participants in scandal strain to follow the narrative arc. “It’s early. We’re getting introduced to the characters,” said John Dean, the White House counsel and Watergate supporting player during the Nixon administration, who has become a frequent author in the decades since. “We’re not quite sure how this story is going to unfold, as comedy or tragedy.” "
"In 1997, Al Gore, then the vice president of the United States, helped forge the first climate change treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, promising the rest of the world that the United States would lead the fight against global warming. That promise was broken when President George W. Bush later announced that the United States would abandon the treaty. In 2015, President Barack Obama made the same promise when he helped forge the Paris climate accord — a promise that was broken when President Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the United States from the deal. In a TimesTalks conversation in New York on Tuesday, I spoke with Mr. Gore about what went through his mind when Mr. Trump made his Paris announcement. Watch to find out how the Nobel Prize-winning climate change activist sees the landscape of policy unfolding in the 21st century, as the effects of climate change become more clear. "
"Donald Trump apparently wanted to set the record straight on the Kremlin Kaper in the strange interview he gave this week to The New York Times. Thank goodness for that, because the story line was getting hard to follow. Here’s where things stand. First, everything is fine because nothing happened between Trump and the Kremlin. And if anything did happen, no one should care and the only people who do are liberals whining about the election results. (Don’t get distracted by the fact that the main person still trying to reargue the vote tally is Trump himself. That’s the kind of thing that liberals toss in to muddy the waters.) Trump and his people never spoke to any Russians, and if they did, they either forgot about it or innocently failed to mention it because it was just normal socializing. And if it wasn’t just socializing, then there was no discussion of the campaign, and if there was discussion of the campaign, it was perfectly appropriate. It is not at all strange for a presidential candidate to get help from the Kremlin to win an election. Who knew that you’re not supposed to sign up Boris Badenov as a campaign adviser? (Or that health care would be hard, or that the president is not supposed to ask the F.B.I. chief to go easy on his friends, or that France is America’s oldest ally?) By now, you should be convinced that there was nothing to investigate about Russia. And if there was, Trump wasn’t being investigated personally. "
"The striped towels, deck chairs and palm fronds outside Rockefeller Center lent the Today Show set a distinctive summer vibe as Matt Lauer told viewers, “The Fourth of July weekend’s almost here, that means beaches, barbecues and books.” The thriller writer Brad Thor, a regular guest, brandished a copy of his own latest volume, “Use of Force.” “Didn’t ‘Foreign Agent’ just come out?” Mr. Lauer asked. “That was last summer’s book,” Mr. Thor answered. “Was it really already last summer?” Mr. Lauer said, a hint of disbelief in his voice. It was. And it’s a safe bet the next novel featuring Navy SEAL turned intelligence operative Scot Harvath will arrive like clockwork next summer. Only once in the past 16 years has he not published a single book. That was in 2010, when he published two. “I was glued to my desk and got two books out that year,” Mr. Thor said in a recent interview at the Manhattan restaurant Oceana. “I suddenly looked and there was my sweet dog, got older, I was like, ‘Wow, this year took a toll on everybody.’” Yet, from his insatiable fans, “the complaint I’m getting is I don’t write fast enough.” Mr. Thor, 47, has a knack not just for churning out books but for thrusting himself into controversies major and minor. Glenn Beck, a big booster, referred to Mr. Thor’s novel “The Last Patriot” as “the Da Vinci Code for Islam.” The plot, which centered on a secret involving the Prophet Muhammad, earned Mr. Thor death threats as well as accusations of Islamophobia. Comments he made last summer about removing Donald Trump, then a candidate, from the presidency if he won the election were interpreted in some corners as advocating harm. He prefaced the remarks as “a hypothetical I am going to ask as a thriller writer,” and denies he meant any form of violence. "
"It’s a dark and stormy night, and the hospital corridor is eerily illuminated by lightning flashes as Dr. Trump and Dr. McConnell enter a patient’s room and approach the bed of a young woman, Janet. “We have the best health care plan ever for you!” Dr. Trump says exultantly, to a thunderclap outside. “Tremendous! I’m the best! I take care of everybody.” He uses his stethoscope to listen to Janet’s heart, and frowns slightly. “Er, doctor?” Janet says. “I think my heart is on my left side, not the right.” “Let me double-check,” Dr. Trump replies, and he hurriedly moves the stethoscope over. “Who knew health could be so complicated?” He looks into Janet’s eyes, holds her hand in his own, and says in a silky voice, “Beautiful Janet, you’re in such great shape.” Janet, creeped out by the doctor’s inappropriate bedside manner, pulls back her hand and tightens her gown around her neck. Dr. Trump doesn’t notice and continues: “Your heart is a disaster. You need a new one, and that’s why we suggest a transplant. We don’t happen to have a replacement ready for you, but never mind. “Normally we do ‘remove and replace,’” Dr. Trump adds. “But in this case, if we can’t settle on a replacement, we’ll just do a flat removal. Nothing to worry about. Huge benefits. Huge!” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump thought he could sell balky Republican senators like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin on the Senate health care bill through pleasantries, cajoling and, ultimately, some Oval Office muscle. But Mr. Johnson could not be charmed. He could not be outbargained. And he could not be scared into supporting the measure for the sake of a president whose inability to bend fellow Republicans toward his political will has become a liability for his young presidency. As the brash Mr. Johnson reminded one associate recently, while Mr. Trump may have stunned the political world in 2016 by winning Wisconsin in the election, Mr. Johnson got 76,000 more votes in the state. Fear is perhaps the most powerful motivating force in politics, and fear of a powerful president is the surest lever to move a lawmaker from a “no” to a “yes” on a presidential priority. But over the past month, Mr. Trump scared no one into supporting the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He has proved simply too unpopular nationally — polling at 36 to 40 percent approval this week — too weak in many senators’ home states, too erratic and too disengaged from the details of governing to harness his party, as other new presidents have. Mr. Johnson, still angry at the Republican establishment for abandoning his long-shot re-election bid, may come around when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, holds a make-or-break procedural vote next week in a bid to revive the health care effort. But the votes of other senators have become more elusive. They have come to believe that their constituents, even the most conservative ones, are more loyal to them than to Mr. Trump. "
"I have written before about the fear of falling down the socioeconomic ladder, the fear of an irremediable loss of status, authority and prestige — and the desperate need to be rescued from this fate. But the topic bears further exploration because it has been such a prime motivation for one slice of the electorate, the swing voters who made President Trump’s unexpected triumph possible. The question that persists six months after Mr. Trump’s inauguration is why six key states — Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, along with 220 counties nationwide — flipped from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. Why did these voters change their minds? These are men and women who are, in the main, still working, still attending church, still members of functioning families, but who often live in communities where neighbors, relatives, friends and children have been caught up in disordered lives. The worry that this disorder has become contagious — that decent working or middle class lives can unravel quickly — stalks many voters, particularly in communities where jobs, industries and a whole way of life have slowly receded, the culminating effect of which can feel like a sudden blow. One suggestive line of thinking comes from Arlie Hochschild, the author of “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right” and professor emerita of sociology at Berkeley. Hochschild has studied Americans whom she calls “the elite of the left-behind.” Her findings shed light, I think, on the concerns of some of the voters who tipped the balance for Trump last year. Hochschild wrote to me that common refrains among these voters were “America’s heading downhill” and “I think our kids are headed for hard times.” In these conversations, she said, Nancy Isenberg, a history professor at Louisiana State University and the author of “White Trash: The 400 Year Untold History of Class in America,” responded to my inquiry about Americans anxious about losing their place: Isenberg expanded on this theme in the preface to the 2017 paperback edition of her book. “The election has opened up festering wounds. The deepest of these exposes how we measure the value of civic virtue and hard work,” she wrote. The 2016 campaign There is no question that the communities where Trump received crucial backing — rural to small-city America — are, in many ways, on a downward trajectory. From 1990 to 2009, the percentage of births to single mothers among whites without high school diplomas grew from 21 to 51 percent; among those who completed high school, the percentage rose from 11 to 34 percent. Along parallel lines, the percentage of intact marriages among white adults 25 to 60 years old without high school degrees fell from 70 percent in the 1970s to 36 percent in the 2000s. For those who finished, the percentage fell from 76 to 46 percent. As early as 2010, a report issued by the Institute for American Values and the University of Virginia, “When Marriage Disappears: The New Middle America,” found that the downward path of those without college degrees stood in contrast to the experience of those with degrees.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. After it was revealed that President Trump had an undisclosed conversation with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during the G-20 summit meeting, late-night hosts found themselves resorting to a range of similes. Mr. Colbert summed up his level of confidence in the Trump administration’s truthfulness: After the collapse of Senate Republicans’ ‘Plan C’ — to repeal the Affordable Care Act now and replace it later — Jimmy Fallon said the G.O.P. wasn’t done offering alternatives. “It turns out Republicans have prepared even more backup plans,” Mr. Fallon said. On “Full Frontal,” the correspondents Mike Rubens and Ashley Nicole Black attended a Trump impeachment rally — and threw some cold water on the whole idea. “More presidents have been removed from office by cholera than by impeachment,” Mr. Rubens said, suggesting that it was especially unlikely with a Republican-controlled Congress. He and Ms. Black urged protesters to become involved in local politics and issues rather than focusing on what they called a virtually unreachable goal. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Trump lashes out at Russia inquiry. President Trump said on Wednesday that he wouldn’t have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known that Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation, calling that move “very unfair.” In a wide-ranging interview with three Times reporters, Mr. Trump also criticized the officials involved in the inquiry, saying: “I’m not under investigation. For what? I didn’t do anything wrong.” Read excerpts and listen to audio clips from the Oval Office discussion. Also on Wednesday, the president had a message for Republican senators seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act: Keep trying. We looked at three things he’s doing to “let Obamacare fail,” as he’s put it. • McCain is diagnosed with brain cancer. Senator John McCain has one of the most malignant types of brain tumor, his office disclosed on Wednesday. "
"Few major financial institutions have been willing to lend to Donald J. Trump over the years. But during his victorious presidential campaign, he pointed to one that had done plenty of business with him: Deutsche Bank. Now that relationship has come under scrutiny. Regulators are reviewing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans made to Mr. Trump’s businesses through Deutsche Bank’s private wealth management unit, The New York Times reported, citing three people briefed on the review. The regulators are examining whether the loans might expose the banks to heightened risks. New York regulators have paid particular attention to personal guarantees Mr. Trump made to obtain the loans. There is no formal investigation of the bank, and personal guarantees are often required for big loans from wealth managers. The regulators are focused on whether these guarantees could create problems for Deutsche Bank should Mr. Trump fail to pay his debts, leaving it with a choice of suing him or risking being seen to have cut him a special deal. The concern is not hypothetical: Mr. Trump sued the bank to delay paying back an earlier loan. Separately, Deutsche Bank has been in contact with federal investigators, and it is likely eventually to have to provide information on the Trump accounts to the special counsel in the Russia inquiry, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump’s 20-year relationship with the bank is complicated, involving more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, most of them completed. Despite the risks involved, working with Mr. Trump has made Deutsche Bank money, according to people with knowledge of the details. "
"On a clear afternoon in mid-February, I met the photographer Peter Duke outside his apartment in Pacific Palisades, an affluent Los Angeles neighborhood situated on a high cliff overlooking the ocean. Duke is 60 but looks a decade younger; he has a head full of wavy, sand-colored hair, and in his green hoodie, khakis, black sneakers and a camera bag slung casually over his shoulder, he gave off the air of a retired director. Duke used to work as a fashion photographer, but lately he has turned his viewfinder rightward. Over the past few years, he has earned a reputation in conservative circles as a kind of visual fixer. He has worked behind the scenes, one pro bono shoot at a time, in an effort to manufacture a new image for the right, one that casts the figureheads of the political fringe in a more refined, almost majestic light. Duke’s subjects have included the belligerent blogger Charles Johnson, the conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, the flamboyant rabble-rouser Milo Yiannopoulos, the “guerrilla journalist” James O’Keefe and the documentary filmmaker Phelim McAleer, a pro-fracking climate-change denier. Duke’s surreal portrait of Malik Obama, Barack Obama’s Trump-supporting half brother, appeared on the front page of The New York Post last July. Perched atop his head is a red Trump hat; he’s flashing the “O.K.” hand sign and smiling impishly, as though he’s in on some secret joke. (Which he is; the innocuous gesture is something right-wing trolls have made charged by semi-ironically claiming it as their own.) After the sun had gone down, Duke and I made our way to a nearby Italian restaurant for dinner. “I know you probably don’t want to hear this, but a lot of people don’t read,” he told me over beers and pasta. “They look at the pictures.” He’s somewhat mystical on the topic of images; he believes that his photographs operate on a hypnotic level, an idea he picked up from Scott Adams, the creator of “Dilbert,” who predicted that Trump would win the election over a year in advance and has been cashing in on his bet ever since. Adams, who frequently blogs about Trump, claims that his experience as a trained hypnotist gives him special insight into the president’s rhetorical modes. Duke is an Adams devotee and often cites his books and theories in conversation. But he also believed, after examining Adams’s online presence, that he looked like a “total dork.” One image in particular, which Adams described to me as his “douchebag photo,” is often employed to accompany negative coverage. (It was taken, Adams says, about 20 years ago, for a Playboy shoot; hands raised before him, eyes to the sky, he looks like a kind of crazed Sunday preacher.) So in one pose, Duke shot Adams close-up, in black and white, with an old flannel blanket draped over his shoulders. The photo looks like a cross between an Eddie Bauer ad and a Richard Avedon portrait. “It’s a whole level of visual persuasion,” Adams told me, “above anything I had in my own inventory.” Duke believes in the primacy of visual culture, and most right-wing figures, he says, don’t take enough care to make themselves look good. Newt Gingrich, he tells me, is “disheveled”; Steve Bannon is a “schlub”; Trump’s hair is “problematic.” At the same time, he thinks left-leaning media outlets — which is to say, just about anything other than Breitbart News and The Drudge Report — go out of their way to present the right in a negative way. Recently, he drew my attention to New York magazine’s March cover story on Kellyanne Conway. Though he hadn’t read the article, Duke was bothered by Martin Schoeller’s clinically lit portrait, “the equivalent of being rendered by a fax machine,” he griped in an email. "
"BEIJING — For years, the fiery band of activists pushing for democracy in China looked to Liu Xiaobo, the jailed Nobel Peace laureate, as a source of inspiration. They created social media groups devoted to his iconoclastic poetry. They held up his photos at rallies, demanding justice and transparency. But Mr. Liu’s death last week of liver cancer, after a final, futile attempt by friends to bring about his release, has dealt a withering blow to the pro-democracy movement. Some say it is now at its weakest point since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. “It’s a turning point,” said Yan Wenxin, a human rights lawyer in Beijing. “The feeling of powerlessness among activists has peaked.” Under President Xi Jinping, the government has imprisoned dozens of lawyers, journalists and advocates and tightened controls over the internet. Now, the ruling Communist Party’s feverish attempts to erase Mr. Liu’s legacy have raised fears that Mr. Xi will intensify his campaign against activists pushing for ideas like freedom of speech and religion. The authorities, wary of turning Mr. Liu into a martyr, have in recent days censored online tributes and arrested activists who have sought to publicly remember him. The dearth of foreign leaders willing to criticize Mr. Xi publicly has added to a sense of despair and isolation among activists. Many say they feel abandoned by the United States in particular, and they worry that President Trump will prioritize trade with China at the expense of human rights. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Today is the six-month mark of Donald Trump’s presidency, and I think it’s still correct to say that his presidency is off to the least successful start in modern times. That’s not a judgment based on his policies (although regular readers surely know I’m no fan of their content). It’s instead an attempt to judge him on his own terms, as I tried to do at the 100-day mark: How effective has he been in accomplishing what he promised to accomplish? I’m somewhat surprised that the answer today feels so similar to the answer at the 100-day mark, because there were times in the last few months when he seemed on the verge of becoming more successful, at least on his own terms. After the House passed its health care bill, it was possible to imagine a series of major bills that would sweep away regulations, reduce benefits for the poor and middle class and cut taxes for the rich. All of that may still happen, given that Trump’s party controls both branches of Congress. But the prospect feels quite far away after the collapse, for now, of the most recent version of the Senate health bill. Instead, Trump has the lowest approval ratings in the history of presidential polling, no major legislative success (or even progress toward such success), a mushrooming scandal and investigation, ill will from many foreign leaders and a partly unstaffed executive branch. The presidency remains an awesomely powerful office, and Trump has had a clear impact. He successfully nominated a very conservative Supreme Court justice. He rolled back many Obama regulations, as the conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt has noted. And Trump has used executive orders to change policy on climate, immigration and other issues. In response to a video of a father being deported from Cleveland to Mexico yesterday, the progressive leader Neera Tanden tweeted: “Good reminder that though we can have legislative successes, Trump is doing heartbreaking damage thru his executive powers.” Trump is clearly more powerful than any other American today. He is also surprisingly lacking in power for a president. No wonder he seems so frustrated. Elsewhere: On Charlie Rose’s show this week, I discussed both the demise of the health care bill and my nourish-your-political-soul project, along with Gerald Seib of The Wall Street Journal. From the archives: Like many people, I’m thinking of John McCain this morning. I recommend reading his 1973 account, published in U.S. News & World Report, of his time as a war prisoner. “My final answer is the same,” McCain writes, recalling an act of amazing bravery and sacrifice. “It’s ‘No.’ ” You may also want to read a Times op-ed McCain wrote earlier this year, “Why We Must Support Human Rights.” "
"With efforts to reshape health care seemingly in shambles, Congress now confronts an issue that business-minded Republicans (and many Democrats) really care about: tax reform. As Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, put it this week, “We’ve got to move on to tax reform so we have a competitive tax system,” and do it “pretty quickly.” The House Ways and Means Committee continued hearings on tax legislation on Wednesday. The stakes couldn’t be higher for Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration, all anxious to demonstrate that a party that controls the White House and both houses of Congress can accomplish something significant and deliver on at least one major campaign promise. So what would be the elements of a tax reform plan that is fair and simple and will stimulate growth — not to mention attract at least 50 Republican votes in the Senate? A good place to start, say many Republicans and Democrats, is the Tax Reform Act of 1986, enacted under President Ronald Reagan with bipartisan support. Almost everyone, it now seems, loves it. Those behind the House Republicans’ tax plan — including the speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Ways and Means chairman, Kevin Brady of Texas — went to great lengths to praise Reagan’s accomplishment in their tax reform manifesto, “A Better Way.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s staff is used to his complaints about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but the Republican senators who attended a White House dinner on Monday were stunned to hear him criticize the man who was once Mr. Trump’s most loyal supporter in the Senate. It turned out to be a preview of even more cutting remarks Mr. Trump would make two days later in an interview with The New York Times: an extraordinary public expression of dissatisfaction with one of his top aides based on Mr. Sessions’s decision in March to recuse himself from the expanding federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Despite Mr. Trump’s avowal in the interview that he would not have picked Mr. Sessions if he had known he would recuse himself, Mr. Sessions said on Thursday that he intended to serve “as long as that is appropriate.” And a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, tried to moderate her boss’s remarks, telling reporters later, “Clearly, he has confidence in him, or he would not be the attorney general.” But even if Mr. Sessions remains in his job, the relationship between him and Mr. Trump — the Alabama lawyer and the Queens real estate developer, an odd couple bound by a shared conviction that illegal immigration is destroying America — is unlikely to ever be the same, according to a half-dozen people close to Mr. Trump. And this is not the typical Trump administration feud. The two men, divided by temperament, culture and geography, became surprisingly close in 2016, with Mr. Trump showing uncharacteristic deference toward Mr. Sessions, a Southern senator whose support he valued deeply. Mr. Sessions was the president’s first cabinet appointment. As attorney general, he has taken on as broad a policy purview as any member of the cabinet, with an ambitious law-and-order agenda — much admired by conservatives — that is focused on ending illegal immigration, attacking urban crime and restarting the Republican Party’s 30-year-old devotion to a “war on drugs.” Two of Mr. Sessions’s aides, Stephen Miller and Rick Dearborn, worked on the Trump campaign and have key roles in the White House. "
"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department on Thursday fined Exxon Mobil $2 million for violating sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in 2014 while Rex W. Tillerson, now the secretary of state, was the oil company’s chief executive. The penalty was relatively small for the Treasury and a blip on Exxon’s mammoth balance sheet, but it came as controversy over Russia policy has engulfed Washington. The Trump administration is facing questions about Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, and Congress has considered stiffening sanctions out of concern that President Trump will try to ease those already in place. The move also underscores concerns over Mr. Tillerson’s deep business connections in Russia. “Exxon Mobil demonstrated reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements,” the Treasury said in a report announcing the penalty. “Exxon Mobil caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program.” Hal Eren, a former official in Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said the fine showed that the department’s staff members would not be cowed. “It gives the message that they’re going to do what they have to even though Rex Tillerson is secretary of state,” he said. “Perhaps it was a bit of assertion of independence by the staff of O.F.A.C.” Exxon violated sanctions imposed after Russia’s armed actions against Ukraine when presidents of the company’s American subsidiaries did business with individuals whose assets were blocked, according to the foreign assets control unit. The violations involved the signing of legal documents related to oil and gas projects in Russia with Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company, and another person. "
"FRESNO, Calif. — The police responded to a call about a loud party on East San Ramon Avenue, but it wasn’t just any party: A sheep was reportedly being slaughtered in a backyard. “Muslim refugees were unaware that slaughtering sheep is not allowed in the city,” the police wrote afterward in their report, which also stated that those involved “were advised to clean up the blood and mess” and warned that in the future “they could be cited.” The animal, actually a goat, was killed by a Syrian refugee who later skinned, roasted and shared it with his Syrian neighbors in the apartment complex where they all live. Refugees are typically placed in towns and cities such as Buffalo, N.Y.; Boise, Idaho; and Fayetteville, Ark., where resettlement agencies ease their transition to life in a new country. But they are free to move about the country like anybody else, and they sometimes land in places like Fresno that are not exactly prepared for their arrival. Since late 2016, more than 200 Syrian refugees originally settled elsewhere in the United States have made a fresh start in Fresno, the largest city in California’s agricultural belt. They have been drawn there mainly by cheap housing. "
"THE FATE OF THE WEST
The Battle to Save the World’s Most Successful Political Idea
By Bill Emmott
257 pp. PublicAffairs. $28. ONE ANOTHER’S EQUALS
The Basis of Human Equality
By Jeremy Waldron
264 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $29.95. The greatest threat to Western liberal democracies in the future is more likely to come from extreme inequality than from Islamic extremism. This is because inequality erodes two foundation stones of modern society — openness to new ideas and opportunities, and a conviction that all citizens are morally equal. For the first three decades after World War II, openness and equality constituted a virtuous circle. Openness generated unprecedented levels of prosperity. That prosperity allowed America and the citizens of other modern nations to invest in excellent schools and universities, basic research, modern infrastructure and social insurance. These investments, in turn, made it easier for people to adapt to change, and fostered ever greater equalities of income and opportunity. The result was a high level of trust in the fairness of the political and economic system. But by the 1980s, the virtuous circle had stopped working. Economic and technological dynamism was upending jobs, convulsing communities and splintering families. At the same time, inequalities of earnings, wealth and job security were widening. After the financial crisis of 2008, many Americans, along with the citizens of other nations affected by the crisis, began to doubt the fairness of the system. Some came to feel neglected, disadvantaged, powerless or otherwise left behind. Within the decade they became easy fodder for demagogues who rejected openness and blamed “others” — immigrants, foreign manufacturers, the news media, racial or ethnic or religious minorities — for what had happened to them. Enter Donald Trump, who promised to “make America great again” by erecting walls, slowing immigration, withdrawing from free-trade agreements, cutting science budgets, attacking the free press and retreating from security alliances the United States has maintained since 1945. Meanwhile, Britain has pulled out of Europe. Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s National Front, has been mounting a challenge to the French establishment. Hungary’s Viktor Orban and others of his ilk are emulating closed-society dictatorships. The result is likely to be less prosperity and widening inequality. The old virtuous circle is in danger of becoming a new vicious cycle. "
"SHANGHAI — If Beijing has its way, the future of artificial intelligence will be made in China. The country laid out a development plan on Thursday to become the world leader in A.I. by 2030, aiming to surpass its rivals technologically and build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion. Released by the State Council, the policy is a statement of intent from the top rungs of China’s government: The world’s second-largest economy will be investing heavily to ensure its companies, government and military leap to the front of the pack in a technology many think will one day form the basis of computing. The plan comes with China preparing a multibillion-dollar national investment initiative to support “moonshot” projects, start-ups and academic research in A.I., according to two professors who consulted with the government about the effort. The United States, meanwhile, has cut back on science funding. In budget proposals, the Trump administration has suggested slashing resources for a number of agencies that have traditionally backed research in A.I. Other cuts, to areas like high-performance computing, would affect the development of the tools that make A.I. work. China’s capabilities, especially in advanced and new technologies, have long lagged those of its better developed neighbors as well as Europe and America. But a multiple-decade industrial policy to help it catch up has paid dividends. A.I. is one of a growing number of disciplines in which experts say China is making quick progress. Yet it was a foreign feat of A.I. prowess that provided one of the greatest impetuses for the new plan. "
"GOLAN HEIGHTS — Quietly, over the last year, hundreds of sick Syrian children and their chaperones have been whisked across enemy lines at dawn for treatment at clinics in Israel, slipping back home after dark. Truckloads of supplies have passed into Syrian villages through a gate in the sturdy security fence that Israel has constructed since Syria erupted into civil war, including stacks of flour, generators, half a million liters of fuel, construction materials, tons of shoes, baby formula, antibiotics and even a few vehicles and mules. This week, the Israeli military revealed the scope of the humanitarian aid project, which it calls Operation Good Neighbor and which began in June 2016 along the Israeli-Syrian boundary on the Golan Heights. The aid project depends on an extraordinary level of cooperation between old foes on both sides of the decades-old armistice lines separating the Syrians and Israelis. Military officials say they coordinate directly with Syrian doctors and village leaders to gauge needs. The humanitarian effort is likely to burnish the reputation of the Israeli military, which is usually viewed as an occupying force and formidable war machine. It also yields immediate security benefits by giving Syrian border villages — dominated by rebel forces fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad — an interest in keeping out more radical anti-Israeli militias, and represents what officials say is a longer-term investment in stabilizing the area. “The aid creates a positive awareness of Israel on the Syrian side,” said Col. Barak Hiram, the commanding officer of Israel’s 474 Golan Brigade, adding that it could lay the “first seeds” of some form of future agreement. "
"If you are still processing Barack Obama’s presidency and the 2016 election, an abundance of upcoming political books will help you along. Some are expected and have already gotten much press — both Obamas have book deals, as do Joe and Jill Biden; Hillary Clinton has a book out this fall, and James Comey’s was announced this week. Some are more surprising. In March, the White House florist, Laura Dowling, published a book featuring photos of the arrangements she created during her tenure, while Alyssa Mastromonaco, who served as President Obama’s deputy chief of staff, wrote a memoir that is being adapted by Mindy Kaling. And there are even more to come — from a former stenographer and campaign associates, as well as reporters who were on the ground. Here is a list of everyone (so far) who will be memorializing the former administration and President Donald Trump’s subsequent election. Eric H. Holder Jr., former attorney general
What We Know: In the forthcoming “Pursuing Justice,” the former attorney general will touch on both the personal and the political, recounting his immigrant roots — his father was born in Barbados — and discussing how to grapple with the application of justice. Holder will collaborate with with the Pulitzer Prize-winning Douglas Blackmon. The book is expected in 2018.
Burning Question: Will Holder tell us more about why he stepped down, or address criticism from the right that he engaged in partisan politics? Valerie Jarrett, former special adviser to the president
What We Know: In what will be part memoir and part handbook on good citizenship, Jarrett will describe her time as the longest serving senior adviser for the Obama administration, as well as her career in the private sector. Not much more has been shared, but in a recent interview, Jarrett said she hopes her book will serve in part as a “teaching instrument,” instructing readers on leadership and resilience, traits she considers particularly important for young people to learn. The book will be published in 2019.
Burning Question: Considering how long Valerie Jarrett has known the Obamas, will she share unheard stories? John Kerry, former secretary of state
What We Know: In an upcoming memoir, Kerry will go over his life, with particular emphasis on moments when he has been on the stage of history. He will give deeper insight into people he’s known, admired and even debated with over the years.
Burning Question: Kerry was instrumental in key diplomatic advances including the Paris agreement and the Iran deal. As both are threatened under the current administration, will Kerry defend his legacy? David Litt, speechwriter for Obama administration
What We Know: Litt, who was the senior presidential speechwriter for Barack Obama, is working on a humorous memoir about his political coming-of-age called “Thanks, Obama: My Hopey Changey White House Years.” He campaigned for Obama in 2008 as a fresh Yale University graduate, and later served as Obama’s speechwriter from 2011 to 2016. During that time, he was in charge of writing Obama’s speech for the White House Correspondents Dinners, for which he came to be called the “chief joke writer.” The book will be published on Sept. 19, 2017.
Burning Question: Did Obama ever contribute his own jokes? Jeremy Bernard and Lea Berman, former social secretaries for the Obama and Bush administrations, respectively.
What We Know: Slated for publication on Jan. 9, 2018, “Treating People Well: The Extraordinary Power of Civility at Work and in Life” will be a guide to social skills and etiquette in life and at work. The premise is reflected in the title: Everyone is important and should be treated well. In addition to being a social handbook, the book also includes behind-the-scenes anecdotes from both administrations.
Burning Question: How did this pair — who worked under two very different presidents — team up and become friends? "
"It’s an active construction site, hard hat and harness required, but the two tubes under the rising towers of the sprawling Hudson Yards development on the Far West Side of Manhattan are relatively peaceful. The nine-foot thick concrete walls, floors and ceilings are all smoothed over, humming with the whir of ventilation ducts and the low buzz of battery-powered LED lighting. Echoes from shouts reverberate for seconds. For two blocks, the box tunnels stretch, curving slightly as they cut a clean concrete cavern 90 feet below 10th and 11th Avenues, plugged on both ends by stark concrete walls that abruptly halt their march. For now, the tubes sit empty and unused. But someday, they might be key pieces to providing the relief that many rail travelers have long yearned for — the tubes would help link a new tunnel under the Hudson River to tracks leading to Pennsylvania Station. “What you see here is the concrete casing, complete here in the first two sections,” Craig Schulz, a spokesman for Amtrak, explained to Representative Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, as he toured the project on a recent weekday. Construction has yet to begin on one remaining section that would connect the box tunnels to the Hudson tunnel. The building of the river tunnel hasn’t begun either. Both projects lack funding. In this era of failing infrastructure and political gridlock, the two-block long caverns, known as the Hudson Yards right of way project, are a rarity for the region: largely completed and funded rail infrastructure work.

"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans ended a demoralizing week on Thursday with their leaders determined to press ahead with a vote to begin debating health care next week, but with little progress on securing the votes and no agreement even on which bill to take up. With President Trump urging them to move forward on their seven-year quest to erase the Affordable Care Act, Republican senators on Thursday still had not decided whether to revive a proposal to replace former President Barack Obama’s health care law with one of their own, or to simply repeal it and work on a replacement later. The choice is unpalatable: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday that the latest version of the bill to repeal and replace the health law would increase the number of people without health insurance by 15 million next year and by 22 million in 2026. Those figures are the same as the estimates in the budget office’s previous analysis, despite numerous changes to the bill intended to win votes. On the other hand, if senators opted simply to repeal the existing law, the budget office said on Wednesday, 32 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 compared with current law. The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, remained unswerving in his drive toward a vote next week on a procedural motion to begin debating health care. But he has not specified which version of the legislation he intends to put before the Senate. In effect, he is asking 50 senators to roll the dice and hope they land on an option they can work with. “You can’t debate something that you don’t initiate the debate on,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. “And everybody can offer endless amendments, so if anybody’s got a better idea, they can offer that and get a vote on it. And in the end, 50 people are going to decide whether we’re going to have an outcome or not.” "
"WASHINGTON — In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, President Trump made a number of misleading and false claims, including statements on health insurance, the biography of his deputy attorney general and French history. Here’s an assessment. “You’re 21 years old, you start working and you’re paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you’re 70, you get a nice plan,” Mr. Trump said. “Here’s something where you walk up and say, ‘I want my insurance.’” Mr. Trump’s description aligns with life insurance or Social Security more accurately than health insurance. A 21-year-old who took out a whole life insurance policy, for example, would pay premiums until death, and the amount accumulated over the decades would be paid out to beneficiaries. A 21-year-old who purchases a health insurance policy is not paying premiums to save up for care 50 years down the line. Rather, the 21-year-old’s premiums help cover the costs of an older person or someone with more expensive medical needs. Mr. Trump is right that in most situations, a 21-year-old is healthier than a 70-year-old and needs less medical care. But a 21-year-old with a pre-existing condition could have been denied coverage or charged much more before the Affordable Care Act’s passage. Motoko Rich, The Times’s Tokyo bureau chief, refuted Mr. Trump’s claim. Though Akie Abe, the wife of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaks Japanese in many public international appearances, she delivered a 15-minute speech in English in New York three years ago and made a public service announcement on H.I.V./AIDS for MTV in English.

"To the Editor: Re “Trump Lashes Out at Russia Inquiry and Its Overseers” (front page, July 20): In his interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, President Trump bemoaned the Russia inquiry, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s recusal from it and the Senate Republicans’ (and Mr. Trump’s) failure to create a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Like a child who is used to getting his way, Mr. Trump — who is not ready for prime time — is holding his breath and then screaming, ranting and threatening those around him as his presidential way of leading America. This apprentice is a failure at supporting American democracy and is trying to take this country in another direction. RICH LURIE, BOYNTON BEACH, FLA. To the Editor: Clearly, President Trump is becoming more uncomfortable and impatient with all the investigations swirling around him. In light of his bogus Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, and given all the suspicious and questionable behavior we have been witnessing, it seems in order to create a nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Integrity to investigate the president, his staff and his family’s conduct during the campaign and since the inauguration. Given the resignation of Walter M. Shaub Jr. from the Office of Government Ethics, the need for such a commission, with powers to subpoena and call witnesses, should be a high priority. "
"Richard Prince, who has pushed the legal limits of artistic appropriation for decades, will continue to fight for his art in court. This week, a federal judge in New York refused to throw out a photographer’s lawsuit against Mr. Prince over Mr. Prince’s use of an image in an exhibition. The case will continue, and could set a precedent for how the fair-use doctrine relates to Instagram, the photo-sharing app. In 2014, Mr. Prince presented an installation called “New Portraits” at the Gagosian Gallery, in which he printed various Instagram photos on large canvases, and added his own Instagram-style comments below them. The show led to a backlash, including from the photographer Donald Graham, whose photo “Rastafarian Smoking a Joint” was featured via a print from another user’s Instagram account. Mr. Graham first filed a cease-and-desist order against Mr. Prince, and then a lawsuit in 2015. Mr. Prince, the Gagosian Gallery and the gallery’s owner, Larry Gagosian, asked the court to dismiss Mr. Graham’s case, arguing that Mr. Prince’s work was transformative. But on Tuesday, the United States District Judge Sidney H. Stein challenged that premise, writing: “The primary image in both works is the photograph itself. Prince has not materially altered the composition, presentation, scale, color palette and media originally used by Graham.” The lawsuit will serve as a follow-up to a case brought against Mr. Prince by Patrick Cariou, whose photos of Rastafarians were used by Mr. Prince in collages and paintings. The United States Court of Appeals decided largely in favor of Mr. Prince, but left an ambiguous precedent for determining fair use. Four other lawsuits have been filed by other photographers whose work was used in “New Portraits.” Mr. Prince responded on Twitter: “Phony fraud photographers keep mooching me. Why? I changed the game,” he wrote on Wednesday. His Instagram account, which previously had over 70,000 followers, is currently disabled. Earlier this year, Mr. Prince made headlines for returning a $36,000 payment for a work that depicted Ivanka Trump. “It was just an honest way for me to protest,” he said. "
"WASHINGTON — For Republicans — who control every corner of this city — this should be a time of elation, running up the score on accomplishments. But their seven-year promise to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law has become an embarrassing, popcorn-worthy drama that evolves hourly around the tweeted whims of President Trump, who provides congressional Republicans with neither a policy blueprint to follow nor a bully pulpit on which to lean. The effort to rewrite the tax code — a durable Republican yearning — has been undermined by a budget fight in the House, an indecisive White House and the stalled health care effort, on which the tax changes were meant to rely. Even something that once easily unified Republicans — the desire to place sanctions on Russia — has unraveled in the House, creating the appearance that lawmakers are protecting the White House from a bill it does not want. An extended fight over the role of Congress in approving the use of force against the Islamic State set off another intraparty battle when Republican lawmakers joined Democrats to finally end the elastic post-9/11 authorization of military force against Al Qaeda, which has been used for every war ever since. Then, Republican leaders used their powers to strip the measure away in the dark of night. Some Republican senators, like Dean Heller of Nevada, should be gearing up for fights with Democratic challengers next year, but instead are trying to duck primary threats inspired at least in part by a president of their own party.

"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Risky Offshore Oil Strategy,” by Bob Graham and William K. Reilly (Op-Ed, July 5): As co-chairmen of the National Oil Spill Commission, Mr. Graham and Mr. Reilly concluded in 2014 that “offshore drilling is safer than it was” at the time of the Gulf of Mexico incident in 2010. It’s even truer today because of technological innovation, stringent new safety standards and strong coordination between federal and state governments and industry. A top-to-bottom review by federal regulators and operators resulted in more than 100 new or revised standards for well design, blowout prevention equipment and other elements of offshore safety. Advanced systems to cap wells at the ocean floor are in the Gulf of Mexico as a safety precaution, and independent third-party auditors and government regulators evaluate progress and update operational practices through the Center for Offshore Safety, created in 2011. Effective safeguards are in place so America’s abundant offshore resources can be retrieved safely. Our industry works toward responsible development and a goal of zero incidents. JACK GERARD, WASHINGTON The writer is president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute. "
"It was early summer, and the wealthy politician’s son was in trouble. He’d done something terrible, possibly criminal, something that would almost certainly derail his future and harm his family. As he and his siblings had always done, he went back to the family home, to confess to the father who’d had such high hopes for his offspring. “Dad, I’m in some trouble,” he reportedly said. And then the family took over. The family’s crisis team drafted a statement for the young man to give and, crucially, a strategy to shape the public’s perception. If America saw this married man in his late 30s as a boy — handsome and high-spirited, mischievous, not a criminal — he’d be able to squirm out of his misdeeds with minimal punishment. If this sounds familiar, it should. It’s how, in the summer of 1969, the Kennedy camp managed the fallout after 37-year-old Teddy drove his car off a bridge off Chappaquiddick Island, and his young female passenger died. We’ve all been having a good chuckle watching our president and his surrogates characterize Mr. Trump’s 39-year-old son, the married father of five, as an “honest kid,” a wide-eyed innocent whose only sin in agreeing to meet with a Kremlin-connected lawyer and others was, perhaps, an endearing overenthusiasm, like when a puppy won’t stop licking your face, or colluding with hostile superpowers. Every new revelation of each new Russian guest at that Trump Tower meeting, where the aim was to pass along Kremlin-gathered dirt on Dad’s competitor, makes Donald Jr.’s case look increasingly less credible.

"The value of the dollar has fallen steadily since the beginning of 2017, erasing a sharp rise immediately after President Trump’s election. To take one example, the number of euros that can be obtained for one dollar has declined to the lowest level in more than a year. The dollar has also declined against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi. Is that bad? It sounds bad. The exchange rate is a price — the price of money. When the price of milk goes down, that is good for families and bad for dairy farmers. When gas prices fall, commuters are happy and Exxon Mobil is sad. When the dollar drops, there are also winners and losers. The winners are American companies that sell goods and services to foreigners — manufacturers like Caterpillar; tourist attractions like Disney World; technology companies like Facebook — because those customers can exchange their currencies for more dollars. The losers are American consumers who now must pay more dollars to obtain foreign goods and services. Of course, many Americans are in both categories. They may benefit at work and suffer at the supermarket. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • More details emerged in the fatal police shooting of an Australian woman in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home. The episode has drawn international outrage about American police practices. Mohamed Noor, who shot Ms. Damond, was the first Somali police officer to be stationed in his precinct, which has a large refugee community that has at times felt victimized by the police. The mayor said that the shooting had happened “under circumstances we don’t yet comprehend.” _____ • The death last week of Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned Nobel Peace laureate, has dealt a blow to the pro-democracy movement in China. Some say it is now at its weakest point since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. "
"My 3-year-old daughter is obsessed with Donald Trump. This is a problem if 1) you live in New York City, 2) you are liberal, 3) your friends are liberal, 4) your daughter attends a liberal school and 5) your relatives are affected by the Trump administration’s travel ban. Yassi, my daughter, attends the kind of school that made counseling available in the wake of the 2016 presidential elections. Parents stood together comforting one another on Nov. 9 in an act of collective mourning that I hadn’t seen since Sept. 11. This is probably exactly the type of school that the Trump voters were hating on with their epic middle finger raised to the elites of this country. On that same morning, Yassi made few friends by screaming “Donald Trump!” at the top of her lungs in the crowded stairwell to her school. People whirled around to find the traitor. Red-faced and humiliated, I pulled her aside and said, “Shhhh, Yassi, we do not scream these things at school.” And so, an expletive was born, much more potent than any four-letter word. “Annabel,” she would say, turning to her best friend, “I want to tell you a secret.” Annabel would dutifully move closer. “Donald Trump!” Yassi would do her 3-year-old best to whisper, which, of course, turned out to be a poorly modulated stage whisper audible to anybody nearby. “What’s your name, little girl?” kindly strangers would ask her in the checkout line of a grocery store, or at the playground.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump said he never would have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation that has dogged him, calling the decision “very unfair to the president.” In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump also discussed his relationship with President Emmanuel Macron of France. “He’s a great guy — smart, strong, loves holding my hand,” Mr. Trump joked, referring to a couple of long handshakes that were caught on video. Here are excerpts from the interview. We discovered that Deutsche Bank has been in contact with federal investigators about accounts held by Trump businesses. The lender expects to have to provide information to the special counsel conducting the Russia investigation. Meanwhile, business records from Cyprus suggest that Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, owed millions to pro-Russia interests before joining Mr. Trump’s campaign. "
"HOOVER, Ala. — The classrooms, tucked above a municipal court here in the Birmingham suburbs, are a long way from the White House. But walk through a set of secured doors and into the futuristic-looking work space, and you will find an important wager by the agency best known for protecting presidents, the Secret Service. Only it has almost nothing to do with earpiece-wearing agents or armored cars. Though the Secret Service may be better known for keeping government executives safe, it also has a mandate to investigate and fight financial and other cybercrimes. And in an era of overworked protection details and nonstop cybercrime, it could use some help. So here at the National Computer Forensics Institute, the pupils are hardened police officers, prosecutors and, occasionally, a judge. Instruction mimics what the agency teaches its own special agents. And tuition is not only free, but the Secret Service throws in travel, room, board and, for police officers, tens of thousands of dollars of technology to set up their own forensics labs back home. In exchange, the Secret Service has quietly empowered a network of thousands of law enforcement officers across the country capable of processing digital evidence and indebted to the agency that taught them. “The threat nature has increased in the world, and the threats are all more and more integrated with the digital world,” said Ben Bass, the special agent in charge of the institute. “So assimilating that into what we do is really important.” "
"Yuval Sharon has instigated a mobile opera involving 126 performers, 24 limousines and six composers. He’s produced a headphone opera, set among commuters passing through one of the country’s busiest train stations. He’s encased Debussy’s ill-fated lovers, Pelléas and Mélisande, in a box of frosted glass. He’s organized a recital with a twist, staging Schubert songs and short Beckett plays on a single stage. And, in 12 months, he’ll become the first American to direct a production at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, founded by Richard Wagner in 1876 and still devoted to his operas. Its 2017 season opens on Tuesday, July 25; Mr. Sharon’s new “Lohengrin” will be the centerpiece of the 2018 proceedings. “At the risk of sounding really cheesy, it is a dream come true,” Mr. Sharon, 37, said over lunch earlier this year. Wagner courses through his artistic blood. Seeing “Siegfried” as a boy was a formative experience. He was Achim Freyer’s assistant for a controversial “Ring” cycle in Los Angeles in 2009, and recently directed “Die Walküre” in Karlsruhe, Germany. “For me, Bayreuth has always been this very holy place,” he said, adding, “I’ve already had five anxiety dreams about it, so that means I’m on the right track.” The invitation from Bayreuth, for a collaboration with the artists Neo Rauch and Rosa Loy into which he steps following the withdrawal of Alvis Hermanis, comes at a time when Mr. Sharon can do little wrong. There have been acclaimed engagements at European houses, including Peter Eotvos’s “Three Sisters” at the Vienna State Opera and John Adams’s “Doctor Atomic” in Karlsruhe, which won the Götz Friedrich Prize in 2014.

"Four months after President Trump proposed eliminating the cultural agencies altogether, a bill to continue to finance the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities won approval this week from the House appropriations committee. The House bill, part of the process of thrashing out the federal budget for fiscal year 2018, includes $145 million for each endowment. The amounts represent a cut of about $5 million to each agency, but is a stark contrast to President Trump’s proposal to eliminate the endowments entirely as outlined in his first federal budget plan he announced in March. That proposal was a political statement about the president’s wishes; Congress writes the federal budget, and those line items are now being thrashed out in the House and Senate. The cultural funds — a small part of the broader interior and environment appropriations bill — may eventually receive a vote by the full House, perhaps as one part of a bigger omnibus bill after the summer recess. The Republican-led Senate will weigh in on the endowments’ budgets, too, but that process probably won’t accelerate until later in the year. After being passed by the House interior and environment subcommittee last week, the bill — which includes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service and others as well as the cultural agencies — was approved on Tuesday by the full appropriations committee by a vote of 30-21. The vote came as a relief to supporters of the endowments. “It is a very solid rejection of the administration’s proposals to terminate the two agencies,” said Narric Rome, who is responsible for government affairs at Americans for the Arts, an advocacy group. “We consider the House number to be a very good starting point for the appropriations process.” "
"I have finally found something about Donald Trump’s arrogation of the presidency in which to take comfort: his absolute ineptitude at legislative advancement. The country may well be saved from some of Trump’s most draconian impulses by some of Trump’s most pronounced flaws: his lack of seriousness, his aversion to tedium and his gnat-like attention span. The embarrassing faltering of the Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act might be both history lesson and harbinger. Republicans in Congress weren’t prepared with a workable plan, and Trump never had any plan. He campaigned on applause-line policies: Anything that roused a response from his rabid adherents, he repeated and amplified. He never gave details because the details didn’t exist, and he wouldn’t have been able to understand and articulate them if they did. Trump was simply a megaphone for the primal screams of Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton haters flipping out over the cultural anxiety accompanying the ascension of women and minorities. He helped people find the language and the platform to disguise racial worry as economic worry. He helped people who inherently, in many cases maybe even subconsciously, loathe women, at least when they aspire to equality or power, to loathe Hillary Clinton, a woman aspiring to more power. Trump has a habit of keeping company and confidence with the racially offensive. The fact that Steve Bannon is his chief strategist and has an office in the White House should be proof enough. "
"The last thing the United States needs is another war in the Middle East. Yet a drumbeat of provocative words, outright threats and actions — from President Trump and some of his top aides as well as Sunni Arab leaders and American activists — is raising tensions that could lead to armed conflict with Iran. Tehran invites some of this hostility with moves like detaining Xiyue Wang, a Princeton scholar, and supporting the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. And for many American politicians, Iran — estranged from the United States since 1979 — deserves only punishment and isolation. But Iran and the United States also share some interests, like fighting the Islamic State. So why not take advantage of all the diplomatic tools, including opening a dialogue, used before to manage difficult and even hostile governments? It is useful to recall the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War, arguably America’s biggest strategic blunder in modern times. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the country was riveted on Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. But in Washington, the talk turned almost immediately to Iraq and the chance to overthrow Saddam Hussein, even though he had nothing to do with Sept. 11 and had no nuclear weapons, as President George W. Bush alleged. Mr. Bush decided to fight a pre-emptive war without a solid justification or strategy. Such a stumble into war could happen again. Here are some reasons to be concerned: ■ President Trump campaigned on a pledge to tear up the 2015 seven-nation nuclear pact under which Iran rolled back its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of sanctions. Although he twice certified to Congress, most recently on Monday, that Iran remains in compliance with the deal, he did so grudgingly and with the subsequent imposition of new sanctions related to Iran’s ballistic missile tests. The Iranians say Mr. Trump is in danger of violating the agreement, especially after urging European leaders not to do business with Iran. A central promise of the deal was that Tehran would benefit economically in exchange for its nuclear restraint. Instead of taking advantage of this diplomatic breakthrough, Mr. Trump seems intent on reversing it by provoking Iran to renege or reneging himself, in much the way he rejected the Paris climate accord. ■ Congress, which was overwhelmingly opposed to the nuclear deal when it was signed, is working on new sanctions. Republicans in particular have pressed Mr. Trump to toughen his approach. In a recent letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, four senators said Iran continues to wage “regional aggression, sponsor international terrorism, develop ballistic missile technology and oppress the Iranian people.” There’s truth in that. But the nuclear deal was intended to alleviate only the nuclear threat, and they, like other critics, fail to acknowledge that it represented important progress toward decreasing the risk of war in the region.

"The Democratic Party is at risk of repeating the billion-dollar blunder that helped create its devastating losses of 2016. With its obsessive focus on wooing voters who supported Donald Trump, it is neglecting the cornerstone of its coalition and failing to take the steps necessary to win back the House of Representatives and state houses in 2018. In the 2016 election, the Democratic Party committees that support Senate and House candidates and allied progressive organizations spent more than $1.8 billion. The effectiveness of that staggering amount of money, however, was undermined by a strategic error: prioritizing the pursuit of wavering whites over investing in and inspiring African-American voters, who made up 24 percent of Barack Obama’s winning coalition in 2012. In spring 2016, when the progressive independent expenditure groups first outlined their plans for $200 million in spending, they did not allocate any money at all for mobilizing black voters (some money was slotted for radio and digital advertising aimed at blacks, but none for hiring human beings to get out the vote). Predictably, African-American turnout plummeted. According to new census data, 59.6 percent of eligible black voters cast ballots last year, down from the 66 percent who voted in 2012. The problem cannot simply be attributed to the absence of Mr. Obama on the ticket: A slightly higher percentage of black voters, 60 percent, turned out for John Kerry in 2004, than cast ballots last year. In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the tens of thousands of African-Americans who voted in 2012 but didn’t vote in 2016 far exceeded the minuscule losing margins for Hillary Clinton. Nonetheless, Democrats seem to be doubling down on their 2016 strategy. In January, the Senate Democratic Caucus trooped to West Virginia for its annual retreat. According to published reports, the senators heard from panels of voters who had once voted for Mr. Obama but then chose Donald Trump. The Democratic National Committee’s “Unity Tour,” featuring the committee chairman, Thomas Perez, and Senator Bernie Sanders, included visits to overwhelmingly white states like Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska and Utah. Meanwhile, African-American women — who voted at a rate of 94 percent for Mrs. Clinton last year, the party’s most loyal voting bloc — had to write a letter to Mr. Perez demanding time and attention.

"Dear Dennis, To err is human. To tweet is to regret. When I decided last month to leave Twitter, it was in part because I knew that, while I couldn’t avoid the former, I could at least escape the latter. Not everything that pops into the heads of smart people is smart. Still less of it needs to be shared. “Silence is better for the wise, and how much more so for fools.” I’m sure you know the proverb. So it was with a grain of salt that I read your Bastille Day tweet: It sounded, frankly, like the kind of involuntary mental wet burp many of us have at moments of peak ideological irritation — for conservatives, often while reading the editorial pages of this newspaper. I didn’t think you could possibly mean it. Turns out, you do. On Tuesday you doubled down with an online column for Townhall. “The real threat to Western civilization is Western civilization ceasing to believe in itself,” you write. “And, in that regard, Russia poses no danger, while the left-wing dominated media and universities pose an existential threat.” You’re a smart guy, Dennis, and it’s not a dumb column. “Attacking what the media is doing is not the same as attacking the existence of the media,” you say. True. “Putin is indeed a murderous quasi-dictator,” you acknowledge. Delete “quasi”; otherwise correct. “Civilization connotes a body of ideas and a value system,” you add, making the point that Russia’s nukes can’t destroy it. Well, O.K., that’s one way of defining civilization. You end with a list of various things being done to Western civilization in the name of multiculturalism, anti-DWEMism and so on, none of it with the help of Putin. Much of it is indeed bad, though I’m not sure that Justin Trudeau declaring there is “no core identity, no mainstream in Canada” counts as a Spenglerian moment in the story of Western decline. "
