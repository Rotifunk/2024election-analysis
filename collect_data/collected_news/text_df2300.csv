"Paul Manafort, who was forced out as President Trump’s campaign chairman last summer after five months of infighting and criticism about his business dealings with pro-Russian interests, disclosed Tuesday that his consulting firm had received more than $17 million over two years from a Ukrainian political party with links to the Kremlin. The filing serves as a retroactive admission that Mr. Manafort performed work in the United States on behalf of a foreign power — Ukraine’s Party of Regions — without disclosing it at the time, as required by law. The Party of Regions is the political base of former President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who fled to Russia during a popular uprising in 2014. The disclosure hints at the vast fortunes available to top American political consultants plying their trade in other countries. It was not immediately clear if Mr. Manafort would be required to pay any fines for the late filing. He has maintained that a majority of his work for Mr. Yanukovych was political consulting in Ukraine, where his firm, Davis Manafort International, operated an office at the time. The Party of Regions employed Mr. Manafort to help rebrand Mr. Yanukovych and his party, which was long known as tilting toward Russia, as modernizers favoring closer ties to the European Union. All the work disclosed by Mr. Manafort on Tuesday predated Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. "
"Senator Mitch McConnell hoped that keeping his wretched bill to destroy the Affordable Care Act secret until the last minute would make it easier for him to railroad fellow Republicans. The facts the majority leader had hoped to suppress came back to bite him on Monday when the Congressional Budget Office released a detailed review of the bill that confirmed what governors, doctors and indeed the American public had been saying for days: The bill is a cruel hoax that would help the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the poorest. With members of his own party balking at even bringing the measure to the Senate floor, Mr. McConnell announced on Tuesday that a vote would be delayed until after the July 4 recess. A wiser course — for his party as well as the nation — would be to concede defeat and give up what now seems a desperate quest to fulfill a seven-year-old party commitment to kill an Obama-era program that, as it turns out, a large number of Americans would like to see preserved and improved. The budget office said the measure would leave 22 million more Americans without insurance by 2026. Hit hardest would be lower-income people between the ages of 50 and 64 and people struggling with chronic illness or battling addiction — many of the same voters who believed President Trump’s promises to improve their health care. The bill would cut $772 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, which covers most of America’s poor children and nursing home patients, to help finance tax cuts for the wealthy. Some Republican senators — Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas — actually complain that the bill is too generous and doesn’t deliver sufficient spending cuts. But others — Susan Collins of Maine, Rob Portman of Ohio, Dean Heller of Nevada — have listened to those who are outraged that they’d even consider such a harmful measure. Having drafted a bill so indefensible on the merits, Mr. McConnell and his allies promoted it with fibs. Mr. McConnell, for instance, claimed it would “strengthen Medicaid.” John Cornyn of Texas said it would “save the people who are currently being hurt.” "
"In CNN’s newsroom, it is called the Triad: a three-pronged internal system designed to ensure that sensitive reporting by the network’s journalists is unimpeachable before it runs. Last week, the Triad fell short — and by Tuesday, the consequences were being felt across the news industry and in the hallways of the White House. CNN was forced to apologize after retracting a story on its website that a Russian bank linked to a close ally of President Trump was under Senate investigation. Three high-ranking journalists at the network resigned. But the mea culpa did not stop Mr. Trump and his supporters from seizing on the mistake, condemning CNN and claiming it as evidence that other major news organizations were conspiring against the administration. On Twitter, Mr. Trump wrote that “they caught Fake News CNN cold” and asked, “What about all the other phony stories they do?” By the afternoon, Mr. Trump’s deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was on live television scolding the White House press corps over the retraction, even urging Americans to watch a video filmed by a controversial right-wing activist, James O’Keefe, that showed a low-level CNN producer criticizing his network. “Whether it’s accurate or not, I don’t know, but I would encourage everybody in this room and, frankly, everybody across the country to take a look at it,” Ms. Sanders said of the video.

"A Supreme Court ruling that a church-run preschool must be granted publicly funded tire scraps for its playground seemed on Monday to be narrowly drawn, attracting even the votes of two of the court’s liberal justices, Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer. But school choice advocates across the nation saw the decision as a game changer in the divisive debate over publicly funded vouchers for private religious schools. And their judgment seemed validated on Tuesday when the legal ramifications began to reshape education debates across the country. The Supreme Court on Tuesday sent two cases back to state courts for reconsideration in light of the ruling for Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Mo. One of those cases concerned a program in Colorado — ruled unconstitutional by the state’s highest court — that awarded public funds to help families cover tuition at private schools, including sectarian ones. The Supreme Court regularly sends back pending cases for a re-airing after it renders decisions that seem legally relevant, but such a move does mean that the court believes there is a “reasonable probability” that a lower court may come to a different decision in light of its findings. In the Trinity opinion, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, held that the Missouri ruling against aiding the church “expressly discriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their religious character.” To voucher advocates, that language was cause for celebration. “This is a tremendous development for school choice,” said Michael Bindas, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, who is representing families who lost scholarships in the Colorado case. “It shows the court takes the principle of neutrality toward religion in public benefits programs very seriously. We’re very confident that the Colorado Supreme Court may come to the correct decision.” "
"John Zimmer, the co-founder and president of Lyft, wants you to know that he is not — I repeat, not — happy about the chaos that is enveloping Uber, his fiercest rival in the ride-sharing market. There will be no corks popped at Lyft’s San Francisco headquarters over the sudden, stunning downfall of Travis Kalanick, Uber’s truculent former chief executive, and no giddy high fives will be exchanged over the chain of scandalous events that have demoralized Uber’s staff, shredded its executive ranks and damaged its reputation. “There’s nothing to celebrate in this situation,” Mr. Zimmer told me in a phone interview Monday, his first public comments since Mr. Kalanick resigned last week. “But it does shine a light on the importance of values and ethics.” Another executive might be tempted to take a victory lap at a moment like this, but Mr. Zimmer, one of Silicon Valley’s more earnest and mild-mannered entrepreneurs, wants to stay above the fray. In fact, he is so unwilling to pounce on Uber’s struggles that he won’t even name the company, which he refers to as “our competition.” Lyft’s refusal to gloat publicly over the misfortunes of the Competitor-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is a savvy maneuver from a company that has spent years positioning itself as the friendly, laid-back alternative to Uber’s cutthroat corporate ethos. Lyft began cultivating a reputation for kindness years ago, when it affixed quirky pink mustaches to drivers’ cars and encouraged them to fist-bump their passengers, and it has continued with feel-good marketing and an emphasis on driver-friendly policies. The company’s big bet was that customers didn’t want just a cheap ride — they wanted an experience, and given the choice between two ride-sharing companies offering similar services at similar prices, they would opt for the one with a whiff of virtue to it. “For a while, people kept saying, ‘Oh, they’re the nice guys, they’re not going to build the right business because there’s someone that’s more aggressive,’” Mr. Zimmer said. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s campaign to rein in North Korea is about to get a lot more complicated, as a progressive new leader in South Korea and fraying ties with China leave the United States with fewer partners to press Kim Jong-un on his nuclear or missile programs. Mr. Trump will get a first taste of this less friendly landscape on Thursday, when he welcomes South Korea’s newly elected president, Moon Jae-in, to the White House for dinner and an Oval Office meeting the next day. Mr. Moon campaigned on an independent-minded foreign policy and is more interested in engaging with the North than Mr. Trump’s hawkish advisers. He also halted the deployment of an American-made antimissile system in South Korea. White House officials hope to defuse any tensions by trying to build good personal rapport between Mr. Trump and Mr. Moon, a 64-year-old human rights lawyer who served a previous South Korean leader, Roh Moo-hyun, known for clashing with the United States over North Korea. As he tries to win over Mr. Moon, Mr. Trump already is pivoting to a harsher approach to China, according to administration officials. The United States has demanded that Beijing crack down on Chinese banks and companies that do business with North Korea. And it plans to move ahead soon with tariffs on steel imports that are aimed partly at China. In its latest human trafficking report, issued on Tuesday, the State Department also downgraded China to the worst category, along with Syria, Iran, Russia and North Korea. It said China was guilty of using forced labor from North Korea. "
"The Trump administration on Tuesday took a major legal step toward repealing a bitterly contested Obama-era regulation designed to limit pollution in about 60 percent of the nation’s bodies of water. The rule, known as Waters of the United States, or Wotus, had extended existing federal protections of large bodies of water, such as the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound, to smaller bodies that flow into them, such as rivers, small waterways and wetlands. Issued under the authority of the 1972 Clean Water Act, the rule has been hailed by environmentalists. But farmers, ranchers and real estate developers oppose it as an infringement on their property rights. President Trump signed an executive order in February directing Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to begin the legal process for rolling back the water rule, calling it “one of the worst examples of federal regulation.” On Tuesday, Mr. Pruitt released a 42-page proposal to rescind the rule. Publication of the plan is the first step in a lengthy legal process that the Trump administration must undertake to eventually enact a new regulation, one that is expected to have far fewer restrictions and pollution protections. The administration will also have to detail its legal reasoning for scaling back the rule, a case environmental groups are sure to challenge. The proposed rollback of the Obama water protection rule will have little immediate practical effect: A federal court had already delayed implementation of the regulation until legal questions are resolved. Supporters and opponents of Mr. Trump’s agenda to aggressively roll back federal regulations both saw the move as a significant step toward reversing President Barack Obama’s environmental actions. “This proposal strikes directly at public health,” said Rhea Suh, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. “It would strip out needed protections for the streams that feed drinking water sources for one in every three Americans. Clean water is too important for that. We’ll stand up to this reckless attack on our waters and health.” Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Republican chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and an ardent champion of Mr. Trump’s push to unravel environmental regulations, cheered the move. “The Wotus rule would have put backyard ponds, puddles and prairie pot holes under Washington’s control,” he said in a statement. “I applaud the Trump administration for working to remove this indefensible regulation. I will continue to work closely with the administration as it seeks common-sense ways to keep America’s water clean and safe.” "
"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has long enjoyed a reputation as a master tactician. But when it comes to repealing the Affordable Care Act, he seems to have miscalculated in the first round of play. He assumed that his conservative and moderate colleagues would come together to make good on their seven-year promise to repeal the health care law, and quickly. But when he assembled a group of senators to cobble together a health care bill last month, he seemed to go out of his way to exclude some of the most knowledgeable members and moderate voices on health care, like Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a doctor, and Susan Collins of Maine, an insurance expert and one of the few women in the Senate Republican conference. Views outside of Mr. McConnell’s on health care did not receive extensive consideration. When Republicans from states that had expanded their Medicaid programs quickly found themselves at odds with more conservative members who wanted a large rollback of Medicaid, Mr. McConnell did little to allay those worries. Conservatives generally wanted to rein in costs while moderate members wanted to increase spending, particularly in states where health care costs are high and opioid addiction is escalating. On those key issues, Mr. McConnell put his legislative thumb on the scale in favor of conservatives, quickly alienating many senators from states that had expanded Medicaid, such as Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as well as Ms. Collins, who became an early and vocal opponent of the bill.

"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security will start construction of prototypes for a border wall this summer in the San Diego area, agency officials said on Tuesday, the first step in fulfilling a campaign promise made by President Trump. Homeland security officials said the prototypes would be added to the existing border walls in San Diego and would allow the agency to evaluate which barriers are most effective in giving Border Patrol agents time to respond to illegal drugs and human smuggling. Officials said they planned to build four to eight prototypes but did not say when construction would begin. “We own that land, have access to it and it’s a good place to start testing in a real-world environment,” Ronald D. Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner at Customs and Border Protection, said at a news briefing. John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, has said that there are no plans to build a wall along all 1,900 miles of the border with Mexico, which Mr. Vitiello has also said. Mr. Vitiello added that the agency had identified about 130 miles that would be unsuitable for a border wall because of bodies of water or other challenging terrain. After Mr. Trump issued an executive order on a border wall in January, Customs and Border Protection in March issued two requests for proposals, for both a concrete wall and other wall types. "
"PARIS — They have had their differences, but when President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Trump spoke by telephone on Tuesday about the threat of a new chemical weapons attack by Syria, Mr. Macron seized the opportunity and invited Mr. Trump to Paris for Bastille Day. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Trump would accept the invitation, which was also extended to his wife, Melania, according to a statement from the Élysée Palace. But the traditional military parade in Paris on this Bastille Day, July 14, will also commemorate the 100th anniversary of America’s entry into World War I to fight alongside the French, British and other Allies. While relations between French and American leaders have been marked by friendship and friction since then, Mr. Macron and Mr. Trump got off to a rocky start. During the French presidential election, Mr. Trump did little to conceal his preference for Mr. Macron’s chief opponent, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. And when the two presidents met for the first time, in Brussels during a NATO summit meeting on May 25, they engaged in the now-famous extended handshake. Even though they kept smiling, their knuckles turned white from the powerful grip. Later that day, at another gathering, Mr. Trump seized Mr. Macron’s hand. And after Mr. Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change, Mr. Macron strongly defended the accord. “I can assure you,” he said in English, “France will not give up the fight.” He capped off those remarks with a twist on the Trump campaign slogan: “Make our planet great again.” In February, during the presidential campaign, he posted a video inviting American climate scientists to move to France since “your new president” is “extremely skeptical about climate change.” But during the final stages of the contest against Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron avoided attacking the American president directly. Since then, he has been more optimistic about Europe’s ability to work with Mr. Trump than some of his European counterparts, like the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “In terms of the fight against terrorism, he has the same drive for efficiency that I do,” Mr. Macron said in an interview with a group of European newspapers last week. He added, “I don’t share some of his choices, above all on the climate issue.” They are to meet again at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, which begins on July 7 — a week before Bastille Day.

"Because we treat old age as a medical problem in the United States, health care policy change always has profound and far-reaching effects on conditions of life for the elderly. The health care bill currently before the Senate, if passed with its proposed cuts to Medicaid intact, is certain to produce drastic upheaval in the landscape of long-term care. That program is by far the largest source of funding for nursing home stays, supporting nearly two-thirds of long-term care residents. It is worth grappling with just how gruesome the results of cuts to it can be. The idea that nursing homes are depressing places is an old one. But life inside nursing homes changes with historical circumstance. The age distribution of our population, the structure of the labor market and the design of our welfare state have produced many different configurations. Cuts as aggressive as those proposed in the Senate bill are bound to cause serious damage — and we have real historical experience showing how bad it can get. It’s now largely forgotten, but a wave of institutional abuse swept through long-term care facilities in the 1970s. In that decade, there were abuse scandals and investigations in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Reflecting on some of the evidence brought before his Senate subcommittee in 1975, Senator Frank Moss, Democrat of Utah, wrote that what he had heard was “something like a Dickens novel.” The problem was systemic. Nursing home staff had too much to do in not enough time. At best, this meant neglect: Investigations found patients left in their own filth for days, infections and sores ignored, medical needs unmet and rehabilitation completely out of the question. “The dirt was indescribable,” testified one inspector to the United States Senate about homes she’d seen in New York. A doctor who treated patients from abusive nursing homes said they were often so dehydrated they couldn’t sweat or swallow. “The experience is so common in the hospitals in New York,” he testified, that “if you mention to a colleague that a new arrival is a nursing home patient, it means he is a comatose patient who has bedsores, is dehydrated and has pneumonia or urinary tract infection.” At worst, patients were subjected to treatment close to torture. In a giant Pittsburgh-area nursing home, staff immobilized hundreds of patients every day because they could not manage their needs. If patients created “extra” work — for example, through incontinence — or spoke out about their treatment, they were subjected to punishment. Among countless such incidents, witnesses described seeing an aide spray cold water on the genitals of an African-American patient with diarrhea while insulting him with a racial slur. A woman named Dorthy, the neediest patient on her floor, had both diabetes and Parkinson’s, and was unable to move any part of her body except her mouth and her eyelids. When she asked for care, “she was screamed at, slapped and told to ‘shut-up’ many times by the staff.” Staff alternated starving and force-feeding her, and, according to eyewitnesses, played with the buttons on her adjustable bed, making it rock back and forth. A patient named Carrie, a blind woman, spoke out about the abusive conditions. The administration sent a psychiatrist to evaluate her, who described her as entirely clear-headed but recommended that she be committed if she continued not to cooperate. "
"DALIAN, China — Three undercover investigators who were seeking evidence of abusive labor practices in the manufacture of Ivanka Trump-branded shoes have been released on bail from a detention center in southeastern China pending a trial, the activist group that employed the investigators said on Wednesday. Their release on bail represents the first confirmation that the three men have been thrust into China’s labyrinthine criminal justice system, and have not just been quietly detained for a few days. China Labor Watch, the group that sent the men into two factories that produce Ivanka Trump shoes, called for them to receive a fair trial. The spokesman for the public security office in Ganzhou, where the men had been held, did not respond to telephone calls requesting comment. The Ivanka Trump brand declined to comment on their release on bail, and Ms. Trump has not commented on the investigators’ detention. She has been publicly urged to do so by the best-known Western expert on China’s criminal justice system, Jerome Cohen, a professor at New York University who has specialized in the subject for a half-century. Mr. Cohen has said that public comments from her would considerably help the legal prospects for the men and the conditions under which they were held. But Ms. Trump did call in a speech at the State Department on Tuesday for strong action against countries where human trafficking occurs, in conjunction with the release of a United States government report that labeled China as one such country. That report particularly criticized the treatment of migrants in China, however, and not necessarily factory workers. Two of the men — Li Zhao and Hua Haifeng — worked undercover in the giant Dongguan factory of Huajian International, a Chinese company that claims to make shoes worn by one in every 10 women in the United States. The factory has made a wide range of brands of shoes, but makes only the heels of Ivanka Trump-branded footwear. "
"MADRID — It has been the destiny of Venezuela to bounce between the extremes of oppression and freedom. The crisis now convulsing the country follows this historical pattern. Every day, Venezuelans of all stripes pour into the streets protesting the loss of their freedom and their constitutional rights by a tyrannical regime that condemns them to scarcity, illness, malnutrition and outright hunger. Social media has given us a wealth of shocking images: the National Guard firing indiscriminately into crowds, killings, tanks moving against demonstrators. A daily Tiananmen while President Nicolás Maduro dances salsa. However, Chavista power in Venezuela is continuing its decline from its glory days with Hugo Chávez. On Tuesday, a rogue faction of police apparently dropped grenades from a helicopter onto the Supreme Court in Caracas in what Mr. Maduro called a “coup plot.” We cannot simply wait for the resolution of this drama as if it were a television series. In spite of the Organization of American States’ failure to reach an agreement to condemn the Maduro administration’s atrocities, Venezuela needs a rapid solution. And we cannot abandon the Venezuelan people in their fight for economic rescue and political freedom. This struggle has gone on for 200 years. In its war of independence — the longest such war on the continent — Venezuelans killed one another with unbelievable savagery, including women, and children and the elderly. A quarter of the population died as well as almost all its considerable wealth of cattle. But also extreme, in ambition and intensity, were the activities and programs of Simón Bolívar, the liberator of five future Latin American nations. And the same was true of his contemporary Andrés Bello, perhaps the greatest republican thinker of 19th-century Latin America. Venezuela suffered through long periods of dictatorship and achieved constitutional order only in 1959, at the hands of another extraordinary figure, Rómulo Betancourt, the first Latin American convert from communism to democracy. Unfortunately, democracy confronted an expiration date. In 1998, the Venezuelan people, tired of a two-party regime stained by corruption and social inequalities, voted Hugo Chávez into power. Much more than a populist, he was a redeemer skilled at and addicted to the intense use of media. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles. The push to approve a single-payer universal health insurance in California never had much of a chance this year, at least according to most longtime Sacramento observers. So perhaps the only surprise came in the timing when the Assembly speaker, Anthony Rendon, announced late Friday afternoon that he would shelve the bill and urged supporters to come up with details before introducing it again. In the capital and beyond, moderates applauded the move, saying it was little more than a hollow promise that would cost the state some $400 billion a year. But one response that ricocheted around social media made it clear how infuriated some liberals were by his decision. In an adaptation of California’s state flag, the image showed a knife brandishing the name “Rendon” stabbing a grizzly’s back. "

"Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some get a series order 400 years post-mortem. On July 10, TNT will debut the first two episodes of “Will,” a boisterous, steampunk-style period drama that imagines William Shakespeare’s early years in London. Shakespeare remains a cultural touchstone and an academic trove. The tales he adapted and invented can still astonish, delight and provoke. But can his own story — 20-something kid from a sleepy, sheepy market town breaks into the Elizabethan theater scene — inspire a hit show? Well, it’s been tried in film — from a 1914 silent movie to “Shakespeare in Love” to the authorship conspiracy thriller “Anonymous” — and on television, too, chiefly in “Will Shakespeare,” the 1978 English series that starred Tim Curry as Will and Ian McShane as his rival Christopher Marlowe. Yet it’s never been attempted with so many tattoos and piercings and stage dives while “London Calling” pulses on the soundtrack. Craig Pearce, Baz Luhrmann’s longtime writing partner and the creator of “Will,” explains the punk-rock mode as an analogy for theater in Shakespeare’s day. “It wasn’t this polite thing,” he said. “It was 3,000 people crammed into these wooden structures. They were fighting and they were drinking and they were eating.” If they liked a play, they cheered. If they hated it, they revolted. But how to communicate that visceral sense of sweat and thrum and poetry via the cool medium of television? Any new take on Shakespeare’s life and work, in whatever medium, has to decide whether to hang on to the original story and language or whether to modernize them. You can stay highly faithful to period and language, as in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptations, say, or old-school BBC made-for-TV movies. You can depart pretty radically from both, as in Akira Kurosawa’s “Ran” or “Scotland, Pa.” or even the spirited “10 Things I Hate About You,” which repurposed “The Taming of the Shrew” as a tart high school romance between Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. Mr. Pearce’s screenplay for 1996’s “Romeo + Juliet” (directed by and co-written with Mr. Luhrmann) and Joss Whedon’s recent “Much Ado About Nothing” kept the lines Elizabethan while updating the setting, while the Oregon Shakespeare Festival is currently embarked on an opposite project, keeping the plays in period, but updating the language.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Stephen Colbert and President Trump finally have something in common: They’re enjoying the chance to take some shots at CNN, after the network retracted a report about a Trump ally. Three journalists resigned on Monday in the wake of the incident.

"This week we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter novel, and the beginning — in Britain, at least; the first volume’s publication in America came a little later — of a cultural juggernaut that defined a generation’s experience with books. It is a timely anniversary, since if you believe what you read on social media the Potterverse has never been more relevant. As Western politics has become more extreme and a generation raised on Hogwarts more politically engaged, the Potter novels have been embraced ever more fervently as political allegories and moral manuals for our times. As I write this The Telegraph of London has just informed its readers that a poll reveals that Jeremy Corbyn belongs in Gryffindor while Theresa May should be in Slytherin — respectively the bravest and most sinister of houses on the Hogwarts campus. Hillary Clinton has just given a speech praising the Potter novels for instilling progressive values in the young. Meanwhile, the social-media celebrations of 20 years of Potter have temporarily crowded out the endless liberal memes comparing Trump and his court to Voldemort and his Death Eater lackeys. Writing for The Spectator recently, Lara Prendergast offered a good survey of the proliferation of Potterpolitics, from anti-Trump organizers invoking “Dumbledore’s Army” to J. K. Rowling’s Twitter interventions (“Voldemort was nowhere near as bad,” she wrote of Trump’s proposed Muslim ban) to Hermione Granger’s — sorry, Emma Watson’s — role as a roving ambassador for millennial feminism. Prendergast also offered a harsh assessment of the trend: “If you have ever wondered why young people are often so childish in their politics, why they want to divide the world between tolerant progressives and wicked reactionaries, it helps to understand” that they think they’re living in a Potter novel. Admittedly, if you think that the world really is divided between tolerant progressives and wicked reactionaries, you won’t find this assessment all that damning. "
"The dangerous dispute between Qatar and other Arab gulf states, chiefly Saudi Arabia, has gone on for three weeks, diverting attention from fighting the Islamic State and other serious challenges. It shows little sign of resolution. The Saudis and the United Arab Emirates provoked the row by breaking diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposing an effective embargo, ostensibly because of Qatar’s coddling of terrorists and other issues. Senator Bob Corker now suggests a way to end the impasse and force some sort of reconciliation: halt arms sales throughout the region. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican, must give preliminary approval to major arms sales, along with the panel’s senior Democrat, Senator Ben Cardin, and the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday, Mr. Corker said that recent disputes among the gulf states “only serve to hurt efforts to fight ISIS and counter Iran.” Future arms sales approvals would thus be held up until he receives “a better understanding of the path to resolve the current dispute and reunify” the regional group, the Gulf Cooperation Council. This would give Mr. Tillerson a new tool for resolving the crisis, though the impact may not be immediate. The Trump administration is already moving forward with a plan to send $510 million in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia for use in the Yemen civil war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and with a $12 billion deal for Qatar to buy F-15 jets. But the Saudis and the emirates might eventually come looking for more weapons to prosecute that war, at which point the United States should say no. The war is a humanitarian catastrophe that urgently needs a political settlement. President Trump himself is also partly responsible for the mess, having encouraged the Saudis by siding against Qatar when the embargo was declared early this month, even taking credit for the decision. He appeared unconcerned by the fact that Qatar hosts two American military bases crucial to the anti-ISIS effort. And he later added fuel to the conflict by accusing Qatar of funding terrorism at a “very high level” soon after Mr. Tillerson called for calm. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump will travel to Paris for Bastille Day next month at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, White House officials said on Wednesday. The statement said Mr. Trump would use the July 14 visit to celebrate the French National Day and to mark the 100th anniversary of the entry of the United States into World War I. “President Trump looks forward to reaffirming America’s strong ties of friendship with France,” the statement said. But the visit could be contentious, given the history, however short, between the two leaders. During their first meeting in Brussels last month, their prolonged, tightly gripped handshake suggested a tense relationship. Mr. Trump was open about his enthusiasm for Mr. Macron’s opponent in the recent French presidential elections. And Mr. Macron was openly derisive of the American president’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accords. Mr. Macron coined the expression “Make our planet great again” to tweak Mr. Trump over the climate decision. And in a speech after Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal, Mr. Macron all but urged Americans to move to France. “I call on them: Come and work here with us — to work together on concrete solutions for our climate, our environment. I can assure you, France will not give up the fight,” he said. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Senate health plan is delayed. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has a reputation as a master tactician. But his assumption that conservative and moderate Republicans would unite to support the Senate’s health care proposal appears to have been a miscalculation, our congressional reporter writes. Mr. McConnell has delayed a vote on the bill until after a congressional recess, another setback in efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. President Trump, who didn’t play as active a role in marshaling support for the bill as he did for a similar measure in the House, said, “We’re getting very close.” We looked at how health care costs would increase for older Americans under the Senate plan, and at how governors from both parties sought to block it.

"Paul J. Massey Jr., a millionaire real estate sales executive, unexpectedly ended his Republican campaign to challenge Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York on Wednesday, citing the cost of running against an incumbent as the reason for halting his bid. Despite rivaling Mr. de Blasio in fund-raising, Mr. Massey, a first-time candidate for public office, struggled to gain support among voters in polls during nearly a year on the trail. His withdrawal all but cleared the way for Nicole Malliotakis, an assemblywoman who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn, to win the Republican nomination. Mr. Massey ended his campaign with a statement hours after appearing with Ms. Malliotakis at a breakfast debate, in which he drew harsh scrutiny for claiming that the city’s low crime statistics had been “fudged.” But in an interview on Wednesday after announcing his withdrawal, Mr. Massey said he had decided in recent days to leave the race and had told some on his staff on Tuesday. “I hadn’t caught fire; I thought I would at some point,” said Mr. Massey, who spent lavishly to build a team of experienced Republican consultants but struggled to settle into the role of political candidate. “In marketing something, you got to have excitement around it. And, you know, it wasn’t there.” His decision to drop out thrust Ms. Malliotakis into the role of Republican front-runner after little more than two months of campaigning and offered an opening for outsider candidates like Roque De La Fuente, a San Diego developer who recently moved to New York City to run for mayor as a Republican. The independent candidate Bo Dietl, a former detective and private investigator, remains barred from running as a Republican. "
"Civil rights organizations and some members of Congress are troubled by the Trump administration’s rollback of civil rights enforcement generally, but they are particularly worried by what is going on at the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. The office has played a crucial role in protecting the rights of transgender students and victims of sexual assault and especially in forcing school districts to abandon disciplinary policies that unfairly single out minority children for suspension and expulsion. This issue came to the fore this month when the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Candice Jackson, sent a memo to the office’s regional directors backing away from a policy that requires investigators to look for systemic problems — and whole classes of victims — when civil rights complaints emerge. The department says the new policy will expedite investigations, but critics rightly argue that it could discourage the staff from opening cases at all. Over the past decade, investigators often looked at years of data to determine if discrimination, harassment and other problems raised in a complaint indicated a systemic problem that affected other students in the same school district or institution. That kind of data collection has allowed the department to ferret out trends that might otherwise have been missed — notably concerning school disciplinary practices. For example, in 2014 parents and educators across the country were startled to learn that minority children were subjected to excessive disciplinary practices at every level in the public schools. Federal data showed that minority preschoolers — mere 4-year-olds — were nearly four times as likely to be suspended as their white peers, at an age when they cannot absorb the lesson from such a punishment. Federal civil rights officials issued guidance showing districts how to avoid such discriminatory policies. Beyond that, the data has had a powerful effect on researchers wo have begun looking into the roots of this serious problem. Civil rights groups and lawmakers are worried that the Education Department is preparing to abandon the role it is supposed to play in prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex and disability. The United States Commission on Civil Rights — an independent bipartisan agency that advises the government — has begun an investigation into the administration’s retreat, citing the Education Department as a place of particular concern. And on Tuesday, Senate Democrats demanded that the department furnish information about how investigations are being handled and why the policy was changed. In addition, a bipartisan group of House members have asked the department to maintain guidance issued by the Obama administration for combating sexual violence in schools of kindergarten through 12th grade. This represents a good start. But civil rights groups and federal lawmakers need to keep bird-dogging this agency whose job is to protect America’s schoolchildren. "
"American flags. References to border security. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents dragging away immigrants in the thick of night. A music video released on Wednesday for “Immigrants (We Get The Job Done),” a song off “Hamilton Mixtape,” is replete with stark political imagery and not-so subtle messaging targeting President Trump’s rhetoric on immigration. “Hamilton Mixtape” is an album of covers sung by mainstream artists including Alicia Keys and Usher, inspired by the Broadway musical-turned-cultural phenomenon “Hamilton” and released shortly after the presidential election in 2016. The song “Immigrants,” performed by K’naan, Snow Tha Product, Riz MC (known to film audiences as Riz Ahmed) and Residente, is the first from the album to spur a music video. The video starts with a number of somber train passengers, seemingly immigrants, listening to the radio. “It gets into this whole issue of border security,” a commentator says. “Who is going to say that the borders are secure?” “It’s really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants, ‘immigrant’ has somehow become a bad word,” the commentator adds, setting the tone for the video. It was directed by Tomas Whitmore and executive produced by Robert Rodriguez and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton.” The video, which lasts more than six minutes, morphs to immigrants stitching American flags under the main refrain of the song and Snow Tha Product rapping in front of an American flag. There are shots of workers picking fruit in fields, Riz MC rapping his verse on a barely-lit New York City subway car and, eventually, immigrants being dragged away in the dead of night by border patrol agents. “Hamilton” is no stranger to politics. President Obama was an avowed fan of the show and invited the cast to perform at the White House after seeing the musical multiple times, one of them at a fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee. After the election, “Hamilton” found itself the target of Mr. Trump’s ire. In late November, Mike Pence, then the Vice President-elect, attended a performance and found himself being directly addressed by the cast during a curtain call after drawing jeers from the crowd. Standing on the stage, Brandon Victor Dixon, who played Aaron Burr, said to a departing Mr. Pence, “We truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. All of us.” Mr. Trump demanded an apology, saying the cast had been ““very rude” toward Mr. Pence and that the theater “must always be a safe and special place.” "
"To the Editor: Re “The Anti-Legacy,” by Peter Baker (news analysis, Sunday Review, June 25): Do you know why President Trump is working so hard to tear down former President Barack Obama’s legacy? Because Mr. Obama represents everything that Mr. Trump is not: an articulate orator, a deep thinker and someone who is elegant in style, words and actions. Mr. Obama brought grace, self-deprecating humor and sensitivity to our country’s deepest concerns, and a fearless commitment to public service. He risked his presidency over his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. Barack Obama is the light, and Donald Trump is the dark, and all the world now knows it. GABRIELLA EVANS, BELMONT, CALIF. To the Editor: Your online headline asks, “Can Trump Destroy Obama’s Legacy?” It’s a fair question, but the more important one is what parts of Barack Obama’s legacy President Trump will keep. Here is where the real danger lies, as President Trump continues and consolidates the less savory aspects of Mr. Obama’s legacy, some of which he inherited from George W. Bush (and expanded upon): the enlarged powers of the presidency; the extension of post-9/11-era “security” legislation; the encroachment upon civil liberties; the deportation of undocumented immigrants; the obeisance to corporations and so on. In our rush to brand the Trump era as an exception to the norms and standards of American-style democracy, we risk overlooking the truly shocking changes to democracy that occurred in the United States after 9/11. CHRISTOPHER PAVSEK
VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA The writer, a U.S. citizen living abroad, has made two documentaries about the United States after 9/11. "
"WHITESBURG, Ky. — Dewey Gorman, a 59-year-old banker who has struggled with opioid addiction, had just gotten out of the hospital in this tiny central Appalachian city when he heard the word from Washington: His fellow Kentuckian, Senator Mitch McConnell, had delayed a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He felt torn about that. “It’s broken. It’s broken very badly,” Mr. Gorman said of former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. “But if they want to take away insurance from 22 million people — a lot of them would come from these mountains. That would be devastating to our area.” Perhaps nowhere has the health care law had as powerful an impact as in Kentucky, where nearly one in three people now receive coverage through Medicaid, expanded under the legislation. Perhaps no region in Kentucky has benefited as much as Appalachia, the impoverished eastern part of the state, where in some counties more than 60 percent of people are covered by Medicaid. And in few places are the political complexities of health care more glaring than in this poor state with crushing medical needs, substantially alleviated by the Affordable Care Act, but where Republican opposition to the law remains almost an article of faith. While some Senate moderates say the Republican bill is too harsh, Rand Paul, Kentucky’s other Republican senator, is among Senate Republicans who say they are opposed to the current bill for a different reason: They believe it does not go far enough to reduce costs. Mr. McConnell, who was re-elected handily in 2014, seems committed to his party’s pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act even if it might hurt some constituents back home. A study last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the percentage of uninsured in Kentucky dropped from 18.8 percent in 2013, the year the health law was put in place, to 6.8 percent — one of the sharpest reductions in the country. Here in Whitesburg, a city of roughly 2,000 people at the base of Pine Mountain, Mr. Gorman’s sentiment seems to be the prevailing one. In nearly two dozen interviews with health care workers and patients, at the hospital and at a nonprofit clinic run by the Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation, Kentuckians sounded both fearful and flummoxed by the health care drama on Capitol Hill.

"Last Friday, CNN sent a man with colored pencils into the West Wing of the White House to cover the news. It was the third time in a week the Trump administration banned cameras from the daily press briefing, so the cable network sent a veteran sketch artist to capture the not inconsequential news of the day: The Senate had just released details of a health care plan that would deprive 22 million Americans of health insurance, and President Trump announced that he did not, as he had previously hinted, surreptitiously record his conversations with James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. In our nonstop, high-resolution, streaming age, the sketches look almost comical — and indeed, many dismissed it as a stunt. Just when it seemed things couldn’t get more absurd, Steve Bannon, the White House chief strategist, offered this penetrating explanation for the sporadic prohibition against cameras: “Sean got fatter.” But the truth is that the decision to prevent the press secretary’s comments on the day’s most pressing matters from being televised is an affront to the spirit of an open and participatory government. It’s especially chilling in a country governed by a Constitution whose very First Amendment protects the freedom of the press. Unfortunately, the slow death of the daily press briefing is only part of a larger assault by the Trump administration on a precious public resource: information. Our government does millions of things each day. It purchases medicine for Veterans Affairs hospitals, it inspects agricultural products for safety, it counts trucks on interstate highways. Each of these actions creates a data record and, in aggregate, these records help us as citizens gain detailed information about the operations of government. "

"SINTRA, Portugal — The rise of robots has long been a topic for sci-fi best sellers and video games and, as of this week, a threat officially taken seriously by central bankers. The bankers are not yet ready to buy into dystopian visions in which robots render humans superfluous. But, at an exclusive gathering at a golf resort near Lisbon, the big minds of monetary policy were seriously discussing the risk that artificial intelligence could eliminate jobs on a scale that would dwarf previous waves of technological change. “There is no question we are in an era of people asking, ‘Is the Robocalypse upon us?’” David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told an audience on Tuesday that included Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and dozens of other top central bankers and economists. The discussion occurred as economists were more optimistic than they had been for a decade about growth. Mr. Draghi used the occasion to signal that the European Central Bank is edging closer to the day when it will begin paring measures intended to keep interest rates very low and bolster the economy. “All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area,” Mr. Draghi said. His comments pushed the euro to almost its highest level in a year, though it later gave up some of the gains. But along with the optimism is a fear that the economic expansion might bypass large swaths of the population, in part because a growing number of jobs could be replaced by computers capable of learning — artificial intelligence.

"During a speech in Iowa last week, in the middle of his red-meat calls for a border wall and tougher immigration enforcement, President Trump called for something decidedly less sanguinary: “a total rewrite of our immigration system into a merit-based system.” This is one of the few consistent positions the president has held while in office; he called for a similar reform in his State of the Union address, months before. The real surprise, though, is his source of inspiration: Canada. If it seems weird that Mr. Trump would propose Canada as a model for anything, that’s understandable. Americans, especially conservatives, love to mock their northern neighbor: for its accent, its apologetic manners, its food (oh, poutine) — and above all, for its supposedly softheaded, pinko style of government. And no wonder: With its liberal, tattooed prime minister, its universal health care, its enthusiastic embrace of pot and gay marriage and its generous refugee policies, Canada can sometimes seem downright Scandinavian. Yet when it comes to immigration, Canada’s policies are anything but effete. Instead, they’re ruthlessly rational, which is why Canada now claims the world’s most prosperous and successful immigrant population. The numbers tell the tale. Last year, Canada admitted more than 320,000 newcomers — the most on record. Canada boasts one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, about three times higher than the United States. More than 20 percent of Canadians are foreign-born; that’s almost twice the American total, even if you include undocumented migrants. And Ottawa plans to increase the number in the years ahead. Far from producing a backlash, Canadian voters couldn’t be happier about it. Recent polls show that 82 percent think immigration has a positive impact on the economy, and two-thirds see multiculturalism as one of Canada’s key positive features. (They rank it higher than hockey. Hockey!) Support for immigration has actually increased in recent years, despite a slow economy and the specter of terrorism. Today in Canada, the share of people who approve of the way their government handles the issue is twice as high as it is in the United States. "
"For a good laugh, or rather cry, zip backward to the beginning of 2014, when Democrats still had control of the Senate, and listen to Mitch McConnell’s lamentations about the way they were doing business. “Major legislation is now routinely drafted not in committee but in the majority leader’s conference room,” he declaimed on the Senate floor. “Bills should go through committee.” He pledged that if Republicans were “fortunate enough to gain the majority next year, they would.” In a speech a few months later at the American Enterprise Institute, he said, “The greatest way to ensure stability in our laws is to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to participate in some way in the passage.” He railed about the lack of transparency from Democrats and the damage they’d done “to the spirit of comity and respect that the public has every right to expect from their leaders.” “If Republicans were fortunate enough to reclaim the majority in November, I assure you, my friends, all of this would change,” he vowed anew. Republicans were fortunate enough. McConnell became the majority leader. And if you can find committee hearings, transparency, full participation, comity, respect or anything akin to good faith in the way he just tried to ram his health care bill through the chamber, then I want you on the hunt for the yeti and, pretty please, the Fountain of Youth. His approach may prove fatal: On Tuesday, he had to postpone any vote on the legislation until after July 4. "
"The Senate Republicans’ stalled effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not the only profound threat to our health care system. If Gov. Scott Walker gets his wish, Wisconsin will be the first state that requires adults without children to undergo drug testing if they want to receive Medicaid. Other states could follow his plan. This would tie lifesaving health care benefits to government procedures that force people to submit to degrading invasions of privacy. Of all the ways to help Americans with drug problems, threatening their Medicaid eligibility is among the worst options. Much attention has rightly focused on the Senate bill to reduce federal Medicaid spending by as much as $772 billion over the next decade, which would result in 20 million fewer enrollees. But budget cuts are not the only way to weaken Medicaid and limit access to health care. Indeed, President Trump’s insistence on giving “our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid” does just that. While flexibility has at times allowed some states to expand services, others like Arizona, Kentucky and Maine are now attempting to impose conditions, such as time limits or work requirements, that would shrink the program. Because these reforms are more palatable than draconian cuts, they can easily slip beneath the radar and quietly imperil Medicaid’s long-term viability. It may seem like giving states the power to drug test Medicaid recipients is reasonable. Governor Walker’s administration claims that doing so will “help people get healthy so they can get back in the work force.” And drug screening shouldn’t be a problem for people who are abiding by the law, right? Yet the history of public assistance policies shows that measures like Governor Walker’s can catalyze a vicious cycle of stigmatization and program retrenchment. Traditional cash assistance programs lost popularity as they incorporated practices like fingerprinting, surveillance, time limits and work requirements, and as political rhetoric linked the program with racist representations of African-American mothers.

"ROCKET CENTER, W.Va. — A few years ago, Sean Bridges lived with his mother, Linda, in Wiley Ford, W.Va. Their only income was her monthly Social Security disability check. He applied for work at Walmart and Burger King, but they were not hiring. Yet while Mr. Bridges had no work history, he had certain skills. He had built and sold some stripped-down personal computers, and he had studied information technology at a community college. When Mr. Bridges heard IBM was hiring at a nearby operations center in 2013, he applied and demonstrated those skills. Now Mr. Bridges, 25, is a computer security analyst, making $45,000 a year. In a struggling Appalachian economy, that is enough to provide him with his own apartment, a car, spending money — and career ambitions. “I got one big break,” he said. “That’s what I needed.” Mr. Bridges represents a new but promising category in the American labor market: people working in so-called new-collar or middle-skill jobs. As the United States struggles with how to match good jobs to the two-thirds of adults who do not have a four-year college degree, his experience shows how a worker’s skills can be emphasized over traditional hiring filters like college degrees, work history and personal references. And elevating skills over pedigree creates new pathways to employment and tailored training and a gateway to the middle class. This skills-based jobs approach matters at a time when there is a push to improve the circumstances of those left behind in the American economy, many of whom voted for President Trump. “We desperately need to revive a second route to the middle class for people without four-year college degrees, as manufacturing once was,” said Robert Reich, a labor secretary in the Clinton administration who is now a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “We have to move toward a system that works.” "

Then, interrupting his conversation with Mr. Varadkar, Mr. Trump pointed at the journalist, Caitriona Perry, and gestured for her to come to him. “And where are you from?” he said. “Go ahead. Come here, come here. Where are you from? We have all of this beautiful Irish press.” After she introduced herself, Mr. Trump told Mr. Varadkar, “She has a nice smile on her face so I bet she treats you well.” "
"HONG KONG — Having just traveled to New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, China, Taiwan and now Hong Kong, I can say without an ounce of exaggeration that more than a few Asia-Pacific business and political leaders have taken President Trump’s measure and concluded that — far from being a savvy negotiator — he’s a sucker who’s shrinking U.S. influence in this region and helping make China great again. These investors, trade experts and government officials are still stunned by an event that got next to no attention in the U.S. but was an earthquake out here — and a gift that will keep on giving America’s allies pain and China gain for years to come. That was Trump’s decision to tear up the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade deal in his first week in office — clearly without having read it or understanding its vast geo-economic implications. (Trump was so ignorant about TPP that when he was asked about it in a campaign debate in November 2015 he suggested that China was part of it, which it very much is not.) Trump simply threw away the single most valuable tool America had for shaping the geo-economic future of the region our way and for pressuring China to open its markets. Trump is now trying to negotiate trade openings with China alone — as opposed to negotiating with China as the head of a 12-nation TPP trading bloc that was based on U.S. values and interests and that controlled 40 percent of the global economy. It is hard to think of anything more stupid. And China’s trade hard-liners are surely laughing in their sleeves. “When Trump did away with TPP, all your allies’ confidence in the U.S. collapsed,” a senior Hong Kong official told me. "
"Since my story about the clash between teenage climate skeptics and their high school science teacher ran earlier this month, several hundred teachers across the country have responded with their own stories of teaching on climate. After the initial flurry of replies, I wanted to get a handle on a broader range of teacher experiences, so I requested more stories. Climate change, of course, is a politically fraught topic in the United States, where Republican politicians and representatives of the fossil fuel industry have sought to cast doubt on the established science of human-caused global warming. Even most states that have adopted the scientific consensus as part of their education standards — and many have not — so far do not require assessments of whether students understand it. And one recent survey suggests that some science teachers simply skim over the topic. But many of the teachers I heard from, including those in conservative strongholds, described efforts to impart the reality of climate change whether or not it was an official part of the curriculum. Here’s a selection of those stories. Some were condensed for space. Many teachers commiserated with James Sutter, the teacher I profiled, over the resistance he faced from some of his students.  “I just finished the NYT article and wanted to send you a message of solidarity from another enviro teacher,” read one email addressed to him.  “Covering the issue can be a real challenge.” Others offered a gentle critique: “Seemed like he made too much of an argument,’’ wrote another. “Better just to put the information out there.’’ And several  outlined favorite strategies for teaching climate science to skeptics. “We’re an oil town that voted two-to-one for Trump, but when the sea level rises and you live on the coast, you need to be aware that the world is changing and consider what you can do about it. My students learn about climate change by taking a boat ride up a fjord, which until very recently was a glacier. The massive Columbia Glacier has retreated (melted) 12 miles since my first boat trip in 1983. Where recently was land, today is ocean. "
"WASHINGTON — With his bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act in deep trouble, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, raised an alternate possibility on Tuesday: Either Republicans come together, or he would have to work with Democrats to shore up the deteriorating health law. That raised a tantalizing prospect: bipartisanship. The idea is not so far-fetched. For years, Republicans and Democrats have explored avenues for changing or improving President Barack Obama’s health care law, from tweaks to the requirement for employers to offer health insurance to revisions involving how the marketplaces created under the law operate. Mr. McConnell had hoped the Senate would pass the repeal bill this week, but he met resistance from moderate and conservative members of his caucus. He spent much of his time on Wednesday in discussions with Republican senators, seeking agreement on the substance of a revised bill. Republican senators said that Mr. McConnell wanted to finish work on the legislation by Friday, submit it for analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and then press the Senate to take it up after a weeklong break for the Fourth of July. “I think it’s going to be very difficult” for Republicans to reach agreement on a bill this week, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. But, she added, “you never know.” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, was even more skeptical. “Pigs could fly,” he said. Republicans have talked for months about possible ways to repair the Affordable Care Act, although they would clearly prefer the wholesale replacement they have long promised. "
"WASHINGTON — Passengers flying to the United States from foreign airports will undergo more rigorous screening of their baggage and electronic devices, but they will be allowed to bring laptops and tablets onto planes in their carry-on bags, the Department of Homeland Security announced on Wednesday. After months of discussions with aviation officials in Europe about banning large electronic devices, homeland security officials ultimately abandoned the idea in favor of more robust screening measures. In March, the department imposed a limited ban barring passengers traveling through airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries from carrying devices larger than cellphones aboard direct inbound flights. Now, agency officials said, the ban on those airlines will be lifted if they carry out the new security measures. The officials, during a background briefing with reporters, did not elaborate on what the new intensive measures would include other than more bomb-sniffing dogs and new scanning equipment. Officials also said they would seek to expand the preclearance program, where United States customs officers at foreign airports check photo IDs and travel documents before allowing passengers to board planes for the United States. Officials did not give a time frame for airlines to put the new measures in place or when passengers could expect to see the changes, but said airlines would be allowed sufficient time to carry out the measures. “Security is my No. 1 concern,” John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, said Wednesday in announcing the new measures. “Our enemies are adaptive, and we have to be adaptive, too.” The new security directives are expected to affect about 180 airlines in 105 countries, and some 2,000 direct daily flights to the United States, officials said. They will apply to 280 airports where airlines fly directly to the United States. Airlines that fail to put the new security measures into effect could face fines or a total ban on electronic devices, or could even be restricted from flying to the United States, officials said. A senior official with a United States airline said that American carriers have already been using enhanced screening at foreign airports, so passengers were unlikely to see many changes. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, did say that the airlines were concerned about the cost of carrying out the screening measures at smaller foreign airports. The new security screening comes as intelligence shows that the Islamic State is developing a bomb that can be hidden in portable electronics like laptops. Extremist groups have targeted transportation hubs in the past two years, including the bombing of an airliner in Egypt in October 2015, the attempted downing of a plane in Somalia last year and armed attacks on airports in Brussels and Istanbul.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The recently deposed crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Nayef, has been barred from leaving the kingdom and confined to his palace in the coastal city of Jidda, according to four current and former American officials and Saudis close to the royal family. The new restrictions on the man who until last week was next in line to the throne and ran the kingdom’s powerful internal security services sought to limit any potential opposition for the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, 31, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize relationships with Saudi royals. It was unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place. An adviser to the Saudi royal court referred queries to the Information Ministry, whose officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. A senior official in the Saudi Foreign Ministry reached by telephone on Wednesday night described the account as “baseless and false.” The Saudi monarch, King Salman, shook up the line of succession last week with a string of royal decrees that promoted his favorite son, Mohammed bin Salman, to crown prince and removed Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, from the line of succession. The elder prince was also replaced as interior minister by a 33-year-old nephew, marking the end of a career that had won him deep respect in Washington and other foreign capitals for his work dismantling Al Qaeda’s networks inside the kingdom after a string of deadly bombings a decade ago. Supporters of Mohammed bin Salman, often referred to as M.B.S., have lauded his promotion, saying it empowered a young, ambitious prince who has laid out a positive vision for the kingdom’s future.

"The parents of Austin Tice, the journalist and former Marine from Texas who was abducted in Syria in August 2012, said on Wednesday that they had reason to believe that their son was alive. “We wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you if we didn’t — weren’t completely positive that Austin’s going to come home safely,” his father, Marc Tice, told Lester Holt in an interview on “NBC Nightly News.” Debra Tice and her husband, who also spoke with Matt Lauer on “Today” on Wednesday morning, confirmed that the United States government had shared with them why it thought he was alive, but they would not elaborate on the reasons. “We need to keep their confidence, so that we can keep working well together as a team,” Ms. Tice told Mr. Lauer. The Trump administration began searching early this year for ways to free Mr. Tice, even setting up a back channel with Syria. “We are absolutely gratified at the engagement we’ve had with this new administration,” Ms. Tice told Mr. Holt. “How quickly they’ve become aware and engaged and advocating for Austin’s safe return.” The Syrian government insists it does not know what happened to Mr. Tice or where he is. And his parents said that they had seen no proof that he was alive, they told Mr. Holt, aside from a YouTube video that was posted one month after Mr. Tice disappeared. In the video, titled “Austin Tice Still Alive,” he appears blindfolded and disheveled, and is surrounded by masked men with rifles. He utters part of an Arabic prayer and says, “Oh, Jesus.” Last year, in a secret analysis, the American intelligence community said there was a good chance that Mr. Tice was alive. But the momentum to find Mr. Tice stalled in April when the Syrian government carried out a gas attack on its own people, killing dozens. Outrage about American hostages being held by foreign governments was renewed last week after the death of Otto Warmbier, a college student from Ohio who spent more than a year in a North Korean prison before being medically evacuated to the United States. The Tices — who lived in Damascus for a time to search for information about their son — stressed that the effort to bring their son home is a humanitarian one, not a foreign policy issue. “We have to be completely apolitical,” she said. Mr. Tice will turn 36 years old on Aug. 11. “We’re really hoping that we can hand him his birthday cards in person,” his father said. "
"President Trump may not have meant to, but on Wednesday he seemed to endorse a longer reach for the tax collector. In an angry tweet directed at Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, Mr. Trump chastised the e-commerce giant for “not paying internet taxes (which they should).” At the moment, there is no “internet tax,” and it is not clear exactly what the president might have had in mind. (The comment was interpolated in a declaration about “The #AmazonWashingtonPost.” Mr. Bezos owns The Washington Post, which has published articles critical of Mr. Trump; Amazon is a separate company.) The White House did not elaborate. But one possibility is that Mr. Trump was thinking of a proposal to allow state governments to force internet retailers to collect sales taxes from their customers. The bill — called the Marketplace Fairness Act — has been pushed for years by brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart, which have been losing ground as e-commerce has grown. The bill passed the Senate in 2013, 69 to 27, with bipartisan support. It was reintroduced by a similar coalition in April but faces opposition from House Republicans. If Mr. Trump was implying that Amazon had failed to add taxes where they were due, he was mistaken. The company long balked at collecting sales taxes, but by 2012 it was collecting taxes in California, Texas, Pennsylvania and other states. It even joined its former opponents that year in lobbying Congress to pass federal legislation that would compel its online competitors to follow suit. The idea not only is anathema to anti-tax advocates but also would seem to be at odds with Mr. Trump’s own promise that “we are going to be cutting taxes massively both for the middle class and for companies.” White House aides and Republican lawmakers have frequently despaired over the president’s fondness for firing off policy statements on Twitter and other social media platforms. But Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, has said that Mr. Trump will continue to post because “the fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results.” A tax increase may not, however, be the result his administration is looking for.

"At stake is what amounts to a blip in the city budget. But for officials in New York, as in several other cities with large immigrant populations, it is about the principle more than the federal money they stand to lose for their so-called sanctuary city policies. On Wednesday, the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio sent a letter to the Justice Department asserting that the city was cooperating with immigration officials to the extent required under federal law and that the city should not, as the Justice Department has argued, forfeit a $4.3 million federal law enforcement grant. The letter, and others sent from cities like New Orleans and Philadelphia, came amid a burst of activity on immigration in Washington. As the House prepared to vote on Thursday on two bills to crack down on undocumented immigrants who commit crimes, President Trump cheered the legislation for getting the “bad people” out of American cities. New York officials said the city’s pledge to protect hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrant residents did not mean the city was breaking federal law. “Being a sanctuary city does not mean that you are out of compliance or trying to violate federal law in any way,” Nisha Agarwal, the commissioner for immigrant affairs, said in an interview. “We can promote policies and programs that are supportive of immigrant communities and protect public safety.” New York was one of several jurisdictions cited by the Obama administration in 2016 for policies that could interfere with federal law. The jurisdictions, including California and the cities Chicago, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, New Orleans and Philadelphia, had until June 30 to submit letters of compliance. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, the self-styled rebel who wants to sweep out an ancien regime, will travel to Paris on July 14 to commemorate revolutionaries who actually did it — with bloodshed and barricade-storming — 228 years ago in France. The White House announced on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had accepted an invitation from President Emmanuel Macron of France to join him for Bastille Day. He extended the offer in a phone call the day before, when the two leaders discussed Mr. Trump’s latest warning to the Syrian government over its alleged preparation of a chemical weapons attack. Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron are to review a traditional military parade on the Champs-Élysées, which this year will mark the 100th anniversary of the entry of the United States into World War I. American and French troops will march side by side along the avenue. The White House used anodyne language to describe the president’s motives for going to Paris — “reaffirming America’s strong ties of friendship to France,” and “celebrating this important day with the French people” — which failed to even remotely capture the psychological subtext. Ever since their death grip of a handshake in Brussels in May, the personal dynamic between Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron has seemed less like a budding friendship than a polite prizefight — a mixture of bluff and bluster by two alpha males intent on claiming an edge. Mr. Macron told a French newspaper that the prolonged handshake was deliberate — “a moment of truth” intended to show Mr. Trump that he would not “make small concessions, even symbolic ones.” "

he issue of race and racism has been front and center in the United States for a few years now — with the public conversation intensifying ever since a series of high-profile killings of young black men by the police in 2014. But how do race relations play out here in Australia? That question will continue to shape this country. Census data released this week shows that one in two Australians are now either born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas, and that Australia’s Indigenous population has grown as well. Isabella Kwai explored a sliver of this demographic shift in her story today, on a group of young Asian-Australians from Sydney’s western suburbs. This week, we also published our deepest look yet at Indigenous Australia, through the eyes of a New York Times reporter who usually covers race in the United States. John Eligon, who I worked with closely before I came to Australia, spent nearly a month traveling all over Australia and the Torres Strait Islands, visiting a wide variety of Indigenous communities.

"WASHINGTON — Shortly after President Trump won the White House, a cluster of Senate Democrats began the search for common cause with the unlikely new president, scouring the populist policy agenda that dominated his campaign. For their part, Republicans believed that Mr. Trump’s win in nine states where Democratic senators are up for re-election next year would scare those lawmakers into acceptance of a Republican agenda, perhaps even voting to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. Neither has come to pass. Rather than taking advantage of his honeymoon phase to pick an issue on which Democrats from conservative states might be amenable — fixing the nation’s crumbling infrastructure, cutting taxes or stiffening immigration laws — Mr. Trump raced toward the most partisan corner of the room, pushing to repeal the health care law with no input from Democrats, in a manner that has proved deeply unpopular. Democrats, watching Republicans careen around in search of a health care solution, honored the demand of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, that they stick together in their refusal to lift a finger to help until repeal was taken off the table. And perhaps most important, Mr. Trump has rarely bothered to ask. “I am a moderate from a state Trump won,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who is up for re-election next year in a state where Hillary Clinton received just 38 percent of the vote. “You’d think they would have called me sometime.” “I am ready to work with President Trump on things like infrastructure. I happen to agree with him on the water rule,” she added, referring to a regulation that Mr. Trump is seeking to roll back. “These are just lower priorities for them, I guess.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee for general counsel of the Transportation Department, Steven G. Bradbury, is coming under fire by Democrats and human rights advocates for his role in providing legal blessing for waterboarding and other torture techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency on terrorism suspects during the administration of George W. Bush. Amid interruptions by anti-torture protesters at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Democrats grilled Mr. Bradbury about interrogation memos he wrote as head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel during Mr. Bush’s second term. “You lacked the judgment to stand up and say what is morally right when pressured by the president of the United States, and I’m afraid you would do so again,” said Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, who wagged her finger at Mr. Bradbury and accused him of having a dangerous “rubber stamp” mentality. “I cannot oppose this nomination strongly enough.” Mr. Bradbury argued that his job at the Office of Legal Counsel, which is often called O.L.C., was to sort through murky legal issues and that he did not advocate particular policies. He also stressed that the legal landscape was different at the time because Congress had not yet enacted a law requiring intelligence agency interrogators to obey the same rules the military follows. “Every opinion I gave for O.L.C. represented my best judgment of what the laws in effect at that time required,” he said. “I certainly recognize and respect that some of the questions we addressed during my tenure in the office raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree.” Democrats also pressed Mr. Bradbury about his work in private practice representing the now bankrupt Takata Corporation as it grappled with regulators at the Transportation Department over its faulty airbags that killed or injured over 100 people and led to an enormous recall. Mr. Bradbury said he would recuse himself from work involving the airbag recall. "
"Usain Bolt started the European leg of his final season with a victory in the 100 meters at the Golden Spike meet Wednesday in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt reeled in the rest of the field after a trademark slow start to cross the finish line in 10.06 seconds. However, he had to hold off a strong challenge from Yunier Perez of Cuba, edging him by 0.03. Jak Ali Harvey of Turkey was third in 10.26. Bolt, an eight-time Olympic champion, is preparing for the world championships in London in August, his final major competition.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s national security officials declared on Wednesday that a White House warning this week to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had succeeded in stopping a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government. “They didn’t do it,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters as he traveled to Belgium. In an unusual written statement on Monday night, White House officials said the United States had “identified potential preparations” by the Assad government to use chemical weapons in an attack similar to one that was launched in April from an airfield in western Syria. The statement, issued by Mr. Trump’s spokesman, threatened to make Mr. Assad “pay a heavy price” if he used them. By Wednesday morning, Mr. Mattis said it appeared that Mr. Assad “took the warning seriously.” He declined to say whether preparations that were noted in Mr. Trump’s statement had ended. But he repeatedly noted the lack of a chemical weapons attack in the two days since the White House issued its warning. “They didn’t do it,” he repeated twice more. Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, echoed Mr. Mattis, telling lawmakers during a hearing that Mr. Trump’s warning had worked. “I think that by the president calling out Assad, I think by us continuing to remind Iran and Russia that while they choose to back Assad, that this was something we were not going to put up with,” she said. “I would like to think that the president saved many innocent men, women and children.” "
"KIEV, Ukraine — The day started like most for Roman N. Klimenko, an accountant in Kiev who had just settled in at his desk, typing at a computer keyboard and drinking coffee. He was unaware that concealed within his tax preparation software lurked a ticking bomb. That bomb soon exploded, destroying his financial data and quickly spreading through computer systems vital to Ukraine’s government — and beyond. The cyberattack, on Tuesday, was caused by a virus similar to one that wreaked global havoc less than two months ago. Both had the appearance of hacker blackmail assaults known as ransomware attacks: screens of infected computers warn users their data will be destroyed unless ransoms are paid. But in Ukraine’s case, a more sinister motive — paralysis of the country’s vital computer systems — may have been at work, cybersecurity experts said on Wednesday. And many Ukrainians cast their suspicions on Russia. Cybersecurity experts based their reasoning partly on having identified the group of Ukrainian users who were initially and improbably targeted: tax accountants. All are required by law to use a tax preparation software such as that made by a Ukrainian company, M.E.Doc. The software that runs on Microsoft Windows-based computers was recently updated. Microsoft issued a statement on Wednesday saying it “now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate M.E.Doc updater process.” "
"Samsung said it plans to open a factory in South Carolina, as President Trump has tried in recent months to entice manufacturers into creating more industrial jobs in the United States. The Korean conglomerate said on Wednesday that it would hire over 950 people for the $380 million plant, which would make washing machines and other home appliances, in addition to conducting research and development. Samsung plans to open the plant in a former Caterpillar factory in the town of Newberry, about 40 miles northwest of the state capital in Columbia. Samsung joins a growing list of international companies that have said they would aid job creation in the United States, which was a central tenet of Mr. Trump’s election campaign. His statements about renegotiating free-trade agreements and potentially imposing import duties alarmed manufacturers overseas, which were suddenly faced with potentially losing access to the biggest consumer market in the world. In February, South Korean company LG said it would open a similar 600-person factory in Tennessee to make washing machines. Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma, the Japanese tech investor Masayoshi Son and Terry Gou, the head of Foxconn, have also made big public plans to invest in America. While many international companies and business owners have promoted their plans to add jobs in the United States in recent months, a confluence of economic trends has been pushing them to invest in plants in America for years. Tim Brown, a managing director of a supply chain research center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said those factors include rising labor costs in China and demands from some retailers, such as Walmart, for more American-made goods. Pleasing the Trump administration would most likely be a “tiebreaker” after those concerns, Mr. Brown said. “It’s staying on the good side of the administration, keeping stability in global trade by shifting a bit more onshore,” he said. South Carolina has been a major beneficiary of foreign investment. The state is home to factories from overseas companies including Rolls-Royce and BMW, which said on Monday it would add an additional 1,000 jobs to the state. South Carolina’s manufacturing jobs have grown 16 percent to 244,700 positions from June 2009 to May of this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the fifth-fastest growth rate in the country. The state has attracted the investment in part because of its lack of unions and its transportation networks, which include the Port of Charleston. Samsung said in an email that it has been considering opening a home-appliance manufacturing plant in the United States for about three years. The company also operates a call center in South Carolina, where 800 people work in full-time and contract positions. With the investment, Samsung will receive financial incentives from the State of South Carolina tied to job creation. In a statement Wednesday, Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said Samsung “will now be an important partner in ushering in an unprecedented period of economic growth and prosperity in our state.” "
"A young  asylum seeker who was tortured in his native Venezuela no longer faces deportation after an immigration judge in Miami ended removal proceedings against him this week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested the man, Marco Coello, 22, in April when he appeared for his asylum interview and initiated deportation proceedings. The arrest, while legal, was unusual because Mr. Coello seemed to have a strong argument for winning asylum. Now Mr. Coello can proceed with his asylum case after he asked an immigration judge to terminate the deportation proceedings and the Department of Homeland Security, the parent of ICE, did not object, according to a one-page order issued on Monday. “They screwed up royally when they detained him and here’s the proof,” said his lawyer, Elizabeth Blandon. She added that Mr. Coello was “extremely grateful.” A spokesman for ICE in Miami had no immediate comment on the case on Wednesday. Mr. Coello was 18 when he participated in a protest in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, in 2014. The demonstration turned violent and Mr. Coello was detained. Members of the security services beat him with a fire extinguisher and a golf club and tortured him with electric shocks. He was imprisoned but was later released pending trial and fled to the United States. Mr. Coello’s mistreatment was documented by a Human Rights Watch report that year and the next year in a report by the State Department on human rights in Venezuela. With such extensive documentation, and almost certain imprisonment if he was deported back to Venezuela, Mr. Coello expected a relatively easy path to asylum. But since President Trump’s inauguration in January, ICE agents have taken a more active approach to immigration enforcement, arresting more people and in particular, more people without serious criminal convictions. Mr. Coello was working as a driver for the ride-hailing service Lyft last year when he became drowsy and pulled over to sleep in a parking lot. He received a ticket for trespassing by a police officer and later paid a $100 fine and $92 in court costs. A spokesman for ICE said the trespassing violated the terms of Mr. Coello’s stay in the United States, leading to his arrest when he showed up for an asylum interview. Mr. Coello’s case drew extensive news coverage in Florida and back home in Venezuela. To many in South Florida, which has a large community of residents who fled socialist governments in Cuba and Venezuela, ICE appeared to be acting overzealously. A day after Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, intervened in the case, Mr. Coello was released from a Miami-area detention center. With the situation deteriorating at home, more Venezuelans have filed asylum petitions in the United States than any other nationality during the fiscal year, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles asylum cases.

"WASHINGTON — A member of the F.B.I.’s elite Hostage Rescue Team involved in a deadly confrontation last year with a prominent antigovernment protester in Oregon has been indicted on charges of lying and obstruction, according to federal court documents. The indictment of the agent, Joseph Astarita, 40, is a blow to the reputation of the hostage team, which carries out the bureau’s riskiest missions in the United States and abroad. Mr. Astarita was accused of lying to supervisors about firing his weapon in the effort to arrest Robert Finicum, known as LaVoy, who was killed during a standoff at a remote federal wildlife refuge in January 2016. Mr. Finicum led a small band of armed militants who said that the federal land had been improperly taken from area ranchers and demanded that it be returned to local or private control. Mr. Astarita pleaded not guilty to all five counts on Wednesday in Portland, Ore., and was released pending court appearances. An F.B.I. spokesman declined to discuss the case but said Mr. Astarita had been assigned to administrative duty. The case was being investigated by the Justice Department’s inspector general along with federal prosecutors in Oregon. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea issued standing orders on Wednesday for the “miserable dog’s death” execution of South Korea’s imprisoned former president and her spy chief, and improbably demanded that its southern adversary extradite them. The execution orders, which the North said could be carried out anytime, anywhere and by any means, amounted to an assassination decree against the imprisoned former president, Park Geun-hye, and Lee Byung-ho, who was director of the National Intelligence Service under Ms. Park. Conveyed in a statement issued via North Korea’s official news agency, the execution orders came nearly two months after the isolated, nuclear-armed country accused the South Korean intelligence service of conspiring with the C.I.A. to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, using biochemical poisons. “We declare at home and abroad that we will impose death penalty on traitor Park Geun-hye and Mr. Lee,” said the statement from the North’s Ministry of State Security, Ministry of People’s Security and Central Public Prosecutors Office. The statement said the pair’s crime was “hideous state-sponsored terrorism.” Ms. Park and Mr. Lee “can never make any appeal even though they meet a miserable dog’s death anytime, at any place and by whatever methods from this moment,” the statement said. There was no immediate response from Ms. Park, who has been incarcerated since she was forced out on corruption charges in March, or from the National Intelligence Service. But the South Korea spy agency has denied trying to assassinate Mr. Kim. "
"All of the nation’s largest banks passed the latest stress test on Wednesday, the first time all aced the exam since the Federal Reserve began administering the exercise seven years ago. The passing grades show that the American banking system has sufficiently rebuilt its capital levels since the crippling losses of the 2008 financial crisis while also learning how to effectively plan for another financial catastrophe. The test also paves the way for the banks to pay the largest dividends in almost a decade, a boon for shareholders who have suffered years of sagging returns. The banks have the option of returning up to 100 percent of their profits to shareholders, up from 65 percent last year. Such lavish payouts are exactly what investors had been hoping banks would deliver under a Trump presidency. While the administration has no direct role in the stress test, this year is the first that a Republican Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, has overseen the process. Mr. Powell, a former private equity executive, has said he wants to phase out the qualitative aspect of the test for certain banks. The industry has complained that this process is overly subjective.

"As online shopping claims ever more casualties, Staples, a mainstay of office supplies, has agreed to sell itself to a private equity firm. The deal is the latest instance of a once-prominent name in retailing being laid low by the powerful forces reshaping how people shop (in other words: Amazon). Sycamore Partners — a private equity firm that specializes in retailers and already owns the likes of Talbots, the Limited and Hot Topic — said Wednesday that it would  acquire Staples for $6.9 billion, citing its “iconic brand.” Yet Sycamore is acquiring a company that is squarely in decline. Sales and gross profits at Staples have fallen for each of the last four full years. At the same time, the company has been shrinking the number of stores it operates. Staples had sought to remain competitive in the online world by merging with another chain, Office Depot. But that deal was blocked by a federal judge, and the companies abandoned their effort last year. In its most recent annual report, Staples was frank about the challenges it faced. After noting that it competes with wholesalers and local stationery stores, it reached the heart of the matter. "
"WASHINGTON — Stepsiblings and half-siblings are allowed, but not nieces or nephews. Sons- and daughters-in-law are in, but brothers- and sisters-in-law are not. Parents, including in-laws, are considered “close family,” but grandparents are not. The State Department issued new guidelines Wednesday night to American embassies and consulates on applying a limited travel ban against foreign visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries. Enforcement of the guidelines will begin at 8 p.m. Eastern on Thursday. The guidelines followed the Supreme Court’s decision on Monday to allow parts of the Trump administration’s revised travel ban to move forward, while also imposing certain limits, as the court prepares to hear arguments in October on the scope of presidential power over border security and immigration. The court said the ban could not be imposed on anyone who had “a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The meaning of “bona fide relationship” was not precisely explained, and the phrase has created much uncertainty for migrants and others seeking to travel to the United States from the six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — covered by the revised travel ban that President Trump issued in March. (An earlier version of the ban included Iraq.) "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Lies,” by David Leonhardt and Stuart A. Thompson (Op-Chart, Sunday Review, June 25): I greatly appreciate the presentation of President Trump’s lies over these last five months, but I doubt that their publication will deter this president from continuing his mendacious behavior. Simply put, lying works for him: It gets him lots of headlines, and his supporters seem pleased that the mainstream media appears to be quite frustrated. The bigger problem is that printing and broadcasting Mr. Trump’s lies isn’t having much effect on his tens of millions of supporters. They still tell pollsters that Mr. Trump is their voice. If we want to peel away Trump supporters, we have to not just publicize his lies but also demonstrate how the president’s actions threaten or hurt them personally. And, above all, we have to present better policies for all Americans. RIC STEINBERGER
INCLINE VILLAGE, NEV. To the Editor: While we should not become inured to President Trump’s lying, I believe that he doesn’t mean to lie. It seems to me that Mr. Trump perceives any simple follow-up question about, say, a previously stated policy position as a confrontation, and he becomes extremely uncomfortable, if not panicked. His sole mission at that point becomes his extrication from that situation as quickly as possible. The truth doesn’t play a role. We have now reached the point where any “definitive” statement from Mr. Trump is meaningless. To the president, the truth is merely collateral damage. VIC LOSICK, NEW YORK To the Editor: Your comprehensive list failed to cite the president’s most egregious lie, which occurred on Jan. 20, when Donald Trump swore to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” ROBERT WIENER, PARIS To the Editor: As Alex Beam wrote in The International Herald Tribune in 2008, citing a memoir by the presidential adviser Theodore Sorensen: “During the October crisis, Sorensen writes, J.F.K. dispatched former Secretary of State Dean Acheson to show the C.I.A.’s surveillance photos of the Cuban missiles to French President Charles de Gaulle. I don’t need to see pictures of the weapons of mass destruction, de Gaulle replied: ‘The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me.’ ” Alas. DAVID ROSMARIN

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s Twitter outburst on Thursday — a highly personal attack on MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski — reignited the controversy over his crass comments about women that nearly immolated his candidacy last year, and it imperiled his legislative agenda by drawing condemnation from women he needs to enact it. Mr. Trump described Ms. Brzezinski, the co-host of “Morning Joe,” as “low I.Q. Crazy Mika” and claimed she was “bleeding badly from a face-lift” during a social gathering at the president’s resort in Florida in the weeks after last year’s election. Mr. Trump’s invective threatened to further erode his support from women and independents, both among voters and on Capitol Hill, where he is in need of negotiating leverage for the stalled Senate health care bill. “This has to stop,” Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who is a crucial vote on the legislation, posted in a Twitter message. She added, “We don’t have to get along, but we must show respect and civility.” Ms. Collins is one of three female swing voters who expressed their distaste for the “Access Hollywood” tape released during the campaign showing Mr. Trump making lewd comments about women with whom he hoped to have an affair.

SCHENECTADY, N.Y. To the Editor: President Trump on Tuesday interrupted a phone discussion with Ireland’s prime minister to remark on the lovely smile of a female Irish reporter waiting in the Oval Office to interview him (nytimes.com, June 28). I strongly believe that a female head of state in a similar situation would not have paused in mid-phone call to comment on the appearance of a fine-looking male journalist. For Mr. Trump, female attractiveness always supersedes ability and professional accomplishment. For him, women will always be judged primarily by their appearance. HILARY EINSOHN, BRONX "
"BERLIN — A combative Chancellor Angela Merkel set herself on a collision course with President Trump and his “America first” agenda on Thursday, predicting “very difficult” talks over climate change and trade when she hosts a summit meeting of 20 global leaders next week. Speaking before Parliament on a day when she also gathered European Union leaders in Berlin to form a common front, the German leader made no bones about the “obvious” disagreement with the United States. “Whoever believes the problems of this world can be solved by isolationism and protectionism is making a tremendous error,” Ms. Merkel said, in what will most likely be her final address before Parliament before closing out her third term in office. In the midst of an election campaign, the chancellor has been criticized by her main opponent for not standing up more forcefully to the American president. Her tough tone to some degree served as domestic political posturing, intended to enhance her appeal as a global leader uniquely qualified to guide Germany after more than 11 years in office. But there was also little doubt that Ms. Merkel was trying to gird Germans and her European Union partners for a more conflictual relationship with the United States, which she said could no longer be counted on as a “reliable” ally after Mr. Trump’s visit to Europe in May. Those divisions are likely to be full display during the Group of 20 summit meeting that begins July 7 in the German city of Hamburg, where Ms. Merkel will welcome not only Mr. Trump but also President Vladimir V.

Putin of Russia, the White House national security adviser said on Thursday, announcing highly anticipated talks amid escalating tensions over Moscow’s interference in the 2016 election and a series of inquiries into whether Mr. Trump’s associates colluded with Russia. The White House would not say whether Mr. Trump plans to press Mr. Putin on the issue of Russia’s meddling in last year’s election — a topic the president has avoided talking about despite deep concern inside his own administration and on Capitol Hill. The meeting, the first between the two since Mr. Trump took office, will occur on the sidelines of the Group of 20 economic summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, providing a dramatic focal point for Mr. Trump’s second international trip as he faces deep skepticism on the world stage. “There’s no specific agenda — it’s really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about,” said Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the president’s national security adviser. The encounter could have broad implications for American foreign policy. But it is also fraught with political overtones for Mr. Trump, who is under scrutiny about his willingness to be tough on Moscow after a campaign in which he praised Mr. Putin effusively and exhorted Russia — in what his aides now call a joke — to hack into Hillary Clinton’s email.

"At backyard barbecues this holiday weekend, liberals will gab with one another about how much time they’re spending on politics. More than ever, they are watching cable news, and refreshing Twitter and Facebook feeds. Many kept up with the recent special House elections. Some skipped work to watch the spectacle of James Comey’s Senate hearing. Others have been using a new technology called Resistbot to send text messages that are transformed into letters faxed to a representative’s or senator’s office. Yet, for all this activism, they have a sinking feeling that maybe they’re just spinning their wheels. Americans who live in relative comfort are emotionally invested in politics, especially after the election, but in a degraded form of politics that caters to the voyeurism of news junkies and the short attention spans of slacktivists. They are engaging in a phenomenon I call “political hobbyism.” They desperately want to do something, but not something that is boring, demanding or slow. Political hobbyists want easy ways to register their feelings. Democrats in particular embrace tools like Resistbot that offer instantly gratifying participation. Beyond the current political climate, Democrats, more than Republicans, believe in mass participation as a core value and also believe it empowers their side. But cheap participation reflects a troubling infirmity in how partisans of both parties engage in politics. In fact, it is not because of gerrymandering, Citizens United, cable news or any of the other common scapegoats that our system is broken, but because of us: ordinary people who are doing politics the wrong way. For years, political scientists have studied how people vote, petition, donate, protest, align with parties and take in the news, and have asked what motivates these actions. The typical answers are civic duty and self-interest. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on a Chinese bank, a Chinese company and two Chinese citizens in an effort to crack down on North Korea’s financing and development of weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions follow the death of Otto F. Warmbier, an American student who was imprisoned by North Korea, and come as frustration grows in the United States government over the North’s missile tests. The most significant action is directed at the Bank of Dandong, a Chinese lender that Treasury officials say acts as a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity and money laundering. The department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is moving to sever the bank from the American financial system, which would severely limit its ability to work with other banks around the world. “We will follow the money and cut off the money,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Thursday during a briefing at the White House. Michael S. Casey, an American sanctions expert at the law firm Ropes & Gray, said, “This is a severe penalty in light of the central role that the U.S. financial system plays in the world’s economy.” Mr. Mnuchin would not say if the United States had warned China about the sanctions, but he said they were not meant as any sort of message to the Chinese government. "
"WASHINGTON — Projected Medicaid spending under a Senate Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be 35 percent lower after two decades, the Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday in a new report, which detailed how Medicaid changes would cut more deeply as they go fully into force. The budget office analysis created a fresh challenge for Republican leaders as they tried to muster support for their bill, even as senators scattered to their home states for a 10-day July 4 recess. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, entertained a stream of senators on Thursday, trying to reach agreement on the contents of a revised bill. But by the end of Thursday, Mr. McConnell’s caucus still appeared far from a consensus, and it was unclear when a new version of the bill would be ready. The nonpartisan budget office had already said that the bill would cut projected Medicaid spending 26 percent in 2026. “A large gap would grow between Medicaid spending under current law and under this bill,” the new report said, and that gap would widen, so that federal Medicaid spending in 2036 would be more than a third lower under the bill than under the Affordable Care Act. “That is going to cause a lot of harm, and that’s one of my biggest concerns about the bill,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a crucial holdout on the bill, told CNN after the release. For Republican leaders who say Medicaid spending is unsustainable, the findings might be seen as evidence that their policies would work. They want to put annual caps on Medicaid spending and roll back the expansion of the program, which has extended coverage to millions of people in 31 states. "
"A couple of weeks ago, I was honored to be invited to present my thoughts on the state of manufacturing in America to the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, headed by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. The thrust of my message was that, regrettably, we should be leery of proclamations of a renaissance of “Made in America.” Job growth in the industrial sector continues to be anemic and at least equally important, wage improvements have been marginal. Below are nine charts that I presented to illustrate the situation. I closed with a list of suggestions — no magic bullets — for how to maximize the performance of our manufacturing sector. For the charts whose takeaway is not self-evident, I’ve provided some brief commentary. In my opinion, the crux of the problem is that we are competing in large part against countries — notably Mexico and China — that have gotten better at making things at a much lower labor cost. Even highly technical products — like airplanes — are beginning to be assembled in these countries. "
"Absent a victory on health care, President Trump has looked to the southern border to highlight recent accomplishments, talking tough about expelling gang members with Salvadoran roots and tweeting about a trade deal with Mexico. Here’s an assessment. Publicly available evidence does not support Mr. Trump’s claim on Wednesday that “we’re pretty much at the 50 percent mark” in getting rid of Mara Salvatrucha, the violent gang known as MS-13, within the first five months of his administration. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for clarification. Previously, the White House has pointed The Washington Post to the arrests of around 7,000 MS-13 members since the inception of Operation Community Shield, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement initiative targeting gangs. But Mr. Trump cannot reasonably take credit for this number, because the initiative began in 2005. ICE officials testified before Congress last week that the agency had made 602 criminal arrests of MS-13 members, resulting in 153 convictions, and 170 immigration arrests from October 1, 2015, to June 4, 2017. Most of that period also predates Mr. Trump’s presidency, and it is unclear how many of those people are United States citizens, who cannot be deported. Yet even assuming that all 772 members were deported or otherwise counted as removed during the Trump administration, they still would not amount to half of the gang. A Justice Department estimate in April puts the gang’s membership at about 10,000 in at least 40 states and the District of Columbia. Over all, ICE removed almost 38,000 people in the first two full months of Mr. Trump’s presidency, about the same as the number removed in February and March 2016. Of the 240,000 people removed in all of the last fiscal year, about 2,000 were suspected or confirmed gang members, according to ICE. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved aggressively on Thursday to fulfill one of the president’s most contentious campaign promises, banning entry into the United States by refugees from around the world and prohibiting most visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries. Freed by the Supreme Court to partly revive President Trump’s travel ban, administration officials said the American border would be shut to those groups unless specific individuals can prove they have close family members living in the United States, or are coming to attend a university or accept a job offer. Officials said those exceptions would be defined narrowly. In a lengthy cable sent to embassies and consulates around the world, officials said that extended family connections would not be enough to evade the president’s ban on entry. Parents, including in-laws, are considered “close family,” but grandparents are not, for instance. Stepsiblings and half-siblings will be allowed, but not nieces or nephews. Late Thursday, the Trump administration added people who are engaged to be married — who originally were not considered to be close family members — to the list of sufficient connections. Critics immediately denounced the administration, accusing the White House of violating the Supreme Court’s directive to exempt anyone with a “bona fide” family connection to the United States. Civil rights groups vowed to challenge what they said was a renewed attempt by Mr. Trump to keep Muslims out of the country. “It remains clear that President Trump’s purpose is to disparage and condemn Muslims,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the A.C.L.U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, adding that the government’s new ban on entry “does not comport with the Supreme Court’s order, is arbitrary and is not tied to any legitimate government purpose.” "
"Officials governing a large area of northern China say their region is suffering from the worst drought on record, leading to crops wilting and farmers and herders growing desperate to get water to farmlands, grasslands, animals and their households. The drought is affecting the northeastern and eastern areas of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, which is near Beijing. In recent years, Chinese scientists have attributed extreme weather patterns in China, and especially in northern China, to climate change. The region of Inner Mongolia and its residents have been hit especially hard by wide fluctuations in the weather. President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders say climate change is an urgent problem that nations must address together, and they have insisted that countries abide by the Paris climate accord, despite President Trump’s announcement this month that the United States would withdraw from the agreement. The United States is historically the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, while China is currently the largest one. In Inner Mongolia, official statistics from the vast municipal area of Hulunbuir, also known as Hulunbei’er, indicate that the economic loss from the recent drought has been 5.3 billion renminbi, or $780 million.

"Once again, President Trump has triggered a predictable wave of outrage, this time over his insulting tweets about the television host Mika Brzezinski’s bleeding face-lift. We know who he alienates by this behavior — and that includes many mainstream Republicans as well as Democrats. But who is the audience he is playing to? And what are the implications when the president flouts what used to be seen as taboos? Mr. Trump and his die-hard followers delight in the shock value of violating social and political norms. They revel in the thumb in the eye. It’s intrinsic to the president’s appeal to his base, and it’s increasingly clear that either deliberately or impulsively, both his conduct and his policies are aimed at that base and not beyond it. The president is an equal-opportunity insulter, but let’s just focus on his posture toward women — and the ecstatic response this evokes in some quarters. This was the week in which Mr. Trump called an Irish reporter to his desk while talking to her prime minister about her smile — only the latest of a stream of pronouncements about women’s appearance. His jab at Ms. Brzezinski echoed his comment that another television anchor, Megyn Kelly, had been bleeding from her wherever, that evocation of menstruation, so unclean, so embarrassing, so primal. There is something about his swagger, his unabashed embodiment of a time when women were eye candy and arm candy. And there is something about the way he strikes back at women who anger him that seems to resonate for some men — and which, at least so far, has not cost him the support of the women who backed him. The uncomfortable larger question is whether this president’s behavior is encouraging and unmasking resentments about women’s place in society. The women’s movement spent decades attempting to change attitudes among Americans so that tweets like Mr. Trump’s would be out of bounds. Even a year ago, the conventional wisdom was that comments like Mr. Trump’s taped boasts about forcing himself on women were political suicide. That no longer appears to be true. And the fear is that much as President Barack Obama’s election seemed to ignite resentments about race that most people had been shy about expressing publicly, Mr. Trump’s election may be unleashing latent anger toward women. Theda Skocpol, professor of government and sociology at Harvard, has been visiting eight counties around the country as part of her research to monitor developments in the Trump presidency. “There’s one example after another as if some button had been pushed and people were openly saying to each other the tensions you’ve been feeling about gender changes over the last 40 years — it’s just fine to uncork all those ambivalent and angry feelings,” she said of national trends overall. "
"WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday voted to crack down on undocumented immigrants and localities that shelter them, approving two bills President Trump has championed but that are certain to meet resistance in the Senate. The legislation from the Republican-controlled House would increase prison sentences for those re-entering the country illegally and pressure so-called sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration officials, including through cutting federal funds. While the measures gave the president a modest, if predictable, win, they would need Democratic support to clear the Senate’s 60-vote threshold, an unlikely prospect. As Senate Republicans worked on the other side of the Capitol to salvage their health care bill and notch their first major legislative victory of Mr. Trump’s presidency, House Republicans trumpeted the immigration-related bills as common-sense measures to bolster public safety. John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, made an unusual appearance at the Capitol to praise the bills. He criticized sanctuary cities — a broad term for localities that limit how local law enforcement officials cooperate with federal immigration officials — by saying they prioritize “criminals over public and law enforcement officer safety.” “It is beyond my comprehension why federal, state and local officials sworn to enforce the laws of the nation, as I am, would actively discourage or outright prevent law enforcement agencies from upholding the laws of the United States,” Mr. Kelly told reporters. "
"WASHINGTON — The State Department approved on Thursday selling more than $1 billion in arms to Taiwan in yet another sign that the Trump administration is embracing a far more confrontational approach with China. Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, underscored that the military sales have no effect on the United States’ “One China” policy, which President Trump suggested in December may be under review. Mr. Trump later affirmed to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would honor the decades-old policy, under which the United States recognized a single Chinese government in Beijing and severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The arms sale is the most tangible sign yet that Mr. Trump’s honeymoon with Mr. Xi is over. The American president had set aside tough moves on trade and regional issues in an informal quid pro quo for Mr. Xi’s commitment to further pressure North Korea. But Mr. Trump acknowledged last week that China had fallen short in its measures toward North Korea, and officials have said he would be less constrained in other parts of the relationship, including Taiwan. To that end, the administration also announced sanctions Thursday on a Chinese bank that has business dealings with North Korea. The announcements came hours before Mr. Trump was set to host a dinner for South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, a progressive who is more open than his predecessor to diplomatic engagement with the North.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Lawyers and activists fanned out to U.S. airports as President Trump’s travel ban went into effect. The State Department issued new guidelines on how to enforce the “close family” test on visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries. We obtained a diplomatic cable that lays them out: Parents, spouses, children, in-laws and stepchildren qualify as “close family.” But grandparents, aunts and uncles do not. Here are the details. The Supreme Court will hear arguments about the ban in October. Above, Reagan National Airport, in Virginia. _____ "
"WASHINGTON — Congress has until mid-October to raise the statutory borrowing limit or the United States will risk defaulting on its debt obligations, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report on Thursday. The hard deadline comes as lawmakers have been under pressure from Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, to lift the debt ceiling before leaving Washington for the August recess. Republicans have been wrestling among themselves over whether to have a “clean” increase or to attach other policy priorities or spending cuts to legislation that lifts the limit. The Treasury has been using “extraordinary measures” since this spring to avoid breaching the debt ceiling, and Mr. Mnuchin has said that his ability to do so was expiring sooner than anticipated because tax revenues have been trickling in slowly. Weaker than expected tax collection — which could be related to expectations by taxpayers of tax cuts later this year — have also resulted in a larger than expected budget deficit this year and a bigger shortfall compared with 2016. The updated numbers follow dire projections released by the C.B.O. at the start of the year. Those showed the United States adding $10 trillion to the federal debt over the next 10 years, thanks to a swelling federal budget deficit. Expectations of rising interest rates could make it even harder to chip away at the debt. The figures present a challenge to Republicans as they work to move an ambitious legislative agenda: agree upon a budget, overhaul the tax code and fund the rebuilding of the nation’s crumbling infrastructure this year.

"My children are Canadian. They are also American and British, though they do not necessarily identify in that order. Once, British might have come first; later, American. But now the Canadian part is on the rise. Not because it’s Canada’s 150th birthday on Saturday, or because of anything specific we (my husband, David, and I) did, but because for them, the geopolitical has become personal. Whither the world, so, too, our household. Now adorned with poutine shack T-shirts, Gretzky jersey numbers and canoe paddles. Until they were 8, 5 and 3, we lived in London. For the last nine years, we have lived in Brooklyn. And for as long as the children can remember, they have spent one to three months every year in Ontario. My husband and I always believed that their having three passports was a gift, one that David (who is Canadian, with Scottish ancestry) and I (American) were lucky to give. (British citizenship came because by the time they were born, we had permanent leave to remain in the country.) They were born into the blessings of bilateralism. When they were little, we plotted ways to create ties for them to their various countries of origin. We wanted them to feel equally invested and at home in all three. Still, the Olympic Games were always a bone of contention in our house. Ditto the Stanley Cup. Someone was usually upset about the team someone else was rooting for. (Oftentimes it was the New York Rangers who were the issue.) In fact, one of the reasons we moved from London back to the United States in 2008 was because my husband became increasingly irritated by our elder daughter cheering for the British rowers and the American swimmers. It seemed to suggest she had absorbed the Canadians’ mythic inferiority complex, the one in which they define themselves by what they are not, and are generally ignored to go about their healthy business.

"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff will depart the White House in the coming weeks and will be replaced by a long-serving aide, in the first major staff change of his office, officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, Josh Pitcock, will be replaced by Nick Ayers, a veteran political operative from Georgia who has been working with the vice president for three years. Mr. Ayers was the chief political strategist for Mr. Pence, then the governor of Indiana, when President Trump chose the governor as his running mate. Until Thursday morning, Mr. Ayers had been seen as a potential contender for governor of Georgia in a crowded field. He had been urged to think about running by some of Mr. Trump’s allies, according to The Atlanta Journal Constitution. More recently, Mr. Ayers has been one of the leaders of an outside group supporting the White House, America First Policies, which had been preparing a series of ads criticizing Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, for his anticipated no vote on the Senate’s bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Mr. Pence, whose portfolio in the Trump White House is still developing, has told allies he would like to return to a system similar to what was in place during the campaign, when Mr. Ayers not only helped to keep Mr. Pence focused on bigger-picture themes as his strategist but also managed staff-related issues. Mr. Pitcock’s departure, scheduled for August, is voluntary. He has worked for Mr. Pence for 12 years, including running the Indiana governor’s Washington office. Mr. Pence had asked Mr. Pitcock to stay on through the transition and then for the first months in the White House, but he had not planned on staying beyond the summer, people close to Mr. Pitcock said. Mr. Ayers worked closely with Mr. Trump’s top aides during the presidential transition and has a good relationship with members of the president’s family and a number of senior presidential advisers. Mr. Ayers is also known as an aggressive fighter on behalf of his bosses, a quality that could serve the vice president well over coming months. Since the inauguration, Mr. Pence has found himself mired in West Wing controversies, often of other people’s making. That included the dismissal of Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who was fired for not being forthcoming with Mr. Pence about private discussions with the Russian ambassador to Washington. Mr. Ayers also was the executive director of the Republican Governors Association for four years, including 2010, a year when the party picked up several statehouse seats. He has also worked on outside efforts supporting Republican conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. "

"Long before there was millennial pink there was rose carthame, a chemical but warm paint hue favored by Katharine Sturges Dodge, mother of the artist Hilary Knight, and an artist herself. “She used it in cheeks, especially,” Mr. Knight said the other afternoon. “Think pink!” his most famous collaborator, Kay Thompson, belted in the 1957 movie “Funny Face.” And because of the blockbuster success of their fictional and widely franchised character Eloise, the 6-year-old girl who first appeared in “Eloise: A Book for Precocious Grown-Ups” in 1955 and has been running amok at (and raking it in for) the Plaza Hotel ever since, one might believe Mr. Knight not only thinks but bleeds pink ink. But as two new exhibitions reveal, he is a many-shaded man, a chameleon, a “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” — apparently one of the few musical stage shows for which he has not designed a poster. Dozens of these (advertising, among others, Angela Lansbury in “Gypsy,” Eartha Kitt in “Timbuktu!” and Twiggy in “My One and Only”) adorn a lower floor at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, where Mr. Knight had arrived, dapper in pinstripes at 90, to give a tour of “Hilary Knight’s Stage Struck World,” devoted to his many eclectic creations and muses and curated by David Leopold with considerable input from the subject. “You know, the walls were like this and I said we cannot have that,” Mr. Knight said, waving dismissively at a shelving area. “Perforated orange wood!” Filled with enough plastic baubles, china, dioramas, feathers and fabric swatches to send the Etsy crowd into ecstasy, the bi-level exhibition complements “Eloise at the Museum,” which opens on Friday at the New-York Historical Society. Both supply a thoughtful counternarrative to the teas, ballets and craft sessions unspooling in somewhat saccharine perpetuity at the Plaza. "
"When President Trump talked tough about China’s economic impact on America during the campaign, he criticized its trade policies and its approach to its currency. Yet one of the first pieces of legislation under the Trump administration that could have a major impact on the economic relationship between the two countries centers on something different: Chinese deal making in the United States. White House officials and a group of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are pushing for new laws intended in part to keep closer tabs on the surge of Chinese money into America. Some in Washington say that money could help China expand its technological and military abilities. While any legislation would face congressional debate and review, a large number of Trump administration employees who deal with both trade and national security have said they support some sort of overhaul of how the United States vets such deals. The push would expand the powers of a little-known but important panel — the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius — that can effectively block foreign deals for American companies on national security grounds. In particular, it could reshape the ways American technology companies, big and small, raise money from Chinese investors. “We’ll try to enable Cfius to take a tougher line against certain investments emanating from those nations that pose a clear threat to our national security, focused particularly in the area of advanced technology,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who said last week that he would propose the legislation. The Trump administration has not staked out a formal stance, but trade experts are watching how the committee treats a pair of pending deals as a test of the political winds. The first is a $1.2 billion bid by Ant Financial — the electronic payments affiliate of the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant — for a remittances company based in Dallas called MoneyGram. The second is a $1.3 billion offer by a China-backed buyout fund for Lattice Semiconductor, which makes a range of advanced communications and telecommunication chips. "

"Donald Trump has a thing about Barack Obama. Trump is obsessed with Obama. Obama haunts Trump’s dreams. One of Trump’s primary motivators is the absolute erasure of Obama — were it possible — not only from the political landscape but also from the history books. Trump is president because of Obama, or more precisely, because of his hostility to Obama. Trump came onto the political scene by attacking Obama. Trump has questioned not only Obama’s birthplace but also his academic and literary pedigree. He was head cheerleader of the racial “birther” lie and also cast doubt on whether Obama attended the schools he attended or even whether he wrote his acclaimed books. Trump has lied often about Obama: saying his inauguration crowd size exceeded Obama’s, saying that Obama tapped his phones and, just this week, saying that Obama colluded with the Russians. It’s like a 71-year-old male version of Jan from what I would call the Bratty Bunch: Obama, Obama, Obama. "
"Members of Congress are paid $174,000 a year, while members of Poland’s lower house of Parliament are paid $32,300 a year. Hmm. It looks as if we’re getting ripped off. Members of Congress seem to underperform compared to members of Parliament in Poland and across the democratic world. Conservatives are right to worry that feeding at the government trough breeds dependency and laziness. So I suggest we introduce pay for performance, using metrics like, say, health. I cite Poland because so many Poles (including the Krzysztofowicz family, later renamed Kristof) came to America for a better life, yet today American babies are one-third more likely to die in their first year of life than Polish children are (and twice as likely as Italian, Portuguese and Czech babies!). Meanwhile, American women are four times as likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth as Polish women, according to the World Health Organization. If we had Italy’s child mortality rate, we would save 12,000 American babies’ lives each year — that’s 33 children’s lives saved every day. Meanwhile, the U.S. spends far more on health care — an average of nearly $10,000 per person — than other countries do. Poland spends just $1,680 per person. "
"Of those from whom little is expected, much is forgiven. And of those from whom much is expected, little is forgiven. Such are the standards by which Donald Trump’s deliberate assaults on the news media need to be understood and feared. I write this following Trump’s latest tirades against the Fourth Estate, including an early morning tweet on Tuesday denouncing “Fake News CNN” for having been “caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories.” That was followed 17 minutes later by a larger eruption, in which the president named NBC, CBS, ABC, The Washington Post and this newspaper as “all Fake News!” And in case the message didn’t penetrate, the deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, denounced the “constant barrage of fake news” from CNN and touted a video in which conservative provocateur James O’Keefe secretly filmed a CNN producer (responsible for health stories), suggesting that the network’s Russia coverage was ratings-driven. “Whether it’s accurate or not, I don’t know,” Ms. Sanders added about the video, lest there be any doubt about the White House’s standards for accuracy. CNN’s sin is to have published a story, based on anonymous sourcing, which alleged that New York financier and Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci had ties to a Russian investment fund supposedly under investigation by the Senate. The story failed to undergo CNN’s usual vetting procedures and was later retracted. For good measure, the three journalists behind the story resigned and the network apologized to Scaramucci, who was gracious in accepting it. "

Now, he’s stuck in a cabinet department so obscure Perry couldn’t think of its name during the famous “oops” presidential debate. The Trump administration is really into Weeks.

But he did remember to push the new slogan, promising to usher in “a golden age of American energy dominance.” Remember the good old days when all we wanted was energy independence?

"WASHINGTON — The Islamic State has carried out nearly 1,500 attacks in 16 cities across Iraq and Syria after they were declared freed from the militants’ control in recent months, providing new evidence that the group is reverting to its insurgent roots and foreshadowing long-term security threats. The information was compiled by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point in a study made public on Thursday that warns that any military gains will fall short without increased efforts to restore the security, governance and economies in territory once held by the Islamic State. “Pushing the Islamic State out as the formal governing party in a territory is not a sufficient development when it comes to ending the group’s ability to enact violence against individuals in Iraq and Syria,” the 20-page report said. American diplomatic and military leaders say an even greater challenge than ousting the Islamic State, or ISIS, from its self-declared religious state, or caliphate, in eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq may well be the daunting political and economic reconstruction in the years ahead. Counterterrorism specialists said the new study illuminates a trend that has been emerging for several months, as American-backed ground forces in Iraq and Syria have steadily rolled back territorial gains the Islamic State achieved in 2014 and used as the basis for its global appeal to Muslims to come join the caliphate. Now, its strongholds of Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, its self-declared capital, are besieged, and senior leaders have fled as opposing forces close in. “ISIS has anticipated the loss of its government for over a year,” said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of “The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State.” “They are prepared to wage a war from the shadows to reclaim it.” "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Samantha Bee attacked Republican senators’ embattled health care bill on “Full Frontal” on Wednesday, and she didn’t pull punches. She was especially irked by the secrecy and exclusiveness surrounding the bill, which was written behind closed doors by a group of white male senators. She compared it with Hollywood’s diversity issues. Ms. Bee said the bill applied an old Republican economic strategy to health care. After a brief detour on Tuesday poking fun at CNN, Stephen Colbert returned to aiming barbs at President Trump. Mr. Trump reacted to a Washington Post report in which a Republican senator said the president did not seem to understand the health care bill — and Mr. Colbert wasn’t very persuaded by Mr. Trump’s response.

"More than a third of Americans believe that Medicaid is akin to welfare, with the implicit subtext that racial and ethnic minorities are the principal beneficiaries. If that’s what they think, they’re dead wrong. Many more Medicaid recipients are white than black or Hispanic. Mick Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina who is now the director of the Office of Management and Budget, promulgates the conservative view. Writing on May 22 for his home state paper, the Charleston Post and Courier, in an opinion piece that fiercely defended the Trump administration’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2018, Mulvaney argued: After laying down this classic Republican framework, Mulvaney puts his own spin on it: In other words, recipients of Medicaid and other federal programs that the Trump administration proposes to cut are thieves, and Mulvaney, with the president’s backing, is determined to end this criminal activity: Mulvaney has little understanding of or respect for social insurance — certainly as it is defined by Merriam-Webster: So who actually gets Medicaid? A plurality, 41 percent, of Medicaid recipients, are white; 22 percent are black; 25 percent are Hispanic; and 12 percent are other ethnicities, including Asian-American. In 18 states, at least 60 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are white: ranging from 98 percent in Idaho and 93 percent in West Virginia to 60 percent in Minnesota and Nebraska. In Kentucky, which is represented by Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, Medicaid covers a third of the population. Seventy-eight percent of Kentuckians on Medicaid are white. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Fears over N.S.A.’s arsenal. After two major cyberattacks recently used tools stolen from the National Security Agency, there are growing concerns that U.S. intelligence agencies have rushed to create digital weapons that they cannot keep safe. On Wednesday, cybersecurity experts were puzzled by the hackers’ motive, which may not have been financial. Tax accountants in Ukraine appear to have been the initial targets. • Travel ban rules are set. Stepsiblings and half-siblings are allowed, but not nieces or nephews. Parents are considered “close family,” but grandparents are not. The State Department issued guidelines today to apply a limited travel ban for citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries. Enforcement begins at 8 p.m. Eastern. "
"The largest banks in the United States have passed the latest stress test — the first time this has happened since the Federal Reserve began the exercise seven years ago. And the shareholders who have put up with years of sagging returns finally look set to get their rewards as the banks prepare to pay out the largest dividends in almost 10 years. They can return up to 100 percent of their profits to shareholders. Here’s what some of the top banks are planning: • Bank of America will buy back up to $12 billion of stock and raise its quarterly dividends 60 percent, to 12 cents a share. • Citigroup will double its dividend, to 32 cents a share, and buy back up to $15.6 billion of shares. • JPMorgan Chase will buy back up to $19.4 billion of stock and raise its dividend 12 percent, to 56 cents a share. • Morgan Stanley will buy back up to $5 billion of shares and raise its dividend 25 percent, to 25 cents a share. • Goldman Sachs … is keeping its cards close to its chest. The billions of dollars of shareholder returns are what investors had hoped banks would deliver under a Trump presidency. "
"Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid said on Thursday that they had called off their long-planned merger after antitrust authorities indicated they were not likely to approve the combination of two of the nation’s biggest drugstore chains. Instead, Rite Aid will sell 2,186 stores, out of a total of 4,600, and three distribution centers to Walgreens for $5.18 billion, ending nearly two years of negotiations between the chains. “While we’re disappointed that we cannot complete the proposed merger with WBA, we believe that this asset sale is an important strategic transformation for Rite Aid,” John T. Standley, Rite Aid’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts, using the ticker symbol for Walgreens. Shares of Rite Aid tumbled as much as 30 percent on Thursday — its steepest plunge since December 2007 — and closed down more than 26 percent. The end of Walgreens’ bid to buy Rite Aid outright, and its replacement with a smaller transaction, highlight how regulators remain concerned — even under an administration that has pledged lighter regulation of business — about mergers creating dominant players in some sectors. Though some dealmakers have hoped that antitrust regulation would ease under President Trump, regulators have not adopted radically looser approaches to examining mergers, according to Norman Armstrong Jr., a partner at the law firm King & Spalding who specializes in antitrust.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Our list of President Trump’s lies continues to generate reader interest and feedback. My colleague Stuart Thompson and I appreciate that interest and wanted to ask your advice for extending the project. We also wanted to ask whether you think our list — which we billed as definitive — missed any of the president’s untruths since taking office. Our standard is a demonstrably false statement. If you think we missed any, please send an email to leonhardt@nytimes.com with the statement, the date and documentation of its falseness. As for the project’s next stage: Some of the president’s defenders have argued on social media that his penchant for lying is no different than other recent presidents. We are skeptical of that notion, but we’re also open to evidence. So if you can recall falsehoods that Presidents Barack Obama or George W. Bush told, send us an email with them. Documentation is ideal, but not necessary. (No need to email us about Obama telling people they could keep their health insurance or Bush claiming that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; we’re aware of those claims.) Finally, we welcome any broader advice from readers. If we update the Trump project in coming months, should we change it in any way? For example, would it be useful if we included a link for each statement, allowing readers to see documentation of its falseness? If you’re interested in more details on the project, Stuart discussed it with Lawrence O’Donnell on MSNBC, and I talked about it on Jacob Weisberg’s podcast, Trumpcast. We also enjoyed the verdict of the world’s leading expert on fantasy. Don’t miss this delightful tweet, either. "
"BEIJING — The Chinese authorities have refused permission for Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace laureate paroled from prison for cancer treatment, to go abroad for care, one of his lawyers said on Thursday. The authorities did not explain the rejection, according to the lawyer, Shang Baojun. The news undermined hopes among supporters of Mr. Liu, a writer and dissident, that he might be freed altogether, if not allowed to leave China. He remains under police guard in a hospital. There have been signs that China’s leaders were growing sensitive to the international attention that Mr. Liu’s case has received, especially allegations that the government had effectively caused him to become gravely ill by failing to treat his liver cancer while he was incarcerated. The judicial department of the northeastern province of Liaoning, where Mr. Liu has been serving his sentence and is being treated, released a statement Wednesday evening saying that he had received regular checkups in prison and that the cancer had been detected only a month ago. That followed the release of a video of Mr. Liu in prison — the first public glimpse of him since he was sentenced in 2009 — showing him exercising and undergoing what appeared to be routine medical tests. The statement said that a team of specialists had convened to oversee Mr. Liu’s treatment on June 7, apparently leading to the decision to transfer him from his jail cell on medical parole. The condition of Mr. Liu, who is 61, was not clear from the statement, though his lawyers and friends, citing his wife, said that his cancer was so advanced that there appeared to be little hope of recovery.

"Throughout the turbulence of his first months in office, President Trump has been able to point to one bastion of support: the stock market. Earlier this month he tweeted the “great economic news” he thinks the mainstream media has been ignoring: The Dow Jones industrial average was up 16 percent and the Nasdaq up 19.5 percent since his election. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross maintained that the Trump administration had bestowed $4 trillion in gains on investors. Investors have seemingly been oblivious to claims of Russian interference in the election, the firing of a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the appointment of a special prosecutor. As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records. But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. “Valuations are high and it’s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,” said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. “Bull markets don’t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?” Investors “are on a knife’s edge,” said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, “they see a potential disaster around every corner.” This month the so-called Faang stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market’s rally — faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes. On June 14, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time this year, a move that was widely expected. But more ominously for stock investors, the Fed also said it would reduce its $4.2 trillion balance sheet and taper its purchases of longer-term government bonds (though it didn’t say how fast), bringing to an end the quantitative easing it undertook after the financial crisis. And the prospect that European central banks might join in the tightening has sent bond prices lower. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out Thursday at the appearance and intellect of Mika Brzezinski, a co-host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” drawing condemnation from his fellow Republicans and reigniting the controversy over his attitudes toward women that nearly derailed his candidacy last year. Mr. Trump’s invective threatened to further erode his support from Republican women and independents, both among voters and on Capitol Hill, where he needs negotiating leverage for the stalled Senate health care bill. The president described Ms. Brzezinski as “low I.Q. Crazy Mika” and claimed in a series of Twitter posts that she had been “bleeding badly from a face-lift” during a social gathering at Mr. Trump’s resort in Florida around New Year’s Eve. The White House did not explain what had prompted the outburst, but a spokeswoman said Ms. Brzezinski deserved a rebuke because of her show’s harsh stance on Mr. Trump. The tweets ended five months of relative silence from the president on the volatile subject of gender, reintroducing a political vulnerability: his history of demeaning women for their age, appearance and mental capacity. “My first reaction was that this just has to stop, and I was disheartened because I had hoped the personal, ad hominem attacks had been left behind, that we were past that,” Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who is a crucial holdout on the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said in an interview. “I don’t think it directly affects the negotiation on the health care bill, but it is undignified — it’s beneath a president of the United States and just so contrary to the way we expect a president to act,” she said. “People may say things during a campaign, but it’s different when you become a public servant. I don’t see it as undermining his ability to negotiate legislation, necessarily, but I see it as embarrassing to our country.” "
"BERLIN — In the preamble to their constitution, the American people pledge to “promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” This compelling, powerful statement has made the United States a world champion of liberty and democracy — a commitment for which all who value and honor the common heritage of freedom are grateful. It is precisely these values on which the trans-Atlantic partnership was founded. It is not simply a community of interests, but a lasting friendship between democrats and democracies. Although not free of conflicts and by no means perfect, it is a friendship shaped and sustained by the principles of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and a belief in the market economy. We shall never forget that many Americans sacrificed their lives for democracy and freedom in Europe. However great that legacy may be, sadly, one cannot deny it is in danger of suffering serious damage. The world is undergoing seismic change with barely conceivable consequences. The rules-based international order largely established by the United States and Europe after World War II is no longer automatically accepted by all states. The international system of trade, which for decades has been characterized by the opening up and interaction of markets, is being challenged by a model of barriers and isolationism. A new type of nationalism and authoritarianism is questioning the achievements of freedom and democracy. This authoritarianism is an external challenge to the Western value-based alliance. Neither Russia nor China has an interest in the joint sustained strength and success of democracies in Europe and the United States. However, our values are also threatened from within. Right-wing and populist parties and movements have gained significant ground in some European countries. Their smear campaigns are poisoning democratic culture and cohesion in Europe. With Donald Trump, Americans have elected a president who hardly displays a deep respect for those values and traditions that made the United States and the trans-Atlantic partnership what they are. A president who wants to build walls around the nation of freedom, of immigrants, that the United States has always been. A president who wants to partition off the world’s largest economy and enforce protectionism, who denies climate change and withdraws from the Paris climate agreement — probably the most significant agreement in the first years of the 21st century. A president who seemingly finds it more important to send a quick tweet than to rely on journalistic and scientific accuracy. A president who made his first official trip abroad to Saudi Arabia to secure a multi-billion-dollar arms deal rather than visit his closest allies in the struggle for peace and cooperation in the world.
