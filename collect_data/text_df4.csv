1,"TEHRAN — Members of Iran’s ruling establishment took turns on Thursday assigning blame for what they regard as an embarrassing outbreak of protests in more than 80 cities across the country. Iran’s chief prosecutor elaborated on the government’s claims that the United States and other foreign enemies were responsible for stirring up trouble. The United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia planned the “riots” to “subvert the Iranian government,” the prosecutor, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, said on state television. “The U.S., the Zionist regime and the Al Sauds were the three sides of this subversive plan, and Saudi Arabia committed to provide money for it,” Mr. Montazeri said. Mr. Montazeri asserted that Michael D’Andrea, a C.I.A. officer who runs Iran operations, was a “main designer” of the protests and that the C.I.A. hoped to turn the protest into an “armed” revolt by mid-February, the anniversary of the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution. The Trump administration has denied having any involvement in the protests, and the C.I.A. declined to comment. But a former intelligence official who was granted anonymity to discuss Mr. D’Andrea’s thinking said the operative did not believe the United States could do anything to bring about regime change in Iran. Iran did not provide evidence for its accusation, which evoked memories of the C.I.A.’s role in a 1953 coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh. "
2,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would suspend nearly all security aid to Pakistan, an across-the-board freeze that is the most tangible sign yet of Washington’s frustration with the country’s refusal to crack down on terrorist networks operating there. The decision, which could affect as much as $1.3 billion in annual aid, came three days after President Trump complained on Twitter that Pakistan had “given us nothing but lies & deceit” and accused it of providing “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.” The move underlines how swiftly relations with Pakistan have deteriorated since Mr. Trump took office. But it echoes several previous rifts between the countries over Pakistan’s role as a sanctuary for extremist groups — a role that has poisoned Islamabad’s relations with Washington since the terrorist attacks of September 2001. Administration officials emphasized that the freeze was temporary and could be lifted if Pakistan changed its behavior. The United States is urging the Pakistani government to cut off contact with militants and reassign intelligence agents with links to extremists, among other measures. United States officials had also demanded access to a member of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network, who was captured by Pakistani forces during the rescue of a Canadian-American family in October, and were angered when Pakistan rejected the request. “It’s hard to argue the status quo has been working, so we are looking at changing it to advance our security objectives,” said Brian H. Hook, the State Department’s director of policy planning. Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said the administration was still working out the precise dollar amounts that would be frozen. Though the move was months in the planning, officials said the announcement was rushed by a few days to catch up to Mr. Trump’s Twitter post on Monday, which drew a toxic reaction from Pakistan. The move also came after considerable internal debate, officials said. The Pentagon is worried that the Pakistani government could retaliate by denying access to routes in Pakistan that it uses to supply roughly 14,000 American troops deployed in neighboring Afghanistan. After Mr. Trump’s tweet, the foreign minister of Pakistan, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, said that there was a need to revisit the nature of its relations with the United States. In an interview with a local news network, he said the United States was acting like neither an ally nor a friend. The suspension includes about $1.1 billion in Coalition Support Funds, which the Pentagon provides to help defray the costs of counterterrorism operations in Pakistan. Under the freeze, the United States also will not deliver military equipment to the country. It had earlier held up $255 million in State Department military financing. Ms. Nauert said some exceptions could be made “on a case-by-case basis if determined to be critical to national security interests.” Internal government talking points that were obtained by The New York Times said the suspension was “a freeze, and does not reflect intent to reprogram funds at this time” — meaning that the money will not be diverted to other uses. “Pakistan has the ability to get this money back in the future, but they have to take decisive action,” Ms. Nauert said. The administration said that the freeze did not apply to civilian assistance programs. The United States has provided Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid since 2002, a program that ramped up sharply in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks as the United States viewed Pakistan as a key ally in fighting Islamic militants. Earlier on Thursday, the State Department announced that it had placed Pakistan on a special watch list for what it described as severe violations of religious freedoms. The designation was part of the administration’s annual accounting of violations by countries as required by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. Attacks on religious minorities have increased in Pakistan in recent years, reflecting a growing religious intolerance and driven in part by a proliferation of religious schools funded by Saudi Arabia. The United States previously has frozen military aid without forcing a change in Pakistan’s policies. In July 2011, two months after an American commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, the Obama administration suspended about $800 million in aid. Relations with Pakistan did not improve, and officials there have come to discount such threats. “This is a great opening salvo, but I don’t think it is enough to make Pakistan change its behavior, unless we have a Plan B,” said C. Christine Fair, a professor who specializes in South Asia at the security studies program at Georgetown University. Still, Ms. Fair said the scale of the administration’s action suggested it was serious about forcing a change. White House officials said they would consider further steps, including removing Pakistan from a list of major non-NATO allies of the United States — a move that would carry enormous symbolic significance for the relationship. Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States, said the decision “indicates that the administration does have a step-by-step plan to indicate to Pakistan that business as usual is no longer possible.” While Mr. Haqqani said that Pakistan might well retaliate by shutting off ground supply routes to Afghanistan, such a move would also carry costs for the Pakistanis, since they supply many of the trucks and other logistics for the supply operation. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said, “We have had no indication of anything like that.” The administration has augured the freeze ever since Mr. Trump announced his Afghanistan strategy over the summer, in which he faulted Pakistan for failing to crack down on terrorist sanctuaries that line the border between the two countries. His language grew harsher in recent weeks. Last month, in presenting his national security strategy, Mr. Trump again singled out Pakistan. “We make massive payments every year to Pakistan,” he said. “They have to help.” Vice President Mike Pence reinforced that message in a visit to Afghanistan just before Christmas, telling cheering American troops that “President Trump has put Pakistan on notice.” But some analysts argued that while publicly complaining about Pakistan’s lack of action against terrorist groups may feel satisfying, such accusations were deeply counterproductive. Richard G. Olson, a former special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan during the Obama administration, noted that the American military effort in Afghanistan was heavily reliant on Pakistan’s consent. Almost every military flight into Afghanistan, including those of attack aircraft, goes through Pakistani airspace. Most supplies travel along Pakistani roads and rails. “Our choices in Afghanistan are already difficult, but if you want to make them even more difficult, continue to taunt the Pakistanis,” Mr. Olson said. “The Pakistanis could effectively shut down the war.” Pakistan closed ground supply routes to Afghanistan in the months after the raid that killed Bin Laden, and those supply lines were rerouted to the northern route. But the northern route is heavily dependent on Russian consent, and with relations between Washington and Moscow deteriorating, such consent is far from assured. "
3,"Must a New York City condominium forever bear the name T-R-U-M-P in large, brasslike letters? Or can it choose to take them down in favor, perhaps, of what a majority of residents believe is a more dignified name, 200 Riverside Boulevard, its simple street address? That is the question before a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan as part of a heated legal battle between the condominium’s board and DJT Holdings, a corporate entity owned by President Trump. There was a time in New York City and beyond when developers and businesses proudly emblazoned the Trump name on their residential buildings, hotels, steaks and water. But since Mr. Trump was elected president, a small countertrend has emerged. T-R-U-M-P letters have been peeled off three rental buildings also on Riverside Boulevard, as well as hotels in SoHo and Toronto. The Trump name was also excised from the now-defunct Taj Mahal casino on the Atlantic City boardwalk, but that happened at Mr. Trump’s insistence. The embattled condominium is part of a development that stretches from 59th to 72nd Street along the West Side, known variously as Riverside South and Trump Place. Mr. Trump bought the property, a former rail yard, in the 1980s, but with his business in distress, he ended up selling it to a group of Hong Kong billionaires who, with his help, developed it. The Trump name was cemented in place by a four-page licensing agreement, signed in 2000. It described Mr. Trump as a “worldwide renowned builder and developer of real estate who enjoys the highest reputation in these fields among others,” but set only a modest value on the use of his name: $1. Not payable monthly or even annually, but $1 in total. "
4,"WASHINGTON — In a notable back flip, the Trump administration has decided that maybe the Obama administration was right in its efforts to change the way doctors and hospitals are paid under Medicare. The Trump administration said late Tuesday that it was starting a Medicare payment model very similar to the ones it canceled and curtailed last year. The Obama administration devised the earlier projects using authority in the Affordable Care Act. In the new program, as described by Trump appointees, Medicare will make a single “bundled payment” for nearly all the services provided in a 90-day period to certain Medicare patients who are admitted to a hospital or have certain outpatient medical procedures. Health care providers can receive a bonus if they hold Medicare spending for these patients below a target set by the government, and they may have to repay the government if Medicare spending for them exceeds the target. Tom Price, the first secretary of health and human services under President Trump, accused the Obama administration of trying to “commandeer clinical decision making” by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for care. Participation in the new project is voluntary. Medicare has traditionally paid a separate fee for each service. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the new bundled payments were “an important step in the move away from fee-for-service and toward paying for value.” "
5,"WASHINGTON — Canada has filed a sweeping trade case against the United States at the World Trade Organization, lobbing a diplomatic grenade at the Trump administration’s “America First” approach amid an increasingly embattled trade relationship between the longstanding North American allies. The trade case could exacerbate tensions between the two nations, which have frayed in recent months as the countries wrestle with trade disputes and attempts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada’s case challenges the United States’ use of tariffs to punish unfair trade practices and protect its markets, saying those actions violate World Trade Organization rules. The case could expand into a multinational trade dispute given that Canada, a champion of global agreements, filed it in a way that allows other countries to join. The 37-page document outlines numerous problematic trade actions that it says the United States has taken against China, South Korea, Japan and Germany. The case, which was filed on Dec. 20 and made public on Wednesday, centers on the punitive tariffs that the United States imposes when it finds other countries guilty of subsidizing their products or of selling them abroad at unfairly low prices, a practice known as dumping. The United States has lost cases in the World Trade Organization over this system, which differs substantially from that of many countries. Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, called Canada’s action “a broad and ill-advised attack” on the American trade system. “U.S. trade remedies ensure that trade is fair by counteracting dumping or subsidies that are injuring U.S. workers, farmers and manufacturers,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. “Canada’s claims are unfounded and could only lower U.S. confidence that Canada is committed to mutually beneficial trade.” "
6,"If there has been any benefit from Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, it’s that it has raised awareness about President Vladimir Putin’s broader threat to democracies in Europe and elsewhere. In the face of complacency from Republicans fearful of what attention to these intrigues might reveal about the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have issued a report that appears to be the most comprehensive public accounting of Russia’s war on the West. It drives home the point that the 2016 election, which every American intelligence agency has said involved Russian interference to help elect Donald Trump, is part of a pattern in which Mr. Putin has worked to erode Western institutions and undermine faith in democratic practices. Few countries in Europe have escaped his malign intrusions. The report should serve as an alert for the United States to work urgently with its allies to protect democracy. There is a significant impediment, however, and that is President Trump and the congressional leaders who enable him. Mr. Trump persists in his bizarre fascination with Mr. Putin and refuses to acknowledge that Russia poses a security threat, even though his own recently released national security strategy says Russia, along with China, seeks to “challenge American influence, values and wealth.” Republicans in Congress have expressed more concern about those who revealed Russia’s meddling than about the meddling, and have done nothing to ensure it cannot be repeated. According to the report, the Kremlin is spending far more on foreign propaganda outlets, and on nongovernmental groups and political parties opposed to the European Union and NATO. It enlisted organized crime groups to launder money and commit other crimes, and used its control of energy supplies to spread corruption, the report said. Russia used cyberwarfare, disinformation and military force to inhibit ties to the West by Georgia and Ukraine. The Kremlin is also trying to undermine Serbia’s efforts to integrate with the West by exploiting connections between the Russian Orthodox Church and Serbians and through its near monopoly on energy supplies. Russia has weakened democracy in Hungary and Bulgaria, both members of the European Union and NATO, and has drawn them closer to Mr. Putin’s orbit. The Kremlin is spreading its reach into Mexico and the Middle East. This activity would be troubling at any time, but more so now when the president has denied there has been Russian meddling, refused to criticize Mr. Putin and has seemed more interested in rewarding Moscow than confronting it. The report was produced without Republican input, which gives it a partisan cast it does not deserve, especially since it acknowledges that the threat posed by Mr. Putin existed before the current administration came to office. Democrats hope the report will increase pressure on the administration to put into effect sanctions Congress overwhelmingly enacted last year with a deadline of Jan. 29. “Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a U.S. president,” Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a letter attached to the report. By contrast, Europe, as the report notes, has begun to push back. Germany pre-empted Russian interference in its elections by warning the Kremlin that meddling would bring consequences, by forging an agreement among political parties not to use bots or paid trolls, and by ensuring cybercooperation between the government and campaigns. Spain has led Europe in cracking down on Russian-based organized crime groups. The Baltic States have beefed up defenses against cyberattacks and disinformation and diversified energy supplies to avoid overreliance on Russia. NATO and the European Union have focused on cyberdefense. As the report points out, there are many things besides sanctions that should be part of a comprehensive American strategy, including helping to strengthen democratic institutions in vulnerable European countries, exposing and freezing Kremlin-linked dirty money and building a coalition to counter Russian hybrid threats. But most important is leadership, which so far Mr. Trump has refused to provide. On Twitter, he denounced the Democrats for releasing the report and, once again, said he had not colluded with Moscow. “Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing,” he wrote. He’s right, but he doesn’t realize who is being laughed at. "
7,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.      
8,"PHILADELPHIA — It is not difficult to find an all-male panel at the annual January mega-gathering of American economists. They are as common as PowerPoint presentations and pie charts. One such panel this year met to sleepily critique President Trump’s economic policies, but it was overshadowed by another panel, two ballrooms away, that jolted a profession that prides itself on cool rationality. That panel on Friday was stocked with women, each of whom presented new research that revealed a systemic bias in economics and presaged a move by the field’s leaders to promise to address some of those issues. Paper after paper presented at the American Economic Association panel showed a pattern of gender discrimination, beginning with barriers women face in choosing to study economics and extending through the life cycle of their careers, including securing job opportunities, writing research papers, gaining access to top publications and earning proper credit for published work. Economics departments have gradually increased their share of female faculty members over the past 20 years. But only one in five tenure-track economics professors is a woman, according to the American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. In many parts of the profession, gender progress stagnated over the last decade. About one in three new economics doctoral students was a woman in 2016, and fewer than one in three assistant professors were women. In both of those cases, the share of women was essentially unchanged from 2006. "

11,"BRUSSELS — A Belgian official’s decision to expel several Sudanese migrants late last year — several of whom say they were tortured when they went back home — has roiled Belgium’s politics, reflecting not only the fraught migration debate in Western Europe but also the divisions that have made the country notoriously difficult to govern. The official, Theo Francken, is a 39-year-old Flemish nationalist who in 2014 was appointed secretary of state for asylum and migration. He is known for making incendiary comments about migrants; in September, he apologized for using the term “cleaning up” about a police operation in which several undocumented immigrants were arrested. The term was condemned as xenophobic. Supporters and critics alike have called Mr. Francken “the Flemish Trump.” Last September, Mr. Francken invited several Sudanese officials to Belgium to review the cases of dozens of Sudanese people who were in the country without authorization. The decision outraged advocates for the migrants, who pointed to Sudan’s abysmal human rights record and the fact that its president, Omar al-Bashir, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for trial on war crimes and genocide charges. Representatives of the Belgian government were present during most of the interviews, but were not always accompanied by Arabic-language interpreters, raising the possibility that they did not follow all of what was said. Lawyers for the migrants said the Sudanese officials warned that if the migrants applied for asylum in Belgium but were denied and sent home, they would be targeted for abuse. Nine Sudanese were subsequently sent home, and accounts quickly surfaced that at least three of them, from the violence-prone Darfur and South Kordofan regions, were abused. The accounts appeared in the Belgian media and in interviews conducted by the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington-based think tank. In the interviews, the men said they had been detained, interrogated, threatened with persecution, and beaten or even tortured. "

13,"Since last Sunday’s Golden Globes, the question of what to wear to the various awards shows has become even more fraught than usual. It’s not just about a pretty dress any more, but about solidarity, statement making and so on. Luckily, however, a solution to at least one such conundrum is at hand. Though there is as yet no official ceremony or red carpet attached to President Trump’s Fake News awards, scheduled to take place next Wednesday (after being postponed from Monday), anyone who suspects that he or she may be in the cross hairs, has a perfect potential outfit. Or at least part of one. Topshop, the British retailer, has created a pair of jeans in semi-stretch denim, with a red stripe down the side blaring, “Fake News” over and over again in white block letters. They look rather like a nod to artwork by Barbara Kruger. Just imagine them with a tuxedo jacket and heels instead of the sweatshirts they are paired with on Topshop’s website, and bingo! “The term ‘Fake News’ became so ubiquitous last year that it was officially named the word of the year, so we thought we’d immortalize this of-the-moment phrase on a pair of our jeans,” said Mo Riach, Topshop’s head of design, by way of explanation. (“Fake News” was chosen as the word of the year for 2017 by both the Collins English Dictionary and the American Dialect Society, in case you were wondering.) The jeans, which cost $90 and come in gently faded denim with a mid-rise and straight legs, were a trending product on the brand’s website by Tuesday, with 30 percent of the sales originating in the United States. By Wednesday, they were sold out. "
14,"President Trump is crashing the global elite’s ultimate party: He’s planning to attend the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering in Davos this month, the White House confirmed on Tuesday. It’s hard to imagine an audience less receptive to Mr. Trump’s “America First” agenda. Yet, whether he is seeking reconciliation or pitching for strongman status, his mere presence is a rebuke to the elites who got him badly wrong. Mr. Trump will stand out among the 3,000-odd political leaders, financiers and company executives due to convene in the Swiss resort on Jan. 23. His threats to raise barriers to the movement of goods and people, his rejection of the Paris climate change accord and his belligerence toward North Korea have convinced the gathering’s wealthy and mostly liberal delegates that the United States is giving up on global leadership. Indeed, this year’s Davos theme — “Creating a shared future in a fractured world” — seems an attempt to mitigate Mr. Trump’s influence. The self-proclaimed billionaire will be the first sitting United States president to attend the gathering since Bill Clinton in 2000. Just as President Richard M. Nixon’s right-wing credentials made it possible for him to visit Communist China, Mr. Trump’s anti-globalization stance has enabled him to risk a trip to the European mountain resort. Imagine the vitriol that Barack Obama would have endured at home if he had put in an appearance. What Mr. Trump hopes to achieve is less clear. There will be optimism that his visit is a sign that White House moderates have gained the upper hand. Even so, it is hard to imagine Mr. Trump giving a conciliatory speech or defending globalization, as the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, did last year. It’s more likely that he will be party pooper in chief, reasserting his isolationist policies while reminding the crowd of what it failed to foresee. At Davos two years ago, delegates dismissed Mr. Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election. A year later, attendees talked up his pragmatic deal-making credentials — only to watch Mr. Trump’s dark and foreboding inaugural address. The Davos crowd does not object to autocrats: Mr. Xi and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have received applause in previous years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, another nationalist, will deliver this year’s keynote speech. Ultimately, Mr. Trump will not be that different to the other wealthy attendees on the ski slopes, debating what the masses really think. "

16,"For nearly a decade, central banks around the world have been the biggest buyers of bonds, sending interest rates plummeting and stock markets soaring. Now, investors are starting to worry about what would happen if the richest nations start to scale back on a buying binge that most of them began to stimulate economies hurt by the global financial crisis. The most immediate fear: A sharp falloff in bond prices would rattle equity markets that are now trading at record highs. Beyond that, there is a looming concern that as the global economy heats up, inflation, a bond investor’s main worry, will start to inch up, fed by higher wage demands on the part of workers everywhere. “Your largest investor might be stepping back, that’s what spooked people,” said John Briggs, a bond strategist at NatWest Markets. “The market is very vulnerable to any change in supply and demand.” That vulnerability has been on display in recent weeks, with many investors selling out of their bond positions, pushing the yield — which rises as bond prices fall — on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury bill up to a high of 2.59 percent on Wednesday from 2.3 late last year. Bond markets appeared to be further spooked on Wednesday by a report that China’s central bank, which owns $1.2 trillion in United States Treasury bonds, may be poised to slow or even halt its buying of United States debt. China has total reserves of just over $3 trillion. "
17,"Our subject today is Donald Trump’s mind. Not the speculation about whether he’s losing his marbles. That was during our “Fire and Fury” period last week. Now we’re thinking about that lovely bipartisan meeting the president hosted Tuesday with members of Congress about immigration. Everybody was impressed by how concerned Trump seemed to be about all the young Dreamers suddenly facing possible deportation. “I came out feeling the president had made it very clear he wants this resolved ASAP,” said Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic whip. The only problem is that Trump seems to be committed to two totally contradictory ideas on what to do. Is he being your typical pol? Your typical loony person? Something in between? Let’s revisit. Right now the real immigration crisis is about the 800,000 young people who were brought here illegally as children and given protection under the Obama administration. Trump hates calling them Dreamers, so he refers to them as “the DACA population,” after the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protected them. Until he terminated it. They could be in danger of deportation beginning in March. The Tuesday Trump was very disturbed about this situation. Really, you’d hardly have known that he was the one who created it. He called for “a bill of love” to make things right. The fix is actually pretty easy. There’s a bipartisan bill floating around the House right now that would protect the Dreamers from deportation and add more money for technology to guard the border. Then later on, if it’s feeling ambitious, Congress could tackle a big immigration reform. That would include a path to citizenship for many of the illegal immigrants here now and some sops to conservatives, like restrictions on their ability to bring in relatives. And yeah, maybe some wall equivalent. We don’t need to discuss that now. The Dreamers are an immediate crisis. But even if you thought building a monstrous multibillion-dollar barrier along the border was a good idea, it’s not something that’s going to happen anytime soon. Here is the current vision in the president’s mind: “We don’t need a wall where you have rivers and mountains and everything else protecting it,” he told that congressional meeting. “But we do need a wall for a fairly good portion. We also — as you know, it was passed in 2006 — a essentially similar thing which — a fence, a very substantial fence was passed. But unfortunately, I don’t know, they never got it done. But they need it.” So, O.K. Senator Dianne Feinstein proposed doing “a clean DACA bill now” followed by a major immigration reform later. Trump thought that was a great idea. “We’re going to do DACA,” he announced, “and then we can start immediately on the phase two, which would be comprehensive.” So easy, so bipartisan, so … bill of love. “We’re on the same page,” Trump told the gathering. “We are, we are,” said Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas, a Democrat who had been arguing strenuously against the wall idea. Then Wednesday the president shouted “No! No! No!” when asked if he’d be open to any deal on the immediately endangered Dreamers that didn’t also involve his Mexican wall. This was at an appearance with the poor prime minister of Norway, who had to look sympathetic when Trump managed to find ways — in a rather short press conference — to brag about the American trade surplus with her country, say “no collusion” seven times, brag about winning the Electoral College and attack Hillary Clinton. (“But Hillary was not for a strong military, and Hillary, my opponent, was for windmills. …”) Plus torpedo the DACA plan. So Trump, who told those Congress members he would “take the heat” for anything they wanted to do to save the Dreamers, threw up a wall. How do we explain all this? A) Situational ethics. B) Extreme dementia. C) Just another day. Here’s an answer. We are well aware by now that there are several incarnations of the president, from the Somewhat Normal Republican Trump (SNORT) to the Nearly Unhinged Trump (NUT). The one we saw at the bipartisan meeting was the Reasonable Chatty Trump, whose pleasant disposition makes up for the fact that the initials don’t spell anything. The Reasonable version can sit through a fairly long gathering nodding, agreeing, making the occasional joke and appearing to be an excellent listener. When he’s actually not paying any attention at all. What do you think was actually on Trump’s mind when Feinstein asked that question? A) Picturing Steve Bannon curled up in the fetal position, crying under his bed. B) Imagining the networks swooning over his warmhearted concern for those … DACA persons. C) Just cheeseburgers. Your guess is as good as mine. But the great part of this tactic is that everybody walks away feeling they’ve made a real impression. Until it becomes clear that nothing ever sinks in. "

19,"WASHINGTON — Prominent House Republicans stepped forward on Wednesday with a vision of immigration policy that clashed fiercely with President Trump’s recent overtures of bipartisanship and highlighted how difficult it will be for Congress and the president to reach accord in the coming weeks. The proposal, championed by the chairmen of the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, would crack down on illegal immigration and sharply reduce the number of legal immigrants to the United States. Coming one day after Mr. Trump held an extraordinary meeting in which he laid out the parameters for a bipartisan immigration deal, the House proposal highlighted the uncertainty surrounding negotiations that are supposed to coalesce before the government runs out of money on Jan. 19. “This is the only bill that’s going to unify the conference, and it’s going to get us to a majority of the conference,” said Representative Raúl R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who participated in Tuesday’s White House meeting. Mr. Trump convened Tuesday’s session to address the fate of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents and were eligible for work permits under an Obama-era initiative called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Mr. Trump rescinded DACA in September and gave Congress six months to come up with a replacement. During Tuesday’s session, the president and lawmakers outlined four broad areas to be negotiated as part of a bipartisan immigration deal: shielding the young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, from deportation; limiting family-based migration, in which one relative can sponsor another; ending the diversity visa lottery system; and improving border security. But the House measure, put forth by a group that includes two committee chairmen — Judiciary’s Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia and Homeland Security’s Michael McCaul of Texas — was far more expansive. "
20,"A Wisconsin school district has agreed to pay $800,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a transgender student who said he was forbidden from using boys bathrooms at his high school and felt degraded by administrators. The decision by the school board for the Kenosha Unified School District means that the matter will not be taken up by the United States Supreme Court. The lawsuit was filed in 2016 by Ashton Whitaker, who was a rising senior at the time at George Nelson Tremper High School in Kenosha, a city on Lake Michigan. Court documents show that Mr. Whitaker, 18, who graduated last year and is now a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, began to openly identify as a boy when he was a freshman at the high school. After teachers and administrators there told him he could not use the boys restrooms, he sued the school district. “The idea of using the girls restroom was humiliating and there was no way I could do it,” he said in a court document filed in August 2016. “If I were to use the gender-neutral restrooms, I would also stand out from everyone else with a big label on me that said ‘transgender.’” He described feeling “scrutinized and degraded” when administrators repeatedly tried to keep him out of the boys restrooms, or when they used female pronouns after he had asked them not to. He added that he suffered from anxiety, depression, migraines and other health problems related to dehydration because he had tried to avoid restroom trips by drinking less water. "

23,"WASHINGTON — The European Union is the West’s last line of defense. The United States has historically been the world’s anchor of republican ideals, but President Trump has abandoned the role, openly admiring strongmen like Vladimir Putin of Russia. As the temptations of nationalist populism spread, Europe has responsibility for holding down the Western fort. The primary battle right now is over Poland, which is deepening its descent into illiberalism. The European Union needs to take a firm stand in defense of Western values. Since coming to power in 2015, Poland’s populist government has sought to control the news media, purged and politicized the civil service, and intimidated intellectuals and civil society organizations. Three weeks ago, Poland’s president signed into law legislation that compromises judicial independence, effectively clearing the way for the ruling Law and Justice party to stack the courts. In response, Brussels has taken the right steps, warning Warsaw of punishment if it continues to pursue policies inconsistent with the European Union’s founding principles, which include “democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.” In late December, the European Commission for the first time in the union’s history started a formal procedure that could lead to disciplinary sanctions, including the suspension of Poland’s voting rights in the European Union’s main decision-making body. These measures have not gone unnoticed in Warsaw. This week, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki reshuffled his cabinet, replacing a number of ministers whose relationships with European leaders were particularly strained. And he flew to Brussels for dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. But these moves have yet to be accompanied by any concrete steps to reverse Poland’s illiberal turn. The European Union must keep the pressure on. Poland’s trajectory is not unique within the bloc. Hungary has already gone down a similar path, and other member states in Central Europe are tilting in the same direction. But Poland’s descent is particularly consequential: With a population of almost 40 million, it is Central Europe’s standard-bearer. Poland’s leading role in the collapse of the Soviet bloc makes its illiberal slide all the more arresting. In the early 1980s, the Solidarity labor movement inspired widespread resistance to Poland’s Communist government, setting the stage for the broader revolt across Central Europe that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Poland was at the forefront of the transition from Communist satellite to market democracy, joining NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. "

WASHINGTON — At 5:20 on Tuesday evening, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tweeted a photo of himself at the Tallahassee airport with Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, announcing that he had decided, after meeting with Governor Scott, to exempt the state from a new Trump administration plan to open up most of the nation’s coastline to offshore oil drilling. It was a sudden and unexpected change to a plan that President Trump had celebrated just five days before, and it took lawmakers and governors from both parties by surprise. It also gave Governor Scott, a Republican who is widely expected to run for the Senate this year, a clear political boost in that race. Florida lawmakers of both parties have long opposed offshore drilling, especially after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill sent tarballs to the shores of a state where the economy relies heavily on tourism. Mr. Zinke’s sudden flip-flop on Florida drilling allows Governor Scott to tout the decision as evidence of his influence with the White House. Mr. Trump’s critics say the move highlights the president’s willingness to blatantly use the nation’s public lands and waters as political bargaining chips. It also appears to illustrate the clumsiness with which the Trump administration drafts federal policies. By publicly putting forth the comprehensive new coastal drilling plan and then abruptly announcing a major change to it less than a week later, with little evident public or scientific review, the Interior Department appears to have opened itself to a wave of legal challenges. "
25,"WASHINGTON — Remember the infamous “Bridge to Nowhere”? The Montana Sheep Institute or the now-shuttered North Carolina teapot hall of fame? Congress years ago eliminated funding for these types of pet projects, known as earmarks, after they became derided as government boondoggles, largess and a pathway to corruption. President Trump now wants to bring them back. In a freewheeling meeting about immigration with congressional Republicans and Democrats this week, Mr. Trump lamented the gridlock that has gripped the capital in recent years and suggested that earmarks, the practice of stealthily stuffing funding for pet projects into legislation, be exhumed from the legislative graveyard. “Our system lends itself to not getting things done, and I hear so much about earmarks — the old earmark system — how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. “Maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.” Earmarks have a long and sometimes troubled history in Washington. Through the late 1990s and 2000s, they were used to persuade lawmakers to take tough votes in exchange for financial help back home. That spawned an entire industry of earmark lobbying and led to some enormous scandals, capped by the downfall of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. In 2011, on a bipartisan basis, earmarks were banned. As they careen toward potentially perilous 2018 midterm elections, Republicans are now actively considering bringing them back. Lawmakers have complained for years that without earmarks, they have no reliable way of funding vital constituent interests, from roads to sewer systems. The House Rules Committee is planning to hold public hearings on the subject next week. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said this week that he supports his party having “conversations” about allowing earmarks to re-emerge. "
26,"WASHINGTON — A yearslong debate over National Security Agency surveillance and protections for Americans’ privacy rights will reach a climactic moment on Thursday as the House of Representatives takes up legislation to extend a program of warrantless spying on internet and phone networks that traces back to the Sept. 11 attacks. There is little doubt that Congress will extend an expiring statute, known as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, that permits the government to collect without a warrant from American firms, like Google and AT&T, the emails and other communications of foreigners abroad — even when they are talking to Americans. But it is far from clear whether Congress will impose significant new safeguards for Americans’ privacy. A bipartisan coalition of civil-liberties-minded lawmakers are trying to impose such changes, while the Trump administration, the intelligence community and House Republican leadership oppose them. Thursday’s vote is seen as the crucial test because more would-be reformers are in the House than in the Senate, which will take up the legislation later. If majority support for imposing new privacy protections on the program does not exist in the House, the Senate is unlikely to add them in. “The chances are better in the House,” acknowledged Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, at a news conference on Wednesday of House and Senate lawmakers who support surveillance overhaul efforts. “The privacy movement is stronger in the House than the Senate. Maybe we can learn from you guys.” The N.S.A. began collecting Americans’ international phone calls and emails without a warrant in October 2001 as part of the Bush administration’s post-Sept. 11 Stellarwind program. In 2008, after the program had come to light, Congress legalized a form of it by enacting Section 702 of the FISA law. That law enabled the program to expand to Silicon Valley firms, not just telecoms, and to all foreign intelligence purposes, not just counterterrorism. In late 2012, Congress extended the law for five years without changes. But the pending expiration of Section 702 is forcing lawmakers to address its substance for the first time since the 2013 leaks about N.S.A. programs by Edward J. Snowden set off a major debate about 21st-century surveillance technology and privacy rights. On Thursday, the House will vote on an Intelligence Committee bill that would extend the 702 program for six years with only minor changes. But House leaders are permitting lawmakers first to vote on a single proposed amendment that would make major changes. Chief among them, the amendment would ban the practice whereby officials at the N.S.A., the F.B.I. and other security agencies, without a warrant, search for and read private messages of Americans that the government incidentally swept up under the 702 program. Instead, except in emergencies, officials would need to obtain a court order to query the repository for an American’s information. The amendment is chiefly sponsored by Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, and Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California. It would substitute in the text of another bill, dubbed the USA Rights Act, which would extend Section 702 by only four years. The bipartisan coalition backing overhaul efforts — which includes some of the most conservative and most liberal members of the House — say that change is necessary to uphold the meaning and substance of Fourth Amendment privacy rights in light of 21st-century communications technology and surveillance powers. But the F.B.I. and the intelligence community have balked at that proposal, saying it would impede their efforts to protect the country to require warrants to query information the government already possesses. There are also lawmakers of both parties — backed by House leadership — who oppose the amendment. Aides to Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, distributed a one-page sheet this week denouncing the amendment as imposing “unnecessarily severe requirements” that would endanger Americans. Complicating matters, the base bill backed by Mr. Nunes contains a gesture toward a court-order requirement, too. It would apply only under narrow circumstances: if F.B.I. agents have already opened a criminal investigation into the American whose information they are searching for, and if the agents have no national-security rationale. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the warrant requirement in the base bill would be sufficient to “prevent the database from being used as a general tool to gather evidence and introduce it in court in cases that have nothing to do with terrorism.” But the base bill would still permit routine queries for Americans’ information without warrants. Its warrant requirement would not apply to national-security-related queries by a range of agencies, including the C.I.A., the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. Nor would it apply to F.B.I. queries when agents are merely pursuing tips about an American but do not yet have enough evidence of wrongdoing to open a criminal investigation. In short, the base bill would give greater privacy protections to criminal suspects than to people the F.B.I. has no solid basis for thinking had committed any wrongdoing. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, dismissed the base bill’s limited warrant provision on Wednesday as “fake reform” that was really just “business as usual.” Adding to the uncertainty, in 2014 and 2015, the House approved amendments to appropriations bills that would have required warrants to search the 702 repository for Americans’ information, but they were rejected in negotiations with the Senate. When the idea came up again in 2016, shortly after the terrorist attack on a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., the House voted it down. Another significant difference between the base bill and the amendment centers on the N.S.A.’s old practice of scanning Americans’ international emails and other internet messages and collecting those that mention a foreign target — but are neither to nor from that target. The technique came to light amid the Snowden leaks and ended last year. Such collection is technically complex, and the N.S.A. shut it down after repeatedly running into trouble adhering to limits imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. But the agency wants to retain the flexibility to turn it back on. The base bill would permit it to do so after briefing the congressional intelligence committees. The amendment would ban the practice. "
27,"I met Steve Bannon for the first time in September 2013 at the so-called Breitbart Embassy on Capitol Hill in Washington. I had spent the better part of the previous seven years working for Republican members of Congress before making the leap to start my own public relations firm. Like anyone starting a business, I was eager to find clients. In Breitbart I had a media platform at my disposal to attract a stable. Before that meeting, I had never met or even heard of Steve, and so I approached it with an open mind. But as I would come to learn over the course of two years working with him closely, his character and temperament made his stunning fall over the past few days inevitable. In that first meeting, Steve described his ambitious vision for Breitbart. He wanted to seize on the social media revolution to create a central digital destination for conservatives. His observation — entirely correct — was that the center-right media universe was fractured and underserved by the mainstream media. The Tea Party movement that swept unconventional Republicans into office in 2010 represented a turning point that upended the establishment, and Steve wanted to use Breitbart to tap into that movement. Steve might have looked unkempt, but his energy, precision, clarity and certainty were impressive. I agreed with his overall observations about the media environment and the change in the Republican Party. So I joined the team. I would be Breitbart’s media consultant, promoting stories written, Steve assured me, by a world-class team of reporters. If Breitbart had an exclusive interview with a policymaker, my mission was to make sure every political reporter and Capitol Hill press aide knew about it. Bannon was obsessive about wanting Breitbart scoops mentioned in the handful of daily morning email tipsheets that set the agenda for Washington, especially Mike Allen’s Politico Playbook. "
28,"Until Robert De Niro took the stage on Tuesday to introduce Meryl Streep at the National Board of Review awards gala, the night had largely been a ho-hum affair, lacking the drama of other events during film awards season, like the Golden Globes on Sunday. But past the evening’s two-hour mark, perhaps aware that the event wasn’t being televised, Mr. De Niro unleashed several profanity-laden asides directed at President Trump. He referred to the leader as a “fool” and an “idiot” (adding the same expletive each time), as well as the “baby-in-chief.” Politics were often front and center much of the night, even though anticipation was minimal because the winners, including Ms. Streep for “The Post,” were announced ahead of time. Mr. De Niro’s remarks were especially caustic, but criticism of Mr. Trump has become standard fare at Hollywood-centric events and several award recipients won applause when they condemned Mr. Trump’s treatment of the news media. The attention on Mr. Trump’s policies was contrasted with the emphasis at the Golden Globes, where efforts to combat sexual misconduct were the focal point. While many of Tuesday’s attendees wore black, missing were the Time’s Up pins seen just two nights before (one was spotted on Stephen Colbert, who was introducing Greta Gerwig for best director). Barely any of the speeches discussed the topic. Mr. De Niro was one of the few to make a glancing reference. “I am still fighting for Meryl to be able to get 79 cents of what a man would get to play Katharine Graham,” Mr. De Niro said. “It’s shameful, I know. The good news is that I think we’re at a watershed moment and it’s about time.” Ms. Streep, accepting best actress, started her speech with an ode to men. “I love men. Oh my God,” Ms. Streep said. “Yeah, I know it’s the year of the woman and everything, but oh my God. The men. All my mentors have been men.” Her film, about The Washington Post’s role in publishing the Pentagon Papers, also won best picture and best actor, for Tom Hanks. "
29,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Mudslides wreaked havoc in Southern California Tuesday amid intense rainfall across the state, demolishing homes in Santa Barbara County and killing at least 15 people. Just weeks ago, many of those areas hardest hit by mudslides were battling wildfires. Firefighters waded through debris, over piles of fallen trees and around displaced boulders in the aftermath of the storm, scouring for survivors after several homes were swept away. In one dramatic rescue, the Santa Barbara fire department pulled a 14-year-old girl from the remains of her destroyed home in Montecito. In another instance, a boy was found under a freeway overpass and rescued by firefighters; mud had carried him for hundreds of yards. [Follow The Times’ reporting here.] As rain pounded down, parts of the 101 Freeway were flooded by water from the overflowing Montecito Creek. “This is not a river. This is the 101 freeway in my neighborhood right now. Montecito needs your love and support,” the comedian Ellen DeGeneres tweeted. More coverage: • The search for victims in Montecito will continue Wednesday with more search and rescue teams joining the effort. "
30,"WASHINGTON — President Trump called the United States courts system “broken and unfair” on Wednesday, the morning after a federal judge’s ruling that ordered the administration to restart a program that shields young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. Republicans and Democrats are in the middle of a legislative battle over the program created by President Barack Obama, called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Lawmakers met with President Trump on Tuesday to discuss the program’s future. “We find this decision to be outrageous, especially in light of the president’s successful bipartisan meeting with House and Senate members at the White House on the same day,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement released Wednesday morning. Hours after the White House meeting, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco wrote that it was not proper to kill the program, and that the administration must “maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis” as the legal challenge to the president’s decision in September to end the program moves forward. Mr. Trump has previously criticized the courts system after judges have halted or held up his policy initiatives. Ms. Sanders said the fate of the program should be addressed by Congress. “President Trump is committed to the rule of law, and will work with members of both parties to reach a permanent solution that corrects the unconstitutional actions taken by the last administration,” Ms. Sanders said.

35,"WASHINGTON — President Trump declined on Wednesday to commit to being interviewed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating whether his campaign colluded with Russia to sway the 2016 election, backing off his statement last year that he would be willing to talk to Mr. Mueller under oath. “I’ll speak to attorneys,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference with Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, when asked whether he would agree to an interview. “We’ll see what happens.” That answer was a marked change from June, when Mr. Trump defended his firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, denying that it was related to his handling of the Russia investigation, and said he would be “100 percent” willing to give a sworn statement to Mr. Mueller. It came as the president’s advisers have been discussing whether Mr. Trump should submit to what would be an extraordinary but not unprecedented instance of a president being interviewed by a prosecutor investigating him for wrongdoing. Mr. Trump also repeated his criticism of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry as a “witch hunt” and the investigations being pursued by congressional committees as a “Democrat hoax.” In a Twitter post, he referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Senate committee conducting an investigation into Russian interference, as “Sneaky Dianne Feinstein.” “For 11 months, they’ve had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government, and it has hurt our government,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s a Democrat hoax that was brought up as an excuse for losing an election.” "
36,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea warned on Wednesday that North Korea would face stiffer sanctions if it resumed weapons tests, while crediting President Trump with helping force the North to resume dialogue and strike a broader agreement to improve Korean ties. “I am giving a lot of credit to President Trump,” Mr. Moon said at a nationally televised news conference a day after the two Koreas forged their agreement during border talks. “I am expressing my gratitude.” The White House said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Moon had spoken and “underscored the importance of continuing the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea,” adding that Mr. Trump “expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances.” Mr. Moon’s comments and his conversation with Mr. Trump suggested a tactful maneuver by the South Korean leader to stroke the ego of Mr. Trump, who has claimed credit for the inter-Korean dialogue, while easing fears in Washington and among his conservative critics at home that in his eagerness for dialogue, he may be too accommodating to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. In a post on Twitter last week, Mr. Trump asserted that North Korea had gone to the negotiating table because he had been “firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North.” Mr. Moon agreed on Wednesday that Mr. Kim’s decision to start a dialogue with the South could be a sign that the Trump administration’s policy of applying maximum sanctions and pressure was working. And he said South Korea and its allies must seize on the North’s renewed appetite for negotiations to persuade it to join broader talks involving the United States over how to end its rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program — an approach the North’s chief delegate to the border talks angrily rejected on Tuesday. Otherwise, North Korea made a surprisingly conciliatory gesture during the talks, promising to send a delegation of athletes, cheerleaders and journalists to the Winter Olympics being held next month in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang. The North also agreed to more talks with the South, including a dialogue between their militaries, to ease tensions and improve ties. This week’s talks, in the border village of Panmunjom, were the first governmental dialogue between the Koreas in more than two years, and the agreements they produced were hailed as a welcome reprieve for South Koreans after a year of talk of war over the North’s nuclear and long-range missile programs. But they also came amid concern that Mr. Moon might end up facilitating Mr. Kim’s strategy of fracturing the American-led sanctions campaign and driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington. Addressing such concerns, Mr. Moon said there was a limit to how far the two Koreas could go in improving ties if North Korea did not move toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program. ”The two issues — improving inter-Korean relations and resolving the North Korean nuclear issue — cannot be separated,” Mr. Moon said. “If the North provokes again or does not show sincerity on revising its nuclear problem, the international community will continue to apply even stronger sanctions and pressure.” “My government has no intention of easing sanctions unilaterally,” he added, dismissing speculation that he might lift some of the sanctions imposed by his conservative predecessors, like the closing of a joint factory park in the North Korean town of Kaesong. But Mr. Moon, a vocal critic of Washington’s plan to use military force to resolve the North’s nuclear threat, reiterated that the ultimate goal of sanctions and pressure must be to force North Korea to negotiate. He emphasized that his top national security and foreign policy goal was to prevent war on the Korean Peninsula. Since he took office last May, Mr. Moon has faced detractors at home, especially older and conservative South Koreans who fear he may concede too much to the North as he doggedly champions talks. Such concerns have persisted even as Mr. Moon has moved to build more powerful missiles and get new weapons from the United States to counter the North’s nuclear threat. Conservative South Koreans, as well as American policymakers, remain deeply skeptical of Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, who has accelerated the pace of nuclear and missile tests since taking power six years ago. In a New Year’s Day speech, Mr. Kim proposed dialogue with the South to discuss his country’s participation in the Pyeongchang Olympics, which Mr. Moon has called for repeatedly. But he wants North Korea to be accepted as a nuclear weapons state, even boasting in his speech that he now had a “button” in his office to launch nuclear missiles at the mainland United States. At the same time, he urged Koreans on both sides to work together for peace. During the border talks on Tuesday, the North’s top negotiator, Ri Son-kwon, categorically rejected the South’s attempt to discuss the nuclear issue, calling it “absurd” and warning that it could derail efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. He said North Korea’s nuclear weapons were not built to attack South Koreans, Chinese or Russians, but were “aimed solely at the United States.” For decades, North Korea has refused to discuss its nuclear weapons program with the South, insisting that it is an issue to be addressed only by it and the United States. On Tuesday, Canada and the United States will host a meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, of foreign ministers from countries that supported the United Nations-backed effort to repel North Korean forces after the 1950 invasion of South Korea. China said on Wednesday that it would not attend the meeting because not all of the main parties to the conflict would be in attendance. "

38,"On my pediatrics rotation in medical school, several residents told me they worked with children in part because they sometimes found themselves judging adults: Did they do drugs? Were they fat? Why did they drink so much? The idea that Americans should take personal responsibility for their health has recently received renewed attention. Vice President Mike Pence has argued for “bringing freedom and individual responsibility back to American health care.” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, expressed a more punitive view, saying, “That doesn’t mean we should take care of the person who sits at home, eats poorly, and gets diabetes.” The call for personal responsibility is not new, nor just conservative. Barack Obama said, “We’ve got to have the American people doing something about their own care.” Many Americans think it’s O.K. to ask people with unhealthy lifestyles to pay higher insurance premiums and deductibles.  Efforts to inject more personal responsibility into health care, however, have not consistently been shown to lower costs, improve outcomes or save lives. Effectiveness — or lack of it — is often in the eye of the partisan beholder. What does it actually mean to take personal responsibility for health? The basic idea is that if we adopt healthful lifestyles, are compliant patients and save money for our own medical care, we’ll feel better, spend less and reduce our burden on others. The details of how this philosophy is applied, however, get complicated: Which programs work and which are counterproductive? Does “personal responsibility” save money or just shift costs from insurers to patients? Who should judge whether we’re living a healthy enough lifestyle: Doctors? Insurers? Government? "
39,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction late Tuesday ordering the Trump administration to restart a program that protects immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. President Trump’s decision last year to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program led to a fierce debate over the future of the 800,000 immigrants who could face deportation starting in March. Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared open to a comprehensive deal that would grant millions of undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. That came as a surprise to lawmakers of both parties, and could alienate those who take a hard line on immigration. • Mr. Trump said he would “take the heat” for such an approach, presented at a meeting with members of Congress that “made clear once again that the details of governance do not really matter to him as much as success,” our chief White House correspondent writes. We looked at some of the key moments from the meeting. "
40,"Margaret Nash is a forensic engineer at a company that specializes in architectural restoration. “If there’s something wrong with a building, I’ll find it,” she said. Two years ago, her sense of discernment led her to the east Midtown neighborhood of Turtle Bay, where she and her boyfriend paid just under $400,000 for a studio in a 1930s co-op building on Second Avenue and East 50th Street. Without exactly boasting, Ms. Nash, 27, painted a dreamlike picture of her home. It has high, coffered ceilings and a sweeping view of the East River. The sunlight “just pours in, in the morning — it wakes me up,” she said. The 13-story building’s lobby is “old-school Art Deco” with a terra-cotta floor and stained-glass doors. An actual person runs the elevator. “We honestly fell in love with how clean everything was, not just in the building but in the neighborhood,” Ms. Nash, who had previously lived on the Upper East Side, went on. “You couldn’t see a speck of gum glued to the sidewalk.” Now she has a choice of three subway lines to her job in Chelsea. “You could throw a stone on Second Avenue and hit five different restaurants,” she said. “Everything you want is within a five-minute walk.” Ms. Nash’s starry-eyed vision of Turtle Bay, which extends from East 43rd to East 53rd Street and from Lexington Avenue to the East River, may have something to do with her status as a newcomer. Residents of longer standing say they are wrestling with the neighborhood’s many changes. “Stores, particularly mom-and-pop shops that I relied on for years, are now replaced by banks and drugstores and Starbucks,” said Candi Obrentz, a product designer and consultant who has lived in Turtle Bay since 1995 and runs her businesses from her one-bedroom apartment on East 49th Street, for which she pays $3,200 a month.

42,"THE RUINED HOUSE
By Ruby Namdar
Translated by Hillel Halkin
514 pp. Harper. $29.99. It’s been a season of reckoning for our high priests, as one after another, in the film industry, journalism, politics, academia and other fields, have been judged and sometimes punished for their sins. How eerie that Ruby Namdar’s strange and exhilarating novel, “The Ruined House,” should appear in English translation just now. Namdar wrote the book, his second, in his native Hebrew, and received Israel’s most lucrative literary award, the Sapir Prize, for it a few years ago. Having lived in New York for decades, he was the first expatriate ever to gain that particular honor, and it looks as if he’ll remain the only one: After his win, the rules were shamefully changed to exclude those who live abroad. It’s just coincidental timing, then, that the novel centers on the sort of American high priest who has recently come under long overdue scrutiny. In “The Ruined House,” he’s the kind of 50-something Jewish New Yorker who publishes his essays in The New Yorker, occupies an impeccable Upper West Side apartment and leads seminars on “comparative culture” at N.Y.U. You can probably already picture him, this elegant Andrew P. Cohen, down to “the old-fashioned watch on his left wrist, the cartoonishly heavy-framed reading glasses, the Warholian shock of hair with its playful wink of gray.” We follow Andrew as he floats through his putatively enviable life, preparing for classes, visiting the mother of his 26-year-old Chinese-American girlfriend, schmoozing the slick president of N.Y.U. He shuttles between the Hamptons and gallery openings, treating himself to cappuccino and biscotti and almond croissants at “those sexy bakeries that have been opening all over.” True to type, Andrew surrounds himself with admiring women he has selected because they will play their roles (ex-wife, girlfriend, daughter) without ever impinging upon his “personal and aesthetic independence.” Namdar skewers the man thoroughly as a hypocritical misogynist, phony scholar and petty narcissist. But Namdar’s deeper subject isn’t contemporary patriarchy and its discontents. Some critics have mistaken the book as continuing the tradition of Saul Bellow, Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud — whose names Namdar strategically drops, as red herrings — with Andrew just another Kepesh, Silk, Levin or Herzog. Namdar actually has less in common with those novelists, whose imaginations were largely secular, than with Cynthia Ozick, who has grappled with religious prohibition, or with the young Leonard Cohen, who harangued an audience in Montreal in 1964, telling them: “There is an awful truth which no Jewish writer investigates today.... It is this truth: We no longer believe we are holy.” As if in response to that howl, in “The Ruined House” ancient Jewish holiness bleeds, insistently, horrifically, into the present. The connection is hinted at from the start, in the Hebrew dates given in the chapter headings, which count “from the creation of the world”: The novel begins on Elul 6, 5760 (“which happened to fall on Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2000”), and ends on “The 1st of Tishrei, 5762” or “Sept. 18, 2001.” This indicates that Andrew’s story is being narrated, unusually, as part of the trajectory of the long Jewish past.

43,"Migrant shelters along the southern border are filling up again. Immigration lawyers in the region say their caseloads are spiking. Across the Southwest, border officers are stopping more than 1,000 people a day. Just months after border apprehensions hit a 17-year low, which administration officials proudly celebrated as a “Trump effect,” the number of migrants trying to enter the United States has been surging, surpassing 40,000 along the Southwest border last month, more than double the springtime numbers, according to new data from the Homeland Security Department. Many factors, including the Central American economy and gang violence, play a role in migration patterns. But it also appears that any deterrent effect of Mr. Trump’s tough talk and ramped-up immigration enforcement has begun to wane. In interviews, volunteers and lawyers along the border say that migrants and smugglers have stopped lying low, deciding that trying to get a foothold in a well-off and safe country was no riskier than in the past. “I think this was a ‘Let’s wait and see what’s going to happen’ period,” said Ruben Garcia, director of the Annunciation House, a shelter in El Paso that provides housing to recent border crossers as they search for more permanent places to live. Mr. Garcia pointed to the president’s plan to hire tens of thousands of border agents, which was announced in February but has yet to come to fruition because Congress still has not provided the funding. The same is true for Mr. Trump’s centerpiece project, the border wall. "
44,"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — Nearly a year into the Trump administration, mentions of climate change have been systematically removed, altered or played down on websites across the federal government, according to a report made public Wednesday. The findings of the report, by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, an international coalition of researchers and activist groups, are in keeping with the policies of a president who has proudly pursued an agenda of repealing environmental regulations, opening protected lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, shrinking the boundaries of federal monuments, and appointing top officials who have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change. The authors of the study said that the removal of the words “climate change” from government websites, and a widespread effort to delete or bury information on climate change programs, would quite likely have a detrimental impact.

At the end of a good-natured interview on “The Late Show” on Tuesday, Stephen Colbert asked James Franco to address the elephant in the room: allegations of sexual improprieties that had surfaced since Sunday. [Update: 2 women say James Franco’s acting school exploited them.] During Mr. Franco’s appearance at the Golden Globes, where he won for his lead role in “The Disaster Artist,” multiple women suggested on social media that he should not have been wearing a “Time’s Up” pin in solidarity with victims of gender inequality. The actress Ally Sheedy tweeted that he was an example of “why I left the film/tv business,” though she later removed the message. When Mr. Colbert asked for a response, Mr. Franco focused on the broader movement for gender equality, then denied any suggestion that he had acted improperly. “First of all, I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy,” he said. “I directed her in a play Off Broadway, I had nothing but a great time with her, total respect for her. I have no idea why she was upset.” "

47,"In the fall of 2014, Oprah Winfrey ran a “transformative two-day live event,” a traveling roadshow that was held in eight cities around the country. For this interactive revival-tent experience, she was joined by her “handpicked life trailblazers,” authors and personalities whose work she considered essential for the theme of the roadshow, “The Life You Want.” The trailblazers included, among others, Iyanla Vanzant, a spiritual teacher of New Thought, a 19th-century movement with links to Christian Science that emphasizes the idea of God as “infinite intelligence” and the human capacity to think our way toward godlike power … Rob Bell, an erstwhile evangelical megachurch pastor who has reinvented himself as an itinerant preacher of the vaguest sort of Christianity … Elizabeth Gilbert, author of “Eat Pray Love,” the megaselling memoir about finding religious ecstasy in India (as well as great pasta in Italy and a hot romance in Bali) … Mark Nepo, the poet-philosopher author of “The Book of Awakening” and other tracts on the spirituality of the everyday … and of course Deepak Chopra, the aging prince of the New Age. I list these figures and their theologies because in all the thousands of words that the political press has written about Oprah since her Golden Globes speech on Sunday night invited 2020 presidential speculation, there has not been nearly enough focus on the most important aspect of Oprah’s public persona, the crucial and fascinating role she really occupies in American life. We’ve heard about Oprah the entrepreneur, Oprah the celebrity, Oprah the champion of holistic medicine and the enabler of anti-vaccine paranoia, even Oprah the neoliberal (don’t ask). But though she is entrepreneurial and rich, Oprah is not Jeff Bezos; though she is famous, she is not the Rock; though she has elevated various dubious approaches to wellness, she is not Gwyneth Paltrow. Instead, her essential celebrity is much closer to the celebrity of Pope Francis or Billy Graham. She is a preacher, a spiritual guru, a religious teacher, an apostle and a prophetess. Indeed, to the extent that there is a specifically American religion, a faith tradition all our own, Oprah has made herself its pope. In other columns I have suggested that American culture is divided between three broad approaches to religious questions: one traditional, one spiritual and one secular. The traditional approach takes various forms (Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Orthodox Jewish) but its instincts are creedal, confessional, dogmatic; it believes in a specific revelation, a specific authority and a specific holy book, and seeks to conform itself to teachings handed down from the religious past. The secular approach is post-religious, scientistic, convinced that the laboratory and the microscope will ultimately account for everything that matters, while hopefully justifying a liberal society’s still-somewhat-Christian moral commitments along the way.

48,"The proudest day of my life was when I was accepted to Stony Brook University — the school of my dreams. I didn’t open the letter right away, weighing the envelope in my hands. When I finally tore it open, I felt relief and exhilaration. I was one step closer to my dream of becoming a high school English teacher. My mom was the first person I told and the first person to congratulate me. We celebrated over lasagna she had made just for the occasion. It was a huge deal for us; I’m the first one in our family to go to college. But my dreams are in jeopardy now. On Monday, the Trump administration announced it was ending Temporary Protected Status for Salvadorans. T.P.S. is the program that has allowed my parents to live and work in this country with legal authorization for decades. The security once felt by my family — and about 200,000 other Salvadorans like us — has suddenly been ripped from under our feet. My acceptance and enrollment into college is as much a reflection of my parents’ hard work as it is my own. As two immigrants who fled El Salvador, they’ve always put me and my two sisters first. They’ve worked factory jobs for years, and when I was young they held several jobs at the same time. They coordinated their schedules to make sure that at least one of them was always home with us kids. All they wanted was a good education and a brighter future for their children. When I got into Stony Brook, I finally felt that I had something tangible to show my parents that justified their hard work and sacrifices. Now I’m a senior preparing to graduate in the fall, and I want nothing more than to have them at my graduation ceremony. I’m a United States citizen, as are my sisters. I first realized that my immigrant parents, who are not citizens, could be under attack during President Trump’s candidacy. Before that, I’d taken for granted that my parents would remain protected. After all, their family is here. Their jobs are here. Their friends are here. "

50,Good morning. Here’s what you need to know:

52,"Odvar Nordli, who stepped down as prime minister of Norway after a five-year term amid opposition over his Cold War agreement to stockpile United States weapons in his country, died on Tuesday in Oslo. He was 90. His death was announced by the Norwegian government, which said the cause was prostate cancer. Mr. Nordli, a career Labor Party politician who was prime minister from 1976 to 1981, supported full-employment programs and increased social welfare services while presiding over the expansion of Norway’s offshore oil production. In 1977, a blowout of a well disgorged tens of thousands of gallons of oil into the North Sea. But it was his actions as a staunch supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and as an advocate of heightened military security in Europe that largely alienated him from his party’s left wing. Opponents said his decision to let the United States store heavy weapons near the Soviet border would only increase tensions with Moscow. He resigned in 1981, citing health problems. Doctors had advised him to take a two-month break from politics, he said at the time, but he concluded that resignation would better serve his party’s interests. He was succeeded by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the first woman to serve as prime minister of a Scandinavian country. Erna Stolberg, the current prime minister, who was in Washington this week to meet with President Trump, described Mr. Nordli in a statement as “a central politician” from the post-World War II period. "
53,"Five months after announcing that they would reward some American city with a $1.6 billion car plant and 4,000 jobs, Toyota Motor and Mazda Motor said on Wednesday that they had a winner: Huntsville, Ala. Huntsville, home to a number of aerospace manufacturers, is the latest location in the Deep South to emerge as an auto-manufacturing hub. “This is indeed a great day in Alabama,” Gov. Kay Ivey said at a news conference in Montgomery. The two Japanese companies said the plant would open in 2021 and be capable of making 300,000 cars a year. In addition to direct employment, the factory is expected to create thousands of related jobs. Toyota’s chief executive, Akio Toyoda, said he was confident that the plant would be a “built-in-America success story.” Success is far from assured. New-vehicle sales in the United States fell 1.8 percent in 2017, to 17.2 million, ending a seven-year run of growth. Analysts forecast further declines in 2018 and 2019, a trend that would put pressure on automakers to cut rather than expand production. “Demand has leveled off, so now it’s a battle over market share,” said Ron Harbour, an auto manufacturing expert at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. “And somebody’s going to lose.” "
54,"Most people agree that the federal government should tackle public health crises, and there is a particular consensus about the current epidemic involving opioids. The White House announced last fall that President Trump was “mobilizing his entire administration to address drug addiction and opioid abuse by directing the declaration of a nationwide public health emergency to address the opioids crisis.” Yet as of today, there is no permanent head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The president’s nominee for “drug czar” to run the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy withdrew from consideration in October and no replacement has been named. The acting chief of staff and general counsel for that office was dismissed last month. All this as overdose deaths continue to rise faster than ever, killing some 64,000 people last year, making the opioid epidemic a top national priority. We need to rethink how the federal government carries out this mission. The Food and Drug Administration, in approving new opioid drugs, puts more opioids in the marketplace because these drugs meet the standards for safety and efficacy in treating certain forms of pain. But the more opioids there are in the marketplace, the greater the opportunity there is for abuse. The D.E.A. tries to curb the amount by limiting the number of pills that can be manufactured, but when the agency cracks down on one form of the drug, opioid addicts move to other forms to sustain their addiction. Playing Whac-a-Mole is hardly a strategy. White House czars are largely ineffective because they do not control the agency heads who are legally responsible for carrying out the various congressional mandates of the czars. Historically, the relevant agency heads don’t pay much attention to czars. There is a world of difference between someone whose authority is to coordinate and someone who has the true authority to impose change. Moreover, the president’s drug control policy office has been more heavily focused on law enforcement than on public health strategies. The many federal agencies that work on this crisis live largely in their own worlds. Funding for opioid-related activities is under the control of multiple departments, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, both of which are criticized as operating with blinders with respect to coordination and accountability. "
55,"Federal immigration agents descended on dozens of 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country before daybreak on Wednesday, arresting undocumented workers and demanding paperwork from managers, in what the Trump administration described as its largest enforcement operation against employers so far. The sweeps of 98 stores in 17 states, from California to Florida, resulted in 21 arrests, according to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which signaled intensified efforts against businesses that hire unauthorized workers. “Today’s actions send a strong message to U.S. businesses that hire and employ an illegal work force: ICE will enforce the law, and if you are found to be breaking the law, you will be held accountable,” Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of the agency, said in a statement. Mr. Homan, the nation’s top immigration-enforcement official, has promised more scrutiny of businesses that knowingly violate federal laws requiring employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of their workers. Under President Trump, ICE has significantly expanded immigration enforcement, arresting undocumented immigrants in their homes or when they check in with federal agents as part of immigration court cases. In a statement, 7-Eleven Inc., based in Irving, Tex., distanced itself from the situation, saying that the individual stores are franchises that belong to independent business owners, who “are solely responsible for their employees, including deciding who to hire and verifying their eligibility to work in the United States.” “7-Eleven takes compliance with immigration laws seriously and has terminated the franchise agreements of franchisees convicted of violating these laws,” the company said. If ICE hoped to make a bold statement, it could hardly pick a more iconic target than 7-Eleven, a chain known for ubiquitous stores that are open all the time and sell the much-loved Slurpees and Big Gulps. Many a 7-Eleven franchise has been a steppingstone for new legal immigrants who want to own and run their own small businesses. Not all franchisees have been scrupulous about whom they hire. ICE called its Wednesday sweep a “follow-up” of a 2013 investigation that resulted in the arrests of nine 7-Eleven franchise owners and managers on Long Island and in Virginia on charges of employing undocumented workers. Several have pleaded guilty and forfeited their franchises, and have been ordered to pay millions of dollars in back wages owed to the workers. “This definitely sends a message to employers,” said Ira Mehlman, the spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors more limits on immigration and stricter enforcement. According to ICE, federal agents served inspection notices to 7-Eleven franchises in California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington State and Washington, D.C. Employees at two 7-Eleven stores on Staten Island said that immigration agents visited the stores on Wednesday. But the agents were shown valid employment records with Social Security numbers, two workers at each of the stores said, and no one was arrested. In all, 16 of the 98 stores visited on Wednesday were in the New York City area, according to an ICE spokeswoman, Rachael Yong Yow, who would not specify their locations. In Miami Beach, an employee at one 7-Eleven said that while no agents showed up at her store, her boss asked workers to make sure their employment records were up to date, in case ICE continued its visits. Agents dropped in on 7-Eleven stores in seven cities in southeast Florida, including Miami Beach, according to Nestor Yglesias, an ICE spokesman; he, too, declined to identify specific stores. Under President George W. Bush, ICE grabbed headlines by rounding up unauthorized workers at meatpacking plants, fruit suppliers, carwashes and residences. In a shift, the agency under President Barack Obama focused on catching border crossers, deporting convicted criminals and pursuing employers on paper, by inspecting the I-9 forms that employers are required to fill out and keep to verify their workers’ eligibility. By targeting 7-Eleven franchisees and their workers on Wednesday, ICE under Mr. Trump appeared to be melding the approaches of his two predecessors: Go after employers while also detaining employees whom agents encountered without work authorization. One of the biggest workplace immigration raids, in May 2008, resulted in the detention of nearly 400 undocumented immigrants, including several children, at an Iowa meatpacking plant. Sholom Rubashkin, the chief executive of the Agriprocessors plant, which was then the largest kosher meatpacking operation in the country, was eventually convicted of bank fraud in federal court. President Trump commuted Mr. Rubashkin’s 27-year prison sentence last month, after years of lobbying by a number of prominent lawyers and politicians who considered his term unduly harsh, and perhaps even anti-Semitic. "
56,"It started with a tweet on Tuesday afternoon. By Wednesday morning, five writers were said to have pulled stories planned for future issues of Harper’s Magazine — an effort to pressure the magazine not to reveal the name of the woman who first assembled a Google spreadsheet listing men in the media industry accused of sexually inappropriate behavior. And by Wednesday night, after hours of debate about the matter on social media, there was a surprising turn: The woman whose identity the campaign had sought to protect revealed herself in a first-person essay on New York magazine’s web vertical The Cut. At issue was an article Harper’s had scheduled for the March edition written by the essayist Katie Roiphe. Writers and editors posted on Twitter that the article would reveal the identity of a person who had created the spreadsheet, first circulated in October, that identified men who were said to have acted in a predatory manner toward women. The spreadsheet, called Shitty Media Men, lists the names of 70 men in the industry, along with allegations against them ranging from questionable behavior to rape. The list comes with a disclaimer advising readers to take its contents with a grain of salt, since some of the material was described as “rumors.” The document includes the names of some men who have been fired from media jobs since it was first shared. In an email interview on Tuesday, Ms. Roiphe said her article did not name the woman who started the list. "
57,"The women of Hollywood have every reason to view the Golden Globes as a smashing success. Their Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment wholly defined and stole the show, eclipsing such trivial matters as who exactly won which award. Instead, the big stories of the night were the women’s rousing speeches, snarky digs, activist arm candy and swishy all-black garb, which, not that it was supposed to matter, made for an especially glam red carpet. Sure, the men kept largely mum about Time’s Up once they got onstage, despite professing solidarity on the red carpet and backstage, bedecked in Time’s Up lapel pins and black shirts. Several male winners said they felt they should just listen, though why they didn’t acknowledge as much from the stage remains an open question. Best-case scenario: They genuinely believed silence was golden. Worst: It didn’t cross their minds or they didn’t care. Likeliest (allowing benefit of the doubt): They were scared. Moving forward, there are questions. How can women keep up the momentum, and will they? And, how can the Oscars possibly top this? The Bagger’s guesses: The momentum will be hard to maintain, but not impossible. And the Oscars, which Jimmy Kimmel is set to host again, will probably fall short, now that the bar has been set high. At Golden Globes after-parties, several women involved in Time’s Up said that while their activist work would carry on strong, they didn’t know (or perhaps weren’t willing to say) what may be in store for the Oscars. There is no doubt that the punch they packed at the Globes benefited from timing, and the elements of freshness and surprise. "
58,"If Omar Vizquel had hit 400 home runs, no one would be debating his Hall of Fame credentials. Marrying that offensive figure with his stellar defensive reputation would have rubber-stamped his induction this year, his first on the ballot. But for all of the acclaim Vizquel earned for his play at shortstop over a 24-year career — including 11 Gold Glove Awards — advanced statistics say he never had a season as baseball’s top defensive player. He came close, finishing second in the majors in defensive wins above replacement in 1993, but never reached the top. There is, however, another first-time Hall of Fame candidate who had an extended run as one of the game’s top defenders, including at least one season as baseball’s best over all: Andruw Jones, who at his peak, as a center fielder for the Atlanta Braves, delivered some of the most impressive defensive seasons of any player in history while, almost as an aside, clubbing 434 career home runs. In other sports, it would be unthinkable to overlook a player so respected for defensive excellence. Deion Sanders became a first-ballot Hall of Famer in pro football. Dennis Rodman sailed into the Basketball Hall of Fame with a hearty endorsement from Michael Jordan. But despite having at least as many qualifications as Vizquel — and many other Hall of Fame candidates this year — Jones is getting very little support in his first year of eligibility, according to Ryan Thibodaux’s tracking of Hall of Fame balloting. Jones, who won 10 Gold Gloves, all in a row, from 1998 to 2007, was named on nine of the 178 ballots that had been made public on Thibodaux’s website as of Wednesday morning. Vizquel, whose offensive credentials pale next to Jones’s, was named on 53 ballots. If Jones had one fewer vote, he would be sitting below the 5 percent threshold for returning on the next Hall of Fame ballot. The contrast between Jones’s reputation among his peers and the voters is, to put it mildly, stark. “With all due respect to Willie Mays, who I never saw play, Andruw Jones is the best center fielder in our generation,” said Tom Glavine, the Hall of Fame pitcher who was Jones’s teammate for seven years in Atlanta. "
59,"To the Editor: Re “With Red Tape Losing Its Grip, Firms Ante Up” (front page, Jan. 2): The examples cited as producing a “wave of optimism” that has “swept over American business leaders” show exactly why we should not set policy based on the preferences of corporate chiefs. The article’s examples of regulations to be overturned include limiting mining debris in streams; requiring broadband providers to obtain permission from customers to collect and use online information; banning plastic bottles from national parks, and restricting housing development in wetlands. The prospect of removing this “red tape” is, according to a Moody’s economist, “lifting everyone’s spirits.” Not mine. Every one of these changes would have the effect of increasing short-term profits at long-term cost to us all. It is the job of government to weigh all factors and write rules that do not overly constrain business plans, but whose primary motivation is to consider the consequences to society as a whole. The views of corporations are just one highly self-interested pole of that debate; only regulation can balance their incentives away from short-term profit. WILLIAM S. KESSLER, SEATTLE The writer, an oceanographer, is an affiliate professor at the University of Washington. To the Editor: There seems to be almost total amnesia about the harm that deregulation can do to the economy. Didn’t something important happen in 2008? And what was the primary driver of that cataclysm? Financial deregulation. And, yes, when it was happening, it was heartily welcomed by financial industry leaders. Maybe we should look elsewhere for guidance this time. DAN IMMERGLUCK, ATLANTA The writer is the author of “Preventing the Next Mortgage Crisis: The Meltdown, the Federal Response and the Future of Housing in America.” To the Editor: The “trickle down” theory underlying the Republicans’ irresponsible tax overhaul had a famous moment of shame in November when a gathering of chief executives admitted that few of them would invest any resulting savings in their companies. The Trump administration’s deregulatory policy is cut from that same discredited cloth. Why should we expect different results? And as with the tax overhaul, the assault on public safeguards is dangerously regressive. As the White House and agencies let chief executives and companies off the hook for endangering Americans, it will be ordinary working families bearing the costs of regulatory rollbacks and delays — through more frequent asthma attacks, missed work days, preventable cancers and so on. Climate change, the opioid epidemic, the myriad harmful chemicals in consumer products and countless other threats to our quality of life won’t go away just because the Trump administration shifts the burden of these hazards from the companies that create them to the public at large. MATTHEW SHUDTZ, WASHINGTON The writer is executive director of the Center for Progressive Reform. "
60,"President Trump on Wednesday repeated a pledge to make it easier for people to sue news organizations and publishers for defamation, denouncing the country’s libel laws as a “sham” a day after his personal lawyer filed a lawsuit against a major media outlet, BuzzFeed News. The salvo from Mr. Trump, who has long expressed hostility toward traditional press freedoms, followed a days-long effort by him and his team to undercut the unflattering portrayal of the White House in a new book by the writer Michael Wolff. “We are going to take a strong look at our country’s libel laws, so that when somebody says something that is false and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts,” Mr. Trump said during a public portion of a cabinet meeting in the White House. The president added, “Our current libel laws are a sham and a disgrace and do not represent American values or American fairness.” First Amendment lawyers were quick to point out that Mr. Trump has little power to modify those laws, barring a Supreme Court appeal or constitutional amendment. Other libel laws are determined at the state level, where Mr. Trump, as president, has no direct influence. “President Trump’s threat to revise our country’s libel laws is, frankly, not credible,” the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr. Trump’s remarks reflected a broader frustration in his inner circle over critical coverage in recent days that has cast him as an erratic and ill-prepared commander in chief. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, filed a defamation lawsuit against BuzzFeed News for publishing, last January, a salacious and mostly unsubstantiated intelligence dossier that purported to describe how Russia had aided the Trump campaign. The dossier characterized Mr. Cohen as a central figure in what it described as a globe-spanning conspiracy. Mr. Cohen also filed a separate suit in federal court against Fusion GPS, the research firm that prepared the dossier. Fusion GPS and BuzzFeed both said they would aggressively defend themselves against the suits. Last week, a lawyer working on Mr. Trump’s behalf, Charles J. Harder of Harder Mirell & Abrams in Beverly Hills, Calif., sent an 11-page cease-and-desist letter to the publisher of Mr. Wolff’s book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.” Mr. Harder’s letter demanded that the publisher, Henry Holt and Company, withdraw the book from stores and apologize; the publisher responded by moving up the book’s release date and increasing its first print run to one million copies, from 150,000. Mr. Trump’s remarks on Wednesday about libel law seemed, at times, to refer obliquely to the book, which debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list, and has provided fodder for dozens of news articles, opinion pieces and cable news segments. “We want fairness,” the president said. “Can’t say things that are false, knowingly false, and be able to smile as money pours into your bank account. We are going to take a very, very strong look at that, and I think what the American people want to see is fairness.” As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump made sport of the reporters who stood in fenced-off areas during his speeches, often whipping up the crowd against them. He also said on the campaign trail that he would “open up” the country’s libel laws — although he later backed off that pledge in an interview with editors and writers at The Times, joking that he personally might be in trouble if the laws were loosened. “Somebody said to me on that, they said, ‘You know, it’s a great idea softening up those laws, but you may get sued a lot more,’” Mr. Trump, who propagated false rumors that Barack Obama was born in Africa and that the father of Senator Ted Cruz had aided the assassination of John F. Kennedy, said at the time. Mr. Trump is no stranger to defamation claims, having filed several of them himself, without success. In 2009, a New Jersey judge dismissed a $5 billion suit brought by Mr. Trump against a biographer, Timothy L. O’Brien; Mr. Trump had claimed that Mr. O’Brien understated his personal wealth. The president’s comments about the news media on Wednesday also extended to one of his favorite punching bags: network news. He taunted the television reporters in the room, saying they were dependent on his activities for ratings. “If Trump doesn’t win in three years, they’re all out of business,” the president said. “You’re all out of business.” He also claimed that network anchors had sent him “letters of congratulations” on Tuesday about a meeting with lawmakers that was broadcast on television that day. “A lot of those anchors sent us letters saying that was one of the greatest meetings they’ve ever witnessed,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he had received “about two hours” of positive coverage from news networks, “and then they went a little bit south on us.” (White House aides said later that the “letters” in question referred to complimentary tweets from journalists.) “They probably wish they didn’t send us those letter of congratulations, but it was good,” Mr. Trump added. “I’m sure their ratings were fantastic.” "
61,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • On a visit to China, President Emmanuel Macron of France and his host, President Xi Jinping, sought to provide alternatives to the strident nationalism of President Trump: They denounced protectionism and embraced cooperation to combat climate change.

Ninety years ago this month, Leon Trotsky, above, one of the early leaders of the Communist Party, was exiled by his rival Joseph Stalin to what is now Kazakhstan, clearing the way for Stalin’s complete control of the Soviet Union. An ever-wandering revolutionary, Trotsky was no stranger to exile. More than a decade before, in January 1917, The Times noted his arrival in New York City: a “Russian journalist and Socialist” who had been “expelled from four lands.” Trotsky and his family lived only briefly in New York — what he called “the city of prose and fantasy, of capitalist automatism, its streets a triumph of Cubism” — before he returned to Russia to help lead the Bolshevik Revolution. After the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924, Stalin and his faction propounded “socialism in one country.” Trotskyists bristled, calling for a “permanent revolution,” global in scope, and accused Stalin of betraying Lenin’s vision. The feud between Stalin and Trotsky would culminate in the anti-Trotskyist show trials in Moscow and the terrifying purges of the 1930s. It ended in Mexico City, where Trotsky settled, when he was killed by an ax-wielding assassin in 1940.

62,"Two political scientists specializing in how democracies decay and die have compiled four warning signs to determine if a political leader is a dangerous authoritarian: 1. The leader shows only a weak commitment to democratic rules. 2. He or she denies the legitimacy of opponents. 3. He or she tolerates violence. 4. He or she shows some willingness to curb civil liberties or the media. “A politician who meets even one of these criteria is cause for concern,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, both professors at Harvard, write in their important new book, “How Democracies Die,” which will be released next week. “With the exception of Richard Nixon, no major-party presidential candidate met even one of these four criteria over the last century,” they say, which sounds reassuring. Unfortunately, they have one update: “Donald Trump met them all.” We tend to assume that the threat to democracies comes from coups or violent revolutions, but the authors say that in modern times, democracies are more likely to wither at the hands of insiders who gain power initially through elections. That’s what happened, to one degree or another, in Russia, the Philippines, Turkey, Venezuela, Ecuador, Hungary, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, Poland and Peru. Venezuela was a relatively prosperous democracy, for example, when the populist demagogue Hugo Chávez tapped the frustrations of ordinary citizens to be elected president in 1998. A survey that year found that the Venezuelan public overwhelmingly believed that “democracy is always the best form of government,” with only one-quarter saying that authoritarianism is sometimes preferable. Yet against their will, Venezuelans slid into autocracy. "
63,"To the Editor: Re “G.O.P. Senators Pursuing Author of File on Trump” (front page, Jan. 6): Instead of putting party over country in an attempt to discredit a government source and longtime intelligence ally in Christopher Steele, a former British agent, Senators Lindsey Graham and Charles Grassley would serve their judicial oversight roles and the American public better by working with their colleagues to investigate the Russian attack on our political system. Since Mr. Steele did bring the findings of his research to the F.B.I. because he was concerned that Kremlin interference was a threat to our election, senators serious about judicial oversight should be grateful for his information, not referring him to the Justice Department for criminal investigation. After all, had any of the members of Mr. Trump’s campaign gone to the F.B.I. when they first discovered that the Kremlin wanted to help Mr. Trump win the election, our country might not be in this mess now.

64,"To the Editor: Re “Attacks on Mueller and F.B.I. Open a Rift in the Party of Law and Order” (news article, Dec. 30): As a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I would like to address claims about the supposed bias at the F.B.I. I questioned the deputy F.B.I. director, Andrew McCabe, in a closed committee session. While the discussion was confidential, I can assure you that the men and women at the bureau are dedicated public servants committed to defending the American people and upholding the law. Firing the special counsel, Robert Mueller, would cross a line that congressional leaders in both parties have made clear. Instead, the president’s team is attacking the credibility of Mr. Mueller and the F.B.I. in what appears to be an attempt to sow doubt about Mr. Mueller’s eventual findings. These attacks are beyond the scope of normal political dialogue and raise a profound question: What is the president’s team afraid of? Mr. Mueller must be allowed to continue unimpeded. The American people deserve no less. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI

The New York theater is obligingly presenting a host of deliberately disorienting productions from an international array of artists this month, in works designed to rearrange your mind and shake up your senses. Fixed notions of nationality, gender and race are being deconstructed and detonated in one of the liveliest lineups of brave new plays in many a season. Here, a quintet of iconoclastic eye-openers to help you focus on the future. For the Italian troupe Motus, boundaries aren’t made for crossing, but for erasing altogether. Two years ago, this genre-blending company confounded and elated downtown audiences with “MDLSX,” a mixed-media meltdown of gender-specific identity. Motus returns to one of its favorite haunts, La MaMa in the East Village, to consider the possibility of a world unfettered by nationalism — and, heck, even nationhood — in the sprawling performance piece “Panorama,” which suggests that to migrate is simply to do what comes naturally.

66,"WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, three federal judges in North Carolina threw out the state’s congressional map because it was “motivated by invidious partisan intent.” On Wednesday, another panel of judges in Pennsylvania upheld that state’s map, with one arguing that such a political issue was none of the courts’ business. The two competing federal rulings in partisan gerrymander cases this week underscore the courts’ angst over even getting involved in political decisions, much less overturning them. Both rulings are certain to draw the Supreme Court’s interest as it mulls a resolution to the gerrymandering question. The Court, with two other redistricting cases before it, is expected this spring to end a decades-long debate over when and if judges should make decisions that could reshape the country’s political landscape. “You’re seeing how much turmoil there is now in the lower federal courts, and how many federal judges believe the time has come for the courts to impose substantial limits” on partisan gerrymanders, said Richard H. Pildes, a scholar of the law of democracy at the New York University School of Law. Experts said that even if the Supreme Court chooses to limit partisan gerrymandering, federal judges are unlikely to force a redrawing of overly partisan maps in the middle of high-stakes midterm races. Legal observers said they believed the courts would put off requiring new maps until after the 2018 elections, or even until the next round of redistricting begins following the 2020 census. Still, the courts’ increased focus on the issue reflects the proliferation of extreme partisan gerrymanders — maps that do not merely hobble political opponents, but effectively doom them to permanent underrepresentation. And it points to growing concern that two tenets of American democracy — the concepts of majority rule and protecting the rights of minorities — are being supplanted by a third doctrine: the winner takes all.

threw off my Blundstone boots in the baggage claim area, swapping them out for flip-flops. The air-conditioning wheezed hello. We’d arrived back in Sydney just in time for an asphalt-melting heat wave, having left New York in the middle of a shark-freezing Arctic cyclone — and man, was I thrilled to be home. Because that, it seems, is where we landed: HOME. Many people take the concept for granted, but for those of us who move around the world to help explain the world, it’s a process of becoming. One minute a place is foreign and peculiar; the next, it’s familiar and magnetic, pulling us back when we look down from airplane windows. This is not the narrow definition of home.

Jim Banks in The Washington Examiner: Mr. Banks, a Republican congressman from Indiana, explains why he supports the decision by Congress to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The statute allows the government to continue conducting warrantless searches of communications of foreigners abroad, even when they are talking to American citizens. Mr. Banks argues that the provision is an “irreplaceable tool” crucial for the intelligence community to protect the nation. Moreover, he counters arguments that Section 702 compromises the privacy of Americans by explaining that it “is subject to extraordinary checks and balances, including oversight from all three branches of government.” Read more » _____ Willis L. Krumholz in The Federalist: Mr. Krumholz cites what he sees as abuses of Section 702 as an argument against reauthorization of the provision.

69,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday balked at an immigration deal that would include protections for people from Haiti and some nations in Africa, demanding to know at a White House meeting why he should accept immigrants from “shithole countries” rather than from places like Norway, according to people with direct knowledge of the conversation. Mr. Trump’s remarks, the latest example of his penchant for racially tinged remarks denigrating immigrants, left members of Congress from both parties attending the meeting in the Oval Office alarmed and mystified. He made them during a discussion of an emerging bipartisan deal to give legal status to immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children, those with knowledge of the conversation said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting. When Mr. Trump heard that Haitians were among those who would benefit from the proposed deal, he asked whether they could be left out of the plan, asking, “Why do we want people from Haiti here?” The comments were reminiscent of ones the president made last year in an Oval Office meeting with cabinet officials and administration aides, during which he complained about admitting Haitians to the country, saying that they all had AIDS, as well as Nigerians, who he said would never go back to their “huts,” according to officials who heard the statements in person or were briefed on the remarks by people who had. The White House vehemently denied last month that Mr. Trump made those remarks. In a written statement, Raj Shah, the White House deputy press secretary, did not deny the account of the meeting on Thursday or directly address Mr. Trump’s comments. “Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,” Mr. Shah said. “Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.” "
70,"To the Editor: Re “Is Mr. Trump Nuts?” (editorial, Jan. 11): If President Trump were clutching his chest or falling down repeatedly and the medical community were silent, the public would wonder what cardiologists and neurologists thought of the president’s physical health and why they were not speaking up. In your editorial you problematically argue that the perspective of the psychiatrist is simultaneously irrelevant because the “obvious” is being stated and dangerous because of public misunderstanding and stereotyping. But these are not the only possibilities. It is one thing for psychiatrists to assume the role of the armchair psychoanalyst, presuming to know the deep unconscious conflicts of our president without examining him. It is this kind of (mis)conduct for which the Goldwater Rule was put in place. It is quite a different situation for a psychiatrist to illuminate an aspect of President Trump based on his observable behavior and to raise legitimate concerns about his mental health. As a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst I do not presume to know why President Trump has trouble staying in reality. But I do know, and the public should as well, that decision making is seriously affected when “reality testing” is impaired, and the consequences can be catastrophic. This discourse is essential regardless of the practical impediments involved in having President Trump examined. It is a moral imperative and an act of conscience. It is also a public service — educating the electorate and daring to lift the veil of shame around mental suffering and its impact. The risk of misunderstanding and stereotyping is only exacerbated when mental health professionals are encouraged to be silent. LARRY S. SANDBERG, NEW YORK The writer is a clinical associate professor at Weill Cornell Medical College. "
71,"House Speaker Paul D. Ryan called electric vehicle tax credits “money wasted on losers.” The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said he’d “do away” with renewable energy subsidies. During the presidential election campaign, Donald J. Trump disparaged renewable energy as “very, very expensive” and “not working on a large scale.” He said a wind farm in California looked like a “junk yard” and claimed wind power killed birds in vast numbers. As president, he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change accord. So it’s no wonder that hardly anyone expected renewable energy subsidies to survive Republican tax reform. In the legislation the House of Representatives passed in November, Republicans drastically curtailed solar and wind power subsidies and put a stake in the heart of the tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles — all while preserving billions in subsidies for fossil fuels. Yet in the final tax bill Mr. Trump signed in December, there they are: the full panoply of tax incentives for renewable energy, as well as the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst for Morgan Stanley, called it a “surprise move” that suggests there may be deeper but little-recognized congressional support for electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them. Given that Tesla and General Motors are by far the top producers of electric vehicles, you’d expect their executives to be thrilled. G.M. has made a huge commitment to an electric vehicle future, and has pledged to have 20 new models on sale by 2023. It lobbied to preserve the incentives. "

73,"The historian, biographer and author, most recently, of “The Square and the Tower” owns books by people who have insulted him in print: “I do research before taking vengeance.” What books are  on your nightstand? I am a few pages from the end of Tom Holland’s marvelously readable “Rubicon” and about a quarter of the way through Mary Beard’s somewhat more earnest “SPQR.” Those were part of my challenge to myself this year to get better educated about the fall of the Roman Republic. I’m still dipping into Maya Jasanoff’s beautifully written travels in the footsteps of Conrad, “The Dawn Watch.” Newcomers to the nightstand, which were both recommended to me by friends: “China in Ten Words,” by Yu Hua and “Lives Other Than My Own,” by Emmanuel Carrère. Tell us about the last great book you read. Great in the sense of “up there with the Columbia Core”?I would nominate “2084,” by the Algerian writer Boualem Sansal. As a vision of Islamic totalitarianism, it is blood-chilling. But it is also a masterly piece of writing. What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? I was rather fascinated to read in Tom Holland’s book about Baiae, the Roman resort on the Gulf of Naples which was the Roman equivalent of the Hamptons or Malibu, complete with that combination of sexual libertinism and dietary epicureanism which I associate with certain members of today’s American elite. What’s the best book on economics? And the best work of economic history? The best book I’ve read recently on economics was probably Ian Kumekawa’s “The First Serious Optimist: A. C. Pigou and the Birth of Welfare Economics.” Amongst recent economic history books I would have to pick Chris Miller’s very insightful “The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy: Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapse of the USSR,” which shows why the Russians could not achieve in the 1980s what the Chinese did achieve, namely (partial) escape from the pathologies of the planned economy. Of course, economists and economic historians these days are discouraged from writing books. Most of what I consume in these fields comes in the form of working papers and journal articles. What books do you think best captures your own political principles? I suppose it would have to be Edmund Burke’s “Reflections on the Revolution in France.” I wish I could force-feed — or perhaps force-read — it to every progressive who is convinced that her latest untested and hare-brained policy initiative will magically eliminate inequality, discrimination, climate change and all the rest, without any unintended consequences for individual liberty.

76,"HONG KONG — Michael Wolff’s book about the Trump administration has been getting mixed reviews from critics and others, but it’s finding fulsome praise in one corner: North Korean state media, which says the book’s popularity “foretells Trump’s political demise.” The book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” has apparently made its way to the so-called hermit kingdom, giving more ammunition to a North Korean government already in a raging propaganda war with President Trump. “The anti-Trump book is sweeping all over the world so Trump is being massively humiliated worldwide,” said a commentary in the country’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper, which is run by the ruling Workers’ Party. The book has sold so well in the United States — 29,000 hardcover copies the first weekend — that retailers are having trouble keeping it in stock, and digital and audio sales have topped 350,000. Pirated copies of the book are already circulating online in Asia. Rodong Sinmun said those sales figures were no surprise, given the worldwide enmity toward Mr. Trump, who has belittled the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Little Rocket Man” and suggested that the dictator’s “nuclear button” is too small. “Voices calling for the impeachment of Trump are on the rise not only in the United States but also abroad,” the commentary said. “Since the book was published, it has triggered a debate on whether Trump is qualified to be president, even in Western Europe.” Mr. Trump has derided the book and its author, and has threatened legal action to halt its publication, a warning the publisher, Henry Holt and Company, brushed off while moving up the book’s publication date. The book portrays Mr. Trump as inattentive, surrounded by aides who belittle his intelligence and capabilities, and describes the president as presiding over a dysfunctional White House. The administration has characterized the book as a “complete fantasy” full of “tabloid gossip.” The North Korean commentary comes after the country has refrained in recent days from attacking Mr. Trump as it held negotiations with South Korea that paved the way for the North’s participation in the Winter Olympics in February in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Oddly, the North through its commentary was praising a book whose title may be rooted in Mr. Trump’s threat to annihilate the country. In August, Mr. Trump warned he would unleash “fire and fury” against North Korea if it ever endangered the United States. "
77,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department took the first step toward carrying out the $1.5 trillion Republican tax overhaul on Thursday, releasing new tax withholding tables and encouraging companies to incorporate them as soon as possible so workers can begin seeing bigger paychecks. The legislation was signed into law late last month after moving through Congress at a blistering pace, sending companies scrambling to determine how the changes affect not only their own taxes but also their workers’ taxes, since employers must withhold federal and state taxes from employees’ paychecks. On Thursday, the Treasury Department told companies that they should incorporate the new, lower withholding rates no later than Feb. 15. “Workers will see changes in their February paychecks once employers adopt the new guidance,” it said. Withholding rates, which are based on income, marital status, number of dependents and other factors, affect the amount that employees take home in their paychecks. The withholding tables are changing because the new tax law does away with personal exemptions, doubles the standard deduction and lowers marginal tax rates. In anticipation of potential confusion over the new system, the Internal Revenue Service will release a calculator at the end of February so that workers can more accurately estimate how much of their income should be withheld from their paychecks. Workers who have too little or too much withheld can face a tax bill or penalties. The Trump administration, which has promised that the new tax law will put money back in workers’ pockets, is eager to ensure that the transition to a new tax code does not devolve into chaos and to show evidence that taxpayers are faring better under the new law.

The canyon’s path to national park status began in the 1880s, when Senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana introduced several bills, but to no success. Later as president, he made it a forest reserve. President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed parts of it a federal game reserve and then established it as a national monument on this day in 1908. Five years earlier, on his first visit to Arizona (then still a territory), Roosevelt said he could not attempt to describe the Grand Canyon and implored people to preserve it. “You cannot improve on it; not a bit,” he said. Like Roosevelt, the environmentalist John Muir was left at a loss for words by the canyon’s beauty, writing in 1902 that no artist could do justice to its colors: “And if paint is of no effect, what hope lies in pen-work? Only this: some may be incited by it to go and see for themselves.” Jennifer Jett contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the European morning and is updated online.

80,Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change.     
81,"WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives voted on Thursday to extend the National Security Agency’s warrantless surveillance program for six years with minimal changes, rejecting a push by a bipartisan group of lawmakers to impose significant privacy limits when it sweeps up Americans’ emails and other personal communications. The vote, 256 to 164, centered on an expiring law that permits the government, without a warrant, to collect communications from United States companies like Google and AT&T of foreigners abroad — even when those targets are talking to Americans. Congress had enacted the law in 2008 to legalize a form of a once-secret warrantless surveillance program created after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Hours before the vote, President Trump set off last-minute turmoil as Republicans scrambled to secure enough support to extend the law without new privacy constraints. In a Twitter  post Thursday morning, shortly after “Fox & Friends” aired a segment discussing the issue, Mr. Trump expressed skepticism about government surveillance — even though a White House statement issued on Wednesday night urged Congress to block significant new constraints on the N.S.A. program. The legislation must still pass the Senate. But fewer senators appear to favor major change to spying laws, so the vote on Thursday in the House was the pivotal test. Effectively, the vote was almost certainly the end of a debate over 21st-century surveillance and privacy rights that broke out in 2013 after the leaks by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden. "
82,"People who bought policies from Centene, a large for-profit health insurance company, filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday claiming the company does not provide adequate access to doctors in 15 states. “Members have difficulty finding — and in many cases cannot find — medical providers,” who will accept patients covered under policies sold by Centene, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington State. “Centene misrepresents the number, location and existence of purported providers by listing physicians, medical groups and other providers — some of whom have specifically asked to be removed — as participants in their networks and by listing nurses and other non-physicians as primary care providers,” the lawsuit claims. People signed up for insurance and they “ discovered there were no doctors,” said Seth Lesser, a partner at the law firm of Klafter Olsen & Lesser who is representing some of the policyholders. A spokeswoman for Centene said that the company had not seen the lawsuit. “We believe our networks are adequate and we work in partnership with our states to ensure our networks are adequate and our members have access to high-quality health care,” she said in an email. Centene, which also provides coverage to low-income individuals under the government Medicaid program, has proved to be one of the mainstays of the Affordable Care Act. After many other large insurers abandoned the individual market created by the federal law and as President Trump has sought to dismantle the law, Centene doubled-down and has become one of the largest insurers still offering policies. "

84,"This week we enjoyed reading diverse opinions on whether astrology is real, if the extreme cold weather is enjoyable or miserable, how to go about reinventing oneself and what 2018 will bring. As always, we were informed, impressed and entertained by student comments on our writing prompts from around the country and the world. This week we want to especially note the students of San Francisco, El Dorado, Ark., and Wilmington, N.C., for their excellent contributions, and Derek Moore from Aruba, Coco Liu from Taipei, Taiwan, and Daniel Heininen from Israel for adding their global perspectives. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted. _________ Our most popular writing prompt this week asked: “Are You a Sneaker Head?” Hype beasts, shoe lovers and skeptics wrote in with their opinions on the sneaker craze. Josh V. from San Francisco was one of the many self-proclaimed sneaker heads who weighed in: Marco Sahagun from San Francisco reported the biggest collection: Brady Hoffacker from Wilmington, N.C., only recently joined this obsession: There were several commenters, like Rosser Baxley from Wilmington, N.C., who have become less devoted to the sneaker hype over time: And LHSGraciela from San Francisco, who wrote: Then, there were those who didn’t get the sneaker mania at all. Bradly Boaz from Wilmington, N.C., was impressed by the shoe collections in the article, but thought the hobby was wasteful: Vianney E from San Francisco suggested all that money spent on shoes could be put to better use: _________ Readers wrote in with their thoughts about the “Cold Weather” taking over many parts of the United States last week. Polaris Hall from Danvers High School in Massachusetts was surprised how much the cold affected her daily life: Tj Salvo from Danvers, Mass., agreed: But Jackson Spiers from Wilmington, N.C., was enjoying it: And Collin MacRae from Massachusetts was grateful that a frigid chill was the worst weather New England was facing this year: _________ We received impassioned responses from believers and nonbelievers alike for our Student Opinion question “Do You Believe in Astrology?” Hee Yun Chung from California was one such doubter: Voltron Thunderstorm from Wilmington was also disturbed by astrology’s recent rise in popularity: Others, though, put themselves in the category of astrology devotees. Like Maickel from New Jersey: And Sydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., who learned a lot about herself through studying the stars: And Julia Broderick from Danvers, Mass., who finds comfort in being able to explain the universe: Ethan Kim from California enjoys reading his horoscopes, but advised to take them with a grain of salt: _________ Students studied an illustration of “Social Media” to decipher what it says about our society.

85,"WASHINGTON — A probe into the Treasury Department’s role in crafting and assessing the Trump administration’s tax plan found no evidence of any improper political interference with the career tax staff, but cast doubt on whether the department’s robust economic growth projections were achievable.      "
86,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • House Republicans proposed a hard-line immigration policy on Wednesday that clashed with President Trump’s talk the day before of a bipartisan deal. The House proposal could complicate negotiations over government funding, which is scheduled to run out next Friday. Anxiously watching the debate are the “Dreamers,” the roughly 800,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who could soon face deportation. After a judge ordered the Trump administration to restart the program that protects the Dreamers, President Trump called the U.S. court system “broken and unfair.” • Also on Wednesday, federal agents raided 7-Eleven convenience stores in 17 states, arresting 21 people. The sweep was part of a growing effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement against businesses that hire unauthorized workers. "
87,"To the Editor: Re “Request to Check Citizenship Stirs Fears for Census” (news article, Jan. 3): It is with questionable motivation that the Justice Department is seeking to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census. But even giving the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt, whatever good intentions may underlie this request — acquiring more information, in theory, can be a good thing — a likely result is that many immigrants will fear participating in the census because of this administration’s words and deeds thus far addressing this group. In turn, this lower participation among immigrants will significantly affect both the redistribution of seats across states in the House of Representatives and the allocation of much federal spending that occurs every decade based on the most recent census. Clearly, here the practical considerations outweigh any theoretical benefits. There is a reason that the professionals at the Census Bureau have chosen to exclude a question of this sort, and the administration should not impose its political agenda on the bureau and compromise the accuracy of the census. NEIL G. BENNETT, NEW YORK The writer is the director of the CUNY Institute for Demographic Research. "

89,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Nuclear brinkmanship, belligerence and now a book review. North Korea had high praise for “Fire and Fury,” the tell-all book about the Trump administration’s early days. “Trump is being massively humiliated worldwide,” a commentary in the state news media said. Mr. Trump has derided the book and has threatened legal action to halt its publication. Separately, we looked at the case of Ma Xiaohong, who not long ago was the face of China’s trade with North Korea. After the U.S. accused Ms. Ma of helping the North evade sanctions, it is unclear what has become of her. _____ • In Washington, the House voted against restricting a surveillance program that permits the government to collect, without a warrant, the emails and other communications of foreigners abroad — even when they are talking to Americans. The vote was a victory for the Trump administration and the intelligence community as a bipartisan push to restrict the surveillance failed. The bill is expected to pass the Senate. President Trump’s approval rating has fallen across a range of demographic groups, including among those seen as his base, including white voters, evangelical Christians and rural Americans. _____ • Harper’s, the storied U.S. magazine, was under pressure not to reveal the identity of the creator of a list of men in the media industry accused of sexual harassment. Then the creator came forward. Moira Donegan said she created the list to allow women in the media to put in writing what many of them had long discussed in private: the names of men to stay away from. And reports that Mark Wahlberg made $1.5 million more than Michelle Williams for reshooting scenes from “All the Money in the World” have roiled Hollywood’s gender equality debate. _____ • “This was an attempt to take me away and turn me into a silent statistic.” That was Taha Siddiqui, above, a reporter and frequent critic of Pakistan’s military, who escaped an attack by a dozen men outside the capital, Islamabad. He escaped. But not everyone has. It has been open season on journalists in Pakistan for years now. Disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture, intimidation — and in the vast majority of cases, no one has ever been brought to justice. “My worry is that the next time they come for me,” Mr. Siddiqui said, “it could end up in something much worse.” _____ • Some good environmental news from northern China, where the skies have been an unlikely blue, above. Pollution in the capital and in 27 other northeastern cities has dropped 33 percent on average, compared with the last three months of 2016. In Beijing, pollution fell 53 percent. The drop indicated that the government’s antipollution campaign — announced in 2013 but accelerated last year for the Beijing area — has begun to show results. _____ • In western Indonesia, one of the largest populations of Asian elephants outside India is dwindling away. Along with habitat destruction, poaching is considered a major threat to the species. Now, wildlife groups are going undercover to help the police track down poachers and some are using unconventional means to save the animals. _____ • CES 2018: A smart refrigerator and a TV that can be rolled up like a yoga mat are among the highlights, but the real star of this year’s electronics trade show is artificial intelligence. • President Trump plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos this month.

Entertaining inmates — while taunting their guards — was tame compared with the other exploits of the Man in Black. In 1965, Mr. Cash accidentally started a forest fire in Southern California that burned hundreds of acres and decimated a population of endangered condors. (Mr. Cash told a judge, “I don’t care about your damn yellow buzzards.”) Later in life, he was attacked by an ostrich and almost died. In a dispute with his label in the 1980s, Mr. Cash released a parody called “Chicken in Black.” He called the track “intentionally atrocious,” but it was the most successful thing he’d done in years. (There’s even a video.) Mr. Cash, who died in 2003, was a Morse Code expert in the Air Force who eavesdropped on Soviet chatter. He was even an ordained minister, and wrote a novel, “The Man in White,” about the Apostle Paul.

90,"WASHINGTON — Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said on Thursday that he would not challenge the Democratic incumbent senator, Heidi Heitkamp, in this year’s midterm elections. It was just the latest indication of the difficulty Republicans are having recruiting candidates in what had looked to be a highly favorable climate in the wake of President Trump’s inauguration a year ago. Ms. Heitkamp is among 10 Democrats seeking re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mr. Cramer had been seen as a top-tier challenger in a state the president carried by 36 percentage points. He made his announcement during a North Dakota radio program. “This is shaping up to be a tough cycle for Republicans across the board,” said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor for The Cook Political Report who specializes in Senate races. “It only makes sense that recruiting is going to be difficult. For someone like Cramer, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to give up a safe seat for a difficult race in a lousy environment.” That assessment is an abrupt reversal of how most analysts saw the midterm landscape shaping up a year ago. Democrats are defending 24 seats, including those in states Mr. Trump won, compared with eight for Republicans. But the president’s chaotic first term has led to the lowest approval ratings for any first-term president at this time in his tenure in the history of polling, and he is now seen as a drag for many candidates. Two Independent senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, are also up for re-election. The environment also became hostile for Republicans who clashed with the president, and two of them, Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, surprisingly announced that they would not seek another term. Those states are now rated as tossups by The Cook Political Report. "
91,"Guess what? Donald Trump is a raving idiot. Every sentient person knows this, and if Michael Wolff is to be believed, so does most everyone in the White House. So why are we talking about Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury” as if it’s the news sensation of the decade? The answer lies in that timeless definition of the word “gossip”: Hearing something you like about someone you don’t. “Fire and Fury” is catnip for everyone who detests this president. Trump gorges on burgers in a bed he doesn’t share with his wife! He barely reads and constantly repeats himself! He has mastered the fine print in the Bill of Rights — all the way from the First to the Third Amendment! But gossip isn’t journalism. And Wolff’s book is Exhibit A in how not to damage Trump’s presidency, much less his chances of re-election. So much was apparent in Tuesday’s televised meeting of the president with congressional leaders to discuss immigration. This was not a good performance by past presidential standards: Trump seemed unable to grasp what a “clean” bill meant, or where Republicans stood on it. Oklahoma Senator James Lankford acknowledged as much when he said the meeting got “confusing.” Yet to a normal person casually tuning in, the president appeared reasonably affable and businesslike. He listened. He cracked an appropriate joke. He said he was prepared to defer to the wishes of Congress. Where was the drooling man-child we had been led to expect from Wolff’s book and the nonstop coverage of it? The net result is that “Fire and Fury” has so thoroughly succeeded in lowering public expectations for Trump that it makes it that much easier for him to exceed them. If the White House were smart it would tweet photos of Trump reading Dean Acheson’s “Present at the Creation” looking deeply engrossed. That should inspire a half-dozen Washington Times columns on how the press used to think Reagan and Eisenhower were boobs, too. That’s not all the damage Wolff has done. The president often misuses the term “fake news,” typically by treating every media mistake as evidence of willful and systematic mendacity. This may be enough to bamboozle his ardent supporters, even if the rest of us understand the distinction. In “Fire and Fury,” however, Trump really does have something resembling fake news. The book is replete with casual errors of fact. Invidious stories are unsourced or unverifiable or, on close inspection, simply nonsensical. It was written with white-hot venom. The book’s only truly credible voice, if credible is the right word, is the peerlessly self-serving Steve Bannon. The book also comes from a writer already accused of playing it fast and loose with the facts. Wolff may fancy that he stands alongside Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein by exposing the hidden intrigues of power. In truth, his book is like a movie “based on real events,” an exercise in the art of pleasingly plausible storytelling. Wolff’s book does more than just lend substance to the administration’s corrosive fake-news allegations. It brings out the worst in Trump’s critics, admittedly including me. Isn’t it vindicating to know that White House insiders take the same appalled view of the dim bulb in the Oval Office? Isn’t it just delicious to hear those words — “moron,” “dope,” “idiot” — whispered about the president by the grown-ups in the room? But if the anti-Trump movement has a crippling defect, it’s smugness, and Wolff’s book reflects and richly feeds it. We’re the moral scolds who struggle to acknowledge the skeletons in our own closet, the smart people whose forecasts keep proving wrong. We said Trump couldn’t win. That the stock market would never recover from his election. That he would blow up NATO. That the Middle East would erupt in violence when Jerusalem was recognized as Israel’s capital. The catastrophes haven’t happened, and maybe that’s just a matter of luck. But by constantly predicting doom and painting the White House in the darkest colors, anti-Trumpers have only helped the president. We have set an almost impossibly high bar for Trumpian failure. (Will anything less than provoking a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula suffice to convince Trump loyalists that he’s an unfit commander in chief?) We have increased the country’s tolerance for the president’s venial sins. And we have turned the “Resistance” into a byword for the hysterical and condescending ninnies of American politics. This is not a winning strategy. One of Trump’s underappreciated strengths is his sly command of irony, on display again last week when he tweeted that his two great assets in life were “mental stability and being, like, really smart.” Note the superfluous “like,” which is stupid when spoken but intended as humor when written. The president isn’t making a fool of himself. He’s having a laugh that’s part self-deprecation, part trolling, and actual wit. Misunderestimation has already been the political stock in trade of one two-term Republican president. I believe that Trump is ignorant, incurious, vain, gauche, bigoted, intemperate, bullying, suggestible, reckless and morally unfit for his office. But he’s not deficient in cunning, and that cunning deserves healthy respect from his political opponents. That Michael Wolff fails to appreciate it only shows who’s the biggest dope in “Fire and Fury.” "

93,"The new United States ambassador to the Netherlands refused on Wednesday to answer questions about his 2015 statement that politicians and cars had been burned by Muslims in the Netherlands, a claim he has not substantiated. “Do you now reach the conclusion that you were wrong when you stated that politicians and cars were being burned?” a reporter asked the ambassador, Peter Hoekstra, in his first news conference with Dutch journalists. “Was that a wrong remark, was it false?” “I issued a statement, I expressed my regrets and my apology for the comments that I made,” the ambassador replied. “And I am not revisiting the issue.” The ambassador, a former Republican congressman from Michigan who was appointed to the position in The Hague by President Trump, had referred in 2015 to “no-go zones,” erroneously suggesting there were Muslim-ruled enclaves in the Netherlands that are outside the government’s control. Reporters seeking clarification on Wednesday asked him about a half dozen follow up questions. “Are politicians being burned in the Netherlands in the past? Is that something you believe? Yes or no,” one asked. The ambassador repeated that he did not want to revisit the remarks and that he had expressed regrets. He then stopped replying, looking silently around the room as journalists continued to question him, according to a video published by The Associated Press. “Any example of a Dutch politician who is burned in recent years?” one reporter asked. “This is the Netherlands, you have to answer questions,” another said, as Mr. Hoekstra remained silent. “Please, this is not how it works,” another reporter said. On Friday, the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported that Mr. Hoekstra had acknowledged in an interview that he had made the controversial statement and that it had been “wrong.” Mr. Hoekstra made the original remarks at a conference hosted by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a conservative group, where he argued that the “Islamic movement” had plunged Europe into chaos. “Chaos in the Netherlands. There are cars being burned. There are politicians that are being burned,” Mr. Hoekstra said. “And yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.” The comments were captured on video, but Mr. Hoekstra denied ever having made them in an interview last month with Wouter Zwart, a reporter with the Dutch news program Nieuwsuur. “I didn’t say that. That is actually an incorrect statement,” Mr. Hoekstra told Mr. Zwart. “Yeah, we would call it fake news.” Shortly after that, in the same interview, Mr. Hoekstra denied having used the term “fake news.” After the interview, Mr. Hoekstra, who was born in the Netherlands but moved to the United States as a child, said in a statement that he had “made certain remarks” in 2015 and expressed “regret” for the exchange with Mr. Zwart. “Please accept my apology,” he wrote.

(AT&T, for instance, has roughly 200,000 employees who will likely benefit from that company’s $1,000-per-worker bonus.) "
96,"When you look across America to see where jobs and wages have been lost to robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and automation, it is the middle of the country that stands apart from the rest. The accompanying map, which was produced by Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, shows the size and scope of the region that has borne the brunt of postindustrial modernization. It is not a coincidence that this map sheds light on President Trump’s Electoral College victory in 2016. “My take is that grievances, both racial and against cosmopolitan, liberal elites, have played an important role,” Acemoglu wrote me in an email: Acemoglu argues that recent technological developments have helped drive voters to the right: In their March 2017 paper, “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets,” Acemoglu and Restrepo found that the addition of Who are the workers forced to bear the costs of the increase in workplace robots? According to Acemoglu and Restrepo, men take about twice as big a hit in terms of lost jobs as women do.

97,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Gov. Jerry Brown moved to bolster California’s “rainy day” fund Wednesday when he unveiled the final budget proposal of his administration in Sacramento, asking the Legislature not to take the state’s economic stability for granted, while also deflecting questions about his legacy. His message centered on a warning: “What’s out there is darkness, uncertainty, decline and recession. So good luck, baby,” he said with a smile. Flanked by blown-up cardboard graphs, he predicted that his successors would probably face an economic recession in the near future and said he was determined to minimize the damage. The $132 billion budget plan centered heavily on infusing the emergency fund with $5 billion in the coming fiscal year — bringing the total stash to $13.5 billion — in order to prevent layoffs and soften other painful budget cuts in a downturn. He and his team said the progress California has made since 2011, when it was teetering on the edge of financial catastrophe, is more reason to double-down on the emergency fund. Today the state has a $6.1 billion surplus. “Yes, we have had some very good years and program spending has steadily increased,” reads his opening message in the budget. “Let’s not blow it now.” There are several obstacles facing the governor before his term expires. Namely, brewing clashes with Republicans in Washington — over immigration, health care, and state and local tax deductions. Those could throw curveballs at the state’s budget in the years to come. "
98,"Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, waded into the bumpy waters of partisan politics on Thursday, announcing that it will use some of its savings under the new tax bill to provide wage increases, bonuses and expanded benefits to its hourly workers. The giant retailer, which faces stiff competition for qualified workers in a tight labor market and pressure from unions to increase wages, said it would raise its minimum starting wage to $11 an hour, from $9. It will also expand maternity and family leave benefits, and give bonuses of up to $1,000 to eligible employees. By tying its pay increases to the tax break it expects to receive, as other large companies have done in recent weeks, Walmart provided support for claims by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress that the new tax law will benefit not just the wealthy but also working-class Americans. “This law is helping improve people’s lives,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a tweet on Thursday, citing Walmart’s actions. But within hours, Walmart had undercut its triumphal message when news leaked that it was closing 63 of its Sam’s Club stores. Sam’s Club, a retail chain offering memberships, was soon trending on Twitter, and labor groups and Senate Democrats seized on the news to question Walmart’s motives and criticize the tax bill as failing to protect low-wage workers. "
99,"Twenty-seven billion dollars has gone missing on Wall Street. For more than a decade, the world’s top investment banks practically minted money from the buying and selling of bonds, currencies and other complex securities. For many banks, the business became their lifeblood. Now, a combination of tough regulations, new technologies, calm markets and changing customer behavior has left that type of trading a shadow of its former self — and much of Wall Street trying to redefine itself. Five years ago, fixed-income trading — so called because its keystone product, bonds, typically provides a fixed payout — generated nearly $103 billion in income for the top 12 investment banks, according to Coalition, a London research firm. By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion — down $27 billion from the peak. The accelerating losses are likely to be on display over the next week as the biggest United States banks report their annual results, starting with JPMorgan Chase on Friday. Some analysts predict that fixed-income revenue could fall another 20 percent this year. Some large banks, including Deutsche Bank, have already warned that the bond-trading blood bath will get worse. The trend is not only depriving giant investment banks of a staple income source. It is also altering the pecking order and business practices of Wall Street in profound ways. Nowhere is the shift more pronounced, or more painful, than at Goldman Sachs Group, not long ago regarded as the unrivaled king of Wall Street. These days, the bank is fighting to maintain an edge that has been blunted by the diminution of its core trading business. "
100,"One of the last official acts of New Jersey’s outgoing governor, Chris Christie, may be to have his cash-strapped statewide transit agency pay about $12 million to buy a maintenance facility for boats that it does not have. New Jersey Transit, the much-maligned operator of commuter trains and buses, wants to acquire the only remaining dry docks in Hoboken for the exclusive use of a privately held ferry company, New York Waterway. If the agency goes through with the purchase, it will do so over the strenuous objections of Hoboken’s new mayor, Ravinder S. Bhalla, and his predecessor, Dawn Zimmer, who is a member of the transition team of Mr. Christie’s successor, Philip D. Murphy. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, has chosen a commissioner of transportation who will chair the board of directors of New Jersey Transit as of next week. But that may be a few days too late for the plan’s opponents, many of whom want the waterfront site turned into a public park. The agency’s board had been scheduled to vote on the purchase on Wednesday morning, but that meeting was abruptly canceled and rescheduled, first for Friday and then for Monday, which will be Mr. Christie’s last full day as governor and is a state holiday. The postponement provided Mr. Bhalla and his allies with an additional 48 hours to try to block a sale that they say is a political favor to a successful company and an attempt to circumvent Hoboken’s ability to decide how land within its borders should be used. Mr. Bhalla called the postponed vote “a tremendous victory for Hoboken, and more important, for good government.” He said that “hitting the pause button on this rushed and ill-conceived plan” would allow New Jersey Transit, under new leadership, to reconsider the idea, using “a deliberative and transparent planning process that considers input from all stakeholders, including the public.” The delayed vote was just the latest twist in the long struggle for control of the last vestige of Hoboken’s industrial shoreline. Once lined with working docks teeming with longshoremen — a rough trade captured in the 1954 movie “On the Waterfront” — the city’s Hudson River waterfront is now lined with parks, luxury condominiums and office buildings. Long gone are the Bethlehem Steel shipyard, the Lipton tea factory and the Maxwell House coffee plant. Union Dry Dock was the last holdover. Ms. Zimmer had attempted to work out a deal to acquire the three-acre waterfront property where the company had operated a barge-repair facility for many years. But after those talks broke down last summer, Ms. Zimmer prepared to use the city’s power of eminent domain to take the site. New York Waterway, which operates ferry service between several terminals in New Jersey and Manhattan, surprised Ms. Zimmer and Mr. Bhalla by purchasing Union Dry Dock’s facility for $11.5 million in November. The ferry company, which has its home base just up the river in Weehawken, wants to use the site to repair, store and refuel its fleet of ferries. Hoboken has challenged New York Waterway’s permit application for the site with the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. The city has argued that the site would be much busier, with ferries coming and going most of the day to fill their gas tanks and unload wastewater. Even if Waterway received the permits it would need to operate there, Hoboken could try to use eminent domain. That is where New Jersey Transit comes in. As a state agency, its ownership would trump Hoboken’s power to take the property, city officials said. Although the transit agency does not operate any ferries of its own or have any control of Waterway or the fares it charges — as much as $9 for an eight-minute ride across the river — it is planning to buy the site and lease it back to the ferry company. Nancy Snyder, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit, said she could not divulge the terms of the proposed deal until after the board voted. There are five voting board members, including three who are allies of Mr. Christie, a Republican. Ms. Snyder said that the agency had statutory responsibility to embark on capital projects and make improvements that “support robust ferry service in the trans-Hudson corridor.” She added that “optimizing the availability and use of ferries will be a crucial part of a coordinated transportation strategy to meet future travel needs of New Jersey residents.” New Jersey Transit has relied on the ferry company to help get commuters across the Hudson when train service was disrupted, as it was for several weeks last summer. Pat Smith, a spokesman for Waterway, said the company would pay more than $100,000 in annual rent to New Jersey Transit and intended to invest more than $10 million in the property. In November, Waterway’s chairman, Armand Pohan, told Hoboken’s City Council that it would be a mistake to try to take the site because, in addition to paying fair value for the property, the city would have to find another location for the facility. “Good luck to you,” Mr. Pohan said, according to a copy of his remarks provided by Mr. Smith. “Because after looking for the past 10 years, I can safely say that there is no other suitable deepwater site anywhere between Fort Lee and lower Jersey City.” Hoboken officials have pointed to Bayonne, whose waterfront has more industrial sites, including a large dry dock, as a more suitable place for the ferry facility. Mr. Bhalla said he appreciated the role the ferry company had played in the region’s transportation network and was willing to help it find a new base — just not in his city. Alluding to the possibility of a final-days decision by New Jersey Transit to buy the Union Dry Dock site, he said, “Any further attempts to subvert this process will be met with fierce resistance from me, and I pledge to use every resource at my disposal to protect Hoboken’s interests.” "
101,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would allow states to impose work requirements in Medicaid, a major policy shift that moves toward fulfilling a conservative vision for one of the nation’s largest social insurance programs for low-income people. Federal officials said they would support state efforts to require able-bodied adults to work or participate in other “community engagement activities” as a condition of eligibility for Medicaid. “Our fundamental goal is to make a positive and lasting difference in the health and wellness of our beneficiaries, and today’s announcement is a step in that direction,” said Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Ms. Verma said the Trump administration was responding to requests from Medicaid officials in 10 states that wanted to run demonstration projects testing requirements for work or other types of community engagement like training, education, job search, volunteer activities and caregiving. Under the new policy, Trump administration officials would allow work requirements in Medicaid somewhat similar to those already imposed in other programs like food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the welfare program known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. In a speech to state Medicaid officials in November, Ms. Verma indicated that the Trump administration would be receptive to work requirements and other conservative policy ideas to reshape Medicaid. And she criticized the Obama administration, saying it had focused on increasing Medicaid enrollment rather than helping people move out of poverty and into jobs. "

President Trump, meeting with lawmakers on immigration, said he’d like to see immigrants from Norway, not “shithole countries” like Haiti. Elsewhere in Washington, the House voted against restricting a surveillance program that permits the government to collect, without a warrant, the emails and other communications of foreigners abroad — even when they are talking to Americans. The vote was a victory for the intelligence community and the Trump administration. There was some bad news for the White House too: Mr. Trump’s approval rating has fallen across a range of demographic groups, including among white voters, evangelical Christians and rural Americans. ____ "

106,"Over a three-day weekend at his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., President Trump showed little or no concern about the angry reaction set off by his use of obscenities to describe the third world countries he fears immigrants could come from under a new immigration bill. His base loved what he said, he told guests at the club, Mar-a-Lago, a refrain he repeated in phone calls over the holiday weekend. But back in Washington on Tuesday, his advisers and congressional allies have tried to limit the fallout from his remarks in an Oval Office meeting last week, insisting that he had never described the countries as “shitholes.” Some who had been in the meeting said they had not heard his descriptions. Others insisted in background conversations with reporters that they were told the word he had spoken was “shithouse,” a phrase that he often uses to describe physical structures that he finds unsavory. It was an unusual debate over words that until last Thursday had rarely, if ever, appeared in any mainstream news media. And if the argument seemed to amount to a distinction without a difference, neither the White House nor its allies have publicly acknowledged it, although some Trump aides have privately. There has also not been any acknowledgment that both words, as well as reports of Mr. Trump’s stated preference for immigrants from places like Norway, were offensive and many considered them racist. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, conceded to reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Trump “hasn’t said he didn’t use strong language.” “He’s passionate about it,” she said. “He’s not going to apologize for trying to fix our immigration system.” But the dispute among the president’s defenders about the vulgarity he actually used did nothing to allay critics. “I think it’s all the same,” said Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which Mr. Trump also mentioned dismissively during the Oval Office meeting, according to one participant. "
107,"WASHINGTON — The commanding officers of two Naval destroyers that collided with commercial vessels in the western Pacific last year, killing a total of 17 American sailors, will face court-martial charges that could include negligent homicide, the Navy said on Tuesday. After the collisions, the commanding officers, Cmdr. Bryce Benson of the Fitzgerald, and Cmdr. Alfredo J. Sanchez of the John S. McCain, along with their second-in-commands, were relieved of their duties. In October, the Navy began looking into further disciplinary actions. Adm. Frank Caldwell, one of the lead officers assigned to the investigation, determined that the charges could include dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel and negligent homicide, the Navy said in a statement. In the coming weeks, the two commanding officers and three other sailors aboard the Fitzgerald will most likely be charged during a hearing that determines whether they will be taken to trial in a court-martial. If found guilty, they could face jail time. The announcement of a hearing and of court-martial charges “is not intended to and does not reflect a determination of guilt or innocence related to any offenses,” the statement said. A chief petty officer from the John S. McCain has already been referred to court-martial on suspicion of dereliction of duty; eight other crew members, four from each ship, face administrative actions. Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the head of the Seventh Fleet, the Navy’s largest overseas, and other senior officers were also relieved last year after the collisions. In November, the Navy released reports about the June 17 collision between the Fitzgerald and a commercial ship that killed seven sailors off Japan and the Aug. 21 collision between the John S. McCain and another commercial vessel that left 10 dead near Singapore. The Navy concluded that both collisions resulted from a chain of errors, missed warnings and poor training. “The collisions were avoidable,” Adm. John M. Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said in a summary of the reports, released in November. Admiral Richardson and the secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer, are set to appear in front of two subcommittees of the House Armed Services on Thursday, focusing extensively on naval operations. "
108,"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — The majority of members of the National Parks System Advisory Board, which advises the federal government on management of the country’s national parks, have jointly resigned to protest Trump administration policies that the board members say have ignored science, squelched efforts to address climate change and undermined environmental protections. The advisory board was established in 1935 to advise the secretary of the interior, who oversees management of the country’s national parks and monuments. Since taking office last year, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has come under criticism from environmental advocates for promoting President Trump’s agenda of opening up the nation’s public lands and waters to fossil-fuel exploration, and for reducing the protection of public monuments. This month Mr. Zinke announced a plan to open up the majority of the nation’s coastlines to offshore drilling. And in December, the administration reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, by some two million acres, the largest rollback of federal land protection in the nation’s history. “From all of the events of this past year I have a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our National Parks has been set aside,” wrote Tony Knowles, the head of the advisory board, in a resignation letter dated Monday that was co-signed by eight other members of the 12-member panel. The Washington Post first reported the letter. “We resigned because we were deeply disappointed with the department and we were concerned,” Mr. Knowles said in an interview. Mr. Zinke, he said, “appears to have no interest in continuing the agenda of science, the effect of climate change, pursuing the protection of the ecosystem.” Mr. Knowles said that Mr. Zinke has refused to meet with his board during his tenure. Phil Francis, chairman of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, an advocacy group of current and former national park employees, said Tuesday evening, “This discourteous and disrespectful treatment of the Board is inexcusable and, unfortunately, consistent with a decidedly anti-park pattern demonstrated by Secretary Zinke’s department.” An Interior Department spokeswoman did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Mr. Zinke has sought to portray himself as a champion of national parks and has compared himself to Theodore Roosevelt, the founder of the national parks system. The resignations come amid growing concern by scientists that their voices are being suppressed by the Trump administration. Last May, the Environmental Protection Agency dismissed several members of its Board of Scientific Counselors in a move that Trump administration officials said was designed to give greater voice to industry interests in the agency. "
109,"WASHINGTON — American troops will remain in Syria long after their fight against the Islamic State to ensure that neither Iran nor President Bashar al-Assad of Syria take over areas that have been newly liberated with help from the United States, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Wednesday. Staying in Syria, Mr. Tillerson said, will help ensure that the Trump administration does not repeat what he described as the mistakes of former President Barack Obama, who withdrew troops from Iraq before the extremist threat was doused and failed to stabilize Libya after NATO airstrikes that led to the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. “We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria,” Mr. Tillerson said during a speech at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University near San Francisco. “ISIS has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.” ISIS is another name for the Islamic State. There were roughly 2,000 American troops in Syria last month, a mix of engineering units that build fortifications and Special Operations units that fight and train with local militias. Additionally, American military contractors in Syria help demine recaptured areas as the Islamic State is pushed back. Mr. Tillerson’s comments were the first time a senior Trump administration official pledged to keep American troops in Syria well after the current battle ends. They also marked another step in President Trump’s gradual evolution from a populist firebrand who promised to extricate the United States from foreign military entanglements to one who is grudgingly accepting many of the national security strategies he once derided. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that “at some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world.” Mr. Obama won the White House in 2008 in part by promising to wind down the war in Iraq, and agreed to only a limited role in the 2011 airstrikes in Libya. Those decisions have haunted the military officers who now serve in Mr. Trump’s cabinet and, in turn, have led to the administration’s deepening military involvement in Afghanistan. Mr. Trump has said American forces must remain in Afghanistan because “a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists, including ISIS and Al Qaeda.” Mr. Tillerson repeated that rationale in outlining the administration’s decision to keep forces in Syria. He did not say whether other countries would help pay for the American military effort or other stabilization costs, even though Mr. Trump also promised during the presidential campaign that he would compel Germany and Persian Gulf nations to contribute financing “because they have the money.” Mr. Tillerson said the military commitment to Syria was “conditions-based” and not indefinite. But he underscored that it would take time to foster a democratically elected government in Syria that he — like the Obama administration — said would require Mr. Assad’s departure from power. “Responsible change may not come as immediately as some hope for, but rather through an incremental process of constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections,” he said. Analysts raised concerns that there might never come a time when withdrawal would be deemed appropriate. “Yes, we can leave troops there for the foreseeable future,” said Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a former ambassador and career diplomat. “But is that 20 years, the way Afghanistan soon will be?” The United States has five key goals in Syria, Mr. Tillerson said. They are: ensuring that the Islamic State and Al Qaeda never re-emerge; supporting the United Nations-led political process; diminishing Iran’s influence; making sure the country is free of weapons of mass destruction; and helping refugees to return after years of civil war. Mr. Tillerson conceded the steep challenge in fostering peace and democracy in Syria, where efforts by world leaders and diplomats across the Middle East and the West have fallen short. He is working on a reorganization of the State Department, which so far has resulted in steep budget cuts and the departure of some of its most senior diplomats, including some top Middle East experts. Such expertise is vital to any military or diplomatic ventures in the Middle East, where contradictory and crosscutting rivalries are endemic. For instance, American backing for a Kurdish-led border force in northeastern Syria has raised alarms in the region and is vehemently opposed by Russia, Turkey, Iran and Mr. Assad’s government. The border force has been described as a “terror army” by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who worries it will be operated by a Kurdish militia that he considers a threat to his country. On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag of Turkey said his country had reached the limit of its patience regarding developments along its borders. Mr. Tillerson sought to allay the concerns, saying that “any interim arrangements must be truly representative and must not threaten any neighboring states.” Nawaf Khalil, a former official in the Syrian Kurdish local government who now works at a German research institute, praised Mr. Tillerson’s speech as “a clear American vision on the situation in Syria.” “Stressing the importance of diplomacy, as well as strengthening U.S. allies in the region, is the needed approach at this stage,” Mr. Khalil said. He added: “It finally seems like the White House and the Pentagon are on the same page in Syria.” There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government, but it has consistently rejected any American interference as illegal and counterproductive. "
110,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — Four weeks before delegates meet to elect the next president of the United States Soccer Federation, Eric Wynalda was in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday to address the state of soccer in a town hall before about 100 angry fans of the local Major League Soccer team. It was unlikely that anybody in attendance had a vote in the election, but that did not matter to Wynalda. In a crowded field of eight candidates, Wynalda, 48, has positioned himself as the voice of the frustrated American soccer fan, a surging demographic since the men’s national team failed to qualify for this summer’s World Cup. But in that populist role, he has challenged the very pillars upon which soccer in this country has been painstakingly built over the past three decades. His candidacy has been called Trump-like. Wynalda rejects the label, but he also has spent months eviscerating the very organization he hopes to soon lead, and he has insisted that he alone has the skills to run an organization with more than $125 million in annual revenues most effectively, even though he spent part of the last decade warding off creditors during a period of personal financial turbulence revealed by public records and not previously reported. Except for having a bit of a temper — Wynalda was shown a red card in his first World Cup game — his soccer credentials are unimpeachable. Wynalda played in three World Cups, and for professional teams in Germany’s Bundesliga and Major League Soccer, before he became television analyst and lower-division manager. It is the rest of the résumé his detractors say is lacking. Wynalda’s critics point out his campaign is being financed in part by a minor-league owner who is locked in a legal battle with U.S. Soccer, and they say he has little experience to prepare him for the task of running an organization with more than 170 employees and multi-million-dollar contracts with some of the biggest entities in sports, including Nike and ESPN. According to public records, Wynalda filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009, and subsequently had significant liens placed against his assets as recently as three years ago. He said the liens were filed in error and were discharged without his having to pay any additional taxes or penalties. "
111,"HONG KONG — North and South Korea agreed on Wednesday to march their athletes together under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month and to field a joint women’s ice hockey team. It was the most dramatic gesture of reconciliation between them in a decade. South Korea, host of the games, has said it hopes such a partnership in sports could contribute to a political thaw after years of high tensions. It came even as the prospect of war over the North’s nuclear and missile tests has grown especially acute. The Games will begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the women’s ice-hockey squad will be the first combined Korean team for the Olympics, and the first unified team since their athletes played together for an international table-tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991. The two countries’ delegations will march at the opening ceremony behind a “unified Korea” flag that shows an undivided Korean Peninsula, negotiators from both sides said in a joint news release after talks at the border village of Panmunjom. The North will send 230 supporters to the Games, and negotiators agreed that supporters of both Koreas would root together for athletes from both countries. The prospect of North and South Koreans cheering together offers a stunning contrast to the bombastic rhetoric of possible war from North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un and President Trump of the United States, South Korea’s main ally. Mr. Trump has threatened the North with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” should it put the security of Americans and their allies at risk. Mr. Kim has called Mr. Trump a lunatic. "

113,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s chief of staff privately told a group of Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had not been “fully informed” when promising voters a wall along the Mexican border last year, and said that he had persuaded the president it was not necessary. He also expressed optimism that a bipartisan immigration deal could eventually be reached. John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general credited with bringing a measure of discipline to Mr. Trump’s chaotic White House during his six months as chief of staff, told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that he had educated the president about the issue of immigration, adding that Mr. Trump had “evolved” on the wall. But President Trump directly contradicted the chief of staff on Thursday, saying his position on building the wall had not “evolved.” In an early-morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump said, “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.” He added in a second tweet, “The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.” The comments Mr. Kelly made Wednesday were an unusual instance of a White House chief of staff seeming to undercut public statements made by the president, in the process contradicting the central message of “Build the wall” that defined Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. The president has recently begun to temper his own statements about the wall, telling a group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House last week that a 2,000-mile structure would not be needed because parts of the border would be impassable. But in telling lawmakers that Mr. Trump had essentially erred from the start in promoting a wall and by claiming credit for dissuading him, Mr. Kelly appeared to be voicing a sentiment some in the West Wing have heard him express privately — that it is his job to tutor a sometimes ill-informed president who has never served in public office before.

115,"WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, will be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel in the Russia investigation instead of testifying before a grand jury, according to a person familiar with the matter, a sign that Mr. Bannon is cooperating with the inquiry. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had subpoenaed Mr. Bannon to appear before a grand jury this week. But Mr. Bannon has agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller’s investigation and will be interviewed in the less formal setting of the special counsel’s offices in downtown Washington. It was not clear why Mr. Mueller subpoenaed Mr. Bannon and did not first ask him to sit for an interview, as Mr. Mueller had done with more than a dozen current and former White House officials who were questioned in recent months. Mr. Mueller could still call Mr. Bannon to appear before a grand jury after he meets with investigators. Legal experts have said the subpoena could be a sign that the investigation was accelerating, while others said it may have simply been a negotiating tactic to force Mr. Bannon to quickly agree to be interviewed. The subpoena was served after Mr. Bannon was quoted in the new book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” criticizing the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. and predicting that Mr. Mueller’s investigation will ultimately center on money laundering. Mr. Bannon is still under subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee, which took the unusual step of subpoenaing him as he was being interviewed by its members on Tuesday. He had refused to answer several questions about Mr. Trump, saying the White House had told him to assert executive privilege. Committee members of both parties were angered by Mr. Bannon’s lack of cooperation during his 10 hours of testimony, and Democrats said that the White House had used executive privilege as a “gag order” to stop Mr. Bannon from talking about the president. The lawmakers would like Mr. Bannon to return to Capitol Hill on Thursday to respond to the questions he refused to answer. But Mr. Bannon’s lawyer told the committee that Mr. Bannon would not be appearing before the panel this week because there is not enough time to work out executive privilege issues with the White House. CNN first reported on Wednesday that Mr. Mueller would forgo Mr. Bannon’s grand jury appearance. Also on Wednesday, a status hearing for George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., was postponed for up to 90 days. Mr. Papadopoulos is cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s inquiry while awaiting sentencing. "

117,Good morning. Here’s what you need to know:      
118,"It’s not every day that a book garners glowing blurbs from both Rod Dreher of The American Conservative (“clarifying”) and the socialist scholar Cornel West (“courageous”), but then these aren’t ordinary times. Patrick J. Deneen’s “Why Liberalism Failed” speaks to a profound discontent with the political establishment. During the 2016 election, “They’re all the same” was a line heard from Americans disgusted with both parties. Judging from this book, Deneen would agree. Liberalism, as he defines it, encompasses the orthodoxy of political elites, whether they lean to the left or the right. It was conceived some 500 years ago and was the founding creed of the United States. It prescribes autonomy for individuals to “fashion and pursue for themselves their own version of the good life.” It advises government to get out of the way in the realm of markets (a Republican priority) and personal morality (a Democratic one). It has been an unmitigated disaster. That, at least, is Deneen’s argument. “Why Liberalism Failed” is a book that reads like an attempt to enunciate a primal scream, a deeply exasperating volume that nevertheless articulates something important in this age of disillusionment. (David Brooks and Ross Douthat have both written Op-Ed columns about the book for The Times.) Deneen, a professor of political science at Notre Dame, may not admire President Trump, but he understands his appeal. “Today’s widespread yearning for a strong leader, one with the will to take back popular control over liberalism’s forms of bureaucratized government and globalized economy, comes after decades of liberal dismantling of cultural norms and political habits essential to self-governance,” Deneen writes. His critique in this slender volume is impressively capacious. Ruthless economic liberalization has left many people materially insecure; relentless cultural liberalization has left them unmoored. Communal ties are discouraged in order to encourage a mobile force of workers. Freedom becomes something for an increasingly powerful government to grant or withhold. Mere tinkering won’t alleviate the deep rot in the liberal project, Deneen insists. He says we need to envision a future after liberalism, where local, preferably religious communities tend to the land and look after their own. These groups would cultivate “cultures of community, care, self-sacrifice and small-scale democracy.” Readers of all political stripes can probably find something in this book that rings true, even if it’s followed by the rude awakening of a record scratch. His thoughts on the environment sound like they came out of a Greenpeace brochure — “Short-term exploitation of the earth’s bounty,” he writes, “forces our children to deal with shortages of such resources as topsoil and potable water” — while his musings on women, when he deigns to mention women, sound like they came out of an especially cranky episode of “The 700 Club.” “The main practical achievement of this liberation of women has been to move many of them into the work force of market capitalism,” he writes, “a highly dubious form of liberation.” You don’t have to be a raging neoliberal to find this a highly dubious form of generalization. “Children are increasingly viewed as a limitation upon individual freedom, which contributes to liberalism’s commitment to abortion on demand, while overall birthrates decline across the developed world.” There’s so much moral panic packed into this sentence it’s hard to know where to begin, though the blithe phrasing of “abortion on demand” reflects the old and spiteful stereotype of the so-called modern woman as a dissolute, selfish pleasure-seeker. “Today we consider the paramount sign of the liberation of women to be their growing emancipation from their biology,” Deneen writes. We do? How many women has he talked to about what they want? Deneen approvingly cites the radical feminist Nancy Fraser to bolster his assertions about women in the work force, yet nowhere does he sufficiently address how gendered injustices — what Fraser calls “domestic violence, sexual assault and reproductive oppression” — might fare in his own faith-based, localist program. Despite his buttoned-up solemnity Deneen occasionally plays peekaboo with his sources, especially the left-wing ones, shining the klieg lights on certain parts of their arguments while eliding others that might complicate his own. In an otherwise illuminating section on the development of capitalism, Deneen refers to the great economic historian Karl Polanyi, who showed how the state had to take a strong hand in the creation of ostensibly free markets: “As Polanyi pithily says of this transformation, ‘Laissez-faire was planned.’” But Polanyi drew different conclusions from his own observations. An ardent social democrat who fled his beloved Red Vienna when the fascists took over, Polanyi went into exile four times, eventually landing in Canada. This cosmopolitan intellectual, born into a Hungarian-Jewish family, would most likely have been highly suspicious of Deneen’s extreme disdain for what he calls “lives of deracinated vagabondage” and his sentimentalization of communal norms enforced by “people of good will.” Deneen says that the only proper response to liberalism is “to transform the household into a small economy.” Home may be where the heart is, but it can also be the site for homegrown prejudice, petty grievances and a vicious cruelty. Deneen is so determined to depict liberalism as a wholly bankrupt ideology that he gives exceedingly short shrift to what might have made it appealing — and therefore powerful — in the first place. With all its abiding flaws, liberalism offered a way out for those who didn’t conform to the demands of the clan. Besides, nobody is truly stopping Deneen from doing what he prescribes: finding a community of like-minded folk, taking to the land, growing his own food, pulling his children out of public school. His problem is that he apparently wants everyone to do these things — which suggests he may have more in common with his caricature of a bullying liberal than he cares to admit. Or perhaps it just goes to show that everyone has his blind spots — even erudite political philosophers keen to denounce the blind spots of others. Deneen and his fellow localists are cast as virtuous souls who would necessarily make discerning, merciful and respectful yeoman farmers once the revolution comes. Yet this generous forbearance doesn’t seem to extend to liberals — or to use his awkward slur, “liberalocrats” — who get tarred in this book as a bunch of condescending, self-satisfied chumps. Hypocrites, every one: They’re all the same. "
119,"SAN FRANCISCO — Apple, which had long deferred paying taxes on its foreign earnings and had become synonymous with hoarding money overseas, unveiled plans on Wednesday that would bring back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it held abroad and said it would make a sizable investment in the United States. With the moves, Apple took advantage of the new tax code that President Trump signed into law last month. A provision allows for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple, which has 94 percent of its total cash of $269 billion outside the United States, said it would make a one-time tax payment of $38 billion on the repatriated cash. For years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple’s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration. In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending. “I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS.” "
120,"WASHINGTON — Cardiologists not associated with the White House said Wednesday that President Trump’s physical exam revealed serious heart concerns, including very high levels of so-called bad cholesterol, which raises the risk that Mr. Trump could have a heart attack while in office. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral and the White House physician, said Tuesday in his report on the president’s medical condition that Mr. Trump was in “excellent” cardiac health despite having an LDL cholesterol level of 143, well above the desired level of 100 or less. Dr. David Maron, the director of preventive cardiology at Stanford University’s medical school, said Wednesday that it was alarming that the president’s LDL levels remain above 140 even though he is taking 10 milligrams of Crestor, a powerful drug that is used to lower cholesterol levels to well below 100. Dr. Maron said he would “definitely” be worried about Mr. Trump’s risk for having a heart attack if the president were one of his patients. Asked if Mr. Trump is in perfect health, Dr. Maron offered a blunt reply: “God, no.” Other cardiologists also disputed Dr. Jackson’s rosy assessment of the president’s heart health. Several said Mr. Trump’s goal should be to get his LDL below 100, or even under 70. He has a real risk of having a heart attack or stroke, especially considering his weight and lack of exercise, they said. Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Scripps Research Institute, said that it is impossible to ignore the dangers of the president’s elevated cholesterol levels when providing an overall assessment of Mr. Trump’s health. "
121,"Lawyers for the Uzbek man charged in the truck attack on a crowded Manhattan bike path that killed eight people on Halloween said on Wednesday that their client would plead guilty and accept life imprisonment without parole if prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. The proposal came in an exchange of letters to Judge Vernon S. Broderick of Federal District Court in Manhattan, in which prosecutors were seeking a firm trial date for the defendant, Sayfullo Saipov, arguing that victims and witnesses needed closure, and Mr. Saipov’s lawyer said the best way to obtain closure was through such a plea deal. The government has not yet said whether it would seek the death penalty for Mr. Saipov, 29, who was indicted on eight capital counts and other charges in the Oct. 31 attack, the deadliest terror attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Saipov has pleaded not guilty. In the days immediately after the attack, President Trump posted messages on Twitter declaring “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” and “Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY.” On Tuesday, the office of Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, wrote to Judge Broderick, describing the process that occurs before a decision on the death penalty is reached: Mr. Berman’s office would make a recommendation to Attorney General Jeff Sessions; the defense may make its own submission; a special Justice Department capital case unit conducts a review; and Mr. Sessions makes the ultimate determination. The prosecutors asked the judge for a firm trial date around April 2019. “Of critical importance,” they wrote, “the victims in the United States and abroad have a strong desire for closure.” In the defense’s letter on Wednesday, David E. Patton, one of Mr. Saipov’s federal public defenders, said, ""The most straightforward way to achieve closure would be for the government to accept a plea of guilty and a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.” That outcome would obviate the need for victims’ families to prepare for and participate in a trial and, in the event of a death sentence, prevent years of appeals, Mr. Patton noted. Such a decision would “bring immediate closure to the case without the need for the public and victims to repeatedly relive the terrible events of Oct. 31, 2017,” Mr. Patton added. “We hope to convince the government of that view in our submissions.” Neither Mr. Patton nor Mr. Berman’s office would comment. Mr. Saipov is accused of driving a pickup truck down a bike path along the Hudson River in Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 11 before being shot by a police officer in the abdomen. "
122,"WASHINGTON — President Trump — who gleefully questioned President Barack Obama’s birthplace for years without evidence, long insisted on the guilt of the Central Park Five despite exonerating proof and claimed that millions of illegal ballots cost him the popular vote in 2016 — wanted to have a word with the American public about accuracy in reporting. On Wednesday, after weeks of shifting deadlines, and cryptic clues, Mr. Trump released his long-promised “Fake News Awards,” an anti-media project that had alarmed advocates of press freedom and heartened his political base. “And the FAKE NEWS winners are …,” he wrote on Twitter at 8 p.m. The message linked, at first, to a malfunctioning page on GOP.com, the Republican National Committee website. An error screen read: “The site is temporarily offline, we are working to bring it back up. Please try back later.” When the page came back online less than an hour later, it resembled a Republican Party news release. Headlined “The Highly Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards” and attributed to “Team GOP,” it included a list of Trump administration accomplishments and jabs at news organizations presented in the form of an 11-point list. The “winners” were CNN, mentioned four times; The New York Times, with two mentions; and ABC, The Washington Post, Time and Newsweek, with one mention apiece. Taken as a whole, Mr. Trump’s examples of grievances came as no surprise to anyone who has read his complaints about the media on Twitter. "
123,"KANDEL, Germany — It happened between neatly stacked rows of shampoo and organic baby food: A teenage boy walked up to his ex-girlfriend in the local drugstore, pulled out a kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade and stabbed her in the heart. The death in Kandel, in southwestern Germany, on Dec. 27 has traumatized this sleepy town of barely 10,000 inhabitants, not just because both the suspect and the victim were only 15 years old and went to the local school, but also because the boy is an Afghan migrant and the girl was German. From the moment Germany opened its doors to more than a million migrants two years ago, prominent episodes like the Berlin Christmas market attack and the New Year’s molestation and rapes in Cologne have stoked German insecurities. But the case of the two teenagers, Abdul D. and Mia V., has struck a special nerve because the killing happened in such a quiet and provincial setting and the two people involved were so young. It became national news, was debated over dinner tables, on talk shows and on social media sites, and reinforced fears that Germany is becoming ever less safe. Yet perceptions are one thing, and statistics are another. Reported crimes have edged up over the past two years, but over all, violent crimes have been trending downward for a decade in Germany, which remains one of the safest countries in Europe. Nevertheless, each crime involving a migrant or asylum seeker has become a fresh occasion for national hand-wringing. "
124,"“Fire and Fury” could be coming to the small screen. Or maybe even the big one. Endeavor Content has acquired the rights to Michael Wolff’s No. 1 best-selling book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” and plans to develop it into a TV show or a feature film. No TV network or film studio has been attached to the project. A “Fire and Fury” adaptation could be the first major dramatic portrayal of the Trump White House. HBO had plans to develop a show from a book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the final days of the 2016 campaign, but that project was canceled after Mr. Halperin was accused of sexual misconduct. News about the rights to Mr. Wolff’s book being acquired was reported by The Hollywood Reporter, and was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Endeavor Content. Mr. Wolff was expected to be the executive producer of the project, and would be joined by the British television executive Michael Jackson. There is heated competition in television these days for major projects, and “Fire and Fury” will most likely attract a lot of interest. Since its publication less than two weeks ago, Mr. Wolff’s book has raised questions about Mr. Trump’s fitness for office, and helped lead to the banishment of the former chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon from the president’s circle of advisers. "
125,"Despite President Trump’s reported call to reject immigrants from “shithole countries,” people from these countries actually have plenty to teach us. Let’s start with a quiz: Which country was the first in the world to ban government discrimination against gays in its constitution? A) Norway B) New Zealand C) South Africa Answer: It’s the so-called s-hole country, South Africa. It also bans discrimination based on gender and disability. Someday all the world will be so enlightened. Here are other examples we can learn from: 1. Sierra Leone’s president has committed the country to providing free health care for children under 5 and for pregnant women, including prenatal care and deliveries, although care still lags. Meanwhile, in America the issue doesn’t get such high-level attention, so American women die in childbirth at five times the rate of British women. 2. Kenya is way ahead of the U.S. in mobile money. It’s easy in Kenya to transfer money by cellphone and to use a phone as a bank account. Nearly everyone has a mobile phone, and 88 percent of Kenyan mobile phone users also have mobile money accounts. Kenyans don’t understand why Americans are so backward in telecommunications. 3. Rwanda may eliminate cervical cancer before America, for Rwanda vaccinates virtually all girls against the human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer. By also employing screenings for older women who were not vaccinated, it aims to eliminate cervical cancer by 2020. In contrast, only 65 percent of American girls get vaccinated for HPV, and a woman dies every two hours in the U.S. from cervical cancer. “I wish parents in the U.S. worked as hard as those in Rwanda to get their daughters vaccinated, so that they will never need to know the horrors of cervical cancer,” says Dr. Seth Berkley, chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Indeed, while African leaders have worked very hard to raise vaccination rates and save lives, America has a president who has repeatedly cast doubt on vaccines. 4. Understanding the importance of languages in a globalized world, many Kenyans speak English, Swahili and a tribal language, and polyglots are common throughout Africa. In contrast, there’s the old joke: If somebody who speaks three languages is trilingual, and one who speaks two languages is bilingual, what do you call someone who speaks one language? An American. 5. African health officials have strongly promoted breast-feeding to make sure that babies get the healthiest possible start in life. So while 20 percent of American babies are exclusively breast-fed for the first six months of life, the figure is 42 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Rwanda, it’s a stunning 87 percent. 6. African governments have conscientiously followed recommendations of the World Health Assembly to curb infant formula marketing that discourages breast-feeding; the U.S. has not. In this respect, suggests Shawn Baker of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, “The U.S. might benefit from technical assistance from Botswana.” 7. Nigeria ensures that 93 percent of households get iodized salt, to reduce iodine deficiency that causes mental disability as well as goiters. In the U.S., only a bit more than half of salt sold to households is iodized, and iodine deficiency is becoming more common. 8. At a time when much of the rich world has turned against refugees, Uganda has quietly accepted more than one million South Sudan refugees. Likewise, the Diffa region of Niger is heroic in taking in refugees from northern Nigeria, and it now resettles refugees at extraordinarily high rates, helping the newcomers rather than demonizing them. 9. In the latest Freedom House index, the U.S. fell in the rankings of freedom and democracy and is now outranked by two African countries, Cape Verde and Mauritius. Both successfully manage multiracial societies in a way we can learn from. 10. The fastest-growing economy in the world is Ethiopia’s, according to the World Economic Forum, with Tanzania’s and Djibouti’s also in the top six. They are all growing more than twice as fast as the U.S. economy. 11. The Trump administration could learn something about diplomacy from Botswana, which asked the U.S. to please clarify whether the U.S. considers Botswana a shithole. No bluster, no military threats, no rude tweets — but the point was made. 12. Immigrants to the U.S. from Africa show a passion for education that can inspire us all. Sub-Saharan African-born immigrants are likelier to earn a college degree (39 percent) than native-born Americans (31 percent). That education, I trust, makes them wary of invidious insults aimed at entire continents and of stereotyping people from those continents. “Africa, like any continent, has its problems,” notes Ken Roth of Human Rights Watch. “But it also has its areas where it excels. We diminish ourselves when we dismiss entire nations with an epithet rather than open ourselves to the positive examples they set.” "
126,"WASHINGTON — It was a made-for-TV moment, perfect for a presidential campaign advertisement. His fists clenched and his voice rising, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, delivered a 10-minute verbal thrashing to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen this week, recalling his “tears of rage” when he learned that President Trump had used vulgarities to describe African nations. Not to be outdone, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, who was seated next to Mr. Booker, also skewered Ms. Nielsen, suggesting that Americans could draw a “reasonable inference” that she is racist. The next presidential election is nearly three years away, but in the Capitol the race is already unfolding, with no fewer than six senators — Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — eyeing the Democratic nomination in 2020, with each angling to get to the left of the others. That is not making life easy for the 10 Democratic senators who must run for re-election this year in states carried by President Trump — so much so that one of them, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, lamented openly in a recent interview that her colleagues running for president were “all trying to find their base.” The fissure between 2018 and 2020 has been on display in the Capitol this week, as Washington barrels toward a possible government shutdown that can be averted only if lawmakers approve a stopgap spending measure by Friday. For that to happen, at least nine Democratic senators need to vote for it. Five of the six presidential hopefuls have long said they would not vote for any spending bill that does not include protection for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, who have been shielded from deportation by an Obama-era program that Mr. Trump rescinded. (The sixth, Ms. Klobuchar, also voted against the last short-term spending bill.) "
127,"In April 2016, Donald Trump stood in front of supporters in Pittsburgh and declared he would bring the country’s steel jobs back. On Thursday, he returns to western Pennsylvania as a president yet to deliver on that promise. While America will never again see mills like those that dotted the river valleys of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia 50 years ago, President Trump now has a chance to help stabilize a reeling steel industry and revive some of the employment it once offered. The wheels are in motion. Three months into his presidency, Mr. Trump invoked a rarely used authority — Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president, after a review, to block imports that threaten national security — and promised decisive action in favor of the domestic steel industry by the end of June. The summer instead passed without progress on the prerequisite review from the Commerce Department. Finally, with a deadline looming, late last week the Commerce Department announced it had completed its investigation and sent recommendations to the White House. The administration must announce a decision based on the report’s findings within 90 days. With the report in hand, Mr. Trump has broad license to apply tariffs, quotas or both to steel imports. And he can do it safely: While there has been speculation about potential retaliation against the United States if it raises import restrictions, an exception in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permits them for security purposes. Mr. Trump should make use of his authority in this case. Even in this digital age, steel undergirds our military power, not to mention critical infrastructure. Tanks, aircraft carriers and the energy grid all rely on high-strength, lightweight steel. That steel has been made in America for generations. "

129,"JERUSALEM — In the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza, Mahmoud Ferwana, 59, huddled beneath a flimsy nylon-and-sheet-metal roof while rain drenched the rest of his squalid home’s sandy floor. He earns money collecting broken stones; his children scavenge for copper. But none of it amounts to a living. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency is what reliably puts food in their mouths. If that aid were to stop, Mr. Ferwana said on Wednesday, “I and my children will die.” That aid, to Mr. Ferwana and more than five million other Palestinians living in refugee camps across the Middle East, is now endangered by what the agency’s leaders are calling the worst financial crisis in its seven-decade history. The United States, its biggest donor, announced this week that it was withholding $65 million from a scheduled payment of $120 million. The Trump administration said it was pressing for unspecified reforms from the agency, while also seeking to get Arab countries to contribute more. In response, the relief agency said on Wednesday that it would begin a fund-raising campaign to try to close the gap before it is forced to cut vital safety-net services. “We’re reaching out to official donors, obviously, but also to the Arab world, to untraditional donors in emerging markets and to individuals, in the hope that we can rapidly upscale the amounts they give to us,” said Chris Gunness, the agency’s chief spokesman. "
130,"Two years ago, Merrill Garbus decided to learn how to D.J. The Oakland, Calif.-based indie-pop musician, known for her pan-global rhythmic loops and frank lyrics in Tune-Yards, had little experience behind turntables but she dived in headfirst, booking a Tuesday night residency at a bar near the studio where she records. “I hadn’t been in charge of an evening like that before,” said Ms. Garbus, 38. “What does the audience want to dance to? How do you know what they want before they say so? It taught me a lot.” You can hear the lessons of the dance floor in the music she and her bandmate, Nate Brenner, made for Tune-Yards’ fourth album, “I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,” due Jan. 19. A sleek, radical evolution from the clattering collages that first earned Tune-Yards an audience (notably on the 2011 album “Whokill,” which won that year’s Village Voice critics’ poll), the new LP is full of insistent beats, catchy hooks and pointed questions about modern society. “I ask myself, what should I do?/But all I know is white centrality,” Ms. Garbus sings on the bubbly single “ABC 123.” Amid preparations for a tour that begins in Sacramento on Feb. 15, she spoke with The New York Times from her home. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You participated in a six-month workshop on race at the East Bay Meditation Center while you were working on this album. What was the most surprising thing you learned there? The whole thing was surprising. We met twice a month, looking at Buddhist principles and our roles as white folks in the community, with readings and videos. A lot of it — learning about a concept like white fragility, for instance — was like, “Oh my God. There’s a word for this?” Instead of walking through the world with this huge amount of defensiveness, [thinking], “I will not be racist,” to say, “Merrill, you are racist, simply by being brought up white in this society. So how does that feel? And let’s move from there.” You’ve said that you felt “a wall of shame bubble up” when you recorded the line “I use my white woman’s voice to tell stories of travels with African men,” from your new song “Colonizer.” How has it felt to sing those words in concert? The first time, my heart jumped out of my chest. A lot of my feeling about growing up white in this country is about not knowing how to talk about whiteness. I think that’s part of how white supremacy works: There isn’t language for it. I’m finding the same thing with singing. What expression do I use when I’m singing those lines? Am I looking straight ahead? Am I looking down? These very subtle performance choices contextualize completely differently. "
131,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Less than 20 miles down the coast from where emergency workers in Montecito are searching for victims of last week’s mudslides is the tiny beach town of La Conchita, where grief and vigilance are permanently intertwined. With about 330 inhabitants, La Conchita offers a scale model of the delights of living in California — and of the risks: the fires, rising sea levels, mudslides and earthquakes. The beach is only steps away. Lemons and avocados grow willingly in the abundant sunshine. Yet residents live in fear of the loose soil above them. In 1995 part of the steep hillside behind the town collapsed, sending a river of mud into the streets and damaging a dozen houses. Engineers built a wall, sinking steel I-beams, the type you might use to build a skyscraper, deep into the ground. Ten years later, after heavy rainfall, the hillside gave way again. Mud surged down the slope and deflected off the wall meant to protect the town, according to Mike Bell, a board member of the La Conchita Community Organization, which serves as a de facto local government. Ten people were killed in that January 2005 mudslide. Their bodies were recovered but parts of their homes are still buried under a giant mound of soil, a monument to the town’s suffering and lingering fears. “Every day we think about what happened in 2005,” Mr. Bell said on Tuesday. “We know what Montecito is going through because we lived through exactly the same thing. It was a mud flow, it was rapid-moving, it buried people.” A number of articles have been published recently about people pondering the wisdom of living in California, fire-prone and seismically volatile as it is, not to mention bank-account-emptying expensive. "
132,"As a photographer for the Department of Energy, Simon Edelman regularly attended meetings with Secretary Rick Perry and snapped pictures for official purposes. Now he is out of a job and seeking whistle-blower protections after leaking photographs of Mr. Perry meeting with a major energy industry donor to President Trump. Late last year, Mr. Edelman said, he shared with journalists photos he shot at the private meeting between Mr. Perry and the campaign contributor Robert E. Murray, the head of one of the country’s largest coal mining companies, Murray Energy. One photo showed the two men embracing; another captured the cover sheet of a confidential “action plan” that Mr. Murray brought to the meeting last March calling for policy and regulatory changes friendly to the coal industry. Democrats and some environmental groups seized on the photos as evidence of the energy industry’s direct line to Mr. Perry, who had been in the job less than a month when the meeting occurred. "
133,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • How Apple plans to capitalize on the new tax plan • Could antitrust law fell the tech giants? •Bank of America reported $2.4 billion in fourth-quarter profit, as well as a $2.9 billion charge tied to the new tax law. • Goldman Sachs reported a $1.9 billion loss, and a $4.4 billion tax charge. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Write the NYT’s Brian X. Chen and Daisuke Wakabayashi: The iPhone maker said it plans to make a $350 billion contribution to the American economy over the next five years. Some of its new investments will come from bringing back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it has long held abroad. Under the new tax law, foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated and taxed at reduced rates. The tech giant said it will pay $38 billion in taxes to repatriate its overseas cash because of the new law. Here’s what Apple plans to do: • Invest about $30 billion in capital expenditures in the United States over the next five years. • Create more than 20,000 new jobs in the United States, a 24 percent increase from the roughly 84,000 employees in the country currently. • Issue stock-based bonuses worth $2,500 to employees, according to Bloomberg. That’s the provocative question posed by Greg Ip of the WSJ. And it reflects governments’ growing wariness toward the tech industry. Google, Amazon and Facebook aren’t like the Standard Oil or AT&T of old, gouging consumers on price. (Indeed, many of their services are free.) But if the question is “Are consumers better off?” then could there be an opening for regulatory action? More from Mr. Ip: Where tech has support: In its efforts to keep net neutrality regulations, with a lawsuit against the F.C.C. by 22 state attorneys general and a bill by Senate Democrats to undo the repeal using the Congressional Review Act.   Goldman once seemed invincible. Its trading business was a profit machine. This morning it posted a quarterly loss in part because of the poor performance in its trading unit. The numbers: • $1.9 billion. Goldman’s fourth-quarter loss. • $4.4 billion. The charge Goldman took related to the new tax law, which wiped out nearly half of Goldman's earnings for the year, according to the WSJ. • $5.68. The Wall Street firm’s profit per share excluding the tax-related charge, beating the consensus estimate of $4.90 from Wall Street analysts. •$7.8 billion. Goldman’s revenue for the quarter, down 4 percent. Goldman is the only big bank to report a decline in revenue so far. • $2.37 billion. Goldman’s trading revenue for the fourth quarter, down 34 percent from a year ago. That was the steepest decline of any of banks reporting so far. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America have reported declines in trading revenue of 19 percent, 17 percent and 9 percent. • $1 billion. Goldman’s revenue from buying and selling bonds, commodities and currencies, half of what it generated a year ago. To put that in perspective: Goldman’s fixed-income division at its peak churned out nearly a billion dollars every two weeks. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed an indictment charging Nicolas De-Meyer, 40, with stealing $1.2 million worth of rare wine from a former employer. The former employer in question was Mr. Solomon, who employed Mr. De-Meyer as a personal assistant, according to two sources familiar with the matter. According to the indictment, the wine was stolen from around October 2014 to around October 2016, when Mr. De-Meyer had been asked to transport it from his former employer’s Manhattan apartment to his wine cellar in East Hampton, N.Y. Mr. De-Meyer was arrested in Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for the Los Angeles federal prosecutor’s office. He could not immediately be reached for comment. “The theft was discovered in the fall of 2016 and reported to law enforcement at that time,” a Goldman spokesman said. Bank of America reported $2.4 billion in fourth-quarter profit, after taking a $2.9 billion charge tied to the new tax law. The numbers: • $5.3 billion, or 47 cents a share. BofA’s profit in the fourth quarter excluding the tax-related charge. Analysts had expected the bank to report earnings of 44 cents per share. • $21.1 billion. BofA’s earnings for 2017, excluding the tax-related charge. That matches its biggest annual profit since 2006. •$20.4 billion. The bank’s revenue for the fourth quarter, up from $19.99 billion a year ago. •$2.66 billion. BofA’s fourth-quarter trading revenue, down about 9 percent from a year ago. • $11.46 billion. The bank’s net-interest income, up 11 percent. Let’s recount the hits that U.S. banks took from the tax overhaul: • Citigroup: $22 billion • JPMorgan Chase: $2.4 billion • Goldman Sachs: $4.4 billion We’ll ignore Wells Fargo for now (it gained). The bigger point is that, thanks to lower corporate rates and preferential treatment for pass-through entities, financial institutions are some of the new code’s biggest winners.

138,"Early in January, an activist group called Resistance SF projected a sign onto Twitter headquarters in San Francisco that read: “@jack is #complicit.” @jack, of course, is Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and C.E.O., and “complicit” is what we call those seen as letting power get away with something bad. In this case, it was the way Twitter had enabled Donald Trump to troll the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un about the size of his “Nuclear Button,” causing cortisol levels to spike worldwide. Resistance SF was accusing Dorsey of abetting this kind of behavior by allowing the president an unmediated platform. Its condemnation was unequivocal, if rather anticlimactically structured: Dorsey “endangers the world,” it said, “and allows Trump to break his company’s own terms of service to do it.” The range of behaviors “complicit” encompasses is vast. Senator Chuck Schumer recently denounced Trump’s behavior on the world stage as “puerile” and accused Republicans who fail to speak out against him of “complicity in the degradation of the presidency,” but most people see no need to specify such details. It’s already understood that some unspeakable abuse or deception has been abetted or let slide, whether out of self-interest or self-preservation, ignorance or fear. “Complicit” came bounding back into the lexicon last year largely because of Trump, a figure whose rise to power was seen by many as so threatening to democratic institutions that they started to talk about “putting country before party” and “joining the resistance,” as if we all had suddenly been teleported into a Humphrey Bogart movie. The language harks back to World War II, when the citizens of occupied nations were sorted by their moral records — the heroes who fought with the resistance versus the Nazis’ “collaborators.” It also channeled the Cold War: In an op-ed in The Washington Post, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona invoked Joseph Welch, the chief counsel for the Army who famously confronted Joseph McCarthy, in denouncing fellow Republicans who defend President Trump. “Complicit” signaled a challenge to the ethos that all is fair in love and war and business and politics. “I have children and grandchildren to answer to,” Flake said in October, announcing his retirement (and thus his willingness to speak frankly). “I will not be complicit or silent.” A month later, an exposé on Harvey Weinstein in The New York Times described how he conscripted others to enable his abuse: “Harvey Weinstein built his complicity machine out of the witting, the unwitting and those in between.” What’s become clear is that there is a lot of “in between.” It takes a lot of fixers and enablers, a lot of toadies and apologists and attack dogs, to create an atmosphere in which people can mistreat others with impunity. That is precisely the kind of apparatus that is, lately, under sustained attack — not just the villain but anyone who can be said to have cleared the villain’s path. The broad brush of complicity can be used in an attempt to tar almost anyone — just ask any public figure unfortunate enough to have been photographed smiling next to Weinstein. It can even be used maliciously: Late last year, right-wing street artists placed posters around L.A. featuring an image of Weinstein with Meryl Streep, along with the words “She knew.” But the point is that complicity is systemic. It doesn’t just describe individual bad actors; it indicts the whole production. “Complicit” traces back to the French complice (a partner or associate), which derives from the Latin complex — which means “folded together,” as in the ingredients of a cake. It also means “complex.” There are so many ways to be complicit that you could make trading cards and never collect them all. You can be complicit through action or inaction, speech or silence, association or omission. You can engage in outright collusion, aiding in wrongdoing and lying your way through the cover-up. You can take advantage of an immoral situation to promote your book or your brand. But you can also feel coerced into complicity, intimidated or brainwashed. You can look the other way because you fear for your job or your reputation, or because you refuse to feel responsible for the systems around you. "
139,"WASHINGTON — He may be fit to be president, but he could be in better shape. President Trump received a glowing and extremely public assessment on Tuesday from Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician, who stressed that the president’s health was basically excellent: “It’s called genetics,” the doctor said as he explained Mr. Trump’s physical and cognitive health to reporters. Mr. Trump’s four to five hours of sleep each night? Probably one of the reasons he has been successful, Dr. Jackson said. The president’s less than stellar diet? Actually pretty healthy lately — minus the desserts — Dr. Jackson said. An increase in the president’s weight coupled with a high-carb-high-fat diet and an apparent lack of interest in physical fitness were of particular interest to Mr. Trump’s doctor. Yet even on that point, Dr. Jackson had a positive, almost Trumpian-sounding prognosis: “The good part is that, you know, we can build on that pretty easily.” The next challenge for Dr. Jackson and members of the first family will be convincing Mr. Trump — a dedicated homebody, know-it-all and creature of habit — that a new fitness routine will be crucial to helping him shed a recommended 10 to 15 pounds this year. (Mr. Trump’s current weight, 239 pounds on a 6-foot-3 frame, lingers at the brink of obesity on the body mass index, Dr. Jackson acknowledged.) Mr. Trump will be encouraged to lower the fat and carbohydrate content of his diet, and will be encouraged by his wife, Melania Trump; his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump; and his doctor to get moving.

141,"WASHINGTON — Even as he is embroiled in an immigration policy debate that has focused on whether he used vulgar language to describe Haiti and African countries, President Trump is claiming that he is delivering for black Americans — and that they are repaying him with their support. In a Twitter post on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said that “unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded” and “Trump approval ratings with black Americans has doubled.” He appeared to credit the comments to a segment on “Fox & Friends,” the morning program on Fox News. The tweet — half misleading and half downright false — demonstrates how inaccurate information can trickle to the president’s social media, which is then is viewed by millions of people on Twitter and Facebook. “Believe it or not, through all this negative coverage, they did a survey of 600,000 people about how black America views this president. His numbers have actually doubled,” Brian Kilmeade, a “Fox & Friends” host, said during the segment that was broadcast Tuesday morning. Mr. Kilmeade was almost certainly referring to a distorted finding from SurveyMonkey, an online polling company. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the company has conducted 602,134 interviews with adults of every race group — not just “black America,” as Mr. Kilmeade said. SurveyMonkey’s results, provided to The New York Times, show that Mr. Trump’s approval ratings among black Americans actually declined from 20 percent in February 2017, his first full month in office, to 15 percent in December. (This is consistent with polling from the Pew Research Center and Reuters.) How did Mr. Kilmeade and, by extension, Mr. Trump arrive at his approval doubling among black Americans? SurveyMonkey broke out some of the results for The Atlantic, telling the magazine in a report that was published last week that 23 percent of black men and 11 percent of black women approved of Mr. Trump’s performance. Breitbart News followed with its own report on Sunday, comparing the SurveyMonkey results with exit polls from the 2016 presidential campaign. “That score averages out to 17 percent, or twice the 8 percent score he was given in the 2016 exit polls,” Breitbart reasoned in an article headlined, “Donald Trump’s Support Among Blacks Has Doubled Since 2016, Amid Racism Claims.” It is inaccurate to simply take the average of two genders without taking into account the number of people who were actually interviewed for the poll. SurveyMonkey interviewed roughly 19,000 black men and 31,000 black women. It is also wrong to compare exit polls to SurveyMonkey’s results. The company surveyed adults who both are, and are not, registered to vote. By contrast, exit polls necessarily survey people who have just voted. The 6.8 percent unemployment rate for black Americans in December is indeed the lowest since 1972, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and remained at that level in December. Presidents, especially in their first year, generally do not single-handedly influence the labor markets — as Mr. Trump suggests. "
142,"Hundreds of immigrants hoping to escape violence in Yemen and join their families in the United States received an official notice last year from the State Department that started with a long-anticipated message: “Your visa is approved.” But those turned out to be just words. After the third version of the Trump administration’s travel ban took effect on Dec. 8, their approvals abruptly turned to rejections, in what lawyers, family members and immigration activists said was a display of bad faith. The rejections of Yemeni citizens, many of them women and children, seeking travel documents from the small United States Embassy in Djibouti, in East Africa, occurred even though the State Department had said it would not revoke any visas when carrying out the president’s proclamation imposing the new restrictions on immigration. Many of those rejected had been told by the embassy that their visas were approved as early as last July, after being interviewed by the State Department. The approval notices, on a half-size piece of paper in English and Arabic, also said: “We cannot guarantee how long it will take to print it and have your passport ready for pickup. You should check the status of your visa online.” Julie Goldberg, a lawyer in Djibouti, said hundreds of people had come to her doorstep since mid-December. She estimated that more than 300 Yemeni nationals had been rejected so far. “There’s no explanation for getting denied — everybody’s getting denied,” she said in a telephone interview from her home there, which serves as a legal clinic. “It’s complete hopelessness. I have women sobbing.” But the State Department said there was an explanation: However final it may seem, an approval notice is not a guarantee, said an official with the department who spoke anonymously because its employees are not authorized to speak publicly. Such a notice should have been considered provisional, the official said, because at the time, the vetting of the would-be immigrants was not yet complete. The ban’s assurances, the official said, applied only to those holding actual visas. But the notice — with the case number written in pen to identify the visa applicant — seemed like the last word to the immigrants and those working on their behalf. “We looked at it like that for all of our clients,” said Mosheer Fittahey, a consultant for Marhaba Service in Albany, which assists Yemeni nationals in legal, financial and travel transactions. Mr. Fittahey said 111 Yemeni-Americans from across the country have contacted him on behalf of their relatives who received approval notices followed by rejections from the embassy in Djibouti. More calls come daily. About 60 percent of the cases there involve women and children, he said. Mohammed Alawadhi, a doctor in Arkansas, said that his wife, Rasha Alzabaidi, 27, who has a heart ailment, received an approval from the embassy in Djibouti on Dec. 6. On Dec. 4, the Supreme Court lifted two injunctions that had been placed on the second travel ban by lower courts, allowing the State Department on Dec. 8 to carry out the latest ban, which restricts immigration from eight countries, six of them majority Muslim. On Dec. 17, a day when numerous families were emptying out of the embassy with rejection notices, Ms. Alzabaidi called her husband in a panic, Dr. Alawadhi recalled. “She said to me: ‘Mohammad, they shattered families. I am seeing families in the street crying like they have a death in the family.’” Four days later, she got her rejection notice. “I was shattered,” Dr. Alawadhi said. Brooklyn-born Malik Almathil, 27, first applied for a visa for his Yemeni wife, Shaima Almathil, 22, in April 2016. For a year, the couple lived in Malaysia, until she was told to go to Djibouti for her interview in July. She walked out of the United States Embassy in Djibouti on July 31 with her visa approved. As with Ms. Alzabaidi, the approval form told her to check online for when the visa would be printed and she could pick up her passport. She kept checking, to no avail. On Aug. 14, Samerah Alawdi, 38, a mother of seven whose husband, a naturalized American citizen, cares for four of their United States-born children in Michigan, received the same approval note. Both waited in Djibouti until she and her three children were also rejected in December. For people trying to flee Yemen, the rejections have come at considerable cost. With the American Embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital, closed since February 2015 because of fighting between Houthi rebels and Saudi Arabian-backed military forces, most Yemenis go to Djibouti to apply for their visas. According to relatives, they first have to go through multiple military checkpoints to leave Yemen. Or they must travel on a boat across the Gulf of Aden. Many say they sold their homes or cars and took out loans in the United States, incurring costs in the thousands of dollars. The third travel ban restricts immigration from countries that the Trump administration determined had inadequate vetting procedures of prospective immigrants because of faulty information sharing, and had a significant terrorist presence and therefore represented a threat to United States security. The third ban, issued on Sept. 24, replaced the president’s March executive order and was not supposed to apply to anyone who had a “valid visa” issued before Oct. 18. Case by case waivers were available to those who could show that a denial would cause “undue hardship,” that they would not pose a security threat and that admitting them would be “in the national interest.” Omar Jadwat, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, one of several groups that sued the government over the travel ban, said the third ban did not seem to take any special cases into account. “It’s a predictable attempt to maximize the number of people that they ban under this order even when the more logical and humane approach would be to not take away visas that, but for the stamp, were practically already issued,” Mr. Jadwat said. At the end of December, more than 100 Yemeni-Americans gathered in Foley Square in Lower Manhattan to protest the treatment of their friends and relatives being rejected for visas. They came from Queens and Staten Island, and as far away as Buffalo, Michigan and North Carolina, waving American flags and holding signs like, “We want our Mom,” and “We all have stories to tell.” Lawyers in the United States said that there have also been numerous Iranians overseas with apparent approvals who have been rejected since the latest ban was enacted. As in Yemen, there is no functioning United States Embassy in Iran, forcing people to travel to apply in Saudi Arabia; Armenia; Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates; and Turkey to interview for visas. Seyed Mousavi, 24, a naturalized citizen from Iran who is an investment banker in Los Angeles, got engaged to his fiancée, Arefé Fayazbakhsh, in July. He said that Ms. Fayazbakhsh, 19, a student at the University of Tehran, had her interview for a visa on Dec. 7 at the American Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia. The consular officer told her that if she stayed in Yerevan for another two days, he could get her the visa. But on Dec. 8, the day the ban went into effect, while she was still waiting in Armenia, the embassy called her back in and told her she had been rejected. Now the young couple is deciding where they could live, while Mr. Mousavi contemplates giving up his career in the United States. “It’s really hard for me to go through months and months of uncertainty, with the feeling that I don’t have control of my life, and I have to wait and see what the president of my nation decides for me,” Mr. Mousavi said in a telephone interview recently. Ms. Goldberg, the lawyer in Djibouti, is planning to file multiple lawsuits in the United States on behalf of her rejected clients, many of them small children. In the meantime, the embassy in Djibouti is still interviewing visa applicants from Yemen. Abdo Alfgeeh, 42, who lives in Mohegan Lake, N.Y., applied for his wife and three children, ages 16 to 21, in June 2015. They were finally approved for an interview on Jan. 29. “They have to be there for the interview,” Mr. Alfgeeh said, “even though there is a big chance they will be refused like everybody else was.” "
143,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • It was one of the U.S. intelligence service’s worst failures in years: China dismantled American spying operations and killed or imprisoned more than a dozen C.I.A. informants since 2010. Now, an American is suspected of having helped Beijing by identifying informants. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, who left the C.I.A. in 2007, was apprehended at Kennedy Airport this week. Read the affidavit supporting charges against him. • Officials are concerned that the case could represent a pattern of Chinese intelligence targeting former agency employees. • Republicans hoping to stave off a government shutdown this weekend are pairing a stopgap spending measure with long-term funding for the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, effectively daring Democrats to vote no. The bill would not address the future of the so-called Dreamers, the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. "
144,"Suppose that you were asked to assess the state of American society under Donald Trump, the essence of our problems and divisions, without any access to the president’s own words or the media coverage thereof. Suppose, instead, that you had to cobble together your assessment based only on the way the electorate and the culture has responded to his ascent and presidency — by looking at the changes wrought in our partisan landscape, the new sociological and political fissures that have opened, and the protests and mass movements, social trends and cultural expressions have defined his strange first year in office. I suspect this exercise might lead to the conclusion that both race and class, the two tangled areas that so many commentators — myself included — have written about endlessly for the last two years, are less important to our moment than the scale of the media attention paid to them suggests, and that divisions and anxieties around sex and gender are where the essential cultural action of the Trump era really lies. This possibility seems like a deliberate provocation in a week when Trump’s outburst about countries that resemble outhouses has made the president’s racism a headline topic for the umpteenth time. And I’m not denying the reality of that racism, which has been apparent since Trump embraced birtherism and which plainly informs his views on immigration more than the commitment to merit-based migration policy that his minders and managers have been trying to advance. But the same week that reminded us of Trump’s bigotry also brought a striking analysis of how Americans are reacting to his presidency, generated by a large and deep survey conducted by Survey Monkey and written up for The Atlantic by Ron Brownstein. To some extent the survey shows what smaller polls have also shown: Trump’s coalition depends on working-class whites, evangelicals and older white men; he’s opposed by minorities and women and the young; and he has lost ground just about everywhere since his election last November. But the way he’s lost ground is interesting. The press coverage often makes it seem as if Trump is using racial provocations to hold his white blue-collar base while assuming the minorities will never vote for him, and indeed I suspect that — to the extent his provocations have any cunning behind them — he may think about them in those terms. Yet racial polarization in the electorate hasn’t actually increased over the last year: Relative to where he stood last November, Trump has lost white support, including working-class-white support, while either holding his own or actually gaining ground with blacks and Hispanics. His lost support has been heavily concentrated among the female of the species: “From February through December,” writes Brownstein, “Trump’s approval rating fell more with middle-aged blue-collar white women than any other group.” Meanwhile among minorities he’s made gains or held his own by appealing primarily to men, while remaining extraordinarily unpopular with black and Hispanic women. “In every age group,” Brownstein notes, “and at every level of education, about twice as many African-American men as women gave Trump positive marks,” and “among Hispanic men older than 50, Trump’s approval — strikingly — exceeded 40 percent.” "
145,"The Times editorial board has been sharply critical of the Trump presidency, on grounds of policy and personal conduct. Not all readers have been persuaded.

We have also published some letters from readers who voted for Mr. Trump but are now disillusioned, and from those reacting to these letters and our decision to provide Trump voters this platform.

OAKDALE, CALIF. To the Editor: I voted against Hillary Clinton more than I voted for Donald Trump. That said, President Trump has exceeded my wildest expectations. Yes, he is embarrassing. Yes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated ISIS in Iraq, has named a number of solid conservative judges, has prioritized American citizens over illegal immigrants, has gotten us out of several bad international agreements, has removed a number of wasteful regulations, is putting real pressure on North Korea and Iran, has reined in a number of out-of-control agencies, and so on and so on. I loved George W. Bush, but he failed on policy over and over again. If it takes putting up with Mr. Trump’s brash ways to see things get done, that is a deal I’m willing to accept. To be honest, I’m not sure he would have accomplished what he has so far without being an unrelenting public bully. "

148,"SEOUL, South Korea — North and South Korea reached an agreement Wednesday for their athletes to march together under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month, a powerful gesture of reconciliation that further complicates President Trump’s strategy for dealing with the nuclear-armed regime of Kim Jong-un. South Korea, the host of the games, said it hoped a partnership in sports could contribute to a political thaw after years of high tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It came even as the prospect of war over the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests has loomed large. For the White House, however, the budding détente scrambles its strategy of pressuring the North, with sanctions and threats of military action, to give up its nuclear arsenal. This latest gesture of unity, the most dramatic in a decade, could add to fears in Washington that Pyongyang is making progress on a more far-reaching agenda. White House officials warn that the ultimate goal of Mr. Kim is to evict American troops from the Korean Peninsula and to reunify the two Koreas under a single flag. They have cited that long-held goal to buttress their argument that Mr. Kim cannot be deterred peacefully as the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. While a onetime Olympics ceremony is hardly a step toward reunification, the image of athletes marching behind a “unified Korea” flag is a symbolic manifestation of what worries Mr. Trump’s aides. And the prospect of crowds from North and South Korea cheering together would be a striking contrast to the threats of war from Mr. Trump. The White House this week welcomed the announcement but played down its significance, noting that it was not the first time that athletes from the two Koreas had competed together. “Let’s hope that the experience gives the North Korean athletes a small taste of freedom and that it rubs off,” said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council. “North Korean propaganda is in a category all its own,” he added. “It is not surprising that North Korea is sending more cheerleaders and musicians than athletes.” That emphasis on propaganda, other officials said, was in keeping with North Korea’s longer-term goal of reunification. In addition to marching together, the two Koreas will field a joint women’s hockey team at the Games, which begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang. It will be the first time the two countries have combined for an Olympics, and the first unified team of any kind since their athletes played together in a table tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991. The Olympic agreement could bolster President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who has been pushing for dialogue with the North. “This will be a great opportunity to thaw the frozen relations,” he said during a visit to the training camp for South Korean athletes. “If we unify our team with the North’s, it won’t necessarily improve our team’s strength very much,” Mr. Moon said. “It will even require extra efforts to build up teamwork with the North Korean players. But if the two Koreas unify their teams and play a great match together, that itself will be long remembered as a historic moment.” Few expected that the breakthrough in sports diplomacy would lead to a broader relaxation of the decades-old standoff over the North’s nuclear weapon programs. But it provided a welcome reprieve for South Koreans who have grown alarmed and weary over the tensions and relentless talk of war. Mr. Trump has threatened the North with “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” should it put the security of Americans and their allies at risk, while Mr. Kim has called Mr. Trump a lunatic. Despite its wariness, the White House has been careful not to dismiss the talks between the North and the South, provided the two sides stick to issues like security at the Olympics. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he would be open to talks with Mr. Kim himself, though he questioned the value of such a meeting. “I’d sit down, but I‘m not sure that sitting down will solve the problem,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters. He warned that while North Korea was not yet capable of delivering a ballistic missile to the United States, “they’re close — and they get closer every day.” In the interview, Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically critical of Russia, saying it had weakened the global sanctions against North Korea, even as China was doing more. “What China is helping us with, Russia is denting,” he said. “In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing.” Analysts said the agreement would be enormously popular in South Korea. Strong ethic nationalism compels people in both Koreas to cheer for each other’s athletes when they compete against non-Korean teams, especially Japan. “We’re at one of these moments where there is this emotional, if not irrational, exuberance at the prospect of North Korean athletes coming south,” said Jonathan D. Pollack, a Korea expert at the Brookings Institution, who is visiting Seoul this week. A previous such moment came in 1991, when a unified and underdog Korean team won the gold medal in the women’s team competition over China in the World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan. The unified women’s ice hockey team will face Japan on Feb. 14 in Pyeongchang. The problem, Mr. Pollack said, is that North Korea “has put down clear markers about what it wants in return. If the expectation is that North Korea is going to get economic goodies by acting nice, they’re not.” For the United States, the fear has been that North Korea’s gestures will drive a wedge between it and its ally, South Korea. So far, the two allies have stayed in sync, said Daniel R. Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs in the Obama administration. “But it will be harder and harder to insure that South Korea and the U.S. stay closely aligned,” he said. “You have a fundamental tension between a progressive government in Seoul and a hawkish government in Washington.” Mr. Moon proposed in June that the two Koreas form a unified team for the Olympics, but the suggestion was not taken seriously until Mr. Kim used his New Year’s Day speech to propose dialogue with the South and to discuss his country’s participation in the Games. That led to a series of talks in the border village of Panmunjom. In an earlier round of negotiations, the North agreed to send a 140-member orchestra to play during the Olympics. On Wednesday, South Korean officials said the North’s delegation would include at least 550 people. The plan is for the North’s athletes to enter the South over a land border on Feb. 1. So far, the only North Korean athletes to qualify for the Games are a pairs figure skating team. North Korea missed an Oct. 31 deadline to accept invitations from South Korea and the International Olympic Committee to join the Games. But the international body has said it remains willing to consider wild-card entries for North Korean athletes. The two Koreas negotiated to share some of the 1988 Seoul Olympics after South Korea won the right to play host to the games. But the talks collapsed, and the North bombed a South Korean passenger jet in 1987 in an attempt to disrupt them. "
149,"People correctly direct their ire about Donald Trump’s hostile, racist, anti-immigrant policies at Trump himself because, after all, this starts at the top. But there is someone else in the administration, behind the scenes and in the shadows, who deserves more scrutiny and more condemnation for this administration’s approach to immigration: Chief of Staff John Kelly. Kelly is often referred to as the man who was brought to the West Wing to impose must-needed discipline on a chaotic White House. He was the access granter and mood regulator for Trump. He was the adult to Trump’s child. He was the former general who had honorably served his country, now brought in to save it. In the most recent kerfuffle over Trump’s torpedoing of a bipartisan DACA deal, in which he made a racist attack against immigrants from African countries and Haiti, it became increasingly clear that Kelly was instrumental in influencing Trump to flip from a stance of openness and compromise back to a celestial alignment with immigration hard-liners. As The Associated Press reported this week, after Trump requested a briefing on a bipartisan immigration deal sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham, a Republican, and Dick Durbin, a Democrat: “Chief of staff John Kelly phoned Trump from Capitol Hill to advise him against accepting the proposal, and the president summoned conservative Republican negotiators to help build a united front against the plan, which would have provided some border security funding as well as protection from deportation for immigrants brought to the country as children and now here illegally.” Graham was not happy about the ambush or the reversal and pointed out who he believed to be the source of the problem, telling reporters, “I think somebody on his staff gave him really bad advice between 10 o’clock to 12 o’clock on Thursday.” Graham went on to say that Kelly is “a fine man, but he’s part of the staff.” "

151,"Updated, 9:15 a.m. Good morning on this gloppy Wednesday. Rain is gradually changing to snow across the city. By morning’s end, we could see up to an inch as temperatures hover just above freezing. This weather may not feel great to you, but it creates ideal conditions for the flu virus, which — it’s true — lives longer and reproduces faster in the cold: The protective layer around the virus is stronger in the cold, enabling it to live longer and replicate more quickly. We asked local experts — Dr. Katharine Miao, a medical director at CityMD, and Dr. Mirella Salvatore, an infectious disease specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian — to fact-check that and other commonly held beliefs about the contagious disease. True or false? “The flu is worse this year.” True. New York, along with the rest of the country, is seeing an uptick in cases of the flu this winter. “Every year, it’s a big problem,” Dr. Salvatore said, “but this year one of the reasons people are getting worried is because the strain circulating is one of the H3N2 family, a virus that compared to the H1N1 is known to be more severe and less responsive to the vaccine.” “It’s too late to get the vaccine.” False. “The flu season can last through April,” Dr. Miao said, “so we are still encouraging people to get it.” Keep in mind it takes about two weeks to become immunized so sooner, better. "
152,"As a psychiatrist for the United States Air Force, one of my responsibilities was evaluating the mental stability of airmen who handled nuclear weapons, using the standards laid out in what is called the Nuclear Personnel Reliability Program. There is no need to justify why our military would take every precaution necessary to ensure that the men and women in uniform handling nuclear weapons were fit to do so, whether they were in charge of a missile silo or loading nuclear bombs onto aircraft — or giving the orders to them, on up the chain of command. Strangely, the commander-in-chief, the one who would decide when and how to use those weapons, is the only individual in the chain who is not subject to the ongoing certification under the program. According to the program, or P.R.P., personnel who handle nuclear weapons are held to higher standards of physical and mental readiness than other personnel, and rightfully so. The Department of Defense Directive 5210.42 states: “Only those personnel who have demonstrated the highest degree of individual reliability for allegiance, trustworthiness, conduct, behavior, and responsibility shall be allowed to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons, and they shall be continuously evaluated for adherence to P.R.P. standards.” On Tuesday the White House physician, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, gave the president a clean bill of health. And no doubt, by many standards, Mr. Trump is in decent shape. But the standards for a person’s physical and mental health are a different matter from his fitness to oversee our nuclear arsenal. What if President Trump were, instead, Airman Trump, and was to be assessed under the program’s guidelines; would I certify him as “P.R.P. ready” to work in the vicinity of nuclear weapons? I have not had the opportunity to examine the president personally, but warning signs abound. What if I had reliable outside information that Airman Trump displayed erratic emotions? That I saw very clearly that he was engaging in cyberbullying on Twitter? That he had repeatedly made untruthful or highly distorted statements? That his language implied he engaged in sexually abusive behavior? That he appeared paranoid about being surveilled or persecuted by others, that he frequently disregarded or violated the rights of others? These are the sorts of things that set off alarms for Air Force psychiatrists. I certainly could not certify him as “P.R.P. ready” without more extensive psychological evaluation. It does not take a former Air Force psychiatrist to point out that our country finds itself in a place unlike any we’ve ever been before. Saturday morning’s alarm in Hawaii, as residents read alerts that incoming ballistic missiles were on their way, is a wakeup call to the very real danger we’re facing. Global tension and angst are significantly heightened. We’ve been here a few times before, but unlike those other times our commander-in-chief adds, without equivocation, to this angst almost daily with his words and actions. We have always assumed that the person at the top has the mental fitness to meet whatever standards the Air Force set for the rest of the chain of command. What keeps me up at night? The realization that, at the worst possible time, we have a chief executive who I believe would probably fail the P.R.P. The topic of presidential fitness and cognitive decline has always been a legitimate issue. The ability for the Executive Office to function effectively and without exposing the American people to undue danger relies on the mental faculties of the one person inhabiting its walls. Former President Jimmy Carter pointed this out in an article he wrote for The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1994, in which he warned that our country is in “continuing danger” from the possibility that a president could become disabled “particularly by a neurological illness.” Revelations that President Ronald Reagan may have had early-stage Alzheimer’s while he was president add to these concerns. It’s unlikely that the military will act on its own to require the president to submit to an Air Force psychiatrist’s evaluation. But there are other options. A bill in the House, with support in the Senate, called the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017, explicitly prevents any president from initiating a nuclear first strike without Congressional approval. This should be common sense for any politician to support, because it assures that the checks and balances intended by the framers of the Constitution remain intact. But equally important, it remedies a glaring failure within the nuclear chain of command and mitigates one of the greatest dangers of our nuclear ages: the possibility of an unhinged president executing a calamitous decision that endangers millions of Americans, and potentially millions of others around the globe. No president, including Mr. Trump, should have the unilateral power to begin a nuclear war. Congress must protect the American people, and taking away the option of an impulsive first strike nuclear attack is a clear and sane way to prevent a dangerous and insane result. "
153,"AMHERST, Mass. — Evangelical churches today can be found in almost every neighborhood in Latin America — and they are transforming politics like no other force. They are giving conservative causes, and especially political parties, new strength and new constituencies. In Latin America, Christianity used to be associated with Roman Catholicism. The church held a near monopoly on religion until the 1980s. The only challenge to Catholicism was anticlericalism and atheism. There has never been another religion. Until now. Evangelicals today account for almost 20 percent of the population in Latin America, up from 3 percent three decades ago. In a few Central American countries, evangelicals are near majorities. Evangelical pastors embrace varied ideologies, but when it comes to gender and sexuality, their values are typically conservative, patriarchal and homophobic. They expect women to be completely submissive to their evangelical husbands. And in every country in the region, they have taken the strongest stands against gay rights. The rise of evangelicalism is politically worrisome. Evangelicals are fueling a new form of populism. They are supplying conservative parties with nonelite voters, which is good for democracy, but these voters tend to be intransigent on issues of sexuality, which feeds cultural polarization. Intolerant inclusion, which is the classic Latin American populist formula, is being reinvented by evangelical pastors. Brazil is a prime example of the rising evangelical power in Latin America. The 90 or so evangelical members of Congress have thwarted L.G.B.T.-oriented legislative actions, played a role in impeaching the leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, and shut down museum shows. An evangelical pastor has been elected mayor of Rio de Janeiro, one of the world’s most gay-friendly cities. So grand are their successes that evangelical pastors elsewhere say they want to imitate “the Brazilian model.” "
154,"WASHINGTON — Republicans are scrambling to save a heavily conservative House seat in western Pennsylvania, dispatching President Trump to the district on Thursday while preparing a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign to stave off another embarrassing special election defeat in a district that was gerrymandered to stay Republican. When Representative Tim Murphy was pushed out of the House last year after the revelation that he encouraged a mistress to have an abortion, Republican leaders gave scant thought to his successor. The odd-shaped district in the southwestern corner of the state was drawn to skirt Democratic Pittsburgh and concentrate conservative-leaning, steel and coal country voters. But since then, Democratic enthusiasm has surged, especially after the improbable Senate victory of Doug Jones last month in Alabama, and Republicans continue to lose lower-profile special elections in friendly districts — the latest in a Wisconsin State Senate race on Tuesday. That has raised alarms in the White House and among Republican leaders anxiously eyeing the House special election on March 13. Holding just a 24-seat majority, with retirements of veteran lawmakers piling up, House Republicans can scarcely allow Democrats to snatch a seat they have not even competed for in recent elections. And Mr. Trump is loath to suffer another electoral humiliation, particularly in a district that he carried by 19 percentage points in 2016. So a constellation of conservative groups are planning an extensive intervention to carry the Republican nominee, Rick Saccone, a state representative and former Air Force officer, across the line in a House seat that has been in the party’s hands for 16 years, but where internal polls from both parties now reveal a single-digit race. "
155,"Donald Trump has passed his mental test. This may come as either a relief or a shock. The results of the president’s physical exam came out this week. This is normally not a big deal — when Obama and Bush got their reports, it was barely a yawn. But on Tuesday White House physician Ronny Jackson had to answer questions from the media for almost an hour. There was a little curiosity about how anybody who eats so many cheeseburgers could be in good health. (“Genes.”) Skeptics pointed out that the report’s enthusiastic descriptions of the president’s tiptop condition seemed inconsistent with some of the statistics on his weight, cholesterol and plaque buildup in the arteries. If the doctor had simply said “good for an overweight 71-year-old guy,” everybody probably could have nodded and moved forward. But the big news was the mental test. Trump took something called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and got a perfect score. Not perhaps the highest bar possible, unless you were concerned about whether he can identify pictures of animals and draw hands on a clock. But the test can be useful if there is, for some reason, concern that the subject is suffering from … um, dementia. Jackson told reporters that he has talked with Trump many times over the past year and found him “very sharp.” This is hardly surprising. When the doctor has a conversation with the president, the subject is probably always Donald Trump, a topic upon which our current chief executive is always able to focus like a laser. “Amazing report, cognitive & otherwise,” cheered Donald Trump Jr. Have we ever before had a First Child rallying the troops around the president passing a mental test? We will refrain from saying anything mean about Junior because, after all, he was the one who grew up in a home where he broke his leg due to an inattentive babysitter and found his nanny dying in the basement. The next time you feel inclined to say anything catty about Donald Jr., remember that this is a guy who went to high school while his father was litigating an adultery crisis on the front pages of the New York City tabloids and that he was thwarted by family pressure from pursuing his chosen career as a bartender in Colorado.

156,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Voters, One Year In” (letters, Jan. 18): As one who does think of President Trump’s supporters as among the “deplorables” — people who are racist and xenophobic, people who fear the world, people who blame others for all their challenges and woes, people who hate the very idea of government as a force for good — I was fascinated to read the letters from Trump voters. I thought it was a wise and striking decision on The Times’s part to run them in its own editorial board’s space. Indeed, that’s the space they deserved to maximize their impact. Thanks to these letters, I do have a better understanding now of what these writers see happening under Mr. Trump: an end to pussyfooted, mealy-mouthed weakness and to regulatory overreach; a return to forcefulness and certainty on the world stage and unleashed optimism at home. But then I stop and think about what it is they’re really so happy about: reckless threats and pointless insults passing for diplomacy; a rejection of fact, science and even the notions of decency, humanity and justice; a litany of lies and myths as the foundation of policy; and historic levels of incompetence and self-dealing across the agencies of government from the White House on down. Mr. Trump’s more educated supporters don’t seem to see the primordial muck on which everything Trumpian is based. PETER BOODY, SAG HARBOR, N.Y. The writer is a former newspaper editor. To the Editor: How depressing. These Trump supporters have had a year to assess a man who has spent his presidency — when he isn’t reclining in bed watching cable TV while wolfing down cheeseburgers and tweeting mean nicknames — lying, bullying and obstructing to cover up possible crimes against our democracy. Despite this, they’ve yet to wise up. "

159,"WASHINGTON — Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had gathered last spring to consider a resolution calling on the university to divest in companies and countries that abuse human rights, profit from the “military-industrial complex” and promote fossil fuels when the debate jumped the rails. Soon, the students were in a full-scale battle over whether the resolution should cover Israel, with charges of anti-Semitism and racism rattling the room. A student representative who was Jewish said that the last-minute inclusion of Israel “crossed the line from legitimate conversation to a point where I consider it malicious.” The student government chairwoman, who is black, suggested the opposition to the resolution amounted to “white supremacy,” which she condemned with a four-letter expletive. In the aftermath, Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, decided to enter the fray, writing to university administrators to denounce calls for divestment from Israel as anti-Semitic, and to assail the meeting as hostile toward Jewish students. He urged that the black student leader be disciplined. On Thursday, Mr. Marcus received the approval of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to be President Trump’s assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department, a prestigious post known more for policing racial bias and sexual violence in schools than refereeing the battles over Israel and Palestinian rights on the nation’s university campuses. Mr. Marcus’s support for Jewish students has earned him praise in some quarters as an ardent defender of civil liberties with an acumen for the rule of law. On campus after campus, the B.D.S. movement — Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel — has driven a wedge between Jewish students and students of color, challenging university administrations and straining the traditional bonds between Jews and other minorities. And Mr. Marcus has not been shy in choosing sides. Critics see him as a biased crusader whose singular focus on what he believes to be rising anti-Semitism on the campus left will further impede the Education Department’s already tentative efforts to enforce civil rights protections for marginalized groups of students. "
160,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s acting director, Mick Mulvaney, intensified his efforts this week to curb an agency he has denounced as a regulator run amok. His latest tactic: starve it of cash. The consumer bureau is funded directly by the Federal Reserve and sends the central bank a request each quarter for money for its operations. On Wednesday, Mr. Mulvaney sent a letter requesting $0 for the current quarter, which runs through March. The bureau has been sitting on a $177.1 million reserve fund, Mr. Mulvaney said in his letter. He plans to use that to cover the bureau’s projected quarterly expenses of $145 million. “I see no practical reason for such a large reserve,” Mr. Mulvaney wrote. “It is my intent to spend down the reserve until it is of a much smaller size.” The move is largely symbolic — the bureau has enough of a cash cushion to continue its usual operations for the rest of the quarter. It follows other recent moves by Mr. Mulvaney to spotlight the Trump administration’s desire to shift the consumer bureau’s trajectory. On Tuesday, Mr. Mulvaney announced that the agency would reconsider a rule it adopted last year that would tightly limit short-term payday loans. But unwinding or significantly altering the rule, which took the bureau five years to develop, requires a lengthy administrative process, which the bureau has not yet formally begun. On Thursday, the consumer bureau moved to end a case it initiated last year against four payday lenders that it said had deceived consumers by charging illegally high rates. The four companies are affiliated with the Habematolel Pomo tribe, which has argued that it is not governed by state laws and should not have to comply with state usury rules. The tribe, based in Upper Lake, Calif., fought the agency’s lawsuit and denied any wrongdoing. The bureau filed a one-line notice in United States District Court in Kansas seeking to dismiss its lawsuit. In a written statement, the bureau declined to comment on its reason for dropping the case. Mr. Mulvaney also said this week that the bureau would soon seek public comments on the way it gathers information during its investigations. Last month, Mr. Mulvaney criticized that information-gathering process, calling it “fairly broad and fairly burdensome.” None of those actions has an immediate effect on the bureau’s operations, but consumer groups expressed frustration with the approach that they signal. “So far this week the acting director has announced plans to gut the payday lending rule, asked big banks and Wall Street special interests how they would like to destroy the agency from the inside, and now he’s screwing with its funding,” said Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, a consumer group. “What he hasn’t done is offer one announcement about actions taken to protect consumers.” Industry groups, on the other hand, welcomed the more relaxed approach from a regulator they have long criticized as overly aggressive. Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, praised Mr. Mulvaney’s call for comments on the agency’s enforcement process. Many of the bureau’s actions “certainly warrant a thorough review,” he said. "
161,"In contrast to letters from Trump voters that we ran earlier, now we hear from two readers disappointed that their hopes didn’t pan out. To the Editor: I voted for Donald Trump, and I regret it. I thought he would change his divisive rhetoric from the campaign trail and never imagined he would divide this country with lies and racism, bigotry and hate. I see a man working to destroy democracy with the help of Vladimir Putin by using disinformation to frustrate and confuse everyone as they weaken America’s standing in the world.

Democracy will die if they continue. SYDNEY COHAN, WESTWOOD, N.J. To the Editor: Admittedly, my vote for Donald Trump was less for him than it was against his opponent. However, when he won I felt he was in a unique situation to unite the country by showing what an outsider could accomplish if given the chance. I now feel that he’s squandered it. Policywise, I agree with much of what he’s done, but the tax bill could have been much better and broader, and he keeps focusing his attention on inconsequential nonsense.

162,Good morning. Here’s what you need to know:

164,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday voted to extend by six years a law that authorizes the National Security Agency’s warrantless surveillance program, essentially ending a cycle of debate over wiretapping and privacy that began with the leaks in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden, a former intelligence contractor. The vote, 65 to 34, approved sending to President Trump a bill to keep through 2023 an activity that traces back to a once-secret program created by the George W. Bush administration following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Congress first legalized it in 2008 by enacting a law called Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. Under Section 702, the government, without a warrant, may collect from American companies, like AT&T and Google, the emails, texts, phone calls and other private messages of foreigners abroad — even when those targets communicate with Americans. Congress last extended that law without changes in 2012. But after Mr. Snowden’s leaks in 2013, a bipartisan coalition of civil-liberties-minded lawmakers pushed to impose far more sweeping warrant requirements on queries for Americans’ information that was swept in by government surveillance. With Thursday’s final vote, that effort failed. Complicating matters, the bill does impose a limited new warrant requirement for F.B.I. agents to read any emails of an American who is already the subject of an open criminal investigation. But that requirement is so narrowly written that it would not apply to the overwhelming majority of such searches, including national-security investigations and assessments of criminal tips before an investigation is opened. The House approved the bill last week after voting down an amendment that would have imposed a far more sweeping warrant requirement. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, then used a procedural maneuver to prevent similar amendments that proposed reform from being put to a vote in the Senate. The Senate approved Mr. McConnell’s move on Tuesday, clearing the path for the bill’s final passage on Thursday. In the House, 55 Democrats had joined 178 Republicans in rejecting the reform amendment. In the Senate, 19 members of the Democratic caucus joined 41 Republicans in approving Mr. McConnell’s move. “We need our armed forces and intelligence community to protect us, and they need us to give them the tools to do it,” Mr. McConnell said on Thursday. But Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said passing the bill without amendments was “a dereliction of duty by a Congress that has a responsibility to protect Americans’ freedoms, as well as our country’s security.” He vowed to keep fighting “to protect Americans from unnecessary government spying.” "

A new novel by Annalee Newitz, AUTONOMOUS, tracks the eventual collision of a mercenary, who is falling for his killer robot, and a murdering pharma-copyright pirate, who is falling for a rescued slave. Much of the book is taken up with a scary plot about drug copyright, which turns out to be about who owns our chemical brains. But the larger point about living in this world — life after ‘the slow-motion disaster of capitalism converting every living thing and idea into property’ — means it has become impossible to recognize the difference between coercion and freedom. It’s normal to read about characters who are mystified about why they can’t connect. It’s much scarier to read about people who can’t recognize that they’re predators.

She wears them crawling up her blouse in a column toward her neck. “My mother always told me I would have to kiss a lot of frogs,” she said. “Instead, I married them. So this was an inexpensive way to a new beginning.” The story of postmarital jewelry has many strands. There are the emotional tales of rebirth and repurposing, such as Ms. Roth’s frogs. There are the stories of the strictly financial, like when a piece that was once a symbol of everlasting love morphs into a strictly salable commodity that helps to pay the mortgage, a child’s college tuition or a charitable donation. Upon her divorce from Donald Trump in 1999, Marla Maples sold her 7.45-carat Harry Winston diamond for $110,000 and reportedly donated the cash to charity. It was a move that Mr. Trump called “pretty tacky.” And then there are the tales of bitter court disputes, once the battle of the assets commences. Disputed jewelry is sometimes lied about, hidden, stolen and, in rare instances, brazenly worn in public. “Horses, wine and jewelry — they always seem to disappear,” said Nancy Chemtob, a Manhattan matrimonial lawyer, herself divorced. “One client has a wine collection and the divorcing spouse has a party and the wine is all gone. The horse always dies. The jewelry gets sold, even though I wonder if he or she actually sold it. We never really know.” Divorce filings typically surge at the turn of the new year. “I know a lot of people feel it’s the stress of the Christmas holiday,” said Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich, a New Jersey lawyer who is president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. “But I personally think that people say to themselves, ‘It’s a new year, I want to start a new life for myself.’” Limor Shaya-Rosenberg of Roslyn N.Y., would tell Ms. Chemtob right up front that she lied about the jewelry (yes she did) after her 18-year marriage snapped like a pearl necklace. “I told my ex-husband I sold the gold Rolex he bought me in the Bahamas to pay for the divorce lawyer, but he knew I had it. He saw it on me,” Ms. Shaya-Rosenberg said. “I’m wearing it right now.” “He said he bought the Rolex for himself, so it became a battle at the beginning,” Ms. Shaya-Rosenberg added. She said initially she held out hope that their problems might work themselves out, then realized that selling the jewelry meant the marriage was, at least for her, finally over. A need for money prompted Ms. Shaya-Rosenberg to sell a Tiffany charm bracelet, diamond earrings, a diamond horseshoe pendant and more. “There’s a guy here in Roslyn, at Gold Coast Jewelers, who became my new best friend,” she said. She even sold her diamond engagement ring to send her three boys to camp. She has entered the realm of ex-spouses who seek to make a profit off their spurned jewelry, in an embarrassment-of-riches sort of way. Now that she has a son in college, she’s looking to sell a diamond Cartier watch. “I do what I can to keep life stable for my boys,” said Ms. Shaya-Rosenberg, the marketing director for the clothing company Raffi. “I do what I need to do to survive.” Ms. Chemtob can attest to that urge. Clients who can’t cough up the cash for a retainer for her services have offered her an Hermès Birkin bag — one sold in May at auction for $380,000 — a diamond ring, a pricey watch. But she doesn’t take those items. “We don’t do any of that,” she said. “I’m always sending people to 47th Street.” There, in the city’s diamond district, clients can sell their jewels for cash, then come back to pay her. Keeping in mind that the cost for particularly nasty, and moneyed, divorces can climb into the millions. (Gay marriage has not yet suffered the blows of the jewelry battleground, Ms. Chemtob said. “Art,” she said with an air of finality. “In gay divorce, art is an issue.”) Laws vary from state to state regarding marital jewelry. Semantics plays a part. In one case Ms. Chemtob handled, a mother-in-law gave a daughter-in-law a ring that was a family heirloom. During the court proceedings, the mother-in-law requested the return of the ring. The daughter-in-law insisted it was a gift. Recognizing that she might be compelled to return it, she turned the ring into a pendant. “The husband comes to me, says, ‘I was at an event at school and I noticed she was wearing a pendant,’” Ms. Chemtob said. “He confronted the ex-wife, who said to him, ‘I don’t have a ring. Nobody asked me about a pendant..’” In a broken engagement, a ring’s return is often requested. In New York law, “If the marriage doesn’t happen — let’s assume it’s a man and a woman — she has to return the ring,” Ms. Chemtob said. “If they get married, it’s hers.” If a letter from the lawyer is deemed necessary and sent, the ring is often sent back, Ms. Chemtob said. But sometimes it isn’t, and “we hear that it was sold to buy a couch, because there’s a lot of animosity when there’s a broken engagement,” she said. “Eighty percent of the time, it comes back.” The engagement ring, after the wedding, is the only piece of jewelry that is separate from marital assets. The bride gets to keep it, no matter where the marriage ends up. But in the case of all other jinxed jewels, there are plenty of jewelers ready and waiting to repurpose them. Ms. Roth, who owns L’Armoire, a clothing, home and jewelry boutique in New Canaan, Conn., has created something of a side business out of designing new lives for divorce remnants. She took apart a client’s sapphire engagement ring and diamond wedding band and transformed them into a Maltese cross-style cuff. Another client owned a large ring — “Garish, she thought it was hideous, but it was a gift,” Ms. Roth said — that she turned into a platinum and diamond ankle bracelet. She has taken diamonds from wedding bands and placed them in lizard pins, in necklaces. She has taken pink and blue sapphires and the cacophony of colors in tourmaline and turned them into bracelets. “Divorce is the death of a relationship, a defining moment,” Ms. Roth said. “This gives people, in my case, for the most part, women, a sense of control.” And a reminder that life goes on. People become attached to their jewelry, said Danielle Halikias, a sales consultant for M.S. Rau Antiques in New Orleans. “They don’t want the original object to remind them of the sadness,” she said. “A lot of people don’t want to part with the stone. There’s an energy to it, so they transform it.” Which makes some people downright businesslike in their dealings with romantic remnants. Jordan Fine of JFine Diamonds in Rockefeller Plaza tells a story of a couple who came into his shop one day and bought a diamond engagement ring, priced at about $28,000. While the would-be groom was sitting with the shop’s bookkeeper, the bride-to-be pulled Mr. Fine aside and said, “Can I meet with you later?” Mystified, Mr. Fine agreed. She returned with a glimmering engagement ring, kept from a previous commitment. She told Mr. Fine she hoped to put its value toward a bigger bauble. The caveat: Mr. Fine couldn’t tell Mr. Right she had been engaged before. “She obviously kept the ring from No. 1 and was using it to prop up No. 2,” Mr. Fine said. Final value: $35,000. Mr. Fine is circumspect; he doesn’t name names. Jewelers, like psychologists and hairdressers, inevitably know the story beneath the story, like the tale of a man who was a client of Tiny Jewel Box in Washington, where Mr. Fine does business in pink diamonds. The man bought a pink diamond for a woman the owner assumed was his fiancée. A year later, the man brought the ring back and asked the owner to have it resized for a second hoped-for fiancée. Soon after, he returned with a third woman and asked the owner to take the stone out of the mounting. Together, the man and woman designed a new ring. The store hasn’t seen him since, so the thinking is that that one stuck. “He bought the ring, then went shopping for the woman,” Mr. Fine said. Leslie Korngold, a semiretired lawyer and journalist from Stamford, Conn., created a choker from her engagement ring, after the psychologist she and her spouse were seeing suggested they should get a divorce. She remarried years ago, but continued to wear the strand. “I really liked the necklace I made it into,” she said. “Things happen. I moved forward. You cannot attach emotions to tangible things.” Thinking about keeping your engagement ring after a breakup? You might not be able to. "
167,"Among our recommended works of fiction this week is Ali Smith’s “Winter,” an “insubordinate folk tale” that continues her projected quartet tied to the seasons. Two classic novels, Nella Larsen’s “Passing” (1929) and George S. Schuyler’s “Black No More” (1931), have been reissued in time for Black History Month. Ruby Namdar’s “The Ruined House” is an intense novel about Jewish life that won Israel’s most lucrative literary award. And Laszlo Krasznahorkai’s “The World Goes On” is full of the sprawling sentences for which the Hungarian writer has become known. In nonfiction, a wide array of subjects: threats to democracy, ancient crafts, strategy during the Vietnam War, Ezra Pound in confinement and the Nobel Prize winner J. M. Coetzee’s literary criticism. John Williams
Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer WINTER, by Ali Smith. (Pantheon, $25.95.) The second novel in Smith’s projected seasonal cycle is an insubordinate folk tale, with echoes of the fiction of Iris Murdoch and Angela Carter. In it, four characters gather in a big rambling house and have at each other. Our critic Dwight Garner says that the book’s elastic structure, like that of the previous novel, “Autumn,” “allows Smith the freedom to write as if improvising a bedtime story. The combination of dreaminess and acuity is what gives these books their tang.” PASSING, by Nella Larsen. (Penguin Classics, $14.) BLACK NO MORE, by George S. Schuyler. (Penguin Classics, $16.) Racial passing is the central concern of both of these influential, if woefully under-read, American classics, which have been reissued in handsome new editions in time for Black History Month. “For their wildly differing approaches, the novels are both curious about what it means to feel, as well as be, truly free, and how freedom and safety might be at odds,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “They are derisive about fantasies of racial purity, black or white. They are unsparing on the madness of racial classification but frank, and very beautiful, on the lure of racial belonging.” HOW DEMOCRACIES DIE, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. (Crown, $26.) In this “lucid and essential” guide, two political scientists write about the norms that have sustained American democracy, and argue that President Trump has tried to eviscerate more than one of those norms. Our critic Jennifer Szalai, summarizing the book’s circumspect conclusion, writes: “There is no democratic paradise, no easy way out. Democracy, when it functions properly, is hard, grinding work. This message may not be as loud and as lurid as what passes for politics these days, but it might be the one we need to hear.” CRAEFT: An Inquiry Into the Origins and True Meaning of Traditional Crafts, by Alexander Langlands. (Norton, $26.95.) Langlands is a sort of method archaeologist, unearthing the various ways that humans used their hands for thousands of years and taking it upon himself to do things like cutting hay, building a drystone wall and making a skep for beekeeping. Our reviewer Michael Bierut writes: “Langlands, surprisingly unsentimental for someone who made his fame doing historical re-enactments, resists the pull of nostalgia. Yet he makes a persuasive case that the surrender of our lives to machines represents a regression.” "
168,"The coincidence was rich. As President Trump was bumpily rolling out his Fake News Awards on Wednesday night, many of Manhattan’s media elite were gathering to toast Michael Wolff, the author of “Fire and Fury,” the best-selling book about the administration. Earlier in the day, Politico had declared the party, held at the Upper West Side apartment of Stephen Rubin, president and publisher of Henry Holt, a “HOT TICKET” — and Twitter’s “verified” users were abuzz. So I hopped in a cab and headed uptown. “Yeah, I’m here for the book party,” I said to a steely-faced doorman. I didn’t have an invite, but unlike at movie premieres, there were no clipboard-toting publicists. After a short ride in an elevator, I arrived in Mr. Rubin’s home with its bookshelves lining floor to absurdly high ceiling. Overlooking the great room was a balcony, from which Mr. Wolff had given a rousing speech just moments before about the perks of being a White House wallflower. I was surprised to find the far-right conservative columnist and Trump supporter Ann Coulter, wearing a sleeveless black dress and black thigh-high boots, situated near the drinks table and chatting companionably with David Folkenflik of NPR and Dylan Byers of CNN. “I had RSVP’d before the book came out. But then I thought, ‘Forget it, I didn’t leak to him,’” Ms. Coulter said, but using a different F-word. Also, Ms. Coulter didn’t think “Fire and Fury” reflected so terribly on the president. “I thought it was a great book,” she said. “One bad line every 20 pages.” "

170,"LONDON — Well, it’s official. He isn’t crazy. “I’ve found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the rear admiral who conducted President Trump’s physical, said this week. That comes as no surprise to me. Because if you observe him through the filter of class, rather than the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders frame, you can reach some very different — and I think more apposite — conclusions. Donald Trump is a man of his class — the nouveau-riche, country-club class. Louder and more obnoxious, certainly, but of that class. It’s a class I know well. My father was a prominent physician, and I grew up in comfortable circumstances at the Jewish end of Philadelphia’s Main Line. My friends’ parents ran midsize family businesses; had seats on the stock exchange; were lawyers and doctors, senior corporate executives and entrepreneurs who rode the postwar economic boom to wealth. We were a very specific class in America’s allegedly classless society. In high school, I got to know people who were several classes above us — living on the remains of Gilded Age fortunes. One way social sorting among the various classes took place was via country clubs. The Jews had their country clubs, the Catholics had theirs, and the fallen-on-hard-times WASPs had theirs, whose thresholds we Jews were not allowed to cross. This confession is my way of establishing bona fides for what I am about to tell you: What Mr. Trump said about certain African countries and about immigrants from Haiti is exactly what you might hear at any country club: in the locker room, or at the 19th-hole bar, or around a big family table with friends and their kids having the Sunday all-you-can-eat buffet. "
171,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is facing a significant change in leadership that goes beyond the installation of a new chairman. It is also awaiting the appointment of two other top officials who will play a crucial role in shaping Fed policy. President Trump, who has already nominated Jerome H. Powell as the Fed’s next chairman, also gets to pick a new vice chairman. But the other open position, the presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is not Mr. Trump’s choice to make. The New York Fed chooses its own president, a position that is often described as the second-most powerful at the Fed. The regional bank is responsible for implementing the Fed’s monetary policy decisions — raising or lowering interest rates through the purchase and sale of financial assets — and it oversees many of the nation’s largest financial institutions. Some of Mr. Trump’s political opponents see an opportunity to fill that opening with a counterweight to the president’s economic agenda. “The appointment of the next New York Fed president is the most powerful appointment in America that Donald Trump doesn’t control,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which lobbies in favor of strong regulation. “Our job is making sure everyone knows the stakes of this appointment, and making sure their interests as working people are protected.” It is unusual for the Fed’s top three jobs to change hands at the same time. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, plans to step down at the end of her term in early February, pending the confirmation of Mr. Powell. The Senate Banking Committee, which approved his nomination last session, did so again on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote. "
172,"ALBANY — It read like a maddening instruction manual for a do-it-yourself piece of furniture, with page after page of bare-bones guidance — and plenty of room for confusion. If taxpayers and lawmakers were expecting that a new 37-page report would provide a definitive road map of how New York State might sidestep the effects of President Trump’s new federal tax plan and its sharp reduction in the deductibility of state and local taxes, they instead got a view of just how complicated this is. The report, released this week, laid out at least a half-dozen ways New York could rewrite its tax code, with no indication of which option legislators might pursue. There was a potpourri of progressive rates, wage credits and tax-withholding schemes, with officials cautioning that all the options would require further study. No bills have been drafted. The possibilities included completely replacing the state income tax with an employer-side payroll tax; introducing a new progressive payroll tax in addition to the existing income tax, with tax credits to make up the difference; or designing a payroll tax only for wage earners above a certain income threshold — the taxpayers most likely to be hurt by the federal tax plan in the first place. Some versions would be mandatory. Others would be opt-in. More than anything, the report illustrated how difficult it may be to turn academic theory into real policy, serving as a cautionary guide to other states contemplating similar options. And it underscored the political challenges that lie ahead for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, as he seeks to sell a new payroll tax that could slightly reduce workers’ wages, even though the net payout, after taxes, would remain the same. “I am not familiar with any rewrite this substantial,” said David Friedfel, director of state studies at the New York-based Citizens Budget Commission. “On the personal income tax side, it’s the biggest one in memory. I think a lack of precedent is the best way to think about it.” "
173,"MIAMI — When Jacques Despinosse lost a primary for the Florida House of Representatives in the 1990s, he chalked up his drubbing to the skepticism many voters had for candidates from what was then a relatively small Haitian diaspora. But since then, Haitian-American politicians have made one electoral stride after another in the state, winning commission seats in the counties encompassing greater Miami, representation in the Legislature, the mayoralty of the city of North Miami and coveted judgeships. Mr. Despinosse, 72, now a local eminence in Democratic politics, eventually won a seat on North Miami’s city council and served two terms. So after President Trump was reported describing Haiti and unspecified African countries as “shitholes,” Mr. Despinosse couldn’t help but smile a little. “Trump’s racism is a rallying cry for us Haitians,” said Mr. Despinosse, who focuses on persuading Haitian immigrants to obtain United States citizenship and vote. “He’s sorely mistaken if he thinks he’s toying with some uneducated refugees.” Mr. Trump’s comments may have horrified many Americans, but for Haitians in South Florida, they were yet another reminder of the stigma they have faced since they began arriving decades ago in large numbers. They have had to refute claims that they are carriers of disease, struggle to find their footing in a society where Latinos have long been ascendant, and face ostracism from some of their African-American neighbors. Still, the presidential insult is also serving among Haitians here as a reminder of their capacity to overcome such hurdles. And their Democratic-leaning leaders are now vowing to use the episode to bolster citizenship drives and turnout in a state where the outcome of presidential elections can turn on a handful of votes.

174,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. NASA declared 2017 Earth’s second-warmest year on record. And here’s the surprising part: Last year had no El Niño, the shift in tropical Pacific weather patterns that contributed to record highs the previous two years. It was actually a La Niña year, the opposite phenomenon. “This is the new normal,” a NASA official said. Above, a dam near Cape Town, which is experiencing a drought so severe that it could run out of water by April. ____ 2. President Trump contradicted his chief of staff, John Kelly, above, who said on Wednesday that the president’s campaign promise to build a border wall was not “fully informed.” “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. And there was confusion over Mr. Trump’s tweets on another subject: negotiations to avoid a government shutdown. The House passed a stopgap bill to keep the government open late Thursday, but Senate Democrats appear ready to block it. ____ 3. In other White House news: President Trump was in western Pennsylvania to shore up support for Rick Saccone, a Republican candidate for the House. The administration announced new steps to protect health workers who have religious or moral objections to performing abortions or sex-change operations. And our editorial board stayed quiet today, dedicating its space in print to letters from Trump supporters. ____ 4. Amazon whittled contenders for its second headquarters down to 20 from 238, mostly in the Midwest and on the East Coast. The company, based in Seattle, says the move will bring 50,000 high-paying jobs. Many of the finalists, like Dallas, Denver, Raleigh, N.C., and Washington, were considered shoo-ins from the start. But there were unexpected ones too, including Indianapolis, above; Columbus, Ohio; Miami; and Nashville. ____ 5. Dylan Farrow went on TV to again accuse her father, Woody Allen, of molesting her as a child, telling “CBS This Morning”: “I want to show my face and tell my story.” Prosecutors in Pennsylvania asked the judge handling Bill Cosby’s retrial on sexual assault charges to allow testimony from 19 additional women who say Mr. Cosby assaulted them. And the Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney said that sexual abuse by Lawrence Nassar, the former doctor for the national women’s gymnastics team, left “scars” on her psyche “that may never go away.” ____ 6. The California parents accused of holding captive their 13 children were charged with torture and abuse. They could face life sentences. The district attorney said that many of the children appeared to have cognitive delays and showed evidence of nerve damage from “extreme and prolonged physical abuse.” The authorities said the couple wouldn’t let the children eat, shower or stay awake during the day, and shackled them for months as punishment. Above, the couple, David and Louise Turpin, renewing their vows in Las Vegas in 2011. ____ 7. An intricate boat ballet plays out each January on the frigid waters of the northern Great Lakes. Huge freighters scramble to make deliveries before the Soo Locks, which connect Lake Superior to points south and east, shut down for the coldest stretch of winter. Our team chronicled the dance in text, photos and video. ____ 8. This year’s flu season is “moderately severe.” That’s the word from our reporter who specializes “in plagues and pestilences.” (Really, that’s in his official bio.) Here’s what you need to know: Large numbers of Americans are sick, with widespread flu activity in every state but Hawaii. But the number of people hospitalized or dying is not unusually high. And no, it’s not too late to get a flu shot. Above, a triage tent for flu patients at a hospital in Loma Linda, Calif. ____ 9. New research shows that 86 percent of American women in their early 40s are mothers, a sizable jump from a decade ago. The rise was especially steep among unmarried women and those with advanced degrees. Above, a baby named Emma, born from a frozen embryo last year. In related news, we launched a new animated video series, Conception, based on hundreds of responses from readers about the experience of motherhood. In the first episode, we hear from a woman who raised a son alone after her activist husband was killed in El Salvador. ____ 10. Finally, Samantha Bee fiercely defended the #MeToo movement amid signs of a growing backlash. She weighed in on the claims against Aziz Ansari, and she argued that it was time to set a higher standard for sex. “And women get to talk about it if men don’t live up to those standards,” she added. “Especially if that man wrote a book about how to sex good.” Above, Ms. Bee and the cover of Mr. Ansari’s book about dating, “Modern Romance.” Have a great night. ____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

175,"On Monday, Mathilde Krim died. She was a biologist who spoke five languages; who contributed, in her 20s and 30s, to more than a dozen papers on cancer and virology; ran the interferon lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering; served on a team that developed a method for determining sex in utero; smuggled guns to opponents of British rule in Palestine; threw John F. Kennedy’s 45th-birthday party at her East Side townhouse; married twice, had a daughter and later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her historic work in AIDS research and advocacy. At the news of her death, the internet paid relatively little attention. Instead, by the next morning, the leading conversation among women whose voices are prominent on social media revolved around the story of a young photographer who had a demoralizing sexual encounter with Aziz Ansari, after going out for lobster rolls with him a few months ago. The woman, who used the alias “Grace,” recalled the events of the evening, which began with drinks at Mr. Ansari’s downtown apartment and ended with recycled jokes and Uber and sorrow, to a writer for an online publication, Babe. We are meant to infer that the comedian’s self-regarding erotic misbehavior began the moment he gave his guest a glass of white wine when she wanted red — there’s no place for speculating that maybe he just ran out of Syrah. Grace came to view what happened as assault, even if the facts she presents do not warrant the charge. Mr. Ansari, as he put it in a statement, believed that he had been given every indication that what had transpired between them was consensual. He continued, he said, to support the essential movement toward sexual equilibrium that was upending the old order, and the world appeared willing to let him do it — few people seeming to demand that his distasteful persistence leave him expelled from public life. But the conversation had its own momentum. Writing for the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan, whose interrogations of gender are as welcome by young feminists as hymnals are by atheists, was the first to wonder why Grace, pushed beyond her point of interest, had not simply gone home. The reprisals were numerous. Maisha Z. Johnson, a writer and editor whose website highlights her professional commitment “to the power of digital media for social change and healing,’’ for instance, alerted her Facebook followers that Ms. Flanagan was not trustworthy, offering as evidence a piece that appeared in Bitch Media, several years ago, titled: “Douchebag Decree: Caitlin Flanagan, Our First Douchebag All-Star!” The irony trumped the incivility. The piece attacked Ms. Flanagan, in part, for denouncing Helen Gurley Brown, the Cosmopolitan founder, who at the time of the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991 jovially said, in response to a question about whether anyone on her staff had ever been sexually harassed: “I certainly hope so.” A counterargument to the idea that young women ought to just extricate themselves from sexual situations in which they aren’t having any fun soon circulated, maintaining that the culture conditions them to acquiesce, to prioritize the needs of others before their own. “It feels paralyzing to assert ourselves,’’ Jill Filipovic wrote in The Guardian in reaction to all of this. And yet when I look around at millennial women, problems with inhibition or the ability to hang on to a healthy sense of entitlement are not the ones I am quickest to identify. "
176,"A year ago, with an impressive roster of Goldman Sachs alumni on their way to top White House positions, the return of “Government Sachs” was in full swing. The newly inaugurated President Trump tapped Steven T. Mnuchin as treasury secretary, Gary D. Cohn as director of the National Economic Council and Dina Powell as White House adviser. Ms. Powell later served as both deputy national security adviser for strategy and senior counselor for economic initiatives. Anthony Scaramucci, another Goldman alumnus, was on the transition team en route to the post of White House communications director months later. Outranking them all was Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist, who worked at the bank early in his career and who reported directly to the president. Depending on one’s point of view, this was either a sellout to Wall Street by a president who had railed against Goldman during the campaign, or a welcome check on some of Mr. Trump’s more radical tendencies. As the Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich put it last year, “It would be interesting to see to what degree the New York liberals change Trump and to what degree Trump changes the New York liberals.” Now, the verdict would appear to be in: Mr. Trump remains the impulsive, freewheeling provocateur in chief, and much of the Goldman contingent has been banished or is leaving the White House. "
177,"Last Thursday, I found myself in the back of an ambulance with my handcuffed husband, Ravi Ragbir, two E.M.T.s and an agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As the ambulance inched its way out of 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, I caught glimpses of the chaos outside. Faces of friends swam in and out of view. We could hear the shouts and wails of the hundreds of supporters surrounding us who knew Ravi had been arrested, feared he was being “disappeared” and were attempting, nonviolently, with their bodies, to protect him. Ravi’s arrest is the latest in a series that makes clear that ICE is singling out immigrant activists and leaders for detention and deportation. In the past week alone we have learned of three other leaders who have been deported, detained or placed into deportation proceedings. Each of these leaders has been outspoken about his or her own immigration case and has worked toward a more just system for all. Ravi is an immigrant from Trinidad and the executive director of the New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City, a network of faith groups that works to reform detention and deportation practices. Eighteen years ago, he served time for a wire fraud conviction; after he finished his sentence, ICE detained him. He had been a legal permanent resident, but his green card was taken away, and he has been fighting a deportation order since 2006. Ravi and I met through our mutual work on immigrant rights and married in 2010. Even though I am an American citizen, Ravi continues to face deportation because of his conviction years ago. As he fights his own deportation, he works with other immigrants in New York, accompanying them to their ICE check-ins, developing a legal support clinic and organizing churches and synagogues to fight deportation. Last week, Ravi had his regularly scheduled check-in with ICE. Once routine, these check-ins have become terrifying under President Trump, with immigrants being detained and deported after meeting with officials. When Ravi, his lawyer and I walked into the building, we were more nervous than usual, even though nothing had changed in Ravi’s case. We had reason to fear: A week earlier, ICE agents in unmarked vans detained another immigration leader, Jean Montrevil, as he went home for lunch the day before his check-in. He has been deported to Haiti. On the same day Ravi was detained, ICE detained Eliseo Jurado, an immigrant rights leader in Colorado, and a week later, another leader, Maru Mora-Villalpando, announced that she received a notice to appear in immigration court in Seattle. When the ICE officer told us that Ravi’s legal options were exhausted and that he would be deported, Ravi passed out. I held him tightly and he revived; someone called for medical attention. By nighttime, Ravi had been flown to Miami. I spent the day unsure where he was and struggling to accept that my husband had been taken from me. As a longtime immigrant rights lawyer and advocate, I am aware of the horrific conditions in the jails that hold immigrants. I know how deportation tears at the fabric of families and communities. But now I am inside this nightmare personally and it hurts more than I ever thought it would. I come home to an empty apartment, and everything screams Ravi’s absence. Like Jean and thousands of other immigrants caught in ICE raids, Ravi threatens no one. On the contrary, he and other immigrant leaders have led their communities with dignity and courage in a brutal time. That’s why they were snatched — and why ICE wants to deport them. The last time I saw my husband was through Plexiglas at the Krome Detention Center in Miami. After six tense days and a court hearing on Tuesday, ICE said it would bring Ravi back to the New York area so that he could be closer to his family, his legal counsel and his community. But he remains detained, and he is still not safe from deportation. We are continuing to challenge his detention. My greatest fear is that he will be sent back to Trinidad, where he has not lived for more than 25 years. We must keep Ravi, and other immigrant leaders, at home in the United States where they belong. "
178,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it was expanding religious freedom protections for doctors, nurses and other health care workers who object to performing procedures like abortion and gender reassignment surgery, satisfying religious conservatives who have pushed for legal sanctuary from the federal government. The new steps, which include the creation of an oversight entity within the Department of Health and Human Services called the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, are the latest efforts by President Trump to meet the demands of one of his most loyal constituencies. They coincide with Mr. Trump’s planned address on Friday to abortion opponents at the annual March for Life in Washington. For religious conservatives, the new protections address long-held concerns that religious people could be forced to comply with laws and regulations that violate their religious beliefs. Roger Severino, the director of the office for civil rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, promised that he and his staff would investigate every complaint of a violation of “conscience rights” protected by federal law. But civil rights, gay rights and abortion rights groups, as well as some medical organizations, expressed alarm at a move they described as part of a systematic effort by the Trump administration to legitimize discrimination. Their concern is not limited to the executive branch. Mr. Trump has appointed judges to powerful appellate courts at a rate faster than any new president since Richard M. Nixon, and the Republican-controlled Senate is working to speed the approval of Mr. Trump’s lower-level district court nominees. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, said the administration was using the civil rights office as “a tool to restrict access to health care for people who are transgender and women.” Eric D. Hargan, the acting secretary of health and human services, said that the creation of the new civil rights unit carried out an executive order issued last year by Mr. Trump, who said that religious people would no longer be “bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs.” "
179,"Thanks to Martin Luther King Day, this was a short week, but, as always, we got lively comments on our writing prompts from students around the country and the world. Wilmington, N.C., always a robust participant in our forums, was well represented, and this week we also saw many excellent comments from Providence, R.I. Teachers, if your students regularly post to our writing prompts and are sometimes called out here, we’d love to hear what the experience has been like — for them and for you. This is a new feature this year, and we’re always seeking feedback. In fact, the email address to which you can write and tell us is LNFeedback@nytimes.com. Thank you in advance! Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted. _________ Our most popular writing prompt this week was “Where Do You Want to Travel?” Of the “52 Places to Go in 2018” selected by The Times travel writers, students were most excited about visiting Italy, the Caribbean, Costa Rica, New Orleans and Spain. They also recommended several places not on the list, including Hawaii; Puerto Rico; Tokyo; Taiwan; California; Chennai, India; Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia; and Sydney, Australia.

180,"Two releases this month have put the relationship between the press and the Oval Office on display: “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” by Michael Wolff, which caused a media whirlwind and was denounced by President Donald Trump, and that highlights The Washington Post’s standoff with the White House over the publishing of the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s. Here are three books that examine the historical dynamic between the presidency and the fourth estate.  "

182,"In 2003, Washington State was facing a budget crisis and wanted to reduce spending on Medicaid. Instead of requiring people to establish their eligibility annually, the legislature began requiring them to do so twice a year, and added some paperwork. It worked: Enrollment in the health insurance program fell by more than 40,000 children in a year. In the early 2000s, Louisiana wanted to maximize the number of eligible children who signed up for coverage, so officials simplified the sign-up process. It also worked: Enrollment surged, and the number of administrative cancellations fell by 20 percentage points. In 2006, Congress asked states to verify the citizenship of beneficiaries by seeking their birth certificates. Across the country, children’s Medicaid enrollment dropped, despite scant evidence that ineligible children had been signed up. That policy was reversed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The Trump administration’s decision to approve a first-of-its-kind work requirement for Kentucky’s Medicaid program last week has inspired concern that the program will leave behind Medicaid beneficiaries who are unable to find or keep work. But a large body of social science suggests that the mere requirement of documenting work hours is likely to cause many eligible people to lose coverage, too. “Without being tremendously well organized, it can be easy to fail,” said Donald Moynihan, a professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is writing a book on the effects of administrative burdens. Researchers have studied the ways complexity can reduce sign-ups for workplace pension plans, participation in food stamps and turnout in elections, he noted. “These sorts of little barriers are ways in which humans get tripped up all the time when they’re trying to do something that might benefit them.” Anyone who has ever forgotten to pay a bill on time, or struggled to assemble all the necessary forms of identification before heading to the D.M.V., is likely to sympathize with how administrative hurdles can stymie someone. But these may be especially daunting for the poor, who tend to have less stable work schedules and less access to resources that can simplify compliance: reliable transportation, a bank account, internet access.  There is also a lot of research about the Medicaid program, specifically, that shows that sign-ups fall when states make their program more complicated. "

184,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Build that wall!” — a rallying cry to physically protect the U.S. border with Mexico — was a central message of President Trump’s campaign. But his promise to do so was not “fully informed,” the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, privately told members of Congress on Wednesday. Mr. Trump turned to Twitter this morning to contradict his  chief of staff. “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,” he wrote, conceding that it would not be necessary on all 2,000 miles of the border, as parts are impassable. • At a meeting with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Mr. Kelly also expressed confidence that a deal could eventually be reached to preserve protections for the immigrants known as Dreamers. • It was a life-or-death call. In 2013, federal agents took a calculated risk and allowed a former C.I.A. officer with classified information in his luggage to return to Hong Kong. The agents, our behind-the-scenes look shows, hoped that by watching patiently, they could piece together how China had decimated a U.S. spy network. "
185,"“We live in trying times,” Chelsea Manning says in a video released over the weekend announcing her candidacy for the Senate, taking on Benjamin Cardin of Maryland in the Democratic primary. “Times of fear. Times of suppression.” Her unsettling spot is replete with footage of white supremacists executing Nazi salutes, police in riot gear carrying off protesters — all the atrocities of the Trump era in which we are now mired. These alternate with shots of a leather-clad Ms. Manning walking determinedly in the nation’s capital, a red rose in her hand. She is poised, but she is angry and ready for a fight (starting with the Democratic Party, of which Senator Cardin is one of its most powerful figures). It’s impossible to look at that video without thinking of the civil rights and antiwar movements 50 years ago. So many of its images remind me of ones I’ve seen before — police attacking black people with fire hoses, marches on Washington, a young person gently putting a flower in the muzzle of a soldier’s gun. Then, as now, it was unclear whether the best way to confront our enemies was to fight them or forgive them. Then, as now, it was unclear whether the best way to bring about social change was through violence or love. For me, Ms. Manning’s candidacy — in fact, her whole career in the public eye — brings that confusion to a sharp point. When I came out as transgender in 2001, advocates in the generation before mine frequently told me: “The only way to survive your life as a public advocate is to never let people see your rage or your tears. You have to be above reproach. You have to be Jackie Robinson.” I tried, in my own meager way, to follow the example of Brooklyn’s 42. As I embarked on my own career as a public person, I too tried to be above reproach, smiling forgivingly as a student at a university in Ohio attempted to compliment me by saying, “You know, Professor, before I heard your lecture, I used to think people like you should be, you know, exterminated.” I laughed along with a studio audience when Oprah Winfrey sang to me, “Yes, she has a vagina, she has a vagina today!” Later, off camera, I’d curl up into a ball and weep, thinking of the words of Clarence the Angel: “There must be an easier way of winning my wings.” What I did not do was fight back. Ms. Manning is an angrier public figure than I am, but she has good reason to be angry. For violating the Espionage Act, she served seven grisly years in prison, much of it at Fort Leavenworth — a military facility for male offenders, in spite of having publicly declared her female identity on the day after her conviction. During her incarceration, which ended after President Barack Obama commuted most of her sentence in January 2017, she endured a hunger strike and a suicide attempt. I can’t imagine the horrors she has experienced, and my heart truly goes out to her. If I’d been through all that, I’d be angry too. At the same time, I’m not sure she’s the senator Maryland needs right now. And it’s not just me — some of the people most ambivalent about Chelsea Manning are other transgender people, and our veterans not least. Kristin Beck, a former Navy SEAL who took an unsuccessful run for Congress herself two years ago, said in 2013 that Ms. Manning was a traitor: “What you wear, what color you are, your religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity has no basis on whether you are a criminal or not.” It is possible to have opposed George W. Bush’s war in Iraq and to nonetheless condemn Ms. Manning for leaking classified documents in the effort to end that war. It is possible to enthusiastically advocate equality and justice for L.G.B.T. Americans and to nonetheless wonder whether Ms. Manning is the best messenger for that fight. In spite of my suspicion that Ms. Manning is not the ideal candidate, I nonetheless admire her willingness to put herself out there in the rough world of national politics. And I also worry for her, in the same way I worry for anyone who places their transness at the center of a public identity. Since coming out as transgender, I have often wondered whether being trans was the thing that hindered my career as a writer, or the thing that made it possible. In part, I wish for Chelsea Manning the thing I sometimes wish I had chosen for myself — a life of privacy and quiet instead of a life in which you have to sit there smiling on television while a celebrity sings a song about your vagina. But maybe Ms. Manning will also find what I’ve found — that progress is its own reward, and that the loss of a private life is a small price to pay in exchange for justice. I’m not sure she has my vote. But whether she wins her wings, or not, she has my respect. "

188,"Updated, 11:14 a.m. Good morning on this bright Thursday. Here’s something you might not expect to find at a farmers’ market or street parade: philosophy. For nearly two years, Ian Olasov, a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and the founder of Brooklyn Public Philosophers, has set up an “Ask-a-Philosopher” booth in places like Union Square. There, he and fellow philosophers help passers-by with questions tougher than how to get where they are going. The most common question they get (not surprisingly, he said) concerns the meaning of life. “But there are other questions of pressing popular concern that people might not recognize as philosophical,” said Mr. Olasov, 31. “‘What does it mean to say that race or gender are socially constructed?’ ‘What is money?’ ‘What makes Bitcoin money?’” During this volatile time in our country, the conversation has also shifted considerably, he added. “One thing that strikes me is how much public talk there is about how we can ‘know’ things or how the institutions that create and disseminate knowledge should be organized — like the press,” Mr. Olasov told us. “Or the role of experts in a democracy. Or what makes scientific institutions trustworthy?” One way to join the discussion: the Night of Philosophy and Ideas. The overnight philosophy marathon on Jan. 27, from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. at the Brooklyn Public Library, will bring philosophers and the public together for debate, performances and more. (It’s free, and you can see the schedule here.) Last year’s event, which took place a week after President Trump’s inauguration and hours after the first travel ban was announced, drew thousands of attendees. Mr. Olasov remembered the message of the opening address: “We’re at a place where all across the world, people are dissatisfied with the basic structure of society — somehow, liberalism and capitalism and globalization are failing people — and we need to think about it.” "
189,"Since its founding nearly 13 years ago, The Huffington Post has relied heavily on unpaid contributors, whose ranks included aspiring writers, citizen journalists and celebrities from the Rolodex of the site’s co-founder Arianna Huffington. An early example of the unfiltered amateur journalism that propagated on the internet, the contributor pages were a mix of reported pieces and personal essays, and even generated national news. In 2008, Mayhill Fowler, a woman who said she had sold her car to fund travel on the campaign trail, set off a firestorm when she quoted Barack Obama at a fund-raiser saying that working-class voters “cling to guns or religion.” But the site’s days of encouraging everyday citizens to report on the news are over. On Thursday, it said it was immediately dissolving its self-publishing contributors platform — which has mushroomed to include 100,000 writers — in what is perhaps the most significant break from the past under its editor in chief, Lydia Polgreen, who joined the news site, which is now called HuffPost, a year ago. The decision was rooted as much in a move to declutter the site as in Ms. Polgreen’s desire to focus on quality reporting and minimize unvetted stories at a time when there is so much misinformation online. The site’s everyone-is-welcome ethos was once seen as a democratizing force in news. But Ms. Polgreen said in an interview that unfiltered platforms had devolved into “cacophonous, messy, hard-to-hear places where voices get drowned out and where the loudest shouting voice prevails.” “Certainly the environment where fake news is flourishing is one where it gets harder and harder to support the idea of a ‘let a thousand flowers bloom’ kind of publishing platform,” Ms. Polgreen said. Recently, for instance, a contributor with the byline Waqas KH published an article about Felix Sater, an associate of President Trump, that he had been paid to post. The site has since deleted the article. In place of the unpaid contributors platform, the site introduced new opinion and personal sections that will include paid contributors who will work with HuffPost editors. The elimination of the platform, which drove 10 to 15 percent of the site’s traffic, is only the latest change for the site since Ms. Polgreen, 42, took the helm after Ms. Huffington stepped down. In short order, she changed the site’s name and redesigned its home page. Though she is closing one of the site’s most populist components, she has also articulated an inclusive vision for the site inspired by big-city tabloids and local television news and aimed at an ideologically agnostic population of Americans who are “never going to pay for news.” Her first year has not been without its challenges. Over the summer, HuffPost laid off some 40 employees, including the site’s only Pulitzer Prize winner, David Wood. (HuffPost has roughly 210 editorial employees in the United States, in addition to the 340 who work for its international editions.) Within the company, there was a sense that the Washington bureau had been hit particularly hard, which some viewed as unsettling given HuffPost’s long association with political reporting. Also, Ryan Grim, the Washington bureau chief, and Sam Stein, the senior politics editor, left the site last year. Ms. Polgreen has refocused the political coverage to include more in-depth reporting beyond Washington and New York. “We’re thinking less about how many people are crawling around the halls of Congress asking the same questions to the same senators all day every day,” she said. She added that she wanted to have “a large cadre of journalists” who reported from around the country. And while Ms. Polgreen has not been shy about sharing her vision for HuffPost and her opinions about journalism — she has appeared three times on CNN’s media analysis program, “Reliable Sources,” since joining HuffPost and is a frequent presence at media events — not all of her ambitious plans have been borne out yet. Ms. Polgreen, for instance, has yet to hire any reporters outside Washington and New York. She said in the interview that she had been focused first on building out an editing team and intended to hire more reporters this year. Traffic to the site has fallen in the last several years, though Ms. Polgreen said she cared more about connecting with readers than audience size. Neither she nor Jared Grusd, HuffPost’s chief executive, would comment on whether the company was profitable. During the interview, in a conference room that serves as her makeshift office, Ms. Polgreen, a former correspondent and editor at The New York Times, spoke enthusiastically about her global ambitions (almost 60 percent of the site’s traffic comes from outside the United States) and her plans for HuffPost’s business model (she did not rule out offering some sort of subscription product in the future). She also showed no concerns about running a historically left-leaning, labor-supporting website owned by the corporate giant Verizon. “We’re working as part of a company that’s developing really exciting new products that will be consumed on mobile phones,” she said. “And we actually work for the phone company.” "
190,"Ben Sinclair needed to get the R.V. upstate for the winter. The R.V. is a 1977 Dodge Sportsman Travco painted white with black trim. There’s room to sleep four, a kitchen and a shower in back, and burnt-orange shag carpet that has seen a few miles. One morning last month, the R.V. was parked on a gritty street in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, near Mr. Sinclair’s office. The plan was to drive north and stash it in his buddy’s backyard near Germantown, N.Y., leaving time enough to smoke a joint before catching the 1:51 Amtrak back to the city. Mr. Sinclair bought the motor home in July for $5,000 and spent part of the summer at another buddy’s country place upstate, chilling inside. “I put this on the coolest part of their property, next to a swimming hole,” he said, buckling the lap belt (no shoulder harness, no airbags) and easing into city traffic. “I hung out all day with my shirt off, wrote, went swimming. We’d meet at sundown to have a beer.” It sounds like the sort of freewheelin’ lifestyle move you might expect from “The Guy,” the laid-back, luxuriously bearded, unnamed Brooklyn weed dealer Mr. Sinclair plays on HBO’s “High Maintenance.” The series, which he created with his wife and writing partner, Katja Blichfeld, began as a no-budget web show in 2012, garnered a cult following for its empathic look inside the lives (and apartments) of New Yorkers and was upgraded to premium cable two years ago. Indeed, Mr. Sinclair wrote the R.V. into The Guy’s story arc for Season 2, which will have its premiere on Jan 19. But whenever men in middle age or approaching it (Mr. Sinclair is 33) make bold vehicle purchases, experience tells us it’s rarely about engines. Months before he answered a Craigslist ad for a family motor home, Mr. Sinclair began divorce proceedings. He and Ms. Blichfeld made the decision to end their six-year marriage on Election Day of 2016, a fluke of timing that had a benefit. "
191,"Many think the issue of sexual harassment — embodied in the #MeToo movement — will work to the advantage of Democrats in upcoming elections. A mid-December NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey gave the party a three to one advantage over Republicans on the matter. But it is hardly guaranteed to do so. Views of sexual harassment and of gender issues generally differ sharply by age, sex and partisan allegiance — all of which create substantial unpredictability. The issue has the potential to accelerate the growing discontent among well-educated white women with the Republican Party. But it could also intensify hostility to the liberal agenda among conservatives, particularly white men, many of whom view women’s complaints of discrimination as “an attempt to gain advantage” in the workplace. This complex dynamic is illuminated, for example, in the work of Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, a psychologist at Tufts, who recently reported a growing divergence on gender issues between male and female voters under the age of 30. In her paper, “How Gender Mattered to Millennials in the 2016 Election and Beyond,” Kawashima-Ginsberg found that in an election in which allegations of harassment and abuse against Donald Trump were central, support for the Democratic nominee dropped by 15 points from 2008 to 2016 among all young men between the ages of 18 to 29 (from 62 to 47 percent) and by 6 points among all women (from 69 to 63 percent). At the same time, turnout among young white men, many of whom supported Trump, shot up significantly. “2016 saw the greatest number of votes cast by young white men in the past 12 years — markedly higher than their female counterparts,” Kawashima-Ginsberg wrote. Emily Ekins, director of polling at the libertarian Cato Institute, also sees pitfalls for Democrats. In an email, she noted that the #MeToo movement and accompanying protests have the potential to make gender issues more important than economics in 2018 and 2020. "
192,"WASHINGTON — President Trump directly contradicted his own chief of staff on Thursday and said his position on building a wall between the United States and Mexico had not “evolved.” Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, told some Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had “evolved” on the issue of the wall, and that the president was not “fully informed” when he promised to build such a barrier last year. In an early-morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump took the unusual step of publicly pushing back against his own White House, signaling a disconnect between the president and his staff at a critical time of negotiations with Congress to avoid a government shutdown. Mr. Kelly’s comments on Wednesday, which he made at a meeting with members of the Hispanic Caucus, were unusual as well. It is rare to see a White House chief of staff undercut a president’s public statements. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. Such a wall is estimated to cost billions of dollars. In one of his Twitter posts on Thursday, Mr. Trump restated his intention that Mexico would foot the bill. But during a factory visit in Coraopolis, Pa., Mr. Trump praised his chief of staff as a “very special guy” who was doing a “great job.” “He is great, I think he is doing a great job,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Kelly. “I think General Kelly is doing a really great job. He is a very special guy.” Mr. Trump’s effusive praise of his chief of staff came during a visit to Pennsylvania where he was appearing to promote his tax cut and boost Rick Saccone, a Republican state legislator running for Congress in a special election in March. Asked whether he minded Mr. Kelly telling lawmakers he had not been fully informed about immigration, Mr. Trump said: “No, he did not say that. He didn’t say it the way you would like him to say it.” But according to one person familiar with the president’s thinking, Mr. Trump was livid when he learned that Mr. Kelly had described him as “evolving” in his immigration position. Throughout the evening on Wednesday, Mr. Trump fielded calls from allies who described Mr. Kelly’s comments to Congress as undermining the president, stoking Mr. Trump’s fury. The president — who never likes it when someone characterizes his thinking — vented his anger to Mr. Kelly and to allies, according to the person familiar with the president’s thinking. It was similar to a moment during the campaign in April of 2016, when Paul Manafort — who had just been hired to the Trump campaign — was caught on tape at a meeting with Republican National Committee members saying of Mr. Trump, “the part he’s been playing is evolving.” When a president’s chief of staff speaks to members of Congress, it should be a “consistent message,” Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat of Texas, said on Thursday in an interview with CNN. Mr. Cuellar, who attended Wednesday’s meeting with Mr. Kelly, said the inconsistency “makes it hard” to negotiate. Lawmakers who attended the meeting on Wednesday described Mr. Kelly’s remarks. Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, a Democrat of Illinois who was at the meeting, said Mr. Kelly told the group that “a 50-foot wall from sea to shining sea isn’t what we’re going to build.” Mr. Gutiérrez told reporters that Mr. Kelly referenced Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to build a wall and said, “There were statements made about the wall that were not informed statements.” In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night, Mr. Kelly defended his comments to the Democratic lawmakers and said, “There’s been an evolutionary process that this president has gone through, as a campaign, and I pointed out to all of the members that were in the room that they all say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed.” Mr. Kelly also said the president has “evolved in the way he’s looked at things,” in reference to what should constitute a wall along the southern border. Congress is currently working on a deal that would protect some 780,000 young immigrants from deportation. During the meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly relayed confidence that negotiations would move forward for a permanent solution to preserve protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, the Obama-era policy that Mr. Trump moved in September to end. In a Twitter post later on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said there would be no such deal without a wall. The president had recently started to water down his statements about building a wall and told lawmakers last week that 2,000 miles of wall would not be needed because of natural barriers. The wall is estimated to cost $18 billion over the next 10 years and cover 900 miles of the southern border, according to a spending plan submitted to Congress earlier this year. The White House director of legislative affairs, Marc T. Short, pushed back against the Democrats’ accounts of Mr. Kelly’s remarks on Wednesday. “I don’t recall General Kelly saying the president was uninformed,” Mr. Short told CNN in an interview. Accounts of what was said and by whom during recent high-level meetings on immigration policies have already hurt prospects for a broad spending and immigration deal to be achieved by Friday. Some participants in an Oval Office meeting last week said Mr. Trump called African nations “shitholes” in a discussion about immigration, reigniting concerns about the president’s racially tinged language about immigrants. Others said the president used the term “shithouse.” The absence of an agreement could lead to a government shutdown, a risk that Mr. Trump may have increased later on Thursday morning when he wrote another Twitter post that blew up Republican plans to keep the government running. Democrats have said they will not support a government spending plan that does not address the fate of the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, who could face deportation as soon as March. Mr. Trump’s morning Twitter posts and his anger with Mr. Kelly about his chief of staff’s remarks to lawmakers come after weeks of the president fielding complaints from allies and staff members about Mr. Kelly’s restrictive influence. Mr. Trump has heard repeatedly that Mr. Kelly is trying to isolate him, and that senior aides to the president are frustrated that they cannot speak directly to Mr. Trump and must go through a filter. People have warned the president that he faces a massive staff exodus among senior officials, in part as a result of the working environment that Mr. Kelly has created. "
193,"Access isn’t everything. For “The Final Year,” the director Greg Barker and his crew were able to follow four vital members of Barack Obama’s administration as they worked to keep the United States out of war, promote better relations with Cuba and deter Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons program. Secretary of State John Kerry; the ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power; the national security adviser Susan Rice; and the deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes are all seen up close and personal as they globe trot in pursuit of what they see as noble aims. For much of its first hour, this movie is tepid and self-congratulatory, a quick-cutting advertisement for itself. Why Mr. Barker thought it worth preserving Mr. Kerry’s “I’ve been very blessed to be able to go through a progression of experiences which underscore the value of experience” sound bite is a mystery. There’s some juice in Mr. Rhodes’s reaction, more bruised than angry, to a profile in The New York Times Magazine, in which he is portrayed as finding the Washington press corps both ignorant and credulous. Current events arguably place some of Mr. Rhodes’s statements in an interesting perspective. In the final half-hour, things start picking up, not just because of the impending surprise victory of Donald J. Trump and the way these players react to it. The team comes to the realization that it misread Vladimir Putin in its dealings with Russia, and that Mr. Putin is in fact out only for himself. “The Final Year” may make viewers miss President Obama’s people. Unlike Marvel or DC superheroes in the movies, they won’t be back any time soon. "

195,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats are questioning the Trump administration’s latest salvo in its push for strict immigration enforcement: possible criminal charges for local politicians in so-called sanctuary cities. The Justice Department is exploring “what avenues might be available” to criminally charge state and local officials who enact laws or guidelines limiting cooperation with federal immigration policies, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen confirmed during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this week. She said the request had come from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, both Democrats of California and members of the committee, asked the Justice Department on Wednesday why it was looking into the matter. “We ask for the legal and factual bases for this request, and information about the consideration of this request,” they wrote in a letter to both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and to Ms. Nielsen. It was not clear how seriously the Justice Department was considering the question or whether it had begun investigating any politicians. A spokesman said only that the Justice Department was working with ICE to explore all options for holding sanctuary cities accountable. "

Just a decade ago, virtually no countries or cities had a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Then Mexico enacted a substantial tax in 2014, and it started a trend. Soda taxes now exist in India, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. A tax will go into effect this year or next year in South Africa, Britain and Ireland. In the United States, Philadelphia, Oakland, San Francisco and Seattle are among the cities that have such a tax. The argument for these taxes is compelling. Sweetened beverages are the single largest contributor to the obesity epidemic, scientists say, and that epidemic exacts a big toll, in both health problems and medical costs. Soda taxes are modeled on tobacco taxes, which have been hugely successful in reducing smoking and improving public health. But even tobacco taxes are still not high enough, as the economist Robert H. Frank explained recently. And taxes on soda could do far more good if they were higher and more widespread. Today, Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, and Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, are announcing a new global group to advocate for these kinds of taxes. I think of them as “health taxes,” and they can also cover alcohol and forms of sugar beyond soda. The group includes the president of Uruguay and the former prime minister of New Zealand, as well as leaders from Britain, China and Nigeria. "

few newsletters ago, I asked for your help. Could we, together, vanquish Canada? Could we add more new sign-ups to the Australia Letter than my colleague, Ian Austen, could add to his newsletter, the Canada Letter?

198,"Three Jersey boys packed into Walter Kerr Theater in Times Square Wednesday night: a rock star, a former governor (as of Tuesday) and this reporter. What follows is what I saw, with apologies to Bruce Springsteen purists. Well they kicked the old governor out of Trenton last night. Kicked him out of the mansion, too. But down on Broadway, he was getting ready for a night. Seems like the Boss can carry him through. He drove in on his own from out of state; no troopers or cops for relief. There were a few who noticed him slink in tonight, and none who wanted to give him any grief. Every term ends, Jersey. That’s a fact. And after two terms, you just can’t come back. So he put that gray sweater on and came into the city. On stage was Springsteen, in the audience Chris Christie. Since before he entered public life, Mr. Christie, a Republican, has idolized his local hero, Mr. Springsteen, but the love has often been one-sided. Though they have no ties that bind them beyond a shared home state, they both were, at least at one time, the pre-eminent icons of working-life Jersey, and two of its most famous citizens. Now, one is fetching many hundreds of dollars per seat on Broadway, wrote a critically-acclaimed memoir and shows no signs of slowing down. The other has just ended eight years as governor of New Jersey, following a failed push for the presidency and has a murky future. "
199,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Brian P. Kelly, the head of California’s State Transportation Agency, was appointed this week to run the state’s High-Speed Rail Authority, the organization charged with overseeing construction of what would be America’s first high-speed train system. This week a consultant to the authority reported that the cost of the first segment under construction, a 119-mile span in the Central Valley, has risen to $84 million per mile from $66 million per mile. Mr. Kelly spoke to us on Wednesday. (Our chat has been edited and condensed below.) Q. You’re going from what appeared to be a secure and prominent role at the State Transportation Agency to the head of an organization that faces a lot skepticism from the general public and fierce opposition from Republicans. Why did you take the job? A. In 23 years of doing transportation policy in California I have never seen a single project that would have such a transformative impact as this one. You are right. This project has mammoth opposition. I’d rather get in the fight than stand on the sidelines. Q. The High-Speed Rail Authority was established 23 years ago. During that time China has built 16,000 miles of high-speed rail. We are still working on the first 119 miles. What are we doing wrong? A. It’s not that we’re doing it wrong. To be fair, the voters of the State of California did not pass a bond bill dedicating any money until 2008. We are in a position today where there is enough dedicated for the project. We have construction underway. Q. Can you look California in the eye and tell us that this train is going to leave the station some day? "

202,"LONDON — Agreements on defense, security and the treatment of migrants were reached by President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Thursday, as the two leaders sought to protect critical areas of cooperation while Britain prepares to withdraw from the European Union. Anglo-French summit meetings are regular events, but with Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc in March next year, this one has a particular resonance. The British withdrawal, known as Brexit, will bring to an end more than four decades of European integration, and 2018 will see tough negotiations on the future trading relationship between Britain and the remaining 27 nations of the bloc — talks in which France will wield considerable influence. In a significant good-will gesture, Mr. Macron announced that the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the Norman Conquest of England, would be lent to Britain for display, allowing it to leave France for the first time in 950 years. That, Mr. Macron told a news conference, was part of an effort to deepen cultural ties and help the two nations make “a new tapestry together,” even as Brexit introduces new uncertainty into their relationship. For her part, Mrs. May agreed to pay an additional $62 million to help reinforce security around the French port city of Calais, which has been a gathering point for migrants seeking to enter Britain. That money will be spent on fencing, CCTV cameras and infrared detection technology. The payment has rankled some members of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, who believe costs should be borne by France. But Mrs. May defended the policy on Thursday, saying that it was in Britain’s “national interest” to secure one of its frontiers. During his election campaign, Mr. Macron suggested renegotiating or scrapping the 2003 Le Touquet agreement that established British border controls in Calais, but that question has receded for now. On Thursday the two leaders reached an additional accord that aims to reduce the time spent by migrants in Calais, particularly unaccompanied minors. Britain is under pressure to accept more of them, though Mrs. May’s statement made no mention of the numbers that could be admitted. "

204,"We purveyors of commentary tend to find multitudes in the teeniest speck and mirrors of the zeitgeist wherever we turn. I grant you that. But grant me this: America really is about to get the pathetic Super Bowl that it deserves. I don’t think that I can even food-bribe myself into watching. There aren’t enough Buffalo wings in the world. On account of a wearyingly familiar come-from-behind victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, the New England Patriots will be playing, and that’s about as surprising as sesame seeds on a bun. The Patriots perfectly embody our income-inequality era and the tax reform that President Trump recently signed. Their good fortune begets more good fortune. They shamelessly hoard glory. And there’s frequently a whiff of cheating in their success. Shockingly, they’re Trump’s team. This makes no geographic sense: The ZIP codes of his primary castles recommend allegiance to the New York Giants, the New York Jets or maybe the Miami Dolphins. But those National Football League franchises have reliable losing streaks, and Trump won’t suffer that. Also, when he looks at the Patriots’ glamour-puss quarterback, Tom Brady, he sees a younger, less quizzically coifed version of himself, complete with a foreign-born model for a wife. Trust me on this. He just squints extra hard, sucks in his gut and begs Melania to answer to “Gisele” for a while. So he roots for the Patriots. Perversely, they root for him. Well, some of them do. Brady has been his occasional golfing partner and sort of endorsed him for president by imagining aloud that with Trump in the Oval Office, there might be “a putting green on the White House lawn.” We’ve gone from a chicken in every pot to this.

206,"President Trump’s pledge during the presidential campaign to help manufacturing workers by reducing imports from China and other countries sounded half-baked. His administration’s decision on Monday to impose import tariffs on solar energy cells and panels and on washing machines makes clear just how difficult it will be to deliver on that promise. The move will most likely raise the price of solar panels and washing machines in coming years and yet may not even lead to many more jobs. That outcome might sound paradoxical, but analysts say it’s due to changes underway in both industries well before Mr. Trump took office. Tariffs will not be high enough to create new manufacturing jobs because the cost of production in countries like Malaysia and South Korea will remain significantly lower than in the United States. Also, American factories would probably be highly automated and require far fewer workers. Meanwhile, the higher tariffs — and thus higher prices — for solar cells and panels will reduce demand from residential customers, businesses and utilities. That will hurt American businesses that install panels and produce equipment used in solar systems. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that the tariffs could cost that industry 23,000 jobs. Whirlpool, which sells more washing machines in the United States than any other company, says that the Trump administration’s decision, which will apply tariffs to imports from most countries, will lead to the creation of 200 jobs at a factory in Ohio, in anticipation of increased sales. But foreign appliance manufacturers like Samsung and LG have already built or are building factories for washing machines in the United States. So any advantage Whirlpool might enjoy could fade away as a new Samsung factory in South Carolina and an LG factory under construction in Tennessee begin churning out machines, creating more competition. The Trump administration imposed the tariffs in response to complaints by domestic manufacturers — Suniva and SolarWorld in the solar case and Whirlpool in the washing machine case — that competition from a surge of imports had hurt their businesses. The tariffs on solar products last four years starting at 30 percent, falling to 15 percent in the fourth year. Each year, the first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells imported into the country will be exempt from the tariffs. The washing machine tariffs last three years and start at 20 percent on the first 1.2 million units and 50 percent for the rest, declining to 16 percent and 40 percent in the third year. The tariffs, though, could have a domino effect. The Trump administration imposed them under a federal trade law that allows the president to protect, or “safeguard,” domestic industries hurt by imports. Other countries will very likely challenge these tariffs at the World Trade Organization and seek to impose retaliatory tariffs against American exports. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to use tariffs to help domestic industries. Barack Obama and George W. Bush took similar actions to help the tire and steel businesses respectively. But those presidents also tried to strike trade agreements with other countries, with varying degrees of success. Mr. Trump seems uninterested in the painstaking diplomacy and negotiation such agreements require. Just look at his threats in recent months to withdraw the United States from the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement should Canada and Mexico not quickly agree to changes his administration is demanding. The White House needs to put forward a coherent and convincing trade policy if Mr. Trump wants to do right by his working-class supporters. The current piecemeal approach is not working on behalf of American consumers, nor is it likely to put anyone to work. "
207,"WASHINGTON — Under fire for using taxpayer money to settle a sexual misconduct complaint from a former aide, Representative Patrick Meehan, Republican of Pennsylvania, said Tuesday that the woman “specifically invited” his intimate communications, and that he was emotionally wounded when she filed a complaint against him. Mr. Meehan denied crossing the line into impropriety, but said in an interview that when the woman told him last year that she had started a relationship with someone outside the office, he “didn’t respond to it as well as I would like to have.” He said he believed his attempt to make amends — a handwritten letter in which he called her “a complete partner to me” — was meant to be a sign of respect. “That I would find later that that was not something that she was comfortable with, really hurts me,” Mr. Meehan said. “This was a person who specifically invited communication with me so that she would be able to have the ability to be there for me.” The New York Times reported that Mr. Meehan, 62, a married father of three, had entered into a confidential agreement to settle the complaint brought by the aide, who is decades his junior. She left the office after filing a complaint alleging that Mr. Meehan became hostile after she rebuffed his romantic overtures, sources familiar with the situation told The Times. On Monday, the House Ethics Committee announced that it had started an investigation into the aide’s accusations and the possibility that Mr. Meehan had “misused official resources” by using funds from his congressional office to settle her complaint. "
208,"As America’s most prominent evangelical, Vice President Mike Pence has courted conservative Christians on behalf of President Trump and borne witness to Mr. Trump as a true “believer,” though some remain skeptical. When Mr. Pence announced his first trip to the Middle East, he initially hoped to draw attention to the persecution of Christians in the region, as well as nudge Israelis and Palestinians toward peace. Things didn’t go as planned. Mr. Pence wrapped up the trip to Israel, Egypt and Jordan on Tuesday, having been rebuffed by top Christian leaders in those countries in protest over Mr. Trump’s decision last month to break with decades of American policy — and recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. It’s still mysterious just how Mr. Trump believes he has advanced the cause of peace, or fortified America’s standing in the world, with that decision. Its costs in terms of American isolation, on the other hand, were evident throughout the trip. Mr. Pence also didn’t meet with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who flew instead to Brussels to ask European leaders for protection from Mr. Trump’s bad decisions. Neither did Mr. Pence sit down with other Palestinian leaders, any Israeli-Arab citizens, or Israeli opposition members. During Mr. Pence’s stops in Amman and Cairo, King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt criticized the Jerusalem decision (although secret tapes reported by The Times suggest the Egyptians acquiesced in Mr. Trump’s choice). "
209,"WASHINGTON — The bipartisan group of senators who intervened to help end the government shutdown now faces an even more formidable task: freeing the Senate — and perhaps Washington — from its dysfunctional rut. In sidestepping Senate leaders of both parties, members of the group have taken it upon themselves to not only quickly resolve an immigration dispute that has long defied answers, but also prove that the Senate’s frozen legislative gears can still turn. “Part of our biggest challenge is letting the Senate be the Senate,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and one of about two dozen lawmakers who came together to pressure Republican and Democratic leaders to abandon the shutdown. It is a pragmatic group of centrists from both parties — a mix of red-state Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota; independent-minded conservative Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; a possible presidential prospect in Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota; and a past vice-presidential nominee in Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. It has senior Republican committee leaders such as Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, fellow Tennesseans, as well as a brand new member of the Senate in Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama. Mr. Alexander identified a common thread tying them together in their drive for an immigration answer. “There is a pent-up demand by accomplished senators who want to act like senators,” he said. With a few more Democrats than Republicans among its members and a goal of bringing more from each side into the mix, the group intends to show that it can produce critical mass behind new immigration legislation as well as demonstrate the power of bipartisanship.

211,"WASHINGTON — It is easy to see why President Trump is fond of Mike Pompeo, the director of the C.I.A. Mr. Pompeo proudly plays up his conservative credentials, and he rarely passes up a chance to talk tough — except when it comes to Mr. Trump, of course. In Mr. Pompeo’s telling, the president is a sophisticated consumer of intelligence, and under his leadership, the C.I.A. is being reshaped into a leaner, more flexible organization whose officers have been freed to focus on stealing secrets, eliminating the United States’ enemies and giving Mr. Trump the delicate information he needs to confront the challenges facing the country. “I have seen 25-year intelligence professionals receive briefings,” Mr. Pompeo said on Tuesday. “I will tell you that President Trump is the kind of recipient of our information at the same level as they are.” In a pair of public appearances this week, Mr. Pompeo, 54, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, marked his first year as C.I.A. director — a span that has, by most accounts, been outwardly smoother than many would have guessed. The concerns at the outset were widespread. Mr. Pompeo’s reputation as a partisan bulldog was hardly the typical profile for a role that is intended to be apolitical. And Mr. Trump spent the weeks before taking office attacking the agency, mocking the assessment that Russia meddled in the presidential election and once comparing intelligence officials to Nazis. On his first full day as president, Mr. Trump stood in front of the agency’s memorial wall, which honors officers killed in the line of duty, and bragged about inflated crowd sizes at his inauguration. Yet since then, Mr. Trump has largely spared the C.I.A. the kind of political attacks that he has leveled against the Justice Department and the F.B.I., both of which he has painted as being staffed by disloyal partisans out to undermine his presidency. Some of Mr. Trump’s silence can be credited to Mr. Pompeo, who appears to be pulling off a political balancing act: He has won over officials at America’s premier spy agency, many of whom were deeply offended by Mr. Trump’s attacks, while persuading the president of the C.I.A.’s value and its loyalty. Mr. Pompeo has managed to establish himself as one of the president’s favorite cabinet members — Mr. Trump has even considered naming the spy chief secretary of state — and one of the most overtly political spy chiefs in a generation. He appears to share Mr. Trump’s bombastic manner and uses far starker language than most C.I.A. directors. That was the case on Monday, when Mr. Pompeo, in an interview broadcast on “CBS This Morning,” said that his goal was ensure the C.I.A. “will be more vicious, more aggressive, more inclined to take risks to come directly at the threats that America and the world faces.” When in Washington, Mr. Pompeo personally delivers Mr. Trump’s daily intelligence briefing, and he readily joins the fray when the president veers into policy and political discussions, topics that past directors typically sought to avoid. Mr. Pompeo has shown a similar eagerness to express his views in public forums, making clear his skepticism of the Obama administration’s deal to limit Iran’s nuclear weapons program, playing down talk of Russian interference in the election last year, and talking at length about the need to stop North Korea’s nuclear program, even if that means using military force. Those issues all came up in Mr. Pompeo’s appearances this week. But his focus was on talking about how he has reshaped the C.I.A. In an appearance on Tuesday at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank in Washington, Mr. Pompeo boasted that he had pared back bureaucracy at the agency, reducing the decisions that had to be personally approved by the director “by 40 percent.” The United States’ list of rivals and enemies is long — it includes global powers as well as international criminal networks — and “we need to have a bias toward being as nimble as our adversaries,” Mr. Pompeo said. He made his point with an anecdote: “I was sitting in a very long meeting with some very senior officials and I was asked, ‘Boy, if we did X, what would our adversaries do?’” Mr. Pompeo recounted. “And I responded by saying, ‘They sure as heck won’t have a meeting like this.’” The audience laughed. “That’s exactly what happened in the meeting, too,” he said. The changes he has made at the C.I.A. have resulted in substantive achievements, though few could be discussed publicly, Mr. Pompeo said. He did offer one example, saying that the C.I.A.’s work had helped stop the flow of supplies vital to North Korea. But he provided no other details. Mr. Pompeo has given only a handful of speeches and interviews since taking over the C.I.A. Most of his appearances have been at forums familiar to neoconservatives, where he tends to find receptive audiences and his assertions about the inner workings of the Trump administration are rarely challenged. The audience’s questions on Tuesday focused largely on North Korea, Iran and the other issues that tend to occupy the Washington national security establishment, including the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Pompeo’s assertions about the president’s handling of the daily intelligence briefings went unchallenged, even though they run counter to accounts from other administration insiders. There was no talk about whether the president’s Twitter messages, such as calling North Korea’s ruler, Kim Jong-un, “Little Rocket Man,” affected the C.I.A. Still, Mr. Pompeo struck a more moderate tone than he has in past appearances this year, like over the summer when he seemed to suggest that the United States should consider leadership change in North Korea. On Tuesday, though, he made clear that a diplomatic solution to end that country’s nuclear weapons program was the goal. But Mr. Pompeo still managed to echo the president’s view that the current administration has been left with a mess by its predecessors. “Frankly, we have been whistling past the graveyard for decades” on some threats facing the United States, Mr. Pompeo said. “And you should know that when I say decades, that is Republican presidents, Democrat presidents, Republican Congresses of which I was a member, and Democrats who are members of our legislative branch, as well.” "
212,"Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, will become the first United States senator to give birth while in that office when she delivers her second child this spring, she announced on Tuesday. Ms. Duckworth, who gave birth to her daughter Abigail in November 2014 while serving in the House of Representatives, is already one of only 10 women who have given birth while serving in Congress. Her Senate colleague Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, gave birth to a son during her tenure as a United States representative. “Bryan and I are thrilled that our family is getting a little bit bigger, and Abigail is ecstatic to welcome her baby sister home this spring,” Ms. Duckworth said in a statement that referred to her husband and daughter. “We are all so grateful for the love and support of our friends and family, and I want to thank the wonderful staff at both Northwestern Medicine and GW for everything they’ve done to help us in our decades-long journey to complete our family.” Ms. Duckworth, 49, told The Chicago Sun-Times in an article published on Tuesday that she and her husband tried various fertilization methods before Abigail was conceived through a form of in vitro fertilization. She said she decided to run for the Senate while on maternity leave. After Abigail’s cesarean birth, Ms. Duckworth told The Sun-Times, she had to wait 18 months to try again; she also said she had a miscarriage during her 2016 Senate campaign. “I’ve had multiple IVF cycles and a miscarriage trying to conceive again, so we’re very grateful,” she told the newspaper. A spokesman for Ms. Duckworth confirmed the details of The Sun-Times article to The New York Times. After Abigail was born, Ms. Duckworth introduced legislation titled “Friendly Airports for Mothers Act,” which, she wrote in an opinion piece for Cosmopolitan, “would ensure that all large-and medium-size airports have accessible, safe, clean and convenient lactation rooms for travelers — at no extra cost for taxpayers or airports.” (It passed the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in June as part of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act and is awaiting full Senate consideration, the spokesman said.) In its statement, Ms. Duckworth’s office said the senator’s experiences as a working mother allow her to bring an “important” and “underrepresented” perspective to Congress. “Parenthood isn’t just a women’s issue, it’s an economic issue and an issue that affects all parents — men and women alike,” she said. “As tough as juggling the demands of motherhood and being a senator can be, I’m hardly alone or unique as a working parent, and Abigail has only made me more committed to doing my job and standing up for hardworking families everywhere.” Ms. Duckworth’s announcement came less than a week after the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, said she and her partner were expecting a child. On Saturday Ms. Duckworth drew attention when she called President Trump a “five-deferment draft dodger.” In addition to being a wife, mother and a United States senator, Ms. Duckworth is also a veteran of the Iraq war who lost both of her legs when her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a tour in 2004. "
213,"ZEBULON, N.C. — At this century-old farm just outside Durham, symmetrical rows of shining blue solar panels have replaced the soybeans and tobacco that Tommy Vinson and his family used to grow here. It is one of many solar farms that have sprung up around North Carolina, transforming a state long battered by global offshoring into the second-largest generator of solar electricity after California. “It’s still reaping a very good harvest,” said April Vinson, who is married to Tommy. “It’s just not a traditional kind of farm.” Across North Carolina, textile factories and tobacco farms have disappeared, giving way to fields of solar panels. But for those venturing into solar farming like Mr. Vinson, the future of this vibrant industry is now cloudy. On Monday, the Trump administration announced that it would impose steep tariffs on imported solar panels, which could raise the cost of solar power in the years ahead, slowing adoption of the technology and costing jobs. Mr. Trump has long championed trade barriers as a way to protect United States manufacturers from foreign competitors. On Monday, he also slapped tariffs on imported washing machines, and his advisers say additional measures on steel, aluminum and other products will soon be coming. “Our action today helps to create jobs in America for Americans,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. The two solar companies that had sought the tariffs, Suniva and SolarWorld Americas, argue that low-cost imports have decimated American manufacturing of solar cells and modules in recent years. Today, 95 percent of the solar panels used in the United States are imported from countries like Malaysia and South Korea, and the companies contend that tariffs are needed to protect the nation’s remaining solar factories. “Today the president is sending a message that American innovation and manufacturing will not be bullied out of existence without a fight,” Suniva said on Monday. But while the tariffs may help domestic manufacturers, they are expected to ripple throughout the industry in ways that may ultimately hurt American companies and their workers. Energy experts say it is unlikely that the tariffs will create more than a small number of American solar manufacturing jobs, since low-wage countries will continue to have a competitive edge. Solar manufacturing now represents just a fraction of the overall jobs that have developed around the solar industry. More than 260,000 Americans are employed in the sector, but fewer than 2,000 of those employed in the United States are manufacturing solar cells and modules, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Far more workers are employed in areas that underpin the use of solar technology, such as making steel racks that angle the panels toward the sun. And the bulk of workers in the solar industry install and maintain the projects, a process that is labor-intensive and hard to automate. The tariffs the president announced start at 30 percent next year and ultimately fall to 15 percent by the fourth year. In each of the four years, the first 2.5 gigawatts of imported solar cells will be exempted from the tariff. But by raising the cost of one all-important ingredient, the tariffs could make solar power less competitive with other sources of energy, like gas and wind, resulting in the construction of fewer solar projects. On Tuesday, the Solar Energy Industries Association said that the president’s action would result in the loss of roughly 23,000 jobs in the solar industry this year, as well as the delay or cancellation of billions of dollars of investments. At the Wakefield solar farm, the five-megawatt project on the Vinson family’s land, the cells that collect solar energy are imported — they were manufactured by JA Solar, a Chinese company, which makes cells and panels in China and Malaysia. But the steel frames that the panels rest on are American made, manufactured by RBI Solar, which is based in Cincinnati. The steel that RBI Solar used to make these racks is also American, bought from Worthington Industries in Ohio and Attala Steel in Mississippi. The project was developed and is now operated by Cypress Creek Renewables, a growing company that employs engineers, electricians and drone pilots in a new glass and brick office building in Durham. It was built by Horne Brothers Construction, which at the project’s peak hired about 50 people to drive piles and install the solar panels. And then there are the Vinsons, the farming family who now have a steady income from leasing their land that allowed Tommy’s mother, Martha, to comfortably retire. On a brisk day this month, the Vinsons sidestepped puddles of melting snow as they walked through rows of solar panels. But the sun was still shining, and the air above the panels shimmered with heat. Built on a 30-acre site, the project now produces enough power for 1,000 homes — including, potentially, that of the Vinsons, who live just a mile away. In North Carolina, state laws and tax incentives that favor solar projects selling power directly to the electrical grid have helped the industry expand to the point where it now powers more than 400,000 homes and employs around 7,000 people. “Everything you see here, with the exception of the module, was built in America,” said Tom Kosto, the executive vice president of Horne Brothers Construction. Mr. Kosto’s company has expanded in the last three years to 350 full-time employees, from just 30, and he said he planned to hire 100 more people this year. He pays his employees an average of $17.31, with benefits. But he said the tariffs would force his company to cut back on its expansion plans. “We’re a profitable company, but with one stroke of the pen, they can take that away,” Mr. Kosto said. “All you’re doing is you’re putting thousands of jobs at risk for jobs that aren’t coming back.” The move is expected to hit utility-scale solar projects like this one, which sell their electricity to power companies, particularly hard. Home and business owners may decide to continue buying solar panels for their rooftops, even if the price is a little higher. But when solar projects sell to a utility company, they compete with other sources of energy, and every cent counts. Over the last eight years, an influx of cheap imported panels has driven down the cost of solar projects by 85 percent, according to Lazard, a financial advisory company. As a result, the number of solar installations has soared to 12 gigawatts last year, from less than one gigawatt in 2010. While the tariffs are likely to slow the adoption of solar power in the United States, they will not entirely halt the industry. An analysis by GTM Research found that solar installations will continue to rise from 2018 to 2022, though there will be 11 percent fewer panels installed as a result of the tariffs. One reason for the muted effect: Solar cells and modules account for one-third or less of the overall cost of solar systems, and the industry has been relentlessly cutting the costs of all components. All told, the tariffs will increase the cost of utility-scale solar projects by about 10 percent and residential rooftop systems by just 3 percent — raising them roughly to prices seen two years ago. But even a small price increase could slow the industry’s growth in states where solar already faces fierce competition from cheap natural gas, such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or Texas. “In the Southeast in particular, we were just starting to see solar compete at the margins with natural gas,” said MJ Shiao, a solar analyst at GTM Research. Duke Energy, a major utility company in North Carolina, said Tuesday that the tariff would cause it to carefully evaluate the economics of each of its solar projects. The company currently owns more than 800 megawatts of solar power capacity and had planned to build and buy more than 3,000 megawatts in the next five years. Many analysts say the tariff may fall short of its goal of reviving solar manufacturing in the United States. While at least one company has reportedly expressed interest in opening a 1,000-worker module assembly plant in Jacksonville, Fla., that is likely to be a rare case. “This tariff only puts module prices back to where they were in 2015 or 2016, and U.S. manufacturers weren’t competitive then,” said Varun Sivaram, an expert on solar power at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the meantime, the companies involved with the long rows of solar panels that have cropped up on the Vinson’s land — Cypress Creek, the project’s designer; RBI Solar, which made the mounting system; and Horne Brothers Construction — expect to be hurt by the measure. “Every percentage point of tariff is going to mean projects which will no longer be built, because they are no longer economically viable,” said Matthew McGovern, the chief executive of Cypress Creek Renewables. “We’ll lose projects, no question.” "
214,"The years immediately following the 2008 financial crisis were a golden age of inflation derp, at various levels. There were the Glenn Beck/Ron Paul frothing-at-the-mouth Austrian types predicting hyperinflation just around the corner. But there were also the seemingly respectable monetary “experts,” from Alan Greenspan to Allan Meltzer to John Taylor, who kept predicting high inflation from deficits and/or quantitative easing.

216,"WASHINGTON — President Trump asked the man he was considering as temporary F.B.I. director how he had voted in the 2016 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The question was directed to Andrew G. McCabe, the bureau’s deputy director. Mr. Trump abruptly fired the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, in May, and at the time, the president openly discussed the need for any successor to be “loyal,” according to an adviser to the president. The week that Mr. Comey was fired, Mr. McCabe met with Mr. Trump a handful of times, a person familiar with the meetings said. It was at one of those meetings that Mr. Trump asked Mr. McCabe whom he had voted for, another person familiar with the encounters said. Mr. McCabe said he had not voted. The exchange was first reported by The Washington Post. The question was unusually and overtly political for an interview related to a position in the Justice Department, which is supposed to maintain its independence from politics. At their final meeting, Mr. Trump offered Mr. McCabe the job and told him he planned to give him the role of acting director. The president also said that he planned to make an appearance that week at F.B.I. Headquarters to bolster morale. Mr. McCabe told Mr. Trump that it would be a risky move after firing a well-respected director, so the president scuttled the trip, citing scheduling conflicts. For weeks, Mr. Trump and his allies have focused their ire on Mr. McCabe. Mr. McCabe’s wife was a candidate for Virginia State Senate in 2015, and she received donations from the “super PAC” supporting Terry McAuliffe, the state’s governor at the time, who was a longtime ally of Hillary Clinton’s. A White House official confirmed Tuesday night that Mr. Trump had asked the question, saying it was in the context of first asking about Mr. McCabe’s family, which led to a discussion about Mr. McAuliffe and then to how Mr. McCabe had voted. The F.B.I. declined to comment. Mr. Trump has also assailed the independence of the F.B.I., and has described its reputation as being “in Tatters,” a stunning broadside from a sitting president against a law enforcement agency he oversees. Mr. Comey has testified publicly and under oath that Mr. Trump asked for his loyalty in one of their meetings. Mr. Trump has denied the allegation. "
217,"WASHINGTON — Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, spent the weekend managing the shutdown of the federal government. On Tuesday, he turned his attention back to his secondary job running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency he would probably shut down if he could. In a 1,118 word mission statement that was sent to the bureau’s staff on Tuesday, Mr. Mulvaney, the acting director, outlined a vision for an agency that enforces financial regulations and consumer protections with “humility and prudence” and that will no longer “push the envelope” when it comes to jurisdiction and scope. Mr. Mulvaney insisted that he would not shutter the bureau, if only because doing so would be against the law. “When I arrived at C.F.P.B., I told folks that despite what they might have heard, I had no intention of shutting down the Bureau,” Mr. Mulvaney wrote. “Indeed, the law doesn’t allow that, and as members of the Executive Branch we are charged with faithfully executing the laws.” The consumer bureau, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, has been an ongoing target of Republican lawmakers, who complain that its mandate is too broad, that it has too much power and that its director is unaccountable. The agency is loathed by Republicans because its authority is intended to be independent of the White House and Congress. In the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Mulvaney directly attacked the approach of his predecessor, Richard Cordray, who left late last year. Mr. Cordray, he said, viewed the bureau as an agency of “good guys” fighting “bad guys” who modeled himself as the “new sheriff in town” with a broad mandate to crack down on businesses as he saw fit. Mr. Mulvaney’s missive also incorrectly quotes Mr. Cordray discussing his strategy of “pushing the envelope” in a Politico Magazine story. That remark was made by an anonymous former CFPB official, not Mr. Cordray. "
218,"DAVOS, Switzerland — By any measure, he made a lot of money, the kid from Queens, maybe not as much as he boasted, but a fortune. And yet never accepted, never respected, he remained on the outside pressing his nose against the window of the club of elites he both revered and resented. So when President Trump arrives in this snowy, mountaintop resort where financial titans mingle with heads of state in an annual saturnalia of capitalism, it may feel like a moment of vindication. Never invited when he was merely a businessman, Mr. Trump will arrive on Thursday as leader of the world’s last superpower, commanding attention if not admiration. Whatever else, he cannot be ignored now. “Part of him will feel the resentment that has long smoldered within and part will revel in the fact that he’s the president and no one else is,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer. “Considering his tendency to say or tweet whatever comes to mind, we might expect both Trumps — the testy one and the triumphant one — to appear. We may even see and hear him toggle between the two, uncertain if he’s superior or inferior.” Mr. Trump’s decision to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, something American presidents generally avoid lest they look out of touch hanging out with the jet-setting crowd, sets the stage for one of the most intriguing encounters of his year-old presidency. Not only will he finally crash the party that would not have him, but he will also bring his protectionist, “America First” message to the ground zero of globalization, addressing the very people he has cast as the villains of his political narrative. The president foreshadowed the awkward and perhaps tense visit by slapping tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines just before departing Washington. “I’m going to Davos,” Mr. Trump said after signing the orders. “We’ll be talking about investing in the United States again, for people to come in and spend their money in the good old U.S.A.” Rather than touting the virtues of lowering economic barriers, Mr. Trump will promote the growing American economy and argue for foreign investment.

220,"The leaders of 21 global aid organizations asked the Trump administration on Wednesday to restore withheld funds to the United Nations agency that helps Palestinians, calling the funding cut a “dangerous and striking departure” from a history of American generosity. In a letter to top administration officials, the groups’ leaders expressed concern that the White House’s decision to withhold more than half of the planned contribution to the agency, if maintained, would disrupt Palestinian access to food, health care, education “and other critical support to vulnerable populations.” The administration announced last week that it was withholding $65 million from a scheduled payment of $125 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which aids more than five million Palestinians in refugee camps across the Middle East. The announcement came after Palestinian leaders had accused the administration of blatantly siding with Israel in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict and dimming prospects for a Palestinian state that would exist side by side with Israel. Administration officials said that restoration of the aid depended partly on the Palestinian aid agency’s making unspecified reforms, and that withholding the funds had not been punitive. Many Palestinians and their supporters disputed that assertion. They pointed to statements by administration officials, including a Jan. 2 Twitter message by President Trump, who complained that “we pay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.” United Nations officials said the administration’s move had created the worst financial crisis in the Palestinian aid agency’s seven-decade history. In their letter, the leaders of the aid groups said: “We are particularly alarmed that this decision impacting humanitarian aid to civilians is not based on any assessment of need, but rather designed both to punish Palestinian political leaders and to force political concessions from them. “This is simply unacceptable as a rationale for denying civilians humanitarian assistance, and a dangerous and striking departure from U.S. policy on international humanitarian assistance,” the letter stated. It was signed by top executives of prominent nongovernmental relief and advocacy organizations, including Save the Children, Oxfam America, CARE USA, Refugees International and the International Rescue Committee. The letter was sent to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, and Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. Eric P. Schwartz, the president of Refugees International, said in a telephone interview that the letter was the outcome of what he described as “the deep reaction by the N.G.O. community to a very bad decision.” Mr. Schwartz, a former assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration under the Obama administration, said the Palestinian aid decision had broken with decades of American policy. He pointed to President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 assertion that “a hungry child knows no politics” in deciding to help famine victims in Ethiopia. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, known by the acronym Unrwa, was created in 1949 to aid Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. Originally meant to be a temporary support for roughly one million Palestinian refugees until a political solution was reached, the agency evolved into a sprawling organization for them and their descendants, who are also classified as refugees. Functioning almost like a government in some places, the agency is widely regarded as a critical lifeline for many Palestinians. But it also has been accused of perpetuating what critics call a culture of dependency among a population that has quintupled in size. Many Israelis regard the agency as politically biased and inherently hostile to Israel, an assertion United Nations officials deny. Mr. Schwartz defended the agency. “Given the pressures and challenges confronting Unrwa, a fair assessment of their work would conclude they are providing valuable services under extremely difficult conditions,” he said.

222,"DAVOS, Switzerland — French President Emmanuel Macron laid claim to the mantle of leader of the free world on Wednesday, with an ambitious speech before a packed assembly at the World Economic Forum. He sought to place France at the center of a mission to revamp global capitalism while spreading its spoils more equitably, forging a mode of commerce centered on innovation, yet bearing protections for workers set back by change. Mr. Macron’s hourlong speech before the annual gathering of the world’s wealthy and powerful in the Swiss Alps came on the same day that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni issued their own forceful speeches toward advancing European integration, while defending the notion of international cooperation. Collectively, they signaled that Europe — only a year ago dismissed as a crippled economic realm fraught with political recrimination — has regained force. Europe’s leaders left no doubt that they aim to channel their newfound economic strength toward advancing the project of European integration first launched in the middle of the last century, seen as an antidote to the brutalities of two world wars. President Trump was not in the room (he is not due to speak here until Friday). But the shadow of his America First policies hung heavily. The three speeches resonated as a broad rebuttal of the doctrine that Mr. Trump has made his own. In contrast to Mr. Trump’s pullback from international trade agreements and his renouncing of the Paris climate accord, the European leaders emphasized their commitment to prosperity through global commerce. "
223,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he was willing and eager to be interviewed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, insisting that he has done nothing wrong. “I’m looking forward to it, actually,” Mr. Trump said of talking to Mr. Mueller, answering months of speculation over whether he was willing to submit to questions from the special counsel, who is also believed to be looking into whether the Trump campaign aided Moscow’s effort and whether the president sought to thwart the inquiry itself. “Here’s the story, just so you understand,” Mr. Trump said during an impromptu question-and-answer session with reporters in the West Wing. “There’s been no collusion whatsoever. There’s no obstruction whatsoever, and I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Trump suggested that his efforts to defend himself against damaging allegations had been unfairly misinterpreted as wrongdoing. “You fight back,” he said, and such a response is characterized as, “‘Oh, it’s obstruction.’” The president’s surprise exchange with about 20 reporters served as a reminder of the extent to which Mr. Trump sees the Russia inquiry as simply an invalidation of his electoral victory, and feels a deep sense of bitterness about the narrative surrounding his presidency. His lawyers have been negotiating for weeks with Mr. Mueller’s team about the prospect of having him answer questions in the inquiry, including what topics would be covered. Mr. Trump said last year he would be willing to speak with Mr. Mueller, but he has more recently suggested that should not be necessary because the allegations being examined were baseless. "

225,"WASHINGTON — A pair of groups supporting President Trump say they raised $30 million last year, then spent tens of thousands of those dollars at the Trump International Hotel here and on payments to a few Trump loyalists like the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and the former Milwaukee County sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., according to new campaign finance reports and news reports. Of the millions raised, at least $1 million came from a coal company that has gained extraordinary access to the Trump administration to push for pro-coal policy changes. The campaign finance reports shed light on a network of groups that were formed to support Mr. Trump, but have spent less than other groups bolstering his agenda, while steering money to the president’s businesses and his most ardent surrogates. One of the groups — a “super PAC” called America First Action — spent nearly $33,000 at the Trump International Hotel, primarily on events for donors, and paid tens of thousands of dollars each to Mr. Lewandowski; Brad Parscale, a digital strategist for Mr. Trump’s campaign; and Katrina Pierson, a campaign spokeswoman. Those figures were revealed in a report filed on Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission, which shows that the group raised $4 million last year. An affiliated nonprofit group, America First Policies, raised $26 million last year, according to a report by Axios. That group is registered under a section of the tax code — 501(c)(4) — that allows it to shield most information about its finances, including the identity of its donors. The America First groups have been viewed as something of an enigma in campaign finance circles. While many of the Republican Party’s traditional elite donors have publicly kept their distance from the groups, the organizations have the blessing of the administration and have projected confidence in their fund-raising. "
226,"SACRAMENTO — When Jerry Brown became the 34th governor of California in 1975, he was a young and impetuous bachelor who slept on a box spring and took pleasure in defying political convention. He was the vanguard of the left, the face and spirit of a new generation of a state that — politically and culturally — was proudly distinct from the rest of the nation. He has been such a fixture ever since that it seems impossible to imagine California without him. Now, as Mr. Brown enters the final 12 months of his second tour as governor, and as he prepares to deliver his final State of the State speech here on Thursday, he has become the face of the old order — admired for his long stewardship, but also seen as a roadblock for some younger Democrats who have impatiently awaited change. This is a decidedly more liberal class of Democrats, on issues ranging from single-payer health care to the impeachment of President Trump, and many of them have long said the time has come for Mr. Brown’s generation to step aside. “He is a middle-of-the-road sort of guy and if I’m being perfectly honest, he is not completely in touch with the way the majority of folks in California feel,” said Kimberly Ellis, a Democratic leader from the Bay Area who lost a fight last year to lead the state Democratic Party. “In many ways, with respect to single-payer and other issues, he and others play the safe role — the conservative role.” Now, with a spirited race to succeed him underway, the talk has turned to Mr. Brown’s next chapter and the resilience of the imprint he has left on a state with which he has been identified for so long. After more than 45 years, Mr. Brown, 79, is entering what he says are his final months in public life. He has been governor (twice), attorney general, mayor of Oakland, secretary of state, state Democratic Party chairman, and a candidate for president (three times). Mr. Brown is barred by term limits from running yet again. "
227,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he is open to a path to citizenship after 10 to 12 years for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, days after rejecting a bipartisan plan with that as its centerpiece. Mr. Trump once again seemed to undercut his administration’s message, telling reporters at the White House that he would allow the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, to “morph into” citizens over a period of time. The reporters had gathered for a briefing from a senior official detailing the administration’s plans to stick to a restrictive immigration agenda when the president dropped in unprompted, shortly before departing for Davos, Switzerland, pre-empting the official. “Over a period of 10 to 12 years,” Mr. Trump said, “somebody does a great job, they work hard — that gives incentive to do a great job. Whatever they’re doing, if they do a great job, I think it’s a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen.” In September, Mr. Trump ended an Obama-era program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, saying it was an illegal assertion of executive authority by his predecessor. But even as Mr. Trump’s actions threatened nearly 700,000 young immigrants with deportation when the program expires March 5, he has urged Congress to find a permanent solution that could allow them to live and work in the country legally. In addition to suggesting a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers, Mr. Trump said that he would request $25 billion to build a wall along the United States border with Mexico, though he said he would build it “way under budget.” He also said that his plan would include a request for $5 billion for additional security measures along the border. "

229,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is arriving at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to explain his “America First” approach at a moment when the world is moving ahead with a trade agenda that no longer revolves around the United States. The world marked a turning point in global trade on Tuesday, when 11 countries agreed to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, announcing they had finalized the pact and expected to sign a deal on March 8 in Chile. It was a remarkable moment for a beleaguered agreement that was conceived and constructed by the United States, then abandoned by Washington when Mr. Trump took office last year. As the world’s largest economy and architect of many international organizations and treaties, the United States remains an indispensable partner. But as the global economy gains strength, Europe and countries including Japan and China are forging ahead with deals that do not include the United States. Thirty-five new bilateral and regional trade pacts are under consideration around the world, according to the World Trade Organization. The United States is party to just one of them, with the European Union, and that negotiation has gone dormant. The United States is also threatening to withdraw from one of its existing multilateral agreements — the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada — if it cannot be renegotiated in the United States’ favor. “Maybe there was some sort of presumption on the part of the president and his team that if the U.S. said stop, this process would come to a halt,” said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and an economist in the George W. Bush administration. “What this shows is that’s not true. The world just moves on without us.” In July, Japan signed a wide-ranging new trade deal with the European Union — a step the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, referred to as hoisting “the flag of free trade high amidst protectionist trends.” The European Union pushed ahead with a major update to its agreement with Mexico, while China pursued a pan-Asian agreement, among other deals. Business interests in the United States are watching with alarm as other countries strike agreements that exclude American exporters. For example, ranchers in Canada and Australia will be able to sell beef at lower prices in Japan than their American competitors, who will be subject to higher tariffs because the United States is not party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Kent Bacus, the director of international trade and market access for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said Tuesday that the United States’ withdrawal was “a missed opportunity for the United States to gain greater access to some of the world’s most vibrant and growing markets.” “This one was really about America’s role in the Pacific, and I think pulling out was a signal we’re not as interested,” said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Clinton administration official. “The president can say whatever he wants, but the way this is being perceived is as a pullback of American influence.” The Trump administration has pushed back against claims that the America First doctrine is isolationist and it is ceding global leadership. While advisers have continued to criticize global institutions, they insist their goal is to improve, not destroy, them. “We’re going to the World Economic Forum to share President Trump’s economic story and to tell the world that America is open for business,” Gary D. Cohn, who heads the White House National Economic Council, said in a briefing on Tuesday. “America First is not America alone.” Mr. Trump and his advisers say that the United States will be pushing ahead with new trade deals — ones that will ultimately be better for American companies and their workers. “We’ll be doing other trade deals,” Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed an order imposing tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar modules. “We’re in the process of negotiating with other countries, also, all of which have treated us very unfairly.” Yet the willingness of countries to engage with the United States is unclear. For many, a relationship with the Trump administration has been a delicate dance: They do not want to risk access to the American market, or raise the ire of the American president. But global leaders are warily watching the Trump administration’s take-it-or-leave-it approach to renegotiating its trade pacts with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. They have seen Mr. Trump scrap the global climate change accord, withdraw the United States from the United Nations compact on migration and refugees and criticize global institutions that the United States largely designed, like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In Davos, at a forum long considered the center for globalization, the administration’s America First message has not been entirely well received. On Wednesday, comments by Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, that American troops were “coming to the ramparts” in what he called a continuing global trade war prompted blowback from other state leaders. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned on Wednesday that “protectionism was not the answer” and called right-wing populism a “poison,” in a speech largely seen as a rebuttal to Mr. Trump before his expected speech on Friday. “We think that shutting ourselves off, isolating ourselves, will not lead us into a good future,” Ms. Merkel said. Canada has also contrasted its approach with that of the United States. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said she was worried about movements around the world that have blamed trade and immigration for the hollowing out of the middle class, and that Canada was “doubling down” on its openness to trade and immigrants. “It’s partly a statement about our values. But we also think it is a really great economic benefit to us as well,” she said. So far, it is unclear which countries the United States could be courting to create new trade deals. Britain has expressed interest in a bilateral deal with United States, but talks could not begin until it finishes extricating itself from the European Union, which does not look likely to be resolved soon. Japan, the preferred partner for many American businesses, appears to have spurned the United States’ offer to forge a trade deal one on one, after Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And China has tried to position itself as a global leader — a sharp change from the early 1990s, when the leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping, cautioned his countrymen to “hide your strength and bide your time.” China has set about building its own vision of an international order, including an Asian investment bank to rival the World Bank, and its global infrastructure project, One Belt One Road. At last year’s meeting in Davos, President Xi Jinping of China portrayed his country as a global leader and vigorously defended free trade — a position some considered ironic for a country that maintains sharp controls on many industries. The Trump administration’s more aggressive stance toward allies and adversaries may shift this balance in China’s favor. At an event on Tuesday in Washington, Juan Gabriel Valdés, the Chilean ambassador to the United States, contrasted Chile’s now warm relationship with China with the United States’ more combative stance on trade, especially in its negotiations over Nafta. “In the history of the region, we have never had a partner that is so willing, so open, so dedicated to listen to what are our needs than what we have now with China,” Mr. Valdés said. “The United States continues to be, and will probably be in the next 10, 20 years, the main partner of the Latin American region,” he said. “But change is there. It’s written on the wall, if this continues like it is.” "
230,"WASHINGTON — He boasted about it at a banquet given by the Communist president of Vietnam. He crowed about it during a pep rally for anti-abortion marchers in the Rose Garden. He even slipped it into his Thanksgiving Day greeting to American troops serving abroad. No president has taken more delight, or claimed more credit, for the roaring stock market than Donald J. Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average has become for him what the Rasmussen Poll was during the 2016 presidential election: a daily source of validation. “Had the other side gotten in, the market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was,” Mr. Trump told a gathering of women at the White House last week, diplomatically avoiding the name Hillary Clinton. “Remember that.” Now, though, Mr. Trump’s fixation with Wall Street is colliding with one of his most cherished legislative projects — a more protectionist trade policy — and it is not clear which one will win. Mr. Trump, for example, has repeatedly threatened to pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Korea Free Trade Agreement. But two top economic advisers, Gary D. Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have warned him that withdrawing from those deals would hurt the stock market, several officials said. Tellingly, those threats have receded. On Wednesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, expressed optimism that the United States would be able to renegotiate the deal with Canada and Mexico. The president himself is scheduled to speak in Davos on Friday, and Mr. Cohn promised that his message would reassure the market makers who flock there every January. “America first is not America alone,” he said. “When we grow, the world grows; when the world grows, we grow. We’re part of it, and we’re part of a world economy.” And yet other people briefed by the White House said they expected Mr. Trump to use the occasion to deliver a defiantly nationalist speech. While Mr. Ross was conciliatory about Nafta, he also said that “U.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts” to wage other potential trade wars, including with China. Those remarks briefly rattled markets. Presidents have generally avoided talking about the stock market — for good reasons. Their words have the power to move markets, and not always in the direction they want. Moreover, if they claim credit for a bull market, they find it harder to evade blame for a bear market. In March 2009, President Barack Obama made a foray into market analysis during an appearance with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. The stock market, he said, is “sort of like a tracking poll in politics.” “It bobs up and down day to day, and if you spend all your time worrying about that, then you’re probably going to get the long-term strategy wrong,” he said. At the same time, he observed, stocks had fallen so far after the financial crisis that their price-to-earnings ratios were nearing their bottom. Given that, and the government’s enormous fiscal stimulus program, Mr. Obama said it might be a good time to get back into the market. “He got substantial blowback for those comments and was advised — and took the advice — not to prognosticate on the market again,” said Jason Furman, who was one of Mr. Obama’s economic advisers. For all the mocking he got, Mr. Furman noted that Mr. Obama was right. The stock market bottomed out six days after his remarks and had bounced back 21 percent a month later. Mr. Obama mentioned the market several other times during his presidency, but Mr. Furman said he stayed away from commenting on day-to-day gyrations. President Bill Clinton also presided over a bubbly stock market but resisted the urge to gloat about it. Former aides said he was repeatedly invited to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to open trading, but they always told him to decline. That reluctance proved wise when the bubble in technology stocks began bursting almost a year before Mr. Clinton left office. “We had a view that markets could go up, markets could go down, markets could be overvalued, markets could be undervalued,” said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to Mr. Clinton. “But it would take your eye off the ball to focus on that rather than on the real economy.” Not that these presidents or their aides are shy about their contributions to the market: Mr. Sperling said Mr. Clinton’s 1993 budget plan, and the ensuing decline in long-term interest rates, helped power the bull market of the 1990s. Even with the bursting of the tech bubble, he said, investors were way ahead at the end of the Clinton years. But all of them, said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, were mindful that what goes up can come down. Mr. Dallek, who recently published a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt, noted that Roosevelt rarely talked about the stock market, which rose steadily during his presidency until 1937, when the Federal Reserve abruptly tightened the money supply — one of the factors that plunged the United States into recession. “All these presidents have paid attention to the stock market,” Mr. Dallek said. “But he finds it irresistible, if finds any sign of strength in his administration, that he is going to seize on that and publicize it.” No president has tied his fortunes so directly to the market as has Mr. Trump. “We’re setting a record literally all the time,” he said last week. “And I’m telling you, we have a long way to go.” Sometimes, Mr. Trump does not even wait for the market to open to claim victory. Before the opening bell in New York on Nov. 29, he tweeted, “Looks like another great day for the Stock Market. Consumer Confidence is at a Record High. I guess somebody likes me (my policies)!” The Dow Jones industrial average closed 104 points higher that day. "
231,"Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas was narrowly confirmed to an ambassadorship on Wednesday after a six-month wait that left Kansans increasingly confused about who was in charge of their state. The Senate split 49-49 along party lines on the nomination of Mr. Brownback, a Republican who has grown unpopular in Kansas, to be ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote. Many religious leaders praised Mr. Brownback’s confirmation, and said he could use his political experience to help religious minorities, including oppressed Christian and Yazidi communities in the Middle East. “He has been a consistent, vocal, competent and impassioned advocate for these issues,” said the Rev. Johnnie Moore, a Southern Baptist minister who served on the evangelical advisory board for President Trump’s campaign. “It was all very logical to us that he would be the nominee, and we were thrilled by it.” Many Democrats and gay rights advocates opposed the nomination of Mr. Brownback, who ended anti-discrimination protections for gay state workers in 2015. Mr. Brownback, who served seven years as governor after stints in both chambers of Congress, drew national attention to Kansas after he oversaw the largest income tax cuts in state history. But the missed revenue forecasts and wholesale cuts to state services that followed led many legislative Republicans to buck Mr. Brownback and undo his signature policy last year. Mr. Brownback, whose term would have ended next January, was passed over for more prominent jobs in the Trump administration. When he was nominated for the religious freedom ambassadorship last summer, many expected a swift confirmation. Mr. Brownback began handing off tasks to Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer after he was nominated, but month after awkward month passed in Topeka without a confirmation vote. Mr. Trump had to renominate Mr. Brownback this month after the full Senate declined to vote last year. “Our state’s been in kind of a leadership vacuum of chaos,” said Jim Ward, the Democratic leader in the Kansas House of Representatives and a candidate for governor. “It’s really slowed down and pretty much stopped all progress on any kind of policy because you’ve got two different guys acting like the governor.” Mr. Brownback announced on Thursday that he will resign as governor next week, on Wednesday. “Wherever my new duties may take me, my Kansas values and experience will always travel with me,” he wrote in his resignation letter. Mr. Colyer, a Republican and a plastic surgeon from suburban Kansas City, will assume the governorship. Mr. Colyer, who is seeking a full term as governor in the election this year, will face several challengers in the Republican primary. "

233,"WASHINGTON — Simmering tensions between Turkey and the United States spilled into the open on Wednesday as President Trump warned President Recep Tayyip Erdogan against the growing risk of conflict between the two nations. The Turkish president, for his part, demanded that the United States end its support for Kurdish militias. The two men, both populists and unapologetic nationalists, spoke by telephone as Turkish forces attacked Kurdish militias in Syria. American officials said they were increasingly uneasy that the campaign against the Islamic State would be seriously undermined by the newest battlefront in a country that has been ravaged by war for nearly seven years. Mr. Trump “urged Turkey to exercise caution and to avoid any actions that might risk conflict between Turkish and American forces,” the White House said in a description of the call. “He reiterated that both nations must focus all parties on the shared goal of achieving the lasting defeat of ISIS,” or the Islamic State. His tough tone with Mr. Erdogan was an abrupt reversal from a White House briefing just a day earlier, where senior administration officials suggested that the United States would side with Turkey, a NATO ally, in disputes with Kurdish forces that have fought the Islamic State with direct support from Washington. Turkey has fought for decades against Kurdish insurgent groups that Ankara considers terrorist threats. Kurds in the region — most notably in Turkey, Iraq and Syria — dream of creating an independent state even as they seek greater political and cultural rights. In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Erdogan said there was no difference between the Islamic State and Kurdish militias, and questioned “the humanity of those who accuse Turkey of being an invader and support an organization that has the blood of tens of thousands of innocent children, women, elderly people and innocents on its hands.” "
234,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department warned the House Intelligence Committee chairman on Wednesday that it was “extraordinarily reckless” for Republicans to push to release a committee memo that draws on classified information to portray the origins of the Russian investigation as scandalous. In a letter to Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the committee, Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, stressed that the committee had refused to show the memo to the F.B.I. “We do not understand why the committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the intelligence community,” Mr. Boyd wrote. The rebuke came as Democrats announced that they had drafted their own classified memo based on the same underlying materials to rebut Mr. Nunes. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, called the Republicans’ document extraordinarily misleading. The moves to curb Mr. Nunes by the Democrats as well as by Mr. Boyd, a Trump administration appointee, came during sharply escalating partisan conflict over the Russia investigation. Republicans and conservative commentators have increasingly argued that the investigation derives from a conspiracy by biased law enforcement officials seeking to sabotage President Trump. Democrats, in turn, have accused Republicans of constructing a false narrative in an attempt to undermine the inquiry on behalf of Mr. Trump. Adding to the rising turbulence, Republicans are also pointing with alarm to newly revealed texts between two F.B.I. officials who were once part of Mr. Mueller’s team, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Mr. Mueller removed Mr. Strzok from his team over the summer after learning that the two had exchanged texts expressing a dislike of Mr. Trump. The Republican memo, which was written by Mr. Nunes’s staff, is said to claim that the F.B.I. abused its powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to spy on the Trump campaign. Democrats did not know it existed until a committee meeting last week, during which its members voted along party lines to share it with the rest of the House. Republicans, conservative commentators and social media accounts linked to Russian influence networks immediately began calling for the memo’s public release, portraying it as revealing a major scandal. Committee Republicans are reportedly weighing whether to invoke an obscure House rule to make public classified materials. People familiar with the memo said it centers on a fall 2016 application for a FISA warrant targeting Carter Page, a onetime member of the Trump presidential campaign who had recently visited Russia. The memo is said to stress that the application used information from a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, without adequately explaining to the judge that his research was financed by Democrats. But people familiar with the underlying application have portrayed the Republican memo as misleading in part because Mr. Steele’s information, which was also compiled into a notorious dossier, was insufficient to meet the standard for a FISA warrant. The application, they said, drew on other intelligence that the Republican memo misleadingly omits — but revealing that other information to rebut the memo would risk blowing other sources and methods of intelligence-gathering about Russia. The Justice Department is “unaware of any wrongdoing relating to the FISA process,” Mr. Boyd wrote. He also revealed that Mr. Nunes has not personally examined the underlying materials on which his memo is based, but rather had delegated that task to Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina. Mr. Boyd also wrote that the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, had personally asked to let the bureau see a copy of the memo, but had been rebuffed. A spokesman for Mr. Nunes, Jack Langer, said: “Agencies that are under investigation by congressional committees don’t typically get access to the committees’ investigative documents about them, and it’s no surprise these agencies don’t want the abuses we’ve found to be made public. Furthermore, there were no limitations placed on disseminating this information, and we will continue to fulfill our oversight responsibilities in accordance with House rules.” In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Schiff refused to discuss the details of the dispute, but said the Republican memo “is misleading in what it says, and it’s misleading in what it omits.” Mr. Schiff portrayed the report as part of a campaign dating to Mr. Nunes’s announcement in the spring that he intended to tell the White House that the Obama administration had improperly “unmasked” the identities of Mr. Trump’s associates in intelligence reports. It later emerged that Mr. Nunes had learned that from Mr. Trump’s aides at the White House, and other Republicans concluded that there had been no improper unmasking. Mr. Schiff said that Democrats would ask the committee on Monday to make their rival memo available to the House on the same terms as the Republican memo, and that if the president declassified the Republican document, he should do the same for the Democratic version. But Mr. Schiff said that he thought the better course was for both memos to remain classified. The texts between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page provided more fuel for the partisan rancor. Republican lawmakers have said texts that the Justice Department gave to Congress last week, supplementing another set that lawmakers received last year, show pervasive political bias against Mr. Trump. Republicans also portrayed phrases in the texts, including a reference to a “secret society” in the F.B.I., as hints of a conspiracy to sabotage him. “The texts between Strzok and Page referenced a ‘secret society,’” Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, wrote on Twitter, adding: “It’s clear from the thousands of texts we reviewed that Strzok and Page held a manifest bias against @realDonaldTrump in favor of Hillary Clinton and showed an intent to act upon that bias.” Other people familiar with the texts agreed that they showed the two officials expressing many negative opinions about Mr. Trump and his team — like declaring “what a disaster” after learning that Jeff Sessions would be the attorney general. But one of those people, a Democratic congressional aide, maintained that Republicans’ insinuations that the texts also showed signs of a conspiracy was based on cherry-picking and portraying as sinister phrases that, in context, were instead tongue-in-cheek banter. For example, the aide said the reference to a “secret society” the day after the election occurred in an exchange between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page in which one noted: “Are you even going to give out your calendars? Seems kind of depressing. Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society.” Another person familiar with that exchange said the team had bought Russia-theme calendars to give out to the agents and analysts investigating Russia’s interference in the election, and in light of the election results, Ms. Page was making a dark joke about the gag gifts. The F.B.I. has also informed Congress that it discovered that the bureau did not preserve text messages between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page between mid-December 2016 and mid-May 2017. It blamed misconfigured software that prevented the automatic retention of such data from many bureau officials who were using Samsung 5 phones provided by the F.B.I. Mr. Trump suggested that the missing texts were worse than Watergate, the scandal that brought down Richard M. Nixon, comparing the months of missing messages to the 18.5 minutes of crucial White House tape that was mysteriously erased after the Watergate break-in. “When you look at five months, this is the late, great Rose Mary Woods, right?” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to Nixon’s secretary, who took the blame for inadvertently erasing part of a taped conversation between him and his chief of staff three days after the burglary at the Democratic Party headquarters. “This is a large-scale version,” Mr. Trump said. “That was 18 minutes; this was five months.” “They say it’s 50,000 texts, and it’s prime time,” he added, referring incorrectly to the number of texts between the two officials that the Justice Department inspector general has reviewed. The number of missing texts is not known. “That’s disturbing.” "
235,"I don’t know if you heard, but this week a boy with a handgun killed two of his fellow students at a high school in Kentucky. “It is unbelievable that this would happen in a small, close-knit community like Marshall County,” said the governor, Matt Bevin. Actually, that part is completely believable. Given that another school shooting this week was in Italy, Tex., population under 2,000. And that two months ago, 25 people were shot to death while attending church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., population 362. It’s about guns, not population density. And it is a huge story. But I know, people, you have been beating your heads against the wall about this issue forever, and a certain numbness creeps in. “You had the worst mass shooting in the country in Las Vegas, followed by a really horrific event in a church. People just get worn out,” said Mark Kelly, who co-founded a gun-safety organization with his wife, then-Representative Gabby Giffords, after she was shot in the head while meeting with her constituents. Donald Trump — who yelled about “carnage” in big cities during his inauguration speech — has said not a word about the Kentucky shooting except to tweet his “thoughts and prayers.” (Even that, commenters noted, came nearly 24 hours after the prime minister of Canada sent his sympathies.) It is highly unlikely this lack of focus was due to weariness. “You’ve got to wonder,” Kelly said in a phone interview, whether the president would have had a more intense reaction if the news reports suggested “the shooter was of a different ethnicity.” True that. During his government-shutdown-immigration rants, Trump kept pointing out that the man who killed eight people with a truck in Manhattan had come to the country through a visa lottery system. That happened on Oct. 31. Since that time, 73 people have been killed in mass shootings in this country. But about gun regulation we have not heard a presidential peep. "
236,"FRANKFURT — Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, directed unusually sharp criticism at Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, on Thursday, effectively accusing Mr. Mnuchin of violating agreements among nations against starting currency wars. Mr. Draghi, speaking at a news conference here, said he objected to “the use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn’t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.” He then quoted from an agreement reached in Washington in October under which countries promised to “refrain from competitive devaluations.” Mr. Draghi did not mention Mr. Mnuchin by name, but he was clearly referring to the Treasury secretary’s remarks on Wednesday at a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland, that a weaker dollar was good for United States trade. The comment was interpreted as an effort to talk down the dollar, which would breach the international nonaggression pact on currency rates. On Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin told reporters in Davos that his comment had been misunderstood. “I thought it was actually balanced and consistent with what I’ve said before,” he said, “which is we’re not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term. It’s a very, very liquid market and we believe in free currencies. And that there’s both advantages and disadvantages of where the dollar is in the short term.” (After arriving in Davos, President Trump said during an interview that he wanted “to see a strong dollar” and that Mr. Mnuchin’s remarks had been misinterpreted.) Central bankers usually refrain from rhetorical fisticuffs with government officials, but Mr. Mnuchin’s initial remark arrived at a sensitive time for the eurozone. Europe’s economy is performing better than anyone had expected it would be just a few months ago. But the growth has brought some unwelcome side effects. In particular, the euro has reached a three-year high against the dollar as investors anticipate the European Central Bank dialing back its economic stimulus efforts sooner than previously expected, which would mean higher interest on the euro. "
237,"Don Buchwald — or “superagent Don Buchwald,” as he is known to listeners of “The Howard Stern Show” — was giving a nostalgic tour of the Friars Club on a Thursday night last month. On the third floor of the club, housed in a 1909 German Renaissance mansion in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Buchwald looked around the Ed Sullivan Room, its paneled walls painted white and minimally decorated with head shots of people such as Carol Burnett and Steve Allen. This is the room Mr. Buchwald used in the 1970s as a makeshift office to meet with clients. He strolled next into the William B. Williams Room, named for a radio disc jockey who coined the “Chairman of the Board” nickname for Frank Sinatra and who hosted the “Make Believe Ballroom” program. Mr. Williams was one of Mr. Buchwald’s clients. So too were Tony Curtis, Kim Novak and José Ferrer. “The Tony Curtis story I can’t tell you because it’s kind of smutty,” he said. To listeners of Mr. Stern’s radio show, Mr. Buchwald, 80, long ago emerged as something of an Oz figure: referred to often, heard from rarely. And he prefers it that way. “I’m not a particularly boastful person,” said Mr. Buchwald, who is the kind of guy who wears a fedora and tips his head as he ducks into the back seat of his driven Mercedes. But he wants to publicize a recent development at his firm, Don Buchwald & Associates, which has changed its name to Buchwald. Mr. Buchwald’s daughter, Julia, is expanding the agency’s Los Angeles practice, including its branding and digital media departments. The firm consists of about 50 agents, and its marquee clients include Kathleen Turner, Ralph Macchio and Ali MacGraw. Mr. Stern is the only client whom Mr. Buchwald personally represents — in 2015 he secured him a deal with Sirius XM satellite radio that is estimated to be worth some $90 million a year. He also serves as Mr. Stern’ s de facto manager and publicist. Lloyd Braun, an entertainment industry entrepreneur and executive who has known Mr. Buchwald for 30 years, called negotiating on the same side of a deal with him “a joy.” Less so when negotiating against Mr. Buchwald. “There is a nightmare quality to it. Because you’re only going to do so well. If you want to do better than that, you’re probably going to have to grovel,” Mr. Braun said. "
238,"WASHINGTON — Nearly $800 million worth of fentanyl pills were illegally sold to online customers in the United States over two years by Chinese distributors who took advantage of internet anonymity and an explosive growth in e-commerce, according to a Senate report released on Wednesday. A yearlong Senate investigation found that American buyers of the illegal drugs lived mostly in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. The Chinese sellers primarily used Bitcoin, the digital currency, as their preferred method of payment and shipped the drugs through other countries to reduce the risk of the opioids being seized by customs officials, Senate investigators said. The 104-page bipartisan report was produced by the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s investigations arm. It was requested by Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the panel’s chairman, and Tom Carper of Delaware, the committee’s top Democrat. They will discuss the report’s findings in a hearing set for Thursday and are expected to press law enforcement and Postal Service officials for details on plans to combat the growing opioid shipments. China has a large pharmaceutical industry and hosts thousands of illegal labs that manufacture counterfeit and illicit drugs, Senate investigators said. The country has long been identified by American officials as the source of much of the illegal opioids flowing into the United States. The report, Senate investigators say, shows how easy it is for Americans to buy the drugs online, and why officials at the post office and Customs and Border Protection has struggled to track and stop the shipments. The Senate investigators said drugs traffickers are exploiting a loophole in the international mail system to send hundreds of pounds of deadly opioids into the United States each year. "

The cans were lighter and cheaper than bottles, and immediately proved a huge success. “Sales resistance to beer in cans has been overcome in every section of the country,” The Times reported a few months later in 1935. “The product is selling more rapidly than it can be supplied.” Within two months, the American Can Co. was producing 25,000 to 30,000 beer cans every day. By September, U.S. winemakers sought to package their product in cans, too, to “induce the American consumer to ‘become wine-minded,’ ” The Times reported. Bottle makers pushed back against the new competition. At a conference in Atlantic City, they spoke of plans for lighter bottles, as well as ones that wouldn’t require a deposit. Regardless of what it was packaged in, beer was popular in post-Prohibition America. Sales of bottled and canned beer grew more than 50 percent in the first half of 1936 over the previous year, The Times reported. By 1970, beer cans had overtaken bottles. _____ This briefing was prepared for the European morning and is updated online. Browse past briefings here.

242,"A number of women — including you, as the interim replacement for Charlie Rose on PBS — have taken over positions of men who were fired over sexual-abuse accusations. Are you surprised at the number of men in media who have been implicated? Of course I’m surprised, especially when it’s people you know and you’ve worked with, and then this kind of thing comes to light. But on the other hand, the patriarchy has dominated for thousands of years, and people see it as their God-given right. It’s not just sexual harassment or abuse or all the other sexual issues — it’s everything. According to the I.M.F., when women are equally represented in all aspects of economy and business, it can cause national G.D.P.s to rise rapidly. In the United States, having equal numbers of women in the work force would raise America’s G.D.P. by five percentage points. In India, by 27 percentage points. If people can’t be persuaded to see a woman’s right to control her own body as a moral issue, it’s most definitely an economic one. There has been some hand-wringing about the fired men: that a mass of male talent is departing the industry. Do you agree? That pisses me off. These talented men are suppressing talented women! You cannot put a figure on the number of young women who have been squelched or run out of Dodge because they haven’t been able to tolerate it. What was it like studying how other cultures deal with sex for “Sex and Love Around the World” while there’s this crisis back in the United States? I set out to talk to people about their sense of empowerment, of agency over their own bodies, feelings, futures, marriages, their ability to be free in their own society, how much control they have over their sexuality. It just so happens that it dovetailed with this evidence that many people in the West have less control over that than we would like to imagine. I have to admit, watching it felt like a departure from the reporting we’ve seen from you in the past. In asking people questions about sex, you inadvertently kind of reveal what you think about sex. I hope people will not be shocked. One thing I found: Everywhere we went, everybody had the same questions. You realize that we’re all the same. "
243,"TRUMPOCRACY
The Corruption of the American Republic
By David Frum
301 pp. HarperCollins. $25.99. Donald Trump is the oddest president America has ever elected. He lived in a gilded tower on New York’s Fifth Avenue but nevertheless became the voice of the left-behind. He made his public reputation as a reality-TV star but nevertheless defeated one of the most experienced politicians in the land. Trump has done so many extraordinary things in his first year in office, from tweeting about nuclear war to conducting public business in sight of paying guests in a resort he owns, it’s easy to forget that, unless impeachment intervenes, he still has another three years — and perhaps seven — to go. Trump’s election has set off a furious competition among America’s pundits to explain what is going on: The most depressing political story of our time is also the most exciting. David Frum has usually been at or near the front of the pundit pack with a succession of articles in The Atlantic, where he is a senior editor. Most commentators are dyed-in-the-wool liberals who exhausted the language of fulmination during George W. Bush’s presidency. Frum worked for Bush and even had a hand in writing his “axis of evil” speech. Most commentators regard conservative America as an alien land inhabited by monsters. Frum has been writing sharp but sympathetic books on that land since his first, “Dead Right,” on the weaknesses of Reaganism, in 1994. The central theme in Frum’s excellent new book, “Trumpocracy,” which draws on his Atlantic articles, is what Trump’s career tells us about the deeper structural problems of America in general, and conservative America in particular. Frum argues that Trump’s greatest talent — his genius really — is spotting and exploiting weaknesses. The Republican establishment spent $100 million to put the crown on Prince Jeb Bush’s head. Trump incinerated Bush (and all that cash) with his gibe about “low energy.” He then proceeded to incinerate “little” Marco Rubio and “lyin’” Ted Cruz. Trump’s campaign against Hillary Clinton was in some ways a model of how not to run campaigns — he lurched from crisis to crisis and never bothered to enumerate any detailed policies. But he understood her great limitation: that she represented the nexus between meritocracy and plutocracy, indebted to Big Money and divorced from millions of heartland Americans. Trump’s political operatics worked because he understood deeper weaknesses in American society. The white working class is suffering from two great hammer blows. The first is to its economic well-being: A group that thrived during the golden years of the 1950s and 1960s has seen its incomes stagnate and its job security disappear. Great swaths of white America now suffer from maladies that are all too familiar to black America: broken homes, drug addiction, listlessness, early death. The second hammer blow is to its psychological well-being: Even as their economic position has declined, members of the white working class — particularly white working-class men — have seen themselves denounced, often by people who spend more on college education in one year than they earn shoveling dirt, as agents of privilege and oppression. What better way to respond to being defined as a problem than to vote for a man who promises to punch back? Trump grasped that America is suffering from an epistemological weakness as well as economic ones: The line between truth and falsehood is becoming dangerously blurred. Again, America’s knowledge elite is partly responsible for this: Armies of postmodern academics had prepared the way for Trump by arguing that truth is a construct of the power elite. But the biggest culprit is technological progress. Digitalization is not only creating a deafening cacophony of voices. It is also making it harder to finance real journalism while simultaneously making it easier to distribute tripe. "
244,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. After months of internal squabbles, President Trump is considering replacing his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, according to a recent Vanity Fair article. Mr. Trump is reportedly frustrated that Mr. Kelly told the news media that the president’s plans to build a border wall had “evolved.” Jimmy Kimmel ridiculed Mr. Trump on Tuesday, saying that the president seems to show no interest in maintaining an orderly work environment at the White House. Jimmy Fallon seized on a recent report in Politico, in which a Trump adviser lamented how difficult it can be to prevent Mr. Trump from interfering in legislative negotiations. The unnamed adviser compared the president to the escape artist Harry Houdini. Conan O’Brien went to an elementary school in Haiti last week, and turned a class upside down. His full Haiti special will air this Saturday. Seth Meyers thinks he knows what the little voice in Mr. Trump’s head sounds like. How #blessed is Mr. O’Brien? DJ Khaled will be the judge of that tomorrow, when he appears on “Conan.” The Oscar nominations have been announced, and “The Shape of Water” has emerged as the big contender. "
245,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Senator Chuck Schumer has withdrawn an offer to fully fund President Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the biggest gesture the Democratic leader had made to try to secure an immigration deal. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, says he will allow a “fair and open” immigration debate if the fate of the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as Dreamers is not resolved by Feb. 8. That’s when the stopgap spending measure that ended this week’s shutdown will expire. The bipartisan group of senators who helped end the shutdown is now trying to find its own way forward. • One, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, announced that he would run for re-election this year, but summed up his feelings about Congress succinctly: “This place sucks.” • Attorney General Jeff Sessions was the first member of President Trump’s cabinet to be interviewed in the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election meddling. "
246,"Near the end of Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, North Korea undertook an extraordinary gamble against the United States, attacking and capturing a Navy spy ship, the Pueblo. Six gunboats and two jets pounced on the Pueblo off North Korea’s rugged eastern coast as it tried to pinpoint radar and other military installations. One American sailor died in the Jan. 23, 1968, attack; 82 others were imprisoned. The unexpected assault on the surveillance ship 50 years ago this week set off an international crisis that tested Johnson’s nerves and brought the United States closer to conflict with North Korea than at any time since the Korean War erupted in 1950. In Washington, North Korea’s action precipitated cries for vengeance. “There can be only one answer for America — retaliation, retaliation, retaliation!” bellowed L. Mendel Rivers, the South Carolina Democrat who led the House Armed Services Committee. But the president, his hands full with the Vietnam War, didn’t give in to pressure to use force. The last thing he wanted was a second war in Asia. Instead, he pursued 11 months of frustrating but ultimately successful diplomacy. In the end the 82 American captives came home alive. A half-century on, Johnson’s patience and measured responses in the face of extreme incitement by the North Koreans offer lessons for American policymakers as they confront a far more dangerous North Korea, now armed with nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.

247,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The fallout from the Presidents Club dinner is growing. • An awkward dinner shared by Travis Kalanick and Dara Khosrowshahi at the World Economic Forum. • Qualcomm’s big fine by the E.U. • Tech giants’ struggles in Washington. • The fight atop Och-Ziff. • Katerra, a construction start-up, wins the backing of the SoftBank Vision Fund.

The Presidents Club dinner was a little-known charity event held at the posh Dorchester Hotel until yesterday, when the FT published a scathing investigation into the all-male-attendee event. What the news outlet discovered from its undercover reporting was what it described as a bacchanalia filled with drinking — and the groping of women hostesses. From the article by Madison Marriage, who said she, while working undercover, had been harassed: Here’s what Anne Milton, an education minister, said of the event in a session of Parliament today: The responses • The Presidents Club said that it would not host any more events. • WPP, which had bought a table at the event over the years, said early today that it had ended its association with the event. • An organizer of the event, the businessman David Meller, has stepped down from a nonexecutive chairman position at the Department of Education. • British lawmakers demanded that companies that had attended the event publish their employee gender ratios quickly. • The Bank of England said that Mark Carney would not follow through on a lunch that was auctioned off at the dinner. • Reporters began looking into the charity’s public financial reports, and were left unimpressed: • Britain’s charity overseer has begun an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment. — Michael J. de la Merced Here at Davos, people are buzzing about businesses’ need to do good for society.

Robert Rubin, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton Administration, was sharply critical of Mr. Mnuchin’s comments. “I’ve always felt that our self interest was in having a strong dollar,” Mr. Rubin said in an interview in his office at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he is chairman emeritus. The best way for United States companies to compete globally, Mr. Rubin said, is for them to be “productive, efficient, and effective.” And the best way for the government to help them do that, he said, is through investments in education, infrastructure and other programs that improve the country’s long-term competitiveness. “Promote our ability to export by our investments in our economy,” Mr. Rubin said, “not by weakening our terms of trade.” Abandoning the United States’ longstanding strong-dollar policy, Mr. Rubin said, would carry risks to both the United States economy and the global financial system. “A loss of confidence in our currency could also undermine our interest rate markets and our equities markets,” he said.

251,"ROME — The serpent in the Garden of Eden hissed the first fake news to Eve and it all went downhill from there, Pope Francis wrote in a major document about the phenomenon of fake news released on Wednesday. “We need to unmask what could be called the ‘snake-tactics’ used by those who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place,” the pope wrote in a message ahead of what the church has designated as its World Day of Social Communications, in May. Arguing that the “crafty” serpent’s effective disinformation campaign to get Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge “began the tragic history of human sin,” he added, “I would like to contribute to our shared commitment to stemming the spread of fake news.” Pope Francis has worn many hats since his election in 2013 — Vatican reformer; global advocate for refugees, the poor, and world peace; and, more recently, defender of bishops accused of covering up for pedophile priests. But in a varyingly sophisticated, spiritual and questionable analysis of the fake news epidemic, the 81-year-old pontiff tried on the cap of contemporary media critic to address an issue that has wreaked havoc and undermined democracies from the United States to Europe and beyond. In doing so, he offered a largely cleareyed assessment of the problem, its social impact, and the responsibility of social media giants and journalists. And he called on news consumers to break out of their comfortable echo chambers and cushy news feeds by seeking out different points of view. "
252,"Frank Bruni, a Times Op-Ed columnist, hosted an online conversation with Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor and the managing director of Bain Capital Double Impact, and Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist most recently with the Doug Jones Senate campaign in Alabama, about the 2018 midterm elections and the challenges and opportunities they present for Democrats. FRANK BRUNI: Many Democratic activists are seething about their senators’ votes to reopen the federal government without any guarantee of a deal on Dreamers. Strategists and pundits of all stripes believe that the Democrats handled this badly and are doing an ace job of jeopardizing their likely midterm election gains and their chances of retaking at least one chamber of Congress. How concerned or worried are you about what just happened on Capitol Hill? DEVAL PATRICK: Frustrated but not that concerned. I hate government shutdowns. I’m not that focused on tactics anyway, so much as I am on the convictions at stake. To me, there are two. First, a great country doesn’t intentionally hurt innocent people. That’s what we’re doing by throwing out the Dreamers. And everybody knows it. Second, the Congress needs to govern. We need a real budget, preferably a multiyear one so people can plan and make progress, not another temporary stopgap measure. JOE TRIPPI: No one wants a government shutdown — but no one wants to continue kicking the can down the road while Dreamers are living with uncertainty and being deported, and the military and domestic programs have no ability to plan. PATRICK: Democrats have given Republicans yet another chance. What happens next will tell us all whether we can depend on Republican congressional leadership and the president not only to keep their word but also to govern. "

255,"DAVOS, Switzerland — One could get the feeling that President Trump might not be set for a rousing welcome when he arrives in this Swiss Alps resort this week to address the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum. The forum, a pilgrimage for the wealthy and powerful, is an unabashed champion of globalization. It advocates ceaselessly for the notion that every problem — from climate change to joblessness to terrorism to cybersecurity — requires international cooperation and multilateral solutions. Mr. Trump’s derisive rejection of such ideas as the woolly-headed notions of the global elite is central to his identity. He used his inaugural address a year ago to declare the dawning of a new “America First” era. He has since pulled the United States out of a sprawling Pacific trade deal, while renouncing American participation in the Paris climate accord. He has spurned the modern sensitivities to race and gender. While many here are poised to recoil at Mr. Trump’s arrival — diplomats, heads of state and members of human rights organizations — much of the moneyed elite who pay the bills for many Davos festivities are willing to overlook what they portray as the American president’s rhetorical foibles in favor of focusing on the additional wealth he has delivered to their coffers. Among banking chiefs, hedge fund managers, private equity overseers and others who make their living managing vast piles of money, Mr. Trump is the rare politician who has made good on his words, having slashed corporate taxes and ditched regulations they view as anti-business. However they publicly greet Mr. Trump, they are happy with key ways in which he has wielded his power. “If you take away Trump’s Twitter ridiculousness, it’s actually been a pretty good year for the business community,” said Raymond Nolte, a managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that manages more than $10.7 billion in assets. “He’s basically accomplished major reform.” "
256,"Hurrah! For the second year running, the Oscars won’t be so white. Sure, the nominations on Tuesday had some lamentable omissions — Dee Rees for best director, for one, along with her movie “Mudbound.” But one of its stars, Mary J. Blige, got two nominations, and Jordan Peele got three, with “Get Out,” his evisceration of smug white liberalism, landing on the best picture list. To quote Tiffany Haddish, as she stumbled over the “Get Out” star Daniel Kaluuya’s name while announcing the nominees, “Kallelujah!” Also, wahoo, the Oscars won’t be so male. Greta Gerwig became only the fifth woman to ever get a directing nomination, for “Lady Bird,” Rachel Morrison became the first female Oscar-nominated cinematographer, for “Mudbound,” and four of the nine best picture finalists are about women. But check out the list of nominated actresses. It’s hard to find an ingénue — to use a term long past its sell-by date — in the bunch. And by and large, the women these actresses portray onscreen are not “likable” in the traditional sense but instead wily, ferocious and unbowed. Who out there wouldn’t want to follow Frances McDormand’s Mildred, from “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” into battle? Or, for that matter, the tough mamas played by Allison Janney in “I, Tonya” and Laurie Metcalf in “Lady Bird”? At the very least, these are not women anyone would soon cross. Nor are Lesley Manville’s icy Cyril from “Phantom Thread”; Margot Robbie’s Tonya Harding; the co-conspirator Octavia Spencer plays in “The Shape of Water”; Mary J. Blige’s sharecropper’s wife in “Mudbound” (Ms. Blige was also nominated for best original song); or even, the Bagger wagers, Saoirse Ronan’s no-nonsense high schooler in “Lady Bird.” This is quite a thing. Only a few years ago, the apparent truism that women had to be winsome or sympathetic to sell films was still holding strong. But Oscar voters and critics went ape for the roster of fearsome female characters that were, at long last, included in this year’s nominated films. (Badass, a term that in the Bagger’s mind is overused to the point of cliché, certainly applies.) Not that there’s anything wrong with the parts that recent Oscar-winning actresses have played, be they harried mothers (“Boyhood”), devoted wives (“The Danish Girl”), washed-up socialites (“Blue Jasmine”) or starry-eyed Hollywood hopefuls (“La La Land”). But this year it was clear that the academy was pretty amped to hear women roar. In these times of #MeToo, Time’s Up and women’s marches, this shouldn’t be a surprise, said Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a filmmaker and founder and chief executive of the Representation Project, a nonprofit that fights gender stereotypes. “With this awards season, we are seeing proof that sexism only sells when it’s the only thing being offered,” Ms. Newsom wrote in an email. She sees the presidency of Donald J. Trump as playing no small part in the nominees’ appeal. “When a man who is so openly misogynistic beats the first female candidate of a major party to become president, it’s an aha moment,” Ms. Newsom added. (A New York Times colleague, Frank Bruni, has written about  the Trump connection in Oscar-contending films and the racial and economic anxieties they laid bare.) Caveat time. With the exception of Steven Spielberg’s “The Post,” most of these films were long in the works, hatched while the prospects of a Trump presidency and the #MeToo movement seemed unforeseeable, impossibly distant or just plain impossible. “The Post,” which stars Meryl Streep as the publisher Katharine Graham (another mighty female character that earned Ms. Streep her 21st Oscar nod), was quickly made after the election. Certainly all of the films’ awards campaigns are trumpeting why they are so relevant now. It could be coincidence that the other films just happened to come out in time for #MeToo. Martin McDonagh, the writer and director of “Three Billboards,” has said that he wrote a strong female lead because he had done so in his plays but had yet to in his films. Guillermo del Toro, who directed “The Shape of Water,” has a history of writing strong female characters, and has said he had wanted to make a human-amphibian love story for years. Greta Gerwig told Slate that she didn’t feel her script for “Lady Bird” was ready until 2015. But chances are these movies, and the academy’s receptivity to them, are in part products of a shift that began when criticism of Hollywood’s white, male homogeneity became impossible to ignore. (Recall that in 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union called on government agencies to investigate Hollywood’s hiring practices.) The success and might of female-led production companies, like Reese Witherspoon’s firm and Shonda Rhimes’s Shondaland, along with the box office bounty brought by women-led films, also played roles. “The dominance of strong female characters over a certain age, the #MeToo movement, the Time’s Up campaign all result from decades of work and years of women resisting and speaking out about the limiting narrative media spread about our worth,” Ms. Newsom said. Needless to say, Hollywood is a long way from being a happy, joyous and equitable place for women. For one thing, there’s a bit of a sexual harassment problem, as perhaps you’ve heard. (But hey, it’s everywhere!) For another, women continue to be grossly underrepresented onscreen and off. Researchers at the University of Southern California found that in the 100 top-grossing films of 2016, less than a third of the speaking characters (31.4 percent) were women. In those 100 films, only 34 had women as the lead or one of the leads. And of those, a mere eight were 45 or older. That was an improvement from the year before, when there were five. Which makes this year’s batch of Oscar-nominated ladies all the more remarkable. The average age of the supporting actress nominees is 55, and the youngest nominee in that category is Mary J. Blige, who just turned 47. (Octavia Spencer turns 48 in May.) The runaway favorite for best actress, Ms. McDormand, is 60. Sure Ms. McDormand’s fellow nominee, Ms. Ronan, is 23, but she plays a pretty tough customer in “Lady Bird,” and also has never been considered an ingénue. (See “Hannah,” or her bone-chilling performance in “The Crucible.”) Ms. Robbie, who is 27, officially graduated from ingénue status with her fierce, fearless performance in “I, Tonya.” The remaining nominated actresses are all in their 60s, with the exceptions of Sally Hawkins, who is 41, and Ms. Janney, 58. (“Oscars so menopausal?” suggested a person close to the Bagger, falling silent after she shot him daggers with her eyes.) At the very least, this shows the expanding horizons for women in Hollywood, something Nicole Kidman, 50, highlighted after winning a Screen Actors Guild Award on Sunday night. “Twenty years ago we were pretty washed up by this stage in our lives,” she said. “That’s not the case now. We’ve proven that we’re potent, powerful and viable.” Maybe, for all the Bagger’s resistance to the word, a new hashtag is apt. #OscarsSoBadass. Bring it. "

258,"WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Alex M. Azar II on Wednesday to be secretary of health and human services, clearing the way for President Trump’s second health secretary to begin controlling more than a trillion dollars a year in spending on medical insurance coverage for about one-third of all Americans. The vote was 55 to 43. Mr. Azar, an ophthalmologist’s son and former drug company executive who served in the administration of George W. Bush, faces two huge challenges. He is supposed to find a way to rein in prices charged by drug companies, which Mr. Trump said last year were “getting away with murder” — a view shared by many consumers. In addition, Mr. Azar must decide how to administer the Affordable Care Act, a task for which he will be personally and legally responsible, at a time when Mr. Trump and many Republicans in Congress want to undermine and eventually kill the law. On many issues, Mr. Azar will face a choice: whether to try to stabilize insurance markets and repair the health law or to “let Obamacare fail,” as Mr. Trump threatened to do last summer. His choices could have significant consequences for consumers and for Republicans on the ballot this fall. At hearings before two Senate committees to review his qualifications, Mr. Azar presented himself as a problem-solving pragmatist rather than an ideologue. At no time did he deviate much from the policies set by Mr. Trump. “The Affordable Care Act has failed millions of Americans who have lost the plans they liked and the doctors they liked,” Mr. Azar declared. Mr. Azar, 50, graduated from Yale Law School and was a law clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court. Democrats dismissed the idea that Mr. Azar might be a moderating influence in the administration. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, said Wednesday: “I’m alarmed that Mr. Azar believes a woman’s employer should be able to decide, based on ideology, whether or not her birth control should be covered. I’m alarmed by his extreme and out-of-touch views on Roe v. Wade,” the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, explained why he had decided to oppose Mr. Azar: “The Trump administration’s determination to destroy the Affordable Care Act through executive action has destabilized our health care system and threatened coverage for millions. I fear Alex Azar could make things even worse.” But Republicans were broadly supportive. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has been in the Senate for 41 years, told Mr. Azar, “You’re one of the best public servants that I’ve seen in the whole time that I’ve been here.” Mr. Azar said repeatedly in recent weeks that “drug prices are too high,” but he placed most of the responsibility on “a system” that encourages price increases. “Everyone shares blame,” he told the Senate health committee in November. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, was frustrated. “Mr. Azar says he agrees that prices are too high, but he does not seem ready or willing to do much about it,” she said. From 2012 to early 2017, Mr. Azar was the president of Lilly USA, a unit of Eli Lilly and Company, the global drug maker based in Indiana. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Mr. Azar told the panel that “he had never — not even one time — signed off on a decrease in the price of a medicine.” “On Mr. Azar’s watch,” Mr. Wyden said, “the price of Forteo, a Lilly drug used to treat osteoporosis, more than doubled,” as did the prices for Humalog, used to treat diabetes, and Strattera, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Six Democratic senators and one independent joined 48 Republicans in voting for Mr. Azar. Opposing him were 41 Democrats, one Republican and one independent. The Democrats who voted for Mr. Azar were Senators Thomas R. Carper and Chris Coons, both of Delaware, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote no. The independent senators split, with Angus King of Maine supporting Mr. Azar and Bernie Sanders of Vermont opposing him. Mr. Hatch said Mr. Azar’s experience as a drug company executive, far from creating a conflict of interest, was an asset. And he said he hoped Mr. Azar would undo many of the policies put in place because of “poor decisions made throughout the eight years of the Obama administration.” Mr. Azar will replace Tom Price, who resigned as health secretary in September, in the face of multiple federal inquiries into his use of private and government planes for travel. Republicans tried unsuccessfully last year to roll back the expansion of Medicaid authorized by the Affordable Care Act. But the Trump administration is determined to make major changes in the program. Mr. Azar told Congress that states should be allowed to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries. “One of the best ways to improve the long-term health of low-income Americans is to empower them with skills and employment, for those who are able to work,” Mr. Azar said. "
259,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration unfurled new sanctions on Wednesday targeting North Korea and its weapons program, underscoring the aggressive approach that President Trump has promised to take against the government of Kim Jong-un. The new sanctions, released by the Treasury Department, target North Korean and Chinese trading companies, North Korean ships and North Korea’s ministry of oil. They also hit North Korean representatives in China and Russia who are members of the Workers’ Party of Korea and who have helped North Korea transfer chemicals and equipment used for weapons production. “Treasury continues to systematically target individuals and entities financing the Kim regime and its weapons programs, including officials complicit in North Korean sanctions evasion schemes,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement. Mr. Mnuchin said that, in accord with United Nations Security Council resolutions, he also is calling on Russia and China to expel anyone working in their countries on behalf of North Korea’s financial networks. The moves come as the White House has been ratcheting up pressure on North Korea following a fiery exchange between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim earlier this year, in which Mr. Trump declared on Twitter that America’s nuclear arsenal is “much bigger” and more powerful than Mr. Kim’s. The saber-rattling renewed fears about the prospect of war and raised questions about whether such a bombastic approach was the best way to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In recent weeks, however, Mr. Trump has suggested that he might be willing to hold direct talks with Mr. Kim. He also voiced his support for the political thaw between North and South Korea, which have agreed to march their athletes together under one flag at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February. "

261,"WASHINGTON — The immigration battle between the Trump administration and local governments escalated on Wednesday, as the Justice Department increased its pressure on so-called sanctuary cities and Democratic mayors from several of the country’s largest cities responded by canceling a meeting with the president. The Justice Department asked 23 jurisdictions across the country to furnish documents proving that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities. Mr. Sessions said he would subpoena local governments that failed to respond in a thorough and timely manner. “Protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Enough is enough.” In objection to the Justice Department’s request, mayors of New York, Chicago and other cities declined to attend a scheduled meeting to discuss infrastructure with President Trump at the White House. Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans and the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday that he saw the Justice Department’s move as an “attack,” and that he could not “in good conscience” attend the White House meeting. “President Trump shouldn’t invite us to the White House for a meeting on infrastructure and three hours before issue the equivalent of what are arrest warrants for standing up for what we believe in and, by the way, what America believes in,” said Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago. "

263,"On the first anniversary of his inauguration, President Trump spent the day blasting Democrats for the government shutdown, suggesting that women marching in protest of his presidency were somehow celebrating it, and embroiled in allegations that he paid off a porn star to keep her quiet about their relationship. Melania Trump, meanwhile, commemorated the anniversary by tweeting a single photo of herself on Inauguration Day on the arm of a Marine. Her husband was nowhere in sight, and she did not mention his name. A few days later — on what happened to be the Trumps’ 13th wedding anniversary — she canceled her plans to accompany Mr. Trump to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She may not be progressive. She may not be political. And yet Mrs. Trump may end up doing more than any of her predecessors to upend our expectations of the slavish devotion a first lady must display toward her husband. Her reasons for doing so, of course, are almost certainly personal. With the exception of the Clintons, there has not been a more complicated first couple in modern history: Mrs. Trump is the third wife of a man who once told the radio host Howard Stern he would “give her a week” to lose the baby weight after their son, Barron, was born. During the 2016 campaign she was put in the position of defending him after a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video showed him bragging about groping women. Since then, however, she has been anything but a public defender, and, in fact, has been defiant in her silence. First ladies are expected to accept their husband’s infidelities and cruelty and to remain their strongest champions, no matter what the circumstances (and Mrs. Trump’s are, undoubtedly, extreme). Lyndon Johnson could be downright mean to his wife, Lady Bird, upbraiding her in public and comparing her with women he found more beautiful. But when he was upset about negative press coverage ahead of the Democratic National Convention in 1964, it was his wife who cheered him on. In a fawning letter, Mrs. Johnson wrote: “Beloved — You are as brave a man as Harry Truman — or FDR — or Lincoln. You can go on to find some peace, some achievement amidst all the pain. You have been strong, patient, determined beyond any words of mine to express.” It is hard to imagine Mrs. Trump writing anything of the sort to her husband. "

265,"Television ratings for the N.F.L. have fallen 17 percent over the past two seasons. The league is embroiled in a continuing crisis over concussions, and youth participation rates are falling. All of this suggests a difficult future for the sport, yet the N.F.L.’s most notorious competitor, Vince McMahon’s XFL, has a comeback in the works. McMahon, the chairman and chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, announced on Thursday that he would take a second crack at professional football, with play scheduled to start in early 2020. McMahon first tried to reimagine pro football 17 years ago. The old XFL was a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation (W.W.E.’s former name) and NBC, which had lost rights to broadcast N.F.L. games. Violence was amped up: An opening scramble replaced the coin toss and fair catches were banned. So was the sex appeal, with cheerleaders who were even more scantily clad than the ones in the N.F.L., and advertising that included innuendo about them. “Where is my smash-mouth, wide-open football?” McMahon asked rhetorically at the news conference announcing plans for the original XFL “This will not be a league for pantywaists and sissies.” "
266,"Stephanie Miner, the former Democratic mayor of Syracuse, announced Thursday that she would not challenge a Republican congressman in her Central New York district, but instead was seriously considering a run for governor. To date, no major candidate has stepped forward from either party to oppose Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this fall, and Ms. Miner’s public ruminations about such a challenge are sure to rankle state Democratic Party officials. “I’m still seriously considering it,” Ms. Miner said about a campaign for governor. In 2014, a relatively unknown candidate, Zephyr Teachout, a law professor, took on Mr. Cuomo and garnered a surprising 34 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary. Just as Ms. Teachout highlighted some of Mr. Cuomo’s perceived shortcomings, suggesting that he had tilted too far to the right, Ms. Miner, an unapologetic progressive, wasted no time in pointing out Mr. Cuomo’s vulnerabilities. In an interview in Midtown Manhattan, Ms. Miner, who is teaching a course on municipal finance at New York University, chastised the governor for his handling of the transit crisis, with the subway system troubled by delays and breakdowns. “Anywhere and everywhere I go, people talk about the transit issue,” she said over coffee at Pennsylvania Station, where she was preparing to board an Amtrak back to Syracuse. “People’s frustration and anger is palpable. I think he bears a great deal of responsibility.” "

President Trump met with his British and Israeli counterparts at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He’s set to give a highly anticipated speech tomorrow. Calling the reports of a rift with Prime Minister Theresa May, above left, “a false rumor,” Mr. Trump indicated that he might be planning another trip across the pond. The last one was canceled, averting the risk of large protests. And with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, at his side, he criticized the Palestinians for refusing to meet with Vice President Mike Pence during his visit to Israel this week. Palestinian leaders were angered by the administration’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. ____ 2. Elsewhere in Davos, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin unleashed market turmoil with an apparently offhand comment — that a weak dollar benefits U.S. trade. The currency plunged to a three-year low amid a flurry of speculation about the administration’s economic plans. Above, Mr. Mnuchin’s signature on the dollar. Here’s our full coverage of the happenings in Davos. ____ 3. The White House is about to offer Democrats what it hopes will be an excruciating choice. In exchange for eventual citizenship for the Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors, they’ll have to accept a huge border wall and strict policies designed to block immigrants from bringing relatives to the U.S. The strategy is set to be released on Monday, and Democrats and activists have vowed to reject it. Above, Dreamers in Washington. Separately, we reported that President Trump ordered the firing last June of the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, Robert Mueller. But he ultimately backed down after the White House’s top lawyer threatened to resign over the directive. ____ 4. “You are the bravest person I’ve ever had in my courtroom.” That’s how a judge described Rachael Denhollander, above, the first former gymnast to go public about abuse by Larry Nassar, the former doctor for the U.S. team. Today on “The Daily,” we talked to another gymnast who spoke at the extraordinary court proceeding. And a writer for our newsletter on gender issues, The #MeToo Moment, asked why it took so long for the gymnasts to get justice. ____ 5. Puerto Rico’s leaders say the island won’t be able to pay down any of its $70 billion debt for the next five years because of the damage from Hurricane Maria. We talked to artists and curators about how the island’s art scene is persevering after the storm. Above, the view from one artist’s studio. ____ 6. Election news from the around world: Another challenger dropped out of Egypt’s presidential election, clearing the field for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to run virtually unopposed. The human rights lawyer Khaled Ali, above, said a fair contest wasn’t possible after a concerted government effort to derail his campaign. A Brazilian appeals court upheld the corruption conviction of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, one of the lions of the Latin American left. He remains Brazil’s most popular politician, but the court’s ruling will jeopardize his bid for a third term in office. Victory is similarly assured for the incumbent in Russia’s upcoming presidential vote. But Vladimir Putin is pushing hard for high turnout as a way to ensure a strong mandate. ____ 7. Tough week: The Doomsday Clock was advanced by 30 seconds to 2 minutes to midnight. The last time the clock was so close to midnight was in 1953, during the Cold War. Devised by the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the clock is meant to convey “how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making.” The group cited the threats of nuclear war and climate change at the announcement in Washington, above. ____ 8.

269,"DAVOS, Switzerland — When President Trump arrived on Thursday at the conference center where the world’s financial and political elite have been meeting, onlookers crowded a balcony and craned their heads to see the leader who has challenged the very international order that Davos represents. At first, it was quiet. Then someone called out a question. “Are you going to be treated well?” he was asked. “You tell me,” Mr. Trump replied. The reverse question was unasked but hung in the air: How was he going to treat them? If he was not exactly entering the lion’s den, it was nonetheless a fraught moment for both sides as the America First president ventured into the lair of the we-are-the-world banking titans, corporate magnates and international leaders who have spent decades preaching the virtues of global integration. Rather than confrontation, both sides labored for conciliation, at least to a point. For one afternoon and evening, at least, Mr. Trump threw no protectionist grenades and even broached the possibility, however remote, that he would re-enter a Pacific trade agreement that he scrapped last year, if it were renegotiated. For its part, the Davos crowd welcomed its top critic with a reception and warm words. The mood was strikingly different from a year ago, when Mr. Trump was about to take office and the globalists meeting in this mountaintop getaway reeled in shock, panicked that his campaign promises meant the end of the movement they had nurtured for decades. A year later, many of the business and political elites remain dismissive of him, privately rolling eyes and using words like “madman,” but there was excitement about economic growth, and the tax cuts and regulatory rollback he has ushered in.

271,"WASHINGTON — Victims’ rights and women’s rights groups sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday, saying that rules that she issued last year to guide campuses on how to manage sexual assault complaints violated federal law and discriminated against accusers. Three organizations, represented by prominent civil rights litigators, filed a complaint in the Northern District of California outlining ways that the guidance issued by Ms. DeVos in the fall had had a “chilling effect” on campus sexual assault investigations. Since the guidance was issued, the groups charged, accusers have been less inclined to pursue sexual assault cases, and colleges have demonstrated a lack of urgency and clarity in pursuing them. In September, Ms. DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance on how colleges should manage the investigations under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination and governs the rules on investigating sexual assault on campus. A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Under Ms. DeVos’s administration, the department has continued to open sexual assault cases and has maintained a contentious Obama-era practice of publishing a list of campuses with open investigations. Last week, in an abrupt and unannounced move, the department began publishing a database of all pending civil rights cases. According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases. "

273,"What is signal and what is noise in the news and developments coming out of the Russia investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel? President Trump said Wednesday he would “love to” testify under oath in the investigation. As Mr. Mueller lines up the president for an interview, the issue of obstruction of justice will take center stage. Donald Trump and officials of the 2016 Trump campaign have established a clear pattern of lying to the media. More important for the law on obstruction, they have also either approached or crossed right over the line of lying to federal authorities. Giving false statements to the media is not a crime. But lying to federal authorities can land people in jail. We know that to the media, since at least July 2016, Mr. Trump and campaign officials lied, repeatedly and often, about not having had contacts with Russian officials. As late as August 2017, President Trump held that line, telling The Wall Street Journal: “There’s nobody on the campaign that saw anybody from Russia. We had nothing to do with Russia.” This sustained pattern of lying to the media about any Russian contacts was almost surely done by design and coordinated from within Mr. Trump’s inner circle. Were statements to federal authorities also done by design and coordinated? If you direct your attention to the series of known cases when Trump officials have not told the truth to the F.B.I. and to Congress about Russian contacts, what emerges is a likely conspiracy on the part of Mr. Trump’s inner circle to mislead federal officials. That’s where the stakes could not be much higher for the White House. Not only is it a crime to lie to federal authorities; it’s also a crime to encourage others to do so, whether or not they follow through with crossing the line of perjury. We know that Trump campaign associates did not report to federal authorities their information about Russian efforts during the campaign, even after the F.B.I. urged Mr. Trump and his aides to alert the agency to any suspicious overtures. Far worse are the numerous instances in which Trump campaign officials either lied to federal officials or came perilously close. We have two undisputed cases, through the indictments of Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, and George Papadopoulos, the former foreign policy adviser. It is difficult to see how the two men could expect to get away with it. Who would lie to the F.B.I. if one’s colleagues, interviewed at a later date, would contradict the false account of the same set of events? We now know Mr. Flynn’s phone call during the transition in December 2016 with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, was coordinated with other senior transition officials meeting at Mar-a-Lago, in Florida. When it came to Mr. Flynn’s F.B.I. interview, a story was already in place. The day before, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had adamantly denied that Mr. Flynn spoke to the Russians about sanctions. So to get away with lying to the F.B.I., whether or not he alerted White House officials to the meeting beforehand, Mr. Flynn would presumably have to count on the others sticking to that lie, too. The same goes for Mr. Papadopoulos, who risked going to prison for lying to the F.B.I. As with Mr. Flynn, his communications with the Russians were well known and approved by senior campaign officials. The pattern goes on from there. If Mr. Flynn was counting on others to cover his tracks, he seems to have calculated correctly. For example, K. T. McFarland, the former deputy national security adviser who also served on the transition team, told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, in writing, that she was not aware of Mr. Flynn’s contacts with the Russian ambassador. That was a lie, disproved by court documents revealing her close strategizing with Mr. Flynn before and after the call and by the news report of her email coordinating on the matter with senior members of the Trump transition team at Mar-a-Lago. (Mr. Spicer was one of the email’s recipients.) Jeff Sessions also infamously lied to federal authorities or at least risked perjury. During his confirmation hearings for attorney general and in subsequent written answers to a senator, Mr. Sessions denied having communications with the Russians. As we now know, The Washington Post revealed that Mr. Sessions met with the Russian ambassador at least twice — and United States intelligence intercepted the Russians saying that they had spoken with Mr. Sessions about the election. Perhaps Mr. Sessions felt he had to lie during his confirmation process. Mr. Trump had told reporters, at his first news conference as president-elect, that nobody associated with the campaign was in contact with any of the Russians. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, skipped over multiple meetings with Russians on his security clearance forms, which were vetted by the F.B.I. Mr. Kushner’s omissions were so alarming that it caused Charles Phalen, the sitting director of the government bureau responsible for clearing these forms, to tell Congress, “I have never seen that level of mistakes.” Finally, Donald Trump Jr. may also have lied to congressional investigators by testifying that he did not inform his father of the Trump Tower meeting with Russians. There is no hard public evidence to prove this, but it is hard to fathom that Don Jr. didn’t inform the candidate of a meeting that was set up on the proposal, as far as he knew, for the Russian government to aid the campaign and that he thought deserved the direct involvement of Paul Manafort, then the campaign manager, and Mr. Kushner. In short, if you block out much of the noise that has surrounded the Russia investigation and focus on certain public information, you can see the outline of a concerted effort to mislead federal officials. Once the Trump inner circle decided to keep telling the media there had been no campaign contacts with Russians whatsoever, that categorical denial may have been the easiest line to maintain. The effort to mislead the public would then be reinforced by an effort to mislead the federal investigators. That’s an easier step to imagine given Mr. Trump’s deep distrust of the intelligence community and his view of their willingness to leak to the press. How could campaign officials, or the president himself, expect to get away with any such scheme, especially when encouraging others to commit perjury is a serious federal offense? Maybe they didn’t anticipate a full investigation. The president admitted that he felt if Mr. Sessions had only held on, the attorney general would have shut down the Russia investigation: “If Jeff Sessions didn’t recuse himself, we wouldn’t even be talking about this subject.” Well, surprise. We are talking about it. And so will witnesses brought in by Mr. Mueller, who has shown his willingness to prosecute four former campaign officials, in each case for making false statements to federal authorities. It will not take much for the special counsel to get to the bottom of how far the president and his associates went to cover up their Russian contacts. With Mr. Flynn, Mr. Papadopoulos and now Steve Bannon cooperating, if and when the time comes for Mr. Trump’s interview, Mr. Mueller’s team will be well prepared to ask the president about his own knowledge and involvement. "
274,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump said on Wednesday that he was open to a path to citizenship after 10 to 12 years for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. His comments came days after he rejected a bipartisan plan built around that idea. The fate of the so-called Dreamers is at the center of a stalemate in Congress made more complicated by Mr. Trump’s shifting position: He has expressed sympathy for the young immigrants while demanding a crackdown on illegal immigration. • Poll after poll has found that a large majority of Americans support protection for the Dreamers. We spoke to some of those who don’t. • President Trump said he was eager to be interviewed by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, possibly in the next few weeks. “There’s been no collusion whatsoever,” the president said. “There’s no obstruction whatsoever, and I’m looking forward to it.” • Separately on Wednesday, the Justice Department rebuked an effort by House Republicans to undermine the Russia investigation. Representative Devin Nunes of California has led a push to release a memo, drawing on classified information, that is said to accuse the F.B.I. of abusing its power. • With those words, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced Lawrence Nassar, the former doctor for the U.S. gymnastics team, to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday for multiple sex crimes. More than 150 women confronted Dr. Nassar, 54, during his seven-day sentencing hearing, accusing him of abuse. We highlighted some of their poignant comments. • Dr. Nassar was also on the faculty at Michigan State University until 2016, when the abuse came to light. Amid fallout from the scandal, the university’s president, Lou Anna Simon, resigned on Wednesday. • It was a major security mistake of the Iraq war: Militants, including the current leader of the Islamic State, were held for years at a U.S. detention facility, where they became even more radicalized. Now, American-backed Kurdish militias in Syria have detained hundreds of ISIS fighters and their families in makeshift camps, raising fears among U.S. military officials of another breeding ground for extremists. • President Trump warned Turkey on Wednesday to limit its attacks on the Kurds. The Turkish government views them as terrorists, but they have helped the U.S. fight Islamic State militants. • President Trump is on his way to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to explain his “America First” approach. But the world has moved ahead with a trade agenda that no longer revolves around the U.S. Whatever reception Mr. Trump receives at the forum, one thing is true for its moneyed elite: The president has been good for business. You can find all of our Davos coverage here. • More large companies like Starbucks and Walmart are seeing the value in paid leave and other benefits for parents, and are beginning to close the gap between salaried and hourly workers. • Demand for coal in the U.S. continues to fall, and the impact is being felt in Pennsylvania, where the closing of a mine will idle 370 workers. • Britain’s “most un-P.C.” charity is shutting down. An undercover investigation revealed that participants at the annual fund-raising dinner of the Presidents Club groped and propositioned young women hired as servers. • U.S. stocks were mixed on Wednesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Throw an incredible Super Bowl party. • Should you give back the engagement ring? • Recipe of the day: Satisfy a sweet tooth with salted chocolate chunk shortbread cookies. • Governor, mayor and soon-to-be retiree Jerry Brown, 79, says his time in public service is “getting close to the end.” We spoke to the  two-time governor of California, the face of the state’s old political order, who will deliver his final State of the State speech today. • Pope Francis on “fake news” The serpent in the Garden of Eden hissed the first fake news to Eve and it all went downhill from there, Pope Francis wrote in a major document about the phenomenon. • Those magazines sure stack up Even as print flails, piles of Vogues, Playboys and other publications are being painstakingly preserved in a former cannon foundry in London. We visited the Guinness World Record-holding collection. • Best of late-night TV President Trump is traveling to Davos with the message that America is open for business. “And who better to make that declaration than a man who declared bankruptcy six different times?” Jimmy Kimmel asked. • Quotation of the day “Maybe there was some sort of presumption on the part of the president and his team that if the U.S. said stop, this process would come to a halt. What this shows is that’s not true. The world just moves on without us.” — Phil Levy, a former White House economist, on President Trump’s approach to trade pacts. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. In honor of Australia Day, Friday’s holiday marking the anniversary of Britain’s arrival Down Under in 1788, we’re looking at one of the country’s most recognizable exports: “G’day, mate!” Australian National University points to an early use of the greeting in “The Romance of a Station,” a novel from 1889: “He pulled up, nodding to Alec’s ‘Good-day, Tillidge,’ and replying in a short, morose manner, running his words one into the other, as a bushman does, ‘G’d-day, sir.’ ” A century later, the phrase was popularized the world over in a tourism campaign featuring Paul Hogan, the Australian actor who would later gain international fame as Crocodile Dundee. Australians have a long tradition of abbreviating and slackening words and phrases, particularly by adding “ie” to the end. “Aussie” appears in references from World War I. A book by Gertrude Moberly, recounting the experiences of a nurse, described a “farewell dance for the boys going home to ‘Aussie’ tomorrow.” And Australians always have their “mates.” The nation’s unique camaraderie, known as mateship, is especially evident during commemorations of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (or Anzacs), the World War I-era fighting force.

276,"Donald J. Trump’s boardroom in “The Apprentice” was like something out of a movie. Specifically, “Network.” In the Netflix documentary “The Confidence Man,” two “Apprentice” producers say they found the actual Trump Organization offices too dated and dowdy for TV. So they built a set in Trump Tower, modeled on the darkened lair where the mogul, Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), dresses down the rebellious newsman Howard Beale (Peter Finch), howling, “The world is a business!” That’s what reality TV does: It set-designs locations (a “Survivor” island, a “Bachelor” love nest) to look more convincing, more in line with our mental cartoons than the real thing. “The Confidence Man,” a swift, brutal overview of Mr. Trump’s business career, argues that he had been doing the same thing with his image for decades: He wasn’t a business titan so much as he played one on TV. The film, directed by Fisher Stevens (“Bright Lights”), is the last episode of a six-part anthology, “Dirty Money,” from the filmmaker Alex Gibney (“Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room”), arriving Friday. The installments range from an infuriating look at payday lending to an offbeat story about Canadian maple syrup cartels. The common thread is the abuse of trust. And “The Confidence Man” argues that the problem goes all the way to the top. Mr. Stevens’s narrative starts with Trump Tower, the gleaming metonym Mr. Trump hung his name on in brass letters. The splashy project landed him on talk shows and magazine covers as the photogenic shorthand for Reagan-age materialism. That served his other big 1980s construction effort — his media image, for which he poured the foundation in the New York tabloids. The gossip columnist A. J. Benza recalls Mr. Trump as a regular source, offering juicy tips with only one condition: that he be referred to in print as a billionaire. TV reports picked up on the description and embellished it, and Mr. Trump smiled and let them. “The Confidence Man” interviews old friends, like the music mogul Russell Simmons, and associates like Barbara Res, the executive in charge of the Trump Tower construction, who remember his mythmaking bemusedly. Compared with real estate families like the Zeckendorfs, Ms. Res says, “Who was Trump? He was nobody.” Maybe Mr. Trump wasn’t the biggest developer. But he was the most visible, and he banked on people taking one for the other. (A later ad for Trump University declared, “Donald Trump is, without question, the world’s most famous businessman” — trusting the audience to read that as “most successful.”) Banks threw money at his celebrity, and he spent it on high-visibility purchases: an airline, the Plaza Hotel, a football team, casinos. When it all went bad by the early ’90s, fame was his guarantor. His creditors, who needed the Trump brand to survive in order to get paid back, put him on an allowance to keep up a glitzy front. Mr. Trump, the film argues, has thrived by finding partners — in finance, reality TV, politics — who were as invested as he was in propping up his image. Mr. Trump’s self-inflation has been covered before. In the 2005 book “TrumpNation” the former New York Times reporter Tim O’Brien, who figures heavily in this documentary, concluded that Mr. Trump was worth mere hundreds of millions, not billions. (Mr. Trump sued him for libel, unsuccessfully.) But “The Confidence Man” is useful for how it separates out the business thread from the recent tangle of “How we got Trump” analyses. When Mr. Trump’s business became licensing his name to others, he essentially turned into a mascot. He showed up on sitcoms and did fast-food ads with his ex-wife Ivana and Grimace from McDonald’s. He was his own Col. Sanders, personifying the herbs and spices — glitter, ambition — that “TRUMP” in big brass letters stood for. That made him a perfect host for “The Apprentice,” whose premise was that Mr. Trump was a legendary businessman and desirable boss. TV fame opened up other opportunities, and the last half of “The Confidence Man” detours into dark intimations about Mr. Trump’s partnerships with businessmen from former Soviet republics and his alleged self-enrichment as president. It also re-examines the fraud case, later settled, against Trump University that his opponents tried to make stick to him in the 2016 campaign. But the film’s larger case is against the reasoning that helped elect him: He was the most famous businessman, therefore he was the best businessman, therefore — following the logic of Mitt Romney and H. Ross Perot before him — he would be the best president. “He’s managed businesses,” one voter quoted in the film says, “and I think he can manage this country.” You could, of course, argue that branding and the ability to leverage illusions are valuable skills themselves. You could agree with Arthur Jensen that the world is a business. But the forceful conclusion of “The Confidence Man” is that Mr. Trump’s world is, and has always been, a stage. "

This one was sent to us from Sue Pfeffer in Toronto: How much of the problem is caused by methane gas emitted from raising farm animals for the meat industry? The impact of agriculture, a category that includes everything from growing lettuce to raising livestock, is tricky to express because the gasses produced — mostly methane and nitrous oxide — have much more warming potential than carbon dioxide but also dissipate more quickly. According to the latest thinking, though, farming is responsible for the equivalent of 574 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States each year and 56 million metric tons in Canada. That’s about 8 percent of each country’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Methane is increasingly drawing attention from researchers because its worldwide levels have doubled in less than 10 years after remaining flat since the 1990s. The reasons behind the increase are not well understood. In the United States, 42 percent of agricultural emissions come from animal agriculture. Two-thirds of those gases are directly emitted by ruminants: animals like cows, buffalo and sheep that use bacteria in their stomachs to ferment food. That allows them to eat foods, like grasses, that humans can’t. "

279,"BERLIN — The previous time I lived in Berlin, in 2000, China had recently bought a building by the Spree River to use for a sprawling new embassy, and the staff would bully the clients of a women-only gym that had a lease on the top floor with verbal insults and by making them undergo intimidating security checks. The bizarre practice was aimed, apparently, at forcing out the gym and securing use of the entire building for China. It worked. Today, the silver and mirror-clad embassy sparkles by the spinach-colored waters of the Spree, satellite dishes and antennas poking out on top. I’m back in Berlin, having spent the intervening years reporting in Beijing as China vaulted from sixth place to second in global economic strength, pushing down Germany from third to fourth. Returning to this country from China, I am struck by how Beijing is asserting its interests here in ways that threaten Germany’s core values, going well beyond intimidating gym-going women. Germany must end Chinese meddling in its hard-earned democracy. Berlin has a stronger hand than many Germans appear to realize: China does not want to lose the good will and cooperation of this technologically strong and politically influential partner in the heart of Europe. Germany should be pushing back against Chinese interference with consistency and strength, just as China does when it feels its core interests are threatened. In recent months China has sent up a series of trial balloons to see how far it can stretch the boundaries of German democracy. First and most easily spotted: challenges to free speech and political protest on German soil. Take an incident in November, when the Chinese halted a soccer match between their under-20 team and TSV Schott Mainz in southwestern Germany to protest a handful of Tibetans and German fans with Tibetan “snow lion” flags. China regards the flags as a sign of resistance to its rule in Tibet. The Chinese players returned to the field only after the flags were furled. (China lost, 3-0.) "
280,"In the fall of 2016, Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, sat down with some of the most powerful figures in the global economy. Hosted by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, their discussion focused on financial trouble spots around the globe. There was scant talk about poverty, which the World Bank has committed to eradicate. And as such, there was no cause for Mr. Kim to join the discussion in a meaningful way. “I sat there and thought, ‘we are completely irrelevant to the majority of these countries,’” Mr. Kim recalled. “The I.M.F. is a systemically important financial institution. But we are seen as just a bunch of do-gooders.” The World Bank, once a powerhouse of global finance, is searching for relevance. Mr. Kim’s unusual solution: embrace Wall Street. For decades, the World Bank followed a simple formula. Developed-world governments that are the bank’s members provided the bulk of its money, which was used to make loans to developing nations for infrastructure projects and the like. But that model is under strain. Some 1.3 billion people still live in extreme poverty, and the bank’s war chest is dwarfed by the funds pouring into developing countries through financial markets. Perhaps most important, the World Bank’s biggest benefactor and largest shareholder — the United States — has become its most trenchant critic. Mr. Kim’s mission is to revitalize the World Bank by increasing its firepower and winning over the United States. To do so, he is fundamentally, and controversially, changing how the bank operates. Instead of relying solely on contributions from reluctant donor governments, he is pushing private investors — sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and insurance companies — to pony up trillions of dollars for projects in Indonesia, Zambia, India and elsewhere. His pitch: They can reap rich returns by putting their money to work alongside the World Bank. As well as visiting villages, Mr. Kim tours financial capitals, hobnobbing with chief executives, bankers and fund managers. Interest rate swaps, internal rates of return, first-loss debt instruments: the jargon rolls off his tongue with the fluency of an investment banker. Trained as an anthropologist and medical doctor, Mr. Kim now says that the world of high finance is “some of the coolest stuff I have ever looked at.” In December, at an environmental summit in Paris, he used the phrase “deals on the table” seven times in an eight-minute speech. During the address he promoted four World Bank projects that would use private-sector capital. World Bank traditionalists are squirming. “It is not enough to be just another private equity fund,” said Scott Morris, a former United States Treasury official who worked with the World Bank, now at the Center for Global Development. The World Bank was founded at the end of World War II, part of an effort to remake the international financial system in a free-market mold. Through subsidized loans, the goal was to stimulate recovery in ravaged Europe and, later, economic development in the world’s poorer parts. The dams, pipelines and roads that these loans built spurred progress. They also stirred controversy when the bank was criticized for environmental destruction and supporting despots. Along the way, an entrenched bureaucracy of economists and development experts took shape. Resistant to change, they sustain and defend the bank’s original mission: funneling loans to emerging economies. The son of Korean immigrants, Mr. Kim worked in the slums of Haiti and Peru, guided by the liberation theology of Catholic priests and the outrage of leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky. Unlike past World Bank presidents, who hailed from politics and finance, Mr. Kim’s background — as a public health crusader and a vocal critic of the bank for imposing heavy-handed solutions on poor countries — made him acutely aware of the institution’s frailties. After taking office he immediately embarked on a reform plan. At the root of this effort is his dream to persuade the private sector to help the bank achieve its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. Via the International Finance Corporation, which is its private sector lending arm and provides cash to companies in exchange for equity stakes, the World Bank currently drums up more than $7 billion a year from the private sector to invest in ventures in the developing world. Mr. Kim wants that figure to increase eventually to $30 billion. In 2016, the bank announced a $5 billion deal to raise cash from insurers like Allianz and Prudential for a vehicle that would invest in infrastructure projects. The World Bank promised to protect investors against some losses. There has been a $500 million bond offering and derivatives offering to fight disease outbreaks. The bank formed a $1 billion partnership with private-equity firm Apollo Global to buy debt in developing countries. Mr. Kim is creating a venture with Credit Suisse to let clients invest in certain World Bank projects. And money is being raised for a $2 billion fund, managed by Amundi, the French investment giant, to buy bonds that finance environmentally friendly projects. Mr. Kim is conducting this experiment at a perilous time for the institution. The United States government is the bank’s largest shareholder, with a 16 percent stake. Under President Trump, it has been openly skeptical about the bank’s mission. In November, David Malpass, who oversees international affairs at the Treasury Department, said at a congressional hearing that those benefiting from the World Bank’s lending practices were “the people who fly in on a first-class ticket to give advice to governments.” And Adam Lerrick, Mr. Trump’s nominee to be a deputy under secretary responsible for the relationship with the World Bank, was a leading contributor to a study that questioned the relevance of the institution. The argument was that growing investment flows into developing countries rendered World Bank lending mostly superfluous. Nearly 20 years later, the report’s critique remains pointed. Last year, the World Bank dispensed $61 billion in loans and investments. By contrast, investors now inject more than $1 trillion a year into emerging markets, financing every manner of corporate or government investment. That is more than the $900 billion the World Bank has doled out in its history. It was 8 a.m. at World Bank headquarters in Washington, and Mr. Kim took his seat at the boat-sized table that dominates the bank’s board room. Its vast length evokes a more majestic time for the bank, when its voice — and loan book — loomed large across continents. Mr. Kim, 58, was on a video feed, urging financiers in Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia to put more of their own money to work in local markets. In effect, he was pitching the bank’s services as a middleman, ready to back projects with guarantees and other incentives. No longer could the World Bank be the sole provider of loans, which, he said, are “crowding out” the private sector. Mr. Kim is, by nature, a cheery person, but there was no mistaking the edge to his voice when he started talking about the World Bank economists whose pay is tied to how many loans they churn out. In his view, the bank needs to reward staff, Wall Street-style, for devising innovative financial solutions. “One of the most difficult things to do in a large bureaucracy is to change incentives,” Mr. Kim told the financiers. “And if you have a large bureaucracy full of economists it is especially hard, because it turns out that economists really hate it when you change the incentives.” Like others before him, Mr. Kim came to his job at the World Bank with bold plans to attack the institution’s bureaucracy. For most of his first term, which started in 2012, following a short stint as the president of Dartmouth, he was consumed by an unpopular reorganization. There were layoffs and bitterness in many areas of the bank. Those tensions are lingering. On Wednesday, the bank’s top economist, Paul Romer, abruptly resigned. Brought in by Mr. Kim a little over a year ago, Mr. Romer ruffled feathers by criticizing the quality of the bank’s voluminous economic reports. His end came after he claimed, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, that the World Bank’s closely-watched report on business conditions in different countries had been altered for political reasons. For Mr. Kim, his vision of the bank as an institution more closely resembling Wall Street poses his biggest challenge. Dominated by economists from the public sphere, the bank tends to see private sector solutions — those involving the profit motive — as morally questionable. “This would be a cultural and organizational shift for the bank, which has not engaged with the private sector in a substantial way,” said Joel Hellman, a former top economist at the bank who is now dean of Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service. “World Bank staffers are used to talking to governments, and now they have to leverage the private sector? It is a different skill set, and flexibility is not the hallmark of development institutions.” Mr. Kim is looking to change staff behavior with positive reinforcement. On the video call, he singled out a lending executive who, instead of simply signing off on a World Bank loan to help Jordan build an airport, created a package that relied heavily on private sector finance. “He had to work against his own incentives,” Mr. Kim said, referring to the bank’s practice of rewarding staff for loans. “And that is part of the institutional problem here.” Mr. Kim’s public criticism of staff has struck a nerve. “He has pursued a strategy of making himself popular in Davos by attacking the organization and its staff,” said Lant Pritchett, a retired World Bank executive. “It is this idea that his hand has been hampered by bureaucratic machinations. That may be accepted in Davos — but it’s completely false.” Mr. Kim’s advisers say morale at the bank is improving and that the work force understands the importance of luring more private sector cash. But Mr. Kim’s motives are more complex than keeping employees happy or even finding the best financial solutions for poor countries. He needs to win over the Trump administration — a task he has attacked energetically. When talking about his relationship with the administration, he drops the first names of White House players. “Ivanka, Jared, Gary Cohn, Dina Powell — they all know our business model very well,” Mr. Kim said. His biggest coup was working with Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and senior adviser, on the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which the bank introduced last October and that has raised $340 million. World Bank staffers sniff at the project, which they have nicknamed the Ivanka Fund. Outside the institution, however, the project was seen as a savvy move by Mr. Kim to outflank his critics at the Treasury Department. In his few meetings with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kim has tried to present the bank as a tool to enhance the administration’s “America First” policy. That could mean generous loans to strategically important countries or even providing expertise for United States infrastructure projects. Mr. Kim is trying to build support for his private-sector emphasis through public speeches. Ever the salesman, he tells the story of the bank’s need to embrace radical solutions as an extension of his own personal journey. He was the son of parents who escaped the ruin of the Korean War. They eventually settled in Muscatine, Iowa, where Mr. Kim was a high school quarterback before going on to Brown and securing advanced medical and anthropology degrees from Harvard. While at Harvard, he helped found Partners in Health, a nonprofit that devises treatment strategies in some of world’s poorest countries. Mr. Kim publicly jokes about ending up at the World Bank after criticizing the institution for being a bureaucratic behemoth, out of touch with the needs of the destitute. He devoured Marx as a young man, he likes to tell audiences. Now he takes counsel from — and socializes with — private equity titans Leon Black and David Rubenstein. “I have met with him many times,” said Mr. Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder of the buyout firm Carlyle Group, who recently hosted a reception honoring Mr. Kim after the screening of a documentary about his public health work. “Jim has a lot of credibility with private equity firms.” Some critics at the bank think Mr. Kim has become too dazzled by bold faced names and billionaires. He golfs (very well, by all accounts) with Michael Bloomberg — who has backed several projects at the bank and hails Mr. Kim as a “doer” — and swaps books with President Emmanuel Macron of France, most recently sending him a copy of “Orientalism,” Edward Said’s critique of Western attitudes toward the Middle East and Asia. Mr. Kim’s turn at the Paris environmental summit in December was an opportunity to trumpet the potential of his reimagined institution. The World Bank has been trying to shed its less-than-green image, and it was a main sponsor of the event, held on an island in the Seine. Mr. Kim had promised Mr. Macron that he would announce some eco-friendly deals. The day before, Mr. Kim had been in Zurich with Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse, pitching clients on a new emerging market fund. And after wall-to-wall meetings at the Paris conference, he planned to fly to Tokyo to sell investors on the World Bank’s latest financial innovations. His voice was hoarse; hectic travel and speechmaking had taken their toll. But now, with Mr. Macron and 50 other heads of state, not to mention Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sean Penn and Bill Gates, watching him closely, it was showtime. Mr. Kim strode onstage and started talking deals. There was a bid to attract $2 billion in private capital to protect coastal shores in West Africa; a $4 billion scheme to back geothermal energy in Indonesia; the establishment of a global investment bank to spur environmentally friendly investments in cities; and a big bet on electric cars in India. All would be blessed by the bank. But their ultimate success would hinge on how much money the private sector would kick in. Mr. Kim concluded by announcing that the bank would no longer back oil and gas drilling projects. A roar of applause filled the auditorium. Mr. Kim grinned. For the moment, at least, the World Bank was relevant again. "

282,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump will address world leaders and business elites in Davos, Switzerland, later today, possibly making good on his promise to “tell the world how great America is and is doing.” On the sidelines, Mr. Trump has been in diplomatic overdrive. He worked to mend relations with Britain, saying he and Prime Minister Theresa May were “on the same wavelength,” despite reports of strains. And with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at his side, Mr. Trump excoriated the Palestinians, threatening to cut off aid unless they “sit down and negotiate peace.” Elsewhere, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin unleashed market turmoil with an apparently offhand comment, that a weak dollar benefits U.S. trade. Here’s our full coverage of the World Economic Forum. _____ • “You are the bravest person I’ve ever had in my courtroom.” That’s how a judge described Rachael Denhollander, above, the first former gymnast to go public about abuse by Larry Nassar, the former doctor for the U.S. gymnastics team. He was sentenced Wednesday, and victims have formed a bond as they gathered the strength to face him in court. And questions about how the abuse could have gone on for years forced the resignation of the president of Michigan State University, where Dr. Nassar was on the faculty until 2016. _____ • “She has developed an arrogance of power.” That was Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, describing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar, a day after he quit an advisory panel on the Rohingya crisis. He also said Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi “exploded” when he raised the detention of two Reuters journalists who were investigating a Rohingya mass grave. ____ • Today is Australia Day, and it’s complicated. Some mark it with barbecues and fireworks. But many others, including Aboriginal groups, see the date — which marks the arrival of British ships in 1788 — as a celebration of colonization. On Thursday, a statue of the British explorer Capt. James Cook was found vandalized in Melbourne with graffiti of an Aboriginal flag, above. Our Australia bureau chief visited Parramatta, an ethnically diverse Sydney suburb, to see what people thought of Australia’s relationship to its past. He reflected on his reporting experience in his weekly newsletter. ____ • Scientists in Shanghai successfully created two cloned monkeys from fetal cells grown in a petri dish.

The last time the clock was so close to midnight was in 1953, during the Cold War. _____ • At the Australian Open today, Hyeon Chung of South Korea, above, will battle Roger Federer — in his first-ever Grand Slam semifinal. No pressure or anything. But as Mr. Chung, 21, told our sports columnist, he doesn’t view it as the highest-stakes match of his career.

The daughter of sharecroppers, who were also of Native American descent, she was inspired by stories of the Wright brothers and World War I pilots. Ms. Coleman’s brother told her of seeing Frenchwomen fly when he served in World War I, so she headed across the Atlantic. She earned her international pilot’s license in seven months. She returned to the U.S. and performed as a stunt pilot, dazzling audiences at air shows — but only those that were open to viewers of her race. “The air is the only place free from prejudice,” she said. On April 30, 1926, Ms. Coleman was airborne when her biplane flipped over during a test flight. She plummeted to her death from the open cockpit. She was 34. “Before she died, however, Miss Coleman became a role model for many young black women and, as a consequence, flying became popular among them,” The Times noted in 1985.

284,"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Steven Mnuchin brought his version of “America First” to Davos with a knock on the value of the dollar. • G.E.’s string of tough breaks continues. • Stevie Cohen wants to get closer to the G.O.P. • Why is SoftBank trying to raise more debt? Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Davos update of the day: Here at Davos, you can sort of tell the relative power of the individual by how casually they’re dressed. While many attendees wear business suits and snow boots, Jamie Dimon yesterday sported a North Face jacket and dad jeans. (Lloyd Blankfein opted for a more business-casual suit-but-no-tie look.) TPG’s David Bonderman had been known to wear a, shall we say, well-worn fleece. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin yesterday at the World Economic Forum: “Obviously, a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities.” Christine Lagarde’s response: “I really hope that Secretary Mnuchin has a chance to clarify exactly what he said.” (Bob Rubin also diplomatically rebuked any effort to weaken the dollar to lift trade.) Today, Mr. Mnuchin said the dollar was “not a concern of mine,” and professed faith in its long-term strength. The bigger picture, courtesy of Ben White in Politico: Said at Davos • Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase told CNBC, “I promise you, we are going to be sitting here in a year and you all will be worrying about inflation and wages going up too high.” • Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs said of President Trump: “I don’t want to be hypocritical, either. I’ve really liked what he’s done for the economy.” • Sundar Pichai of Google said about taxes: “We are happy to pay a higher amount, whatever the world agrees on as the right framework. It’s not an issue about the amount of tax we pay, as much as how you divide it among various countries.” • Jack Ma of Alibaba said on a panel: “I think globalization cannot be stopped. Nobody can stop globalization. Nobody can stop trade. And I believe, if trade stops, war starts.” • Raymond Nolte of SkyBridge Capital said, “If you take away Trump’s Twitter ridiculousness, it’s actually been a pretty good year for the business community.” More from the World Economic Forum • European leaders like Emmanuel Macron (who reportedly persuaded Mr. Trump to come) and Angela Merkel forcefully defended international cooperation and globalization. (NYT) • Liu He, an influential senior adviser to President Xi Jinping, said China would bring its debt under control within three years. (NYT) • All of Mr. Trump’s friends and frenemies at Davos. (Bloomberg) A Davos scheduling bonus Take a guess: Which former high-powered Wall Street executive who, when bumped into at the bottom of the hill leading up to Mr. Deripaska’s chalet and asked in jest if he was headed to the “oligarch party,” declared that his firm “did not hang out with oligarchs” — and then sauntered up the hill to the party? Shares of Viacom and CBS jumped ahead of the close after Reuters reported that the two companies had held an exploratory discussion about merging, citing sources familiar with the matter. The boards of both companies are expected to discuss the potential merger at their regularly scheduled meetings in the next couple of weeks, Reuters reports. The context: Recombining the two companies has been much speculated in recent years as media companies tried to add scale. Shari Redstone, who along with her father, Sumner Redstone, controls the two companies, tried to merge them in 2016. Those efforts faltered over the concerns of CBS’ directors and CBS’s chief executive, Les Moonves. But Walt Disney’s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. It is, of course, Oprah. Here’s what she told InStyle magazine: Completely coincidentally, we’re sure, shares in Weight Watchers International were down 3 percent this morning: From a client memo by David Katz and Laura McIntosh of the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz: Among the best ways to better address the issue at a company: having more women on corporate boards and in senior management positions. — Michael J. de la Merced Shares of the biggest American technology companies have continued to surge in 2018. The S&P 500 technology sector is up 7.6 percent to start 2018. Amazon.com has risen 17 percent, Alphabet is up 12 percent, and Microsoft has climbed 8.4 percent, writes MoneyBeat’s Ben Eisen. Meanwhile, Apple has lagged a bit in 2018, up just 1.8 percent. If the rally persists, then the four biggest companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index could all soon be flirting with the $1 trillion mark. Apple: $884 billion. Alphabet: $814 billion Microsoft: $713 billion Amazon: $656 billion Bad enough that the embattled industrial giant had to announce that GE Capital would suspend dividends to the group, after a $6.2 billion charge tied to its reinsurance operations. Now the S.E.C. is taking a look, and questions are being raised about the conglomerate’s famously opaque accounting. Its shares fell 2.7 percent yesterday. Critics’ corner • Spencer Jakab writes, “Sunlight may be the best disinfectant, but General Electric is learning that it can leave some nasty burns — particularly for those who have spent too much time in the shade.” (Heard on the Street) • Tom Buerkle writes of G.E.’s chief, John Flannery, “Flannery’s time to draw a line under past mistakes is shrinking — and with it the likelihood that he can show that G.E.’s diverse businesses are better together than apart.” (Breakingviews) Point 72 is on the verge of managing outside money and operating as a true hedge fund again. So, it appears, its chief is seeking friends in Washington. Mr. Cohen donated $2 million to the Senate Leadership Fund and $1 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, Fox Business reports.

286,"They can be hard to spot — let alone take at face value — amid the usual spray of insults and bombast, but every now and then President Trump emits a sensible idea. Mr. Trump offered at least the appearance of such an idea when he strode into the White House briefing room late Wednesday and announced that he was open to a multiyear path to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, about 700,000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children and granted protection from deportation by President Barack Obama. His words sent his surprised staff scrambling and heartened Democrats who have been seeking a just solution for these young people. But the price of the offer became clear Thursday afternoon, when White House officials said that citizenship for the Dreamers, and about 1.1 million other young immigrants who could qualify for the status but didn’t apply, would come only as part of a bargain that included an additional $25 billion for border security and a crackdown on legal immigrants, including family members of those already in the United States. Mr. Trump, who canceled the Dreamers’ protection in September, has professed his “love” for them, but the real policy is being made by hard-liners in the White House. In the heat of the struggle over the fate of the Dreamers, what has often been obscured is how the heartless anti-immigration crowd has ominously pushed the broader debate to attack immigration as a whole. Among hard-core Republican foes of immigration, aided and abetted in the White House by President Trump’s fiercely anti-immigration senior adviser for policy, Stephen Miller, the goal is not only a crackdown on undocumented immigrants within the United States or a Great Wall along the Mexican border, but also a sharply reduced number and a more restrictive profile of immigrants in general. Though American immigration policy has been marked for much of the nation’s history by racism and injustice, a fundamental narrative has formed of the United States as a land shaped by waves of creative, hard-working immigrants, and as the great haven for “tempest tossed” refugees from less fortunate lands. The last two efforts to reform America’s tangled immigration policies, with bills in 2007 and 2013, were still based on a faith across party lines that foreigners coming to these shores — at least those coming legally — were good for America. The bills foundered over how to deal with undocumented immigrants, but various programs intended to bring in talented and diverse immigrants and to let legal immigrants bring in family members continued largely unchallenged. Until Donald Trump. While his public statements on immigration have been all over the place, his fundamental hostility to immigrants is obvious, from slogans such as “Buy American, Hire American” to his infamous racist and profane slur against poor third world nations. In August, he gleefully endorsed a bill sponsored by two anti-immigration Republican senators, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, that would reduce legal immigration by about a half, in large part by terminating the diversity lottery and curtailing family-based immigration, derisively called “chain migration” in their camp. (As for poor, huddled masses, Mr. Miller dismissively noted at a White House briefing that Emma Lazarus’s celebrated sonnet was appended to the Statue of Liberty only later.) There is no question that the millions of people who have crossed into the United States illegally, largely in the 1990s, represent a problem that demands a comprehensive solution. The anti-immigration backlash that Mr. Trump tapped is not always racist or xenophobic; to many Americans, mass illegal immigration represents a failure of government in one of its basic duties. It is equally clear that a solution must be a balance between offering many of the undocumented immigrants and their families — and the Dreamers — a way to legalize their presence, and increasing border security. None of that changes the fact that immigrants, legal and illegal, supply, and have always supplied, America with the talents, skills, diversity and dreams that have made it what it is. The fact that Silicon Valley has so many foreign-born workers is not evidence of native-born Americans having been crowded out of work, but of America’s ability to tap talent from around the world. And with America’s birthrate sagging and baby boomers retiring, immigrant labor will be critical to sustain economic growth. Base nativism must not be allowed to undermine the American dream, or its future. "
287,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Last weekend, as the federal government was shutting down amid partisan squabbles over immigration, President Trump’s re-election campaign released an ad featuring an undocumented immigrant from Mexico accused of murdering two Sacramento police officers. Democrats, the ad stated, are “complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.” On the same day, a group of California Republicans put out their own ad about immigration. It featured the sunny disposition of Ronald Reagan, and words he spoke form the Oval Office in 1989, as he prepared to leave office. In the address, President Reagan defined what he meant when described, as he often did, America as a “shining city.” It is a country, he said, “teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.” The contrasting tone of the two ads — one dark and ominous, the other bright and optimistic — say a lot about the divergence between the national Republican Party and the party in California. In California, the party is fighting for relevance in a state whose diversity — Latinos are a plurality in the state — and progressive values have placed it at the forefront of opposition to the Trump administration. “In California we have a problem,” said Chad Mayes, a former Republican leader in the California State Assembly, who was pushed out of his leadership position last year after a backlash within his party because he negotiated with Democrats on climate change. Mr. Mayes, from Yucca Valley, grew up the poor son of a preacher and has taken moderate positions on a number of issues, including immigration, climate change and poverty. In an effort to rebrand his own party, Mr. Mayes recently founded New Way California, which put out the Reagan ad and has drawn the support of the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. When he was his party’s leader in the State Assembly, polling he conducted showed that many Californians, “didn’t think we cared about people,” he said. “They thought we were caustic and abrasive,” he added, and only looked out for, “rich white people.” "

289,"DAVOS, Switzerland — In the year and a half since Britain’s shocking decision to sever itself from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May has labored to portray her country’s future as one of glorious progress. She has described a bold new era in which Britain would look beyond the confines of Europe, striking trade deals and reclaiming its place as a global power. All the while, an uncomfortable reality has been sinking in. Britain’s stature on the world stage has diminished, and its economy has sagged. The former colonial empire has been reduced to a lesser actor, a reality that hit home on Thursday as Mrs. May delivered a sparsely attended speech before the World Economic Forum. Mrs. May devoted part of her speech to declaring Britain’s steadfast commitment to global trade and international engagement. But one of her primary examples of that commitment — highlighting Britain’s role in a European bloc it is actively leaving — underscored the strange moment she inhabits. “The U.K. has been at the forefront of championing new trade deals including the E.U.’s deals with Canada and Japan,” Ms. May said. “And as we leave the European Union, the U.K. will continue to be a global advocate of free trade.” The day before, President Emmanuel Macron of France had received rock star-style treatment from a packed crowd that waited nearly an hour for a chance just to get into the room where he was to speak. People who arrived a moment before Mrs. May’s speech found empty seats within a few rows of the stage. Much of Britain’s receding status comes from its decision to abandon Europe — Brexit, in the parlance — and to remove itself from a realm of some 500 million people that sprawls from Ireland to Greece. Given that nearly half of Britain’s exports land within the European Union, any rupture to this trade could cost the country substantial treasure. Around the world, every major economy is now growing in a synchronized wave of expansion that has finally put the finish on a wrenching global downturn that began a decade ago. “It is the best moment in the global economy since the ’50s,” said Kenneth Rogoff, an international economist at Harvard University. Britain stands out as one of the weaker performers. Its economy probably expanded by just 1.7 percent last year and is expected to grow by only 1.5 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. By contrast, the I.M.F. estimates that the United States economy will grow by 2.7 percent this year, and the 19 nations that share the euro currency will collectively expand by 2.2 percent. Britain’s weak performance is due in large part to market sentiments about Brexit. The vote sent the British pound plunging against both the dollar and the euro. Although the pound has recovered much ground since then, Britain has been choking on the effects of the shift: A net importer of goods, Britain is paying higher prices for products it brings in from Europe, China and elsewhere, contributing to inflation that is running at a 3 percent annual pace. And the country’s pending divorce from Europe has marginalized its role within the bloc just as European leaders are channeling the Continent’s newfound economic strength into furthering their integration. “Who sees the U.K. as an important discussion partner?” asked Hans-Paul Bürkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group, based in Frankfurt. In recent months, Mrs. May has pursued a split with Europe that changes as little as possible, while simultaneously trying to evade the wrath of anti-European members of Parliament in her governing Conservative Party. Mrs. May’s government hopes to negotiate a transitional arrangement with Europe that allows Britain to remain within the single European marketplace and customs union to ensure that trade continues unabated. The price of such arrangement will almost certainly be Britain’s continuing to make substantial contributions to the European budget while still living by European rules, including the free movement of people — the very item that provoked the electoral backlash that delivered the Brexit vote. President Trump’s administration has sought to bolster Britain’s place in the world while offering its support for Brexit. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, sought to reassure Britain that its so-called special relationship with the United States was intact. “I do think we’ve had a very special economic relationship, and we expect that to continue,” Mr. Mnuchin said, hours before Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet privately with Mrs. May. The president remained intent in striking a bilateral trade deal, Mr. Mnuchin added. “As soon as the U.K. is ready, we’d be prepared to negotiate a very attractive trade deal,” he said. But so long as Britain remains within the European customs union, it cannot negotiate trade deals with other countries. Such negotiations are the sole preserve of European bureaucrats in Brussels. And trade between the United States and Britain is already so free of tariffs that a deal would probably be of far more symbolic importance than a spur to increased commerce. In her speech, Mrs. May steered clear of any discussion of the particulars of Brexit, instead devoting most of her time to calling for a new social compact that would bring social media platforms to heel for enabling trafficking in hate speech and facilitating communication among terrorists. Above all, she cast Britain as a country that is not in retreat. “The United Kingdom has a proud history of stepping up and seizing the opportunities of our time,” she said. “We stand ready to do so again.” By that point, several people attending the speech were standing and walking toward the exits. "
290,"The #MeToo movement has inspired a “tsunami” of stories, from newspaper front pages to social media to private conversations between friends and relatives. It is, many believe, a watershed cultural moment. Has it touched your community or school? How have you and your students responded? As The Times’s new gender editor, Jessica Bennett, writes: In this unit, we pull together a wealth of Times reporting, opinion and video to suggest several ways to begin confronting the questions and issues the movement raises. We asked Christopher Pepper, a health educator in the San Francisco Unified School District who helped design the district’s high school sex education curriculum, to co-write this piece with Learning Network staff. Before beginning, we suggest reading our advice on talking about sensitive issues in the news. Though we realize there is already enough here for at least a week’s-worth of work, we’d love to add your ideas as well. How are you talking about these issues in your school or classroom? Please let us know in the comments. ___________ Begin the lesson by having students write about what they already know, or think they know, about sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement. You can have the class submit their thoughts anonymously by putting folded pieces of paper into a basket, or you can have them write publicly by using a graffiti board. Or, you can invite them to share first in partners or small groups. To prompt their thinking, you might start by asking: • What have you heard or learned about sexual harassment? • What do you know about the #MeToo movement? • How do you feel about the movement? You can represent your feelings with a word or an image. • What questions do you have about this movement and the many issues it has raised over the past several months? • Why might this be a difficult topic to discuss in class? After students have had time to reflect, discuss all but the last question as a class. If students wrote anonymously, you might read aloud from some of the submissions to get the discussion started. As the class talks, highlight patterns in their feelings and observations and write down student questions on a poster paper so you can continue to address them over the course of the unit. Finally, take on the last question: Why might this be a difficult topic to discuss in class? What barriers might there be to learning about this topic and discussing it as a group? Are there ground rules that should be developed? If so, what should they be? Over all, do they think this is an important topic to take on in school? Why or why not? _________ For students to understand the significance of the #MeToo movement, they must understand the events that led to this cultural reckoning. Start by watching the Retro Report video “Why Hasn’t Sexual Harassment Disappeared?,” which traces the evolution of sexual harassment in the workplace from the defining of the term in the mid-1970s, to Anita Hill’s testimony in 1991, to the current deluge of allegations against powerful men in entertainment, media, politics and other industries. Agree on Definitions As they watch, ask students to come up with a working definition of “sexual harassment” using a Frayer model or some other vocabulary tool. The definition of this term is part of the conversation that the #MeToo movement, and those before it, has sparked, so students can continue to add to and revise their definitions as they learn throughout the unit. The Times defines sexual harassment in the workplace this way: Note to teachers: Discussing sexual harassment often involves legal and technical language. The Times uses the terms “sexual harassment” and “sexual misconduct” to refer to a range of behaviors that are sexual in nature and nonconsensual. The term “sexual assault” usually signifies a felony sexual offense, like rape. For more information, see the legal definition of sexual harassment from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, these examples of sexual harassment from the United Nations and this definition of consent from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. You might have students read these documents and add examples and non-examples of sexual harassment to their Frayer model. Depending on the reading level of your students, you may also want to prepare a vocabulary sheet to help them understand other words they may not know related to this topic. You might also ask them why it is so important to understand how all these terms are defined. Annotate a Timeline As students watch, read and research during this unit, they might take notes by creating an annotated timeline, plotting the events that have led up to the #MeToo moment and briefly explaining what makes them significant in the current context. After they have watched the Retro Report video, invite them to read “The ‘Click’ Moment: How the Weinstein Scandal Unleashed a Tsunami” and add the information in it to their timelines. The article begins: Review the sexual harassment timelines that students have created and, if you would like to go deeper, compare them to this interactive sexual harassment timeline from KQED. Have a Class Discussion In response to the video and article discuss as a class: • What has catalyzed the #MeToo moment? Why is this suddenly in the news? • What progress has been made since people first started talking about sexual harassment in the workplace in the 1970s? In your opinion, what still needs to be done and why? • What effects have sexual harassment and misconduct in general had on society? What examples can you give? • Do men and boys have a different role to play than women and girls in fighting sexual harassment? If so, how? If not, why not? • In your opinion, is this a watershed moment or turning point in the conversation around sexual misconduct in the workplace and beyond? Why or why not? To end this part of the unit, you might invite your students to weigh in with their answers on our Student Opinion question: “What Is Your Reaction to the #MeToo Movement?” (Our student questions are open for response indefinitely.) __________ Since the allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein broke late in 2017, the conversation about sexual harassment has evolved, becoming more complex and nuanced. In an article for The Cut, Rebecca Traister writes about the impact of widespread sexual harassment not only on individual people, but also on our society as a whole: And in “The #MeToo Moment: What’s Next?” Jessica Bennett writes for The Times: In this section, students explore how the pervasiveness of sexual harassment affects all of us on personal, professional and societal levels. They also begin to address some of the many questions the #MeToo conversation has sparked on the nature of sexual misconduct: Why does it happen? Why has it persisted? Why do victims often not speak up against their abusers? Is it about sex, power, both or something else? Jigsaw Assign, or allow students to choose, one of the following articles to read in small “expert” groups for a jigsaw activity. Remind them that each of these articles provides just one opinion, with which they may agree or disagree. You might provide them with some guiding questions and ask them to annotate as they read: • What is the author’s overall argument about the root causes of sexual harassment? • What points resonate with you? Which challenge your beliefs? Why? • What evidence does the author provide to support his or her argument? Is it credible and substantial? “How Wall Street Bro Talk Keeps Women Down” critiques men’s participation in the objectification of women: “Sexual Harassment: It’s About Power, Not Lust” was written in 1991, but its premise remains relevant: “The Unexamined Brutality of the Male Libido” offers a contentious counterpoint to that power argument: “When Saying ‘Yes’ Is Easier Than Saying ‘No’” examines the tricky subject of consent in intimate relationships: “She Didn’t Fight Back: 5 (Misguided) Reasons People Doubt Sexual Assault Survivors” challenges myths about sexual assault: “Men and Women Say They’re More Different Than Similar” explores the traditional notions of gender that underlie a culture of sexual harassment: Then, create “teaching” groups with one or two students from each “expert” group. Allow each student to present his or her article and ask the other students to take notes on the different perspectives in a graphic organizer such as this one. Class Discussion After all students have presented their points, invite them to discuss in their small groups or as a whole class the factors that contribute to a culture of sexual harassment. Encourage them to respectfully agree or disagree by citing evidence from the articles or their own experiences. Some conversation starters might include: • Why does sexual harassment happen? • If this has been happening all along, why are we just hearing about it now? • Why is the problem of sexual misconduct so widespread? • What is the role of gender in sexual harassment? • What can we do as a society? What can we do as individuals? • Based on your reading, do you think discussing and learning about sexual harassment is important? Why or why not? Two Ways to Close This Section of the Unit: A Barometer Activity or a Gallery Walk Barometer In a barometer activity, students listen to a statement and then stand up and move to a point between “Strongly Agree” and “Strongly Disagree” that reflects their opinion. Begin by stating the prompt, then allow students to find their place on the continuum. After all students have moved, ask a few to explain why they chose that position. If they feel so moved by the discussion, let them change their place on the barometer and explain why they did so. You may also want students to prepare their answers in writing before engaging in the discussion. Some possible prompts include: • Stereotypes about men and women are harmful. • It’s hard to tell the difference between sexual harassment and flirting. • Sexual harassment is natural. • If we wanted to end sexual harassment, it would be easy to do. • Sexual harassment is mostly a women’s issue. • Sexual harassment is a problem at our school. Gallery Walk Or, invite students to share the implications of what they learned with the rest of the class in a gallery walk. On a piece of poster paper, have each student create a “one-pager” about the article they read. In this format, students create a visual of some kind that captures a key aspect of the article, literally or symbolically, but they also include a quotation from the article that seems important, and pose a question for the journalist or for someone mentioned in the article. Here is an activity sheet that can guide them. After students have completed their work, post it on the walls or leave it at individual desks and invite the class to move around silently and respond to what they see on sticky notes with questions, comments or connections. Finally, as a class, discuss the larger patterns among the different articles. How does sexual harassment affect individuals? How does it affect society? What might our world look like without it? __________ The #MeToo movement has tried to hold sexual abusers accountable for their actions in the workplace and in broader society. As with any movement toward widespread social change, though, a backlash has been brewing, with some saying the movement has gone too far. In “Publicly, We Say #MeToo. Privately, We Have Misgivings.,” Daphne Merkin writes: Where do your students stand within the debate? What do they really think about the conversations being had and the ways men are being held accountable for sexual misconduct? Do they think #MeToo has gone too far — or not far enough? Engage students in a structured discussion, such as a debate, a Fishbowl or a Four Corners activity, where they can voice their opinions honestly and listen to other perspectives respectfully. We recommend the articles below for a wide variety of perspectives. You might choose to have half the class read one side of the issue and the other half read the other side. Or, have every student read at least one article from each point of view to get a well-rounded understanding of the debate. Articles generally in support of the #MeToo movement Yes, This Is a Witch Hunt. I’m a Witch and I’m Hunting You. Amber Tamblyn: I’m Not Ready for the Redemption of Men Response to French Letter Denouncing #MeToo Shows a Sharp Divide How the Myth of the Artistic Genius Excuses the Abuse of Women When Sexual Assault Victims Are Charged With Lying Articles that question the movement: Publicly, We Say #MeToo. Privately, We Have Misgivings. When #MeToo Goes Too Far Catherine Deneuve and Others Denounce the #MeToo Movement I’m Not Convinced Franken Should Quit The Limits of ‘Believe All Women’ To facilitate the discussion, you might ask: • Has the #MeToo movement gone too far? If so, what is the limit? If not, why not and is there a limit? • What should happen to people who are accused or guilty of sexual harassment and assault? • Should we always “believe all women”? What are the benefits and drawbacks of doing so? • Do these conversations around sexual harassment and assault make relations between men and women better or worse? Why do you think so? __________ Note to teachers: Any discussion of sexual harassment in our society will quickly involve students’ own experiences, in and out of school. Below are several ideas for how students might consider some of the questions raised by the activities above in terms of how they affect their own communities. This is obviously a sensitive thing to take on in a classroom, and we welcome your ideas. How have you addressed these issues with your students? Please post thoughts to our comments section. 1. Research School Practices and Policies A recent survey by The Upshot reports: Do your students think peer-to-peer sexual harassment is a problem at your school? How do they know? Invite them to investigate the policies and protocols already in place school-wide, and perhaps even district- or statewide. Students might interview teachers, administrators and fellow students to learn the following: • How comprehensive, thoughtful and practical are the policies we have now? • How well do they seem to work? • How might they be improved? Based on their analysis, what recommendations might your students make about these policies? How can they communicate these recommendations? For example, might they write a piece for the school newspaper? Send a letter to administrators? Create an annotated reading list for their peers? Sponsor an awareness-raising campaign or “teach-in” around the issue for the school as a whole? 2. Revise Your Sex Ed Curriculum How much does your school’s sex education curriculum address sexual harassment? Consent? Gender roles? Healthy relationships? In California, lessons about sexual consent are now required: Ask your students to do an audit of their sex education curriculum, either by sharing experiences they have had in class or by analyzing learning materials like worksheets and textbooks. What do they learn about sexual harassment, consent and gender? What messages do boys get about these topics? What messages do girls get? In their opinions, is what they learn about sex helpful in combating the social norms that have allowed sexual misconduct to continue? Or does it perpetuate them? Invite students to do further research into how to address these issues with young people. In addition to the above resources on sexual harassment, they might also read some of these articles for a deeper look at sex education and consent: Sex Ed Lesson: ‘Yes Means Yes,’ but It’s Tricky Teaching Good Sex Campus Sex … With a Syllabus Making Consent Cool: Students Advocate for Consensual Sex Affirmative Consent: Are Students Really Asking? Talking to Children About Consent Talking With Both Daughters and Sons About Sex After they complete the reading, assign them to groups and ask them to outline the sex education curriculum they would like schools to teach. Encourage them to consider gaps in learning about gender, consent and sexual harassment. How can their curriculum help students understand the many factors that contribute to sexual misconduct? How can it disrupt harmful stereotypes about boys and girls? How might the curriculum be balanced to encourage all students to share their voices? Students might even create a sample lesson plan for one of these issues and teach it to the class. To increase the academic rigor of the exercise, have students compare what’s taught in their school to the National Sexuality Education Standards. 3. Examine the Role of Technology and Social Media in Sexual Harassment Should sexting be a crime? Invite your students to watch and respond to this video by our colleagues at KQED’s Above the Noise. Then, have them read “Teenagers, Stop Asking for Nude Photos.” In the article, Lisa Damour writes: We posed our own Student Opinion question about this article, asking What Advice Should Parents and Counselors Give Teenagers About Sexting? One student wrote: Have your students participate in the conversation by reading other students’ responses and then writing to us with their own ideas about the advice teenagers should get about sexting — and the kinds of support they need when dealing with this issue. 4. Consider What One Individual Can Do What actions — big or small — can your students commit to as individuals to help create a safe and inclusive society for all people and prevent the continuation of a culture of sexual assault and harassment in their generation? You might invite your students to write down ideas — as many as they each can come up with — on sticky notes, and post those notes all over a wall of your classroom. Then, as students walk around and read what others wrote, they can think about which of the suggested actions they would be willing to take. They might then keep a private journal of their actions and thoughts around this issue, and report back to class in future days about the results. If they need help coming up with ideas, you might have students read one or more of these articles and identify the strategies that the authors suggest men and women can use to stop sexual harassment: This Is a Man Problem How to Help Kids Disrupt ‘Bro Culture’ The #MeToo Moment: How to Be a (Good) Bystander Steinem, Sandberg and Judd on How to End Sex Harassment __________ At the end of a unit on this topic, students can deepen their reflections and voice their opinions through creative responses like the following. They might work individually on the project of their choice, work together in small groups, or, as a class, choose one of these ideas to do together. 1. Make Art Inspired by the Reckoning The Times’s gender editor, Jessica Bennett, writes: The Times asked readers to submit work based on this theme and published it with comments from the artist. Let students view the artwork readers created and then ask them to create their own visual representations of the #MeToo moment. Or, they can design an editorial cartoon in response to an article on sexual harassment, as several students did in our 2017 Editorial Cartoon Contest. 2. Weigh In Like a Late Night Talk Show Host Late night talk show hosts often use their platforms to respond to the news. Many, like Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah and Jimmy Fallon have been weighing in on the #MeToo movement with passion and humor. Let students watch one or more of the excerpts from the shows above, using it as a mentor text for their own late night talk show. Which topics from the conversation around sexual harassment get your students most animated? Have them choose an article from The Times Topics Sexual Harassment page or another source and prepare a monologue in response to it. Just as late night hosts do, they should use specific evidence from the article, other resources and their own experiences to defend their position. They should also consider how they can effectively use humor, emotion, empathy and logic to communicate their message. Note to teacher: Some of the linked videos do use expletives. 3. Remix Beauty Standards At the Golden Globes this year, women and men wore black in solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct and effectively redefined the purpose of the red carpet. The Times followed suit, as Bonnie Wertheim writes: The Times has also written about the ways that clothing and beauty companies are responding to the #MeToo moment by changing the way they represent women in their industry. Have students look at some of the examples above. Then ask them to do their own research in magazines, on social media or on other online platforms and collect images of women and men. Ask them to consider the following questions: • How are women generally portrayed? • How are men generally portrayed? • How might these portrayals contribute to a culture of sexual harassment and assault? Then, as The Times did on the red carpet this year, invite students to choose one of the images they found and “remix” it in a way that challenges “the widely held perception that women’s bodies are available for public consumption.” 4. Record Oral Histories of #MeToo Experiences by Earlier Generations The Times asked readers to share the conversations they have had with their families about unwanted sexual encounters. The Times received more that 140 responses, mostly from women, and interviewed members from seven of those families. Have students listen to one or more of these interviews. What do they notice about how different generations think about sexual harassment? Jessica Bennet parses the results in this piece, interviewing Times staffers of different generations and focusing in part on reactions to recent allegations against Aziz Ansari that raise the question, Is it possible for something to be nonconsensual but also not sexual assault? After students have listened to or read some of these pieces, invite them to prepare their own questions and interview someone of a different generation to understand their experiences on or thoughts about the #MeToo movement. They can record the interview on audio or video if they like. Students can and should consider the topics about which they are personally curious, but they might use these questions as starting points: • Did you learn about sexual harassment when you were my age? If so, what advice did you get? If not, do you wish you had? • Have you ever had an experience with an unwanted sexual encounter that you want to share with me? What was that like for you? • What advice do you have for me when it comes to sexual harassment and assault? • Do you think progress has been made in addressing gender inequality and abuses of power since you were young? • What do you think about the #MeToo movement? Is it necessary? Has it gone too far? If students are comfortable, they can share what they learned from their interviews with the class. Discuss the commonalities and differences across generations. If they find differences, why do they think those generational differences exist? Do they think that progress has been made in the conversation around sexual harassment and assault? What do people in older generations have to teach your students on this issue? What does your students’ generation have to teach older generations? 5. Create an Anti-Harassment Campaign Aimed at Your Peers Since the Harvey Weinstein story broke, people across industries have been looking for ways to fight the problem in their own worlds. Earlier in this lesson we invited students to think about what their schools could do, but this activity goes further by asking them to actually create a campaign that will help educate their peers. They might first study some examples of campaigns, such as the Time’s Up anti-sexual harassment action plan: Students can view Time’s Up’s open letter and website as mentor texts. What are the plan’s purpose and goals? What steps does it outline for achieving those goals? As students begin to brainstorm about what kind of campaign they want to create and what issues they will address, they might borrow ideas from these Times articles: Sexual Harassment Training Doesn’t Work. But Some Things Do. It’s Not Just Fox: Why Women Don’t Report Sexual Harassment How to Stop the Predators Who Aren’t Famous Men at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too Stepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault _________ As your students finish their final projects, encourage them to return to some key questions we posed at the beginning of this unit: • How does sexual harassment affect individuals and society? • How do social and cultural norms contribute to sexual harassment? • What can individuals do to put an end to sexual misconduct? • Why is this such a difficult topic to address in class and in wider society? • Do you think discussing and learning about sexual harassment is important? Why or why not? Have their answers changed? Become more nuanced or informed? How? What advice might they have for future teachers and students of a class like this one? __________ Additional Times Resources Though our unit focuses on how this movement has played out in the United States, it is also surfacing in countries around the globe, from Indonesia and Afghanistan to Italy, Sweden, China and France.

291,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Europe is back. That was the message of some of the Continent’s leaders in speeches at the World Economic Forum that resonated as a rebuttal of President Trump’s unilateralism. (Above, our cartoonist’s take on the gathering in Davos, Switzerland.) While some at the forum might recoil at Mr. Trump’s speech on Friday, many members of the gathered elite appreciate the additional wealth he has delivered to their coffers. Meanwhile, trade deals that do not include the U.S. are moving ahead. Among today’s speakers are the leaders of Britain and Israel, and Cyril Ramaphosa, who is widely expected to become South Africa’s next president. _____ • Before he left for Europe, Mr. Trump ended months of speculation by saying that he was willing to speak under oath with Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. "
292,"PARIS — The evening before President Trump arrived in Davos, Switzerland, to hobnob with the global elite and throw down the gauntlet of America First — and maybe nail down a date with President Emmanuel Macron of France for his first state dinner — Pierpaolo Piccioli, creative director of Valentino, stood atop an ornate iron staircase in the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild here and brought the couture shows to a close with a meditation on the subject of dreams. It’s a popular word when it comes to couture, which pretty much everyone involved likes to refer to as “the dream” (in part to justify that it is out of reach for 99.9 percent of consumers). But, like so many other words (Sad! Huge!) and language elements (the exclamation point) in the past year — and especially the past few weeks — it has been Trumpified. It’s almost impossible to hear “dream” and not think “Dreamers” instead. That has a way of taking your mind in a different direction. So perhaps it was fitting that Mr. Piccioli framed his collection not as escapism but rather as an opportunity to put the old idea to rest and move on. “The essence of the dream of couture is its past,” he said, standing next to a bulletin board tacked with pictures of Audrey Hepburn and Charles James gowns. “But I was not the kind of kid who had a grandma who wore couture. So I wanted to take elements of classic couture — volume, ruffles, bows — but do them in the lightest way I could imagine, because it is only when you confront your past that you can face your future.” "
293,"The comments President Trump reportedly made recently, asking why the United States should accept immigrants from “shithole countries,” shed an uncomfortable spotlight on Haiti, El Salvador and the entire African continent. Several political figures and others from these nations responded swiftly — with a mixture of anger and mocking humor — to counter the sentiment, both in public statements and on social media.  The tourism industry jumped on the comments as well. The lodging company Gondwana Collection Namibia released a satirical Namibian tourism video featuring the voice of a Mr. Trump impersonator.  And Airbnb is reportedly spending at least $100,000 on a digital ad campaign to promote travel to these countries — a message echoed in a tweet from its chief executive. While Mr. Trump’s strong language (he denied using the word “shithole”) has been widely condemned as ignorant and racist, it’s clear by other reactions that many see these countries as undesirable destinations. “This is about poverty and crime,” tweeted Paul Joseph Watson, a far-right YouTube personality and an editor at large at InfoWars.com. “It has nothing to do with race.” The tweet was liked over 5,000 times, and many users commented in agreement. Opinions, though, differ significantly from those who are familiar with the countries. “Of all the amazing places I lived in during my 18 years as a diplomat — including highlights like Paris and New York — Haiti is the place that sticks in my mind the most, because of its beauty and the character of its people,” said Peter Kujawinski, a writer who, as an American diplomat, lived in Haiti for a total of four years since 2000. Avid readers of travel journalism may have also noticed many of these same countries on a number of prominent 2018 “best of” destination lists. Our own 52 Places to Go in 2018 featured several African destinations, including Kigali, Rwanda; Liuwa Plain National Park, Zambia; Tangier, Morocco; and São Tomé and Príncipe. Elsewhere, Harar and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia were recommended by National Geographic and Condé Nast Traveler, respectively, and Forbes flagged destinations in Haiti, Tanzania and Senegal as “Best Budget Travel Destinations for 2018.” And Tanzania’s Ruaha National Park was chosen by National Geographic as one of its “Places You Need to Visit in 2018.” ""Traveling is so much more to me than sightseeing. It also means sharing, learning and feeling,” said Ana Sánchez, who writes about solo female travel at anianywhere.com. Ms. Sánchez, who has spent significant time in Senegal, Turkey and Iran, added, “it was in these countries where I felt most alive.” In this spirit, here’s a small window into a few of the countries that Mr. Trump has brought new attention to — including travel recommendations from those who have spent time there. “I traveled alone to 15 countries in Africa from June to August of 2017 and it has been one of my most rewarding travel experiences to date,” said Kach Howe, who runs the Two Monkeys Travel blog with her husband, Jonathan. “Tanzania is a very modern African country, but retains its unspoiled wilderness.” Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa, is on the bucket list of many adventure travelers. For the height-averse, consider a spice tour or one of the many pristine beaches in and around Zanzibar, an archipelago off the coast. “Unlike most people’s perceptions of Africa, I was able to travel securely, comfortably and very affordably, even in the less populated village of Nungwi (Zanzibar), where I learned to cook real local cuisine,” Mrs. Howe said. “Kenya has a lot of choice and its accessibility and infrastructure for tourism means you can easily combine all manner of activities,” Becki Enright, who writes at bordersofadventure.com, said. “This makes it a great country for a first-time visit to the Africa continent.” Safaris in Kenya get a lot of attention, and rightfully so (the word itself has roots in East Africa, meaning “journey” or “expedition” in Swahili). But its proximity to the Indian Ocean also makes water-related activities like windsurfing, sailing and snorkeling popular. Additionally, there’s the world’s largest permanent desert lake in the Kenyan Rift Valley; Lake Turkana; and Mount Kenya, Africa’s second tallest mountain after Kilimanjaro. Those hoping to glimpse some of Africa’s “Big Five” safari animals have many options, including the Masai Mara National Reserve, the Tsavo National Parks and the Borana Conservancy of the Laikipia region, which made our 52 Places to Go in 2017 list. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, according to the World Bank, and the U.S. State Department continues to warn travelers of potential risks. But signs of a tourism rebound are there. In recent years, the number of new hotels — including the $45 million, 175-room Port-au-Prince Marriott Hotel that opened in February 2015 — have increased, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. An investment of $345 million has been made in the tourism industry in recent years, according to the Department. “In my opinion, Haiti is safe for an adventurous tourist, especially if you can speak a little French,” Mr. Kujawinski said. “I think it’s very worthwhile to visit now, because you get a sense of the place before a big tourist wave rolls through.” Like Haiti, El Salvador, which Lonely Planet calls “Central America’s most underrated country,” does have a high poverty rate and the U.S. State Department says travelers should be aware of high crime rates and violence — but that hasn’t kept tourists away. The number of visitors to the country has increased each year since 2010, according to statistics from the World Bank and World Tourism Organization, including over 2 million tourists in 2016. El Salvador Tourism said in December that cruise ship arrivals increased by 100 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. “South Africa is a country that is, quite often, devastatingly misunderstood, and once you visit your mind is opened to the complexities, as well as its natural beauty,” Ms. Enright of bordersofadventure.com said. Cape Town, which was No. 1 on our 52 Places to Go in 2014 list, has long been known by tourists for its stunning beaches, Table Mountain (South Africa’s most-photographed landmark, according to Sony) and its closeness to the Stellenbosch wine region. It is currently dealing with a severe drought and has put in place water consumption limits, so those visiting soon should find out in advance what this means and how they can help. “Tourists traveling to a destination, in terms of being a responsible traveler, should always be aware of context of a destination to which they’re traveling, whether it’s cultural sensitivity or religious sensitivity. This is water sensitivity,” Lisa Scriven, the director of Levelle Perspectives, which works to implement sustainable tourism practices, told The Times in December. There is no shortage of other must-see attractions across the country, including the massive Kruger National Park in the northern provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, the scenic Drakensberg Mountain Range, Durban’s Golden Mile beachfront and Johannesburg’s numerous cultural offerings. Mr. Trump was roundly mocked after referring to Namibia as “Nambia” (or did he mean Zambia or Gambia?) in a speech last September. Once you get the name straight, consider Namibia for a family-friendly African adventure or for a great solo trip. “Namibia is one of the safest countries in Africa for travelers, and one of the easiest to explore independently,” said Megan Jerrard, a travel blogger at mappingmegan.com. “It’s ‘Africa for beginners,’ and has everything you could possibly want out of an African experience — a wealth of iconic wildlife, natural beauty, remote wilderness and one of Africa’s last remaining nomadic tribes.” “Zambia is one of the lesser-visited gems of Africa, but that means the experience is an authentic one. You can experience the remote African wilderness free of the mass tourism of more popular destinations like Kenya and Tanzania,” Ms. Jerrard said. One remote safari destination to consider is Liuwa Plain National Park, No. 14 on our 52 Places to Go in 2018 list. “Zebras, spotted hyenas and wildebeest are among the resurging wildlife in this 900,000-acre national park in Western Zambia, where the nonprofit organization African Parks has spurred conservation efforts since 2003,” Sarah Amandolare wrote.

295,"Among Amazon’s 20 finalist cities for its coveted second headquarters are several that would have to be called long shots: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville and Miami, to name three. And then there’s Indianapolis. In the frenzy of coverage and speculation that accompanied Amazon’s initial announcement of a North America-wide competition for the new headquarters, I couldn’t find anyone who cited Indianapolis as a likely finalist. This week the Irish betting site Paddy Power had Indianapolis tied for last among the finalists, with the odds of being chosen at 20 to 1. (Boston and Atlanta have been vying for the best odds, with Boston on top this week at 2 to 1.) The commercial real estate firm CBRE ranked Indianapolis only 33rd among 50 American cities for what CBRE calls “tech talent.” Amazon has cited access to highly trained and educated technology workers as one of its top priorities. And then there’s what might be called the “cool” factor — which Indianapolis, at first glance, would seem to be lacking. Bob Stutz, chief executive of Salesforce.com’s Marketing Cloud, which is based in Indianapolis, came to the fast-growing company from Microsoft, and lived in Amazon’s hometown, Seattle. When Salesforce asked him to move to Indianapolis, his first thought was, “You’ve got to be kidding.” But if Mr. Stutz’s experience is any indication, the oddsmakers may have to recalculate Indianapolis’s chances. Since moving to the city 16 months ago, Mr. Stutz said, he has been “amazed.” “Indianapolis has done what may be the best urban redevelopment I’ve seen in this country,” he said. “Everyone here is aligned with making Indianapolis a successful place for technology companies. The people are tremendous, very friendly, polite, with a strong work ethic.” With over 1,700 Salesforce employees there, Indianapolis is now home to the company’s second-largest office outside its San Francisco headquarters. In May the company moved into the Salesforce tower in downtown Indianapolis, the tallest building in Indiana, representing a commitment from the company that “we’re here to stay,” Mr. Stutz said. Salesforce is eager to move more employees to Indianapolis because of its much lower costs and a good quality of life. “This is one of the few places where you can buy a beautiful home in the city for under $200,000,” he said. One area where Indianapolis stands out also happens to be one of Amazon’s top priorities, according to its proposal: “A stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure.” Indianapolis may be the most business-friendly city in the country, Mr. Stutz said. Both Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, a Republican, and the city’s mayor, Joe Hogsett, a Democrat, showed up for the opening of the Salesforce tower, and when it comes to promoting business, partisan gridlock is all but unknown in the state. Both officials “were very vocal and hands-on and totally bought into this,” said Michael Huber, chief executive of the Indy Chamber of Commerce, which worked closely with regional and state elected officials, and private sector leaders, to assemble Indianapolis’s Amazon proposal. “That made it so much easier for us.” Neither the city nor the state has said what, if any, tax or other incentives it is offering Amazon. In opening the competition, Amazon also said that “a strong university system is required.” Indianapolis hardly comes to mind as an academic mecca. But it’s the geographic center of “a surprising number of highly rated schools that are a 45-minute to one-hour drive away,” said Mark McCoy, the president of DePauw University, a liberal arts college and music school in Greencastle (a 35-minute drive from the Indianapolis airport, and also my alma mater). These include Big Ten members Indiana University and Purdue University, as well as Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, ranked the nation’s No. 1 undergraduate engineering program by U.S. News & World Report for 19 consecutive years. Many university faculty members live in or around Indianapolis, “attracted to a metropolitan area with great cultural opportunities,” Dr. McCoy said. “Over 5,000 of our DePauw graduates live in Indianapolis. After they graduate, many of them want to stay.” With a population of 855,000 (ranked 15th among United States cities), in a metropolitan area of more than two million, Indianapolis is larger and more diverse than many people realize. The city has a highly regarded symphony, art museum, ballet and school of ballet, and zoo. It’s probably best known as a sports mecca, with the N.B.A. Pacers, W.N.B.A. Fever and N.F.L. Colts. It’s the headquarters for the N.C.A.A. and the site of numerous collegiate sports competitions, and it hosted the 2012 Super Bowl. And, of course, it’s home to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of the Indianapolis 500 auto race. Mr. Stutz lived in Austin, Tex. (another Amazon finalist), before moving to Seattle, and watched its evolution from sleepy state capital to technology hub and hip cultural magnet. “Austin was never a cool place,” he said. “Now it’s a hotbed of cool. Indianapolis isn’t quite there yet, but I see a lot of similarities.” Last year Bon Appétit magazine devoted a feature to the “Brooklynization of Indy” that focused on the city’s explosion of craft breweries, artisanal bakeries and farm-to-table restaurants. Transportation facilities are also prominent on Amazon’s wish list. The city’s light-filled new international airport has been voted the best in North America for five years running by Airports Council International and the best airport in the United States for four years by readers of Condé Nast Traveler. The airport offers multiple direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston and Washington, and is about to start nonstop service to Paris. Indianapolis’s central location and network of interstate highways earned the city its nickname, the Crossroads of America. Amazon is among the large companies with distribution centers there. While Indianapolis lacks subways, light rail or a sophisticated urban transport network, the city is crisscrossed with bike and walking trails. Mr. Stutz said many Salesforce employees biked or walked to work (something Amazon’s Seattle employees value). Of the 20 finalist cities, Indianapolis has the least traffic congestion and the lowest average home prices, according to the Chamber of Commerce. That’s not to say there aren’t high-end options: A 21,000-square-foot, six-bedroom 1930s-era mansion, currently home to the Indiana University chancellor, is on the market for just under $7 million. (It might be perfect for the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos.) For all its virtues, Indianapolis faces a number of hurdles. While Mr. Stutz told me that Salesforce had found an abundance of homegrown tech talent there, Amazon knows it will need to import many of the high-level software engineers and employees who will form the core of the work force at its second headquarters. That may be a challenge. Unlike Amazon’s home state of Washington, Indiana reliably votes Republican in presidential elections, though it went for Barack Obama over John McCain in 2008. Donald J. Trump carried the state overwhelmingly in 2016, and Mike Pence, an Indiana native and self-described religious conservative, served as Indiana’s governor before becoming Mr. Trump’s vice president. A strong streak of social conservatism runs through the state (though not so much in Indianapolis), and this week the state legislature was roiled by a new round in the culture wars as legislators debated whether to pass a hate-crimes bill to protect victims of bias based on race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. Indiana is one of only five states without such legislation. Partly as a result of pressure from Salesforce, other companies and the N.C.A.A., Mr. Pence, when he was governor, amended a so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015 that had allowed business owners to discriminate against gays and lesbians on the grounds of religious principle. Mr. Huber said the Chamber of Commerce had been a longtime supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and was a strong supporter of comprehensive anti-hate-crime legislation. The city has had a comprehensive human rights ordinance in place since 2005, he said. Indianapolis may never emerge as the popular favorite to win, but I wouldn’t count it out. Maureen Krauss, the chamber’s chief economic development officer, who worked on Indianapolis’s proposal, said a team of about 300 people had contributed to the first-round effort, and they worked 43 days straight. “We finished it two days early,” she said. “Amazon is a creative company and a tech company, and that’s the kind of proposal we tried to deliver.” She and Mr. Huber got the good news that Indianapolis was a finalist on Thursday last week, but there was no celebration. “We hunkered down and started on Phase 2,” Mr. Huber said. "
296,"The Doomsday Clock, a potent symbol of scientific concerns about humanity’s possible annihilation, was advanced by 30 seconds on Thursday, to 2 minutes to midnight, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced in Washington. The last time the clock was moved so close to midnight was in 1953, during the Cold War. “In 2017, world leaders failed to respond effectively to the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change, making the world security situation more dangerous than it was a year ago — and as dangerous as it has been since World War II,” the bulletin’s science and security board, which oversees the clock, said in a statement. It cited the risks from North Korea’s nuclear program; discord between Russia and the United States; tensions in the South China Sea; the buildup of the nuclear arsenals of Pakistan and India; and uncertainty over the Iran nuclear deal. The scientists also warned that the sustained reductions in greenhouse gases needed to prevent disastrous warming of the planet had not yet occurred and cited the dangers that technology disruption is causing for democracies, including disinformation campaigns intended to manipulate elections and undermine confidence in democracy. They also found that “in 2017, the United States backed away from its longstanding leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges.” The scientists cited, among other destabilizing factors, the harsh rhetoric President Trump has exchanged with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un; Mr. Trump’s disavowal of the Iran deal; the hiring of climate-change deniers at the Environmental Protection Agency; and the administration’s plans to remake and expand the nation’s nuclear arsenal. "
297,"PHILADELPHIA — Malcolm Jenkins, the Philadelphia Eagles’ star safety, was dragging Monday afternoon, and for good reason. The previous night, he helped the hometown team earn a trip to the Super Bowl with a 38-7 thumping of the Minnesota Vikings. He left the stadium at 11 p.m. After a brief appearance at a team party, he went home and played poker with some college fraternity brothers until 3 a.m. His alarm went off at 6 a.m., as it always does. He looked in on his 5-day-old baby and got ready to take his 4-year-old daughter to school. Then it was off to the Eagles’ training facility for rehab, Super Bowl planning and to discuss his other full-time job — fighting for criminal justice reform and addressing racial inequality. “There’s a huge emphasis for me on time management,” Jenkins said with a shrug. “Sometimes it requires burning the candle on both ends.” Jenkins, 30, has been burning that candle since the summer of 2016, when the killing of several African-Americans by the police became his call to action. Since then, he has used every waking hour he isn’t spending on football or family to work with the Players Coalition, a group of N.F.L. players seeking solutions to seemingly intractable problems facing African-Americans. His raised fist during the playing of the national anthem before games in October and November became one of the enduring images of this most political of N.F.L. seasons. Beyond that gesture, though, Jenkins and the Players Coalition have met with leaders of police departments, public defenders, bail officers and lawmakers. They have visited prisons and courts to learn about problems, and pushed for legislation to address them. They also met with top N.F.L. executives repeatedly throughout the season. After some prodding, the N.F.L. announced in December that it would spend up to $89 million over seven years to help grass-roots groups fight inequality. On Tuesday, the league said that the owners of the Browns, the Cardinals, the Dolphins, the Falcons and the Jaguars, along with three current players and two retired players, would form a committee to choose programs and initiatives to support. Jenkins is not on the committee, but he remains the public face of the Players Coalition. He says he is happy with the league’s commitment, but he will not declare victory. The problems are unrelenting. “When I look at our communities, our country, our justice system, those are things I want to change and I’m committed to changing, and that’s going to take sacrifice,” Jenkins said, a gold chain with a pendant in the shape of a fist around his neck. “Laying the foundation is the hardest part, and requires a lot of sacrifice and time.” The 2017 season will probably be remembered more for what happened off the field rather than on it. For large parts of the season, the coast-to-coast debate over whether players should all stand during the playing of the national anthem drowned out any discussion of X’s and O’s. President Trump ignited a full-throated shouting match in September, when he urged owners to fire players who did not stand for the anthem. His fury turned the N.F.L. — traditionally a unifying force — into a mosh pit of competing agendas and emotions, pitting owners, players and league officials mostly against the president, at least initially, and longtime fans against the league. The dispute with Trump overshadowed the original intent of the protests. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was the first not to stand for the national anthem in 2016, did so to shine a light on police brutality and what he saw as the unfairness of the criminal justice system. Some tarred Kaepernick and other protesting players as traitors. Others hailed them as heroes. Amid the storm, Jenkins and about three dozen other players formed the Players Coalition and got to work on finding solutions to the problems they cared about most. During the spring and summer, and then on their days off during the season, they visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in statehouses, went to prisons and bail hearings, and met with activists trying to help the incarcerated get back on their feet. They wrote op-ed pieces and letters to legislators and spoke on television. Jenkins; his Eagles teammate Chris Long; the former wide receiver Anquan Boldin; Michael Bennett and Doug Baldwin of the Seattle Seahawks; Devin McCourty of the New England Patriots; and players on every other team also lobbied their bosses, the 32 team owners and Commissioner Roger Goodell, to use the N.F.L.’s deep pockets to help fight these issues. It was a delicate dance, and some owners wondered whether the league should be expanding its mission far beyond football. “Institutionally, we are not here for a lesson in civics,” Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, said in December. “Institutions — churches, businesses — have all been slow to act. When they act, they usually overreact, and then they have to come back and back the adjustment.” Also, while the players wanted the league to help, they did not want to be seen as asking for its permission. Some players worried that the league might co-opt their message, or demand they stop protesting in return for support. Other players felt that the league could do a lot more than it ultimately did. Jenkins and the majority of his group were simply glad the owners and the league heard them out. “Listening to the players, giving us a seat at the table, it was something we wanted,” Boldin said. In fact, by the time Trump lashed out at the league, Goodell, the Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie and league officials had already spent an entire day in Philadelphia with Jenkins and other players. They met with the police commissioner and public defenders, sat in on bail hearings and heard from former prisoners about the challenges of getting back on their feet. Jenkins said the afternoon was the group’s opportunity to explain why players had chosen to demonstrate, sacrifice their time and “put our necks out there, because these are things happening every day and happening in N.F.L. cities.” Just days later, the league was trying to dance around the political third rail of the anthem protests and the president. The league’s sponsors and television partners were jittery. Through the fury, the Players Coalition became a way to approach the issues productively, and the league and the group had established a degree of trust. “One of the things you come away with is, they are incredibly knowledgeable, articulate and passionate about these issues,” the Atlanta Falcons’ owner, Arthur Blank, said of the members of the Players Coalition. In an odd way, the president may have done the Players Coalition a favor. His obsession with the anthem protests accelerated the discussion about the issues the group was trying to highlight. Those discussions were awkward for some owners, but also for the players who were being branded unpatriotic. Jenkins said the group was determined to seize the moment. “I realized I could have a far greater impact than I ever had,” said Jenkins, a nine-year veteran. All he needed was time, and Jenkins already had a lot on his plate. His foundation, which provides leadership and life skills to young people in underserved communities, had expanded to four states. He had also recently opened a high-end clothing store in Philadelphia. The baby was on the way, and the Eagles were suddenly one of the league’s top teams. Holly Harris, the executive director of the Justice Action Network, enlisted Jenkins to write a letter of support for a program in Ohio that diverts nonviolent drug offenders from prison to community treatment programs. In no time, Jenkins, who played at Ohio State, sent a letter to legislators. Harris said the letter helped save the program. Bill Cobb, the deputy director of the A.C.L.U. Campaign for Smart Justice, which tries to reduce racial disparities in the criminal justice system, took Jenkins and other players to Graterford Prison, in Collegeville, Pa., about an hour’s drive from Philadelphia, to talk with officers and inmates, including juveniles who received life sentences. Jenkins recorded a video and wrote an op-ed column to publicize Cobb’s program. He gave Super Bowl tickets to a man who was released from the prison after serving 30 years of a life term, which he received as a 15-year-old. Jenkins credited players on the Coalition, his wife, Morrisa, and Lurie for helping to shoulder the workload. Among N.F.L. owners, Lurie is uniquely sympathetic to what the Players Coalition has been trying to achieve. Long before he bought the Eagles, he earned a doctoral degree in social policy and lectured on topics like incarceration rates. In the lobby at the Eagles’ training facility, there are large photos of Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Jonas Salk, rather than sepia-tone images of the team’s best former players. While he supports Jenkins and the players, Lurie told them they needed to better publicize their goals so they were not sidetracked by people accusing them of being unpatriotic, like those protesting the Vietnam War in the 1960s. “They had to understand that the message is really important, and if the message is not being received, it hurts their ability to take action,” Lurie said. At one point, Jenkins received criticism from those against the protests and those in favor of them. After the league and the Coalition announced their plan to support grass-roots groups, Jenkins said he would no longer raise his fist during the playing of the anthem. Critics, including some players who quit the Players Coalition, said he had cut a deal to get support from owners who wanted the protests to end. But Jenkins said the protests had succeeded in shining a light on social injustice and the need for action, and the N.F.L. had made a commitment to help, even if it meant working under a bright and sometimes harsh light. “The goal is not to make everyone comfortable and happy,” Jenkins said. As players, we had “to understand the noise is just part of the deal, and if you’re going to get involved, you have to be tough enough to ignore that, and eventually our words and actions will answer all the questions people have.” Then he was off to get back to his new baby.

298,"Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, writes: This transformation presents students with an opportunity to watch, and study, presidential drama in real time, as history unfolds — and to learn more about the office of the presidency and American democracy. With a year of Mr. Trump’s tenure completed, students can also grade the president on his performance so far, and make predictions about what’s to come. Below, we present four approaches to using President Trump’s first year in office as a topic for teaching and learning: 1) Evaluate President Trump’s first year in office.
2) Analyze how, and to what extent, Mr. Trump has changed the presidency.
3) Study major policy shifts advanced by the Trump administration.
4) Voice your opinion. _________ Part I: Working in small groups, students should brainstorm a list of what they think are the most important qualities of a president. Encourage them to come up with at least five qualities or characteristics they think would make anyone who holds that office successful. To help them generate a list, you might offer as a starting place these criteria proposed by Sean Wilentz, a professor of history at Princeton, in his recent Op-Ed: And if you want students to go deeper, you can have them read one or more of these five essays about what makes a good president, written by the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the Republican strategist Karl Rove and others. Part II: Next, ask students to brainstorm a list of President Trump’s most important or memorable actions or statements over the past year. They should come up with at least five important moments in his presidency. Again, if you want to help students with their list, they can begin by watching this brief video and skimming this extensive timeline in Time magazine’s “The Year in Trump: Memorable Moments From the President’s First Year in Office.” If you would like to make this a more in-depth activity, you can present students with six additional sources: • President Trump’s Op-Ed, “A Year of Real Change,” published on the anniversary of his first year in office | The Washington Examiner
• “How America Has Changed During Trump’s First Year in Office, by the Numbers” | N.P.R.
• “The Republican’s Guide to Presidential Etiquette,” a list of the president’s words and actions that concern the New York Times Editorial Board
• “Trump’s First-Year Job Approval Worst by 10 Points,” an analysis of current and historical Gallup Polls | Gallup News
• “A Strong Start: Trump’s First-Year Report Card” | National Review
• “They Were Bad. He May Be Worse,” an Op-Ed in The Times Part III: Now that students are armed with this information, ask them to evaluate President Trump’s first year in office. Do they think he is a good president? Is he a successful president so far? How will history look back on his first year in office? They can share their analysis in one or more of these formats: • Op-Ed: Students can write their own opinion piece analyzing the president’s first year in office.
• Textbook Entry: Students can compose a new chapter for their U.S. history textbook detailing the president’s first year in office for future students.
• Discussion: Students can hold an evidence-based discussion evaluating the president’s first year in office based on previously agreed on criteria.
• Report Card: Students can grade the president on his performance in office so far using the qualities or characteristics they brainstormed, with a short analysis of why they gave each grade. • Predictions: Now that students have considered Mr. Trump’s first year, what detailed predictions might they make about the year to come? Invite them to brainstorm ideas and post or publish them somewhere, then monitor the news to see which come true, how and why. _________ Peter Baker asserts in his analytical piece “For Trump, a Year of Reinventing the Presidency” that President Trump has continually shattered precedents established by previous presidents. Assign this 3,000-word article for students to read. It might be a difficult read for some students, but it sums up a year’s worth of news for this topic. To help students better understand and consider Mr. Baker’s arguments, we suggest giving students these five excerpts (PDF). Working in pairs, students should first explain Mr. Baker’s claim in their own words. Then they should respond: Do they think his analysis is accurate and fair? Within the article itself, Mr. Baker provides evidence to support his assertions. Excerpt 1: Excerpt 2: Excerpt 3: Excerpt 4: Excerpt 5: Once students have fully examined Mr. Baker’s argument, then the class can hold a Socratic seminar using the article to contemplate how, and to what extent, Mr. Trump has changed the presidency. Possible discussion questions include: • In what ways is Mr. Trump reinventing the presidency?
• Do you think these changes are good or bad for the country?
• Is he making the presidency more “authentic” or more “autocratic”?
• Are the president’s actions and statements corrosive to American democracy? Or are they benign political tools for advancing his policy objectives?
• Do you think the changes President Trump is making will outlast his tenure?
• Do you think Mr. Baker’s analysis is accurate and fair? _________ In “The Year the News Accelerated to Trump Speed,” Matt Flegenheimer writes: With this whirlwind of news-making, it can be easy to lose track of what is actually getting accomplished by the White House. The Times has done an in-depth analysis of important policy shifts in two major areas over the president’s first year in office: immigration and foreign policy. Other topics students might want to explore include: climate and the environment, tax reform, health care, energy and education. Students should write a research paper on one policy area, using resources in The New York Times and elsewhere, making sure to do the following: • Define the Trump administration’s policy.
• Identify what actions and statements the White House has taken to advance that policy.
• Determine what the administration has accomplished so far.
• Then, evaluate whether this policy is good for the United States and the world, and explain why. _________ Ask students: What do you think of President Trump’s first year in office? Then invite them to express their opinion in a way that adds to a healthy classroom, and public, discourse. They can write a letter to the editor, draw a political cartoon, make a short video, create a podcast, compose a song, write a poem or use some other creative or rhetorical medium to communicate their point of view. One source of possible inspiration? This piece: “How You Are Showing Up This Year,” which captures what readers say they’re doing to get involved in politics in their communities. Note: You may have to be very clear about ground rules for this activity, to ensure that students use language and images appropriate for the task. For inspiration, students can read letters to the editor in support of and opposed to President Trump. Here are examples: And: Or, students can look at these cartoons marking the end of the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and these winning cartoons drawn by students for our 2017 Editorial Cartoon Contest. Then have students share their work in a classroom gallery. _________ The Inauguration of a New President: A Lesson Plan on Predicting and Evaluating the First 100 Days of a Trump White House Analyzing Trump’s Immigration Ban: A Lesson Plan Teaching and Learning About Governmental Checks and Balances and the Trump Administration Analyzing the Relationship Between the Press and the President: A Lesson Plan Teaching About Charlottesville With Resources from The New York Times Teaching Activities for: ‘Wrenched From Scandal to Success, Trump Looks Ahead, and Over His Shoulder’ What Is Your Reaction to the Recent Flood of Breaking Political News?

299,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — One day after an American drone strike killed a leader of the militant Haqqani network in northwestern Pakistan, United States officials on Thursday rejected a claim by Pakistan that the strike had targeted an Afghan refugee camp. There were also conflicting accounts of the location of the drone strike and the number of people killed. A statement by Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday condemned the strike and maintained that it had “targeted an Afghan refugee camp in Kurram Agency” — an assertion that the United States rejected on Thursday. “The claim in an M.F.A. statement yesterday that U.S. forces struck an Afghan refugee camp in Kurram Agency yesterday is false,” said Richard W. Snelsire, the United States Embassy spokesman in Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital. American officials said that there were no Afghan refugee camps in Kurram, a remote tribal region straddling the border with Afghanistan, where they said Wednesday’s drone strike had taken place. The strike, which killed Nasir Mehmood, a commander of the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network, was at least the third American drone strike in the past two months in Pakistani territory. The United Nations refugee agency also said it had not been operating in the tribal regions of Pakistan since 2005. “We don’t have any access to FATA,” Qaisar Khan Afridi, the agency’s spokesman said, referring to the semiautonomous tribal regions.

300,"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. Our Washington investigations editor, Mark Mazzetti, who was a national security reporter for a decade, has spent the past year exploring the controversy clouding the 2016 presidential election and the Trump presidency. Was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin? What role did social media play? Did President Trump try to obstruct the F.B.I.’s continuing investigation? How vulnerable is the president to criminal charges for his conduct in office? Where is the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, headed? How do reporters get this information? On Tuesday, Feb. 13, in New York City, on a panel titled “Unpacking the Russia Story With the Experts Who Have Covered It,” Mark and his fellow Times reporters Michael Schmidt and Scott Shane will explore this and more with Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at The New School. Save your spot here. (Times subscribers receive 50% off the ticket price with code KREMLIN.)

301,"Updated, 11:30 a.m. Good morning on this bright, cold Thursday. She’s been called a “Trump-whisperer,” “Trump’s favorite foe” and ""the best reporter in the room.” Maggie Haberman, The New York Times’s White House correspondent, consistently breaks front-page news with deeply sourced articles about the Trump White House. We recently spoke to Ms. Haberman as part of an interview series in which successful New Yorkers offer advice to newcomers to their industries. She got her start as a clerk at The New York Post and became a reporter there. She also worked at The Daily News and Politico before joining The Times — where her father, Clyde Haberman, has written for more than 40 years — in 2015. She splits her time between Washington and New York City, and we reached Ms. Haberman, 44, at The Times’s Washington bureau. Her responses have been lightly edited and condensed. How does someone get started in journalism today? It’s not what it was when I started, which was you worked at a local paper — in my case, the tabloids in New York. It’s still a good idea to clerk somewhere, either a print newsroom or TV network. But you’re going to be doing a lot of grunt work for not a lot of pay early on. It was always a difficult field to get into. It’s harder now. What’s your best advice for a young journalist? Basically, outwork everybody: Start out earlier and end your day later. Go to every stakeout that you can on a story. Always make the additional phone call. When a rival beats you on a story, try to figure out how they got it and go from there. Meet with whoever asks to meet with you, although we’re in a bit of a “gotcha” environment now, so you have to be more careful. How do you avoid burnout? I don’t know. I’m very tired (laughs). But we’re all very tired. I think that the demands of reporters now are very different. The only way to avoid burnout is to take cues from your body and your brain. If you’re making mistakes in your copy, take a few extra minutes and look it over a few extra times. Double-check yourself. That doesn’t really deal with the feeling of “I can’t keep doing this,” but if you need to take a break, take a break. "
302,"The past few days have seen a flurry of news about the Robert Mueller investigation: who has been interviewed (Attorney General Jeff Sessions), whom Mueller plans to interview shortly (Donald Trump) and the seeming focus of Mueller’s inquiry (obstruction of justice). Concurrently, Trump and his allies have continued to attack the credibility and authority of the F.B.I. and the media, attempting to pre-emptively discredit any charges Mueller may file and any finding he may make public, as well as the media that would herald those charges and findings. Furthermore, Trump constantly says that there was no collusion with the Russians because, as I am sure he has been told by his attorneys, collusion is not a crime and therefore would not be one of Mueller’s charges. And the Republican-led inquiries in the House and Senate would move heaven and earth to prevent an affirmation of collusion from being included in a final report. This will encourage the Trump team to more forcefully make this argument: They looked for collusion and didn’t find it, so they fished around, on a politically motivated mission, to find anything they could. This would be a twist of the truth, but that is par for the course in these times, with this administration. It is clear from what we already know that there was an appetite in the Trump camp to accept whatever help they could get from the Russians. It is clear that there were a disturbing number of undisclosed meetings with Russians. It is clear that there are some incredibly curious coincidences of timing between activities by the Russians and activities by the campaign. "
303,"The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resigned on Wednesday, in the middle of the nation’s worst flu epidemic in nearly a decade, because of her troubling financial investments in tobacco and health care companies that posed potential conflicts of interest. Alex Azar, the newly appointed secretary of Health and Human Services, announced the resignation of the director, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald. An agency statement cited her “complex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all her duties as the C.D.C. director.” The statement continued: “Due to the nature of these financial interests, Dr. Fitzgerald could not divest from them in a definitive time period. After advising Secretary Azar of both the status of the financial interests and the scope of her recusal, Dr. Fitzgerald tendered, and the secretary accepted, her resignation. ” Mr. Azar, a former executive with Eli Lilly, made the decision on his third day running the sprawling H.H.S. agency. Dr. Anne Schuchat, a veteran official with the C.D.C., was named acting director — the position she had filled before Dr. Fitzgerald took office. She has had prominent roles in many of the agency’s emergency responses to disease outbreaks and vaccine programs around the world. The resignation was announced less than a day after Politico reported on Tuesday that Dr. Fitzgerald, 71, had traded in tobacco stocks even after taking the position at the public health agency. The tobacco trades were small: Dr. Fitzgerald bought between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Japan Tobacco in August, according to her financial disclosure forms, before she signed her ethics agreement. She sold the stock, as promised, in October. Before assuming the post, she also had investments in major tobacco companies, including Reynolds American, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands, Philip Morris International, and Altria Group. Those were also sold in October, along with many of her other holdings. "
304,"President Trump gave a bravura performance on Tuesday night. Among presidential speeches, the State of the Union address comes closest to the long, disjointed, episodic form of the campaign rally — the form of oratory at which he excels. So even though virtually every word of the speech is scripted, it has the shout-outs, the self-applause, the knowing smiles and mugs that this president enjoys and that allow him to engage the congressional and the television audience over a long evening. He became almost as much a conductor as a speaker, expertly cuing the soloists, as it were, a dozen or so times during the speech — surely the largest number of hero-witnesses crammed into one of these events since Ronald Reagan had the dubious idea of turning the State of the Union into a report card on the State of the People. The rhetorical flourishes in last night’s address owed much to Reagan: not merely the heroes and volunteers, but above all the business and personal tax cuts, the largest in a generation, and with them the whirring and turning of economic gears, lifting citizens (in a nice phrase) “from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.” A few hard edges were smoothed away. The phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” did not appear in the speech, as it had in Mr. Trump’s Inaugural Address and his message to the joint session of Congress last year. He did not mention the news media, libel laws or Russia (except to criticize it alongside China as rivals “that challenge our interests, our economy and our values”). The phrase “America First” is gradually softening (another Reagan touch?) into putting “Americans first.” As Mr. Trump put it winningly: “I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.” Some hard edges remained. It is not enough to defeat or destroy the Islamic State. The president won’t rest until we “extinguish ISIS from the face of the earth.” He understands wedge issues better than any current American politician. That side of him might be called Nixonian, except that Mr. Trump tends to be more boldfaced than tricky. His immigration plan, “bipartisan” he called it, is calculated to open up fissures on the Democratic left. The repeal of the Obamacare mandate — “an especially cruel tax” (tip of the hat to the Supreme Court!) “that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year” — was a political masterstroke, devised by the impressive Senator Tom Cotton but quickly embraced by Mr. Trump. "
305,"The prospect of food and water assistance coming to an end for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico blindsided the island’s government this week, prompting angry reactions from local leaders and alarming lawmakers in Washington, who urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reverse course. By Wednesday, FEMA had done so — except it said it had never intended to stop helping Puerto Rico in the first place. The agency will continue providing aid to the storm-ravaged island for as long as it is needed, said William Booher, an agency spokesman. The uproar began when agency officials mistakenly told NPR in an interview published on Monday that FEMA planned to cut off food and water assistance on Jan. 31. “This aid is not stopping,” Mr. Booher said in an interview on Wednesday. “There was no, and is no, current plan to stop providing these commodities, as long as there continues to be an identified need for them.” According to Mr. Booher, Wednesday was not an actual cutoff point, but rather an internal planning date to evaluate if Puerto Rico could still justify needing assistance. The confusion marks the latest blot in the federal government’s response to Maria, which was widely criticized as too small and too slow. More than four months after the storm, nearly a third of Puerto Rican power utility customers are still without electricity, and the island’s financial position remains shaky. “Yesterday, I had to take to a school in Morovis, almost an hour outside of San Juan, water and powdered milk to a school that doesn’t have water or power or enough food for its children,” Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz of San Juan told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. President Trump offered a brief moment of recognition for natural disaster victims in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, telling them, “We are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together. Always.” Mr. Booher insisted on Wednesday that FEMA was not backtracking on its food and water aid plans in response to public criticism. Had the agency planned to end the assistance, it would have required giving notice to the Puerto Rican government, Mr. Booher noted, and FEMA had no plans to end the aid without consulting with Puerto Rico. A statement on Tuesday from Héctor M. Pesquera, the island’s public safety secretary, said that the government had not been informed about any cutoff before the NPR report. Ending the emergency aid would require a transition of at least two weeks between the federal and Puerto Rican governments, Mr. Pesquera added. FEMA has been distributing water bottles, snack food boxes and ready-to-eat meals to Puerto Rican municipalities, where local mayors have handed them out to needy residents. On Wednesday, Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló told reporters in San Juan that his administration had reached out to the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, whose department oversees FEMA, to ensure the aid would continue. FEMA’s plans, Mr. Rosselló said, had been “perhaps miscommunicated.” Puerto Rico intends to rely on mayors to let his administration know when their residents no longer need emergency food and water, Mr. Rosselló said. “You can’t pretend to end it overnight,” he said. The local FEMA workers cited by NPR on Monday — Alejandro De La Campa, the director of the agency’s San Juan-based Caribbean division, and Delyris Aquino-Santiago, a spokesman — mistakenly thought that the date being used in a planning exercise for what ending aid would look like was real, Mr. Booher said. The reported cutoff date had baffled Washington lawmakers. While major cities like San Juan have had much of their power restored — allowing people to refrigerate their food — some towns in the island’s mountainous interior are still in the dark. “Cutting this aid to the people of Puerto Rico, almost a third of them who still do not have electricity — it’s unconscionable, and it’s a travesty,” Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. Thirty lawmakers from both parties had signed a letter imploring FEMA to change course. In clarifying FEMA’s position, Mr. Booher noted that the agency’s aid has become less necessary as supermarkets and restaurants return to regular business. The agency has full stockpiles of food and water to distribute to towns and does not need to bring new supplies to the island for now, he said. FEMA has provided more than $1.6 billion in food and more than $361 million in water, in addition to more than 100,000 liters of water, he said. "
306,"There was only one reference to the deficit in last night’s State of the Union speech, and it had nothing to do with the federal budget. I found that refreshing — we can carry a deficit if the money’s spent wisely — but that’s another story. What President Trump talked about was America’s staggering infrastructure deficit, a whopping $2 trillion fault line in the backbone of the American economy, according to the latest estimates from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The president’s proposal sounded like an ambitious plan to take a big bite out of the problem. He urged Congress to produce a bill that would “generate at least $1.5 trillion” to modernize our decrepit infrastructure. The problem — at least for Democrats — is that the bulk of the financing is apparently supposed to come from private investors, who would ultimately shift most of those costs onto the public in the form of user fees and tolls. Most Democrats won’t sign on to this kind of legislation. Yet without the support of many Democrats, there can be no bill. So where does that leave us? Doing nothing is itself costly. As water mains break, roadways deteriorate and bridges crumble, businesses forgo trillions in sales, families lose an estimated $3,400 a year in disposable income, and our economy sacrifices millions of jobs. That’s why Larry Summers, the former Democratic Treasury secretary, urged the next president to go big on infrastructure spending. If Democrats were in control, they would be pushing not only for the brick-and-mortar projects the president spoke of last night but also for enormous investments in high-speed broadband and renewable energy. Unfortunately, the president wants to spend more money on 20th-century technology — so-called clean coal — instead of modernizing our electric grid and reorienting our economy away from coal and other fossil fuels. So how can Democrats find a way to get things into an infrastructure bill that (a) are good policy and things they would want anyway and (b) can be tied to goals of the Trump administration and a certain number of moderate Republicans in Congress? If done right, infrastructure can actually deliver in four areas the president emphasized again and again in his speech last night: a boon for the economy and the Trump administration; addressing the high cost of health care; tackling the opioid epidemic ravaging the country; and ensuring the safety of the American people. "
307,"Not everyone needed 80 minutes behind a microphone to make a statement at the State of the Union address. The Democratic Women’s Working Group wore black pantsuits, skirts and dresses. In doing so, they followed the women of Hollywood, who wore all black to the Golden Globes in honor of the Time’s Up and #MeToo movements. It was a stark contrast to what has, in the past two years, become the Democratic women’s unofficial color: white. Hillary Clinton memorably wore a white pantsuit when she became the first woman to accept the Democratic nomination for president — a nod to the suffragists, who adopted it as one of their signatures in 1913. And last February, Democratic women wore all white during Mr. Trump’s address to Congress. Yet on Tuesday, in a strange turn, it was Melania Trump who chose white — a gorgeous pantsuit by Christian Dior. Was it meant to stand out against the all-black crowd? Was it a nod to women’s rights? Or perhaps a thumb in the eye of her husband, who was recently accused of having an affair with the porn star Stormy Daniels just weeks after Mrs. Trump gave birth to their son? To judge from Melania’s face and the reports that she traveled to the speech apart from her husband, I suspect the latter. The members of Mr. Trump’s party kept things traditional. Paul Ryan wore the classic American flag pin on his lapel and his equally classic smug face. And many Republican men wore red, white and blue ties. "
308,"To the Editor: Re “President Issues Appeal for Unity in State of Union” (front page, Jan. 31): President Trump has demonstrated that for 80 minutes, by following the script on the teleprompter, he is capable of at least appearing presidential. Most of us know by now that this will not last. Mr. President, the moral and ethical underpinnings of our union, far from being renewed and rejuvenated, are decaying. Your incessant demeaning of government institutions, assaults on the free press and prevarication show your true colors. It is true that in your first year the state of our union economically has become stronger and the advance in the stock market has added to the wealth of our country, although mostly among a small subset of the population. But what is undeniably also true is that our democratic ideals are under attack from within the Republic and from outside it. Until you accept and deal with this reality, the state of our union will remain in peril. KEN DEROW, SWARTHMORE, PA. To the Editor: President Trump, love him or hate him, hit the ball out of the park in his State of the Union address, leaving Democrats scavenging for criticism. His balcony guests were a mix of stories of heroism, heartbreak and patriotism, all of which registered with Americans. The Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, demonstrated an embarrassing petulance in the congressional gallery. One maxim sums up the night: You cannot argue with success. PHIL SERPICO
KEW GARDENS, QUEENS To the Editor: It’s sad that President Trump used honorable, responsible and in some cases grieving individuals as props for a shell of a speech that neither addressed the state of the union with substance nor proposed anything but sketchy plans for the future. "
309,"When someone tells you who they are, believe them. In his State of the Union address, Donald Trump told us exactly who the modern-day abortion opponents are — and exactly what they think of women. This revelation came more than halfway through the speech Tuesday, and probably by accident, when President Trump told a story that was, at least nominally, about human kindness as a cure for the opioid epidemic. As Mr. Trump described it, a 27-year-old Albuquerque police officer, Ryan Holets, happened upon a pregnant woman who was homeless and was “preparing to inject heroin.” The president continued: “When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.” The president said that Officer Holets “felt God speak to him,” that he took out a picture of his wife and their four children, and “went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.” You might have been wondering — I know I was — what happened to that homeless woman? Was she offered treatment? Was she given a chance to reunite with her newborn baby, which could have been a powerful incentive to get clean? Can she be part of the baby’s life? Where is she now? Is she O.K.? The woman’s name is Crystal Champ, and her history is sad, and, at this point, to anyone who’s been paying attention to the devastating opioid epidemic, sadly familiar. And, according to a December CNN report, she has been addicted since she was a teenager, and on the street for the past two years. “I did give up. I just decided this was going to be my life,” Ms. Champ told CNN. Her previous attempts to get clean all ended in failure. “It just keeps coming back and ruining my life.” Once the story went public, Mr. Holets set up a GoFundMe page to help support Ms. Champ as she sought treatment. Donors, who saw Ms. Champ as a person in need of respect and care, gave their money. A rehab facility offered a scholarship. According to Officer Holets, who spoke to CNN on Wednesday, Crystal Champ has now been sober for 40 days. Happy endings all around. Still, it’s revealing that, in President Trump’s telling, we never learned Ms. Champ’s name, and that, once the Holets family made their offer, she simply vanishes from Trump’s story. This wasn’t accidental. Abortion opponents know what they’re up against. In spite of years of debate, of pickets and protests and Marches for Life, the majority of Americans continue to support abortion rights. I imagine that means that most Americans understand, instinctively, that there’s a difference between a 6-week-old embryo and a 6-month-old baby, and that forcing an unwilling woman to carry an unplanned pregnancy to term is different than protecting the life of an existing, living child. In order to make abortion illegal, abortion opponents have to change our minds. They have to get Americans to believe that a fetus or an embryo is the same as a baby, only smaller, and that a mother doesn’t matter as much as that “pre-born” baby does. If, in fact, she emerges from their rhetorical sausage grinder as barely a person at all, that’s all to the good. Think of the posters often brandished at anti-abortion marches and rallies, with the image of a fetus in utero, floating free, like an astronaut, with the umbilical cord, untethered, trailing off into the darkness. The spaceship — a woman — was, of course, nowhere to be seen, an important framing. With the woman literally out of the picture, abortion foes can advance the claim that a fertilized egg is just as much a unique human life, deserving of protection as a living, breathing, toddler. They can argue that the only difference between an embryo, a newborn baby, and a kidney patient on dialysis is age, size, location and circumstance. In this formulation, a pregnant woman, a living, breathing, thinking person, becomes no more than an environment, or a tool, whose story ends once she’s given birth. Once we put the woman back in the picture, once we insist on seeing her as a person, not a place or a thing, we’ve got to acknowledge what is, for abortion opponents, an inconvenient truth. A tiny baby can survive and thrive under the care of a biological parent, or an adoptive one, or even in a neonatal intensive care units, with no parents around. Her survival is not tied to a specific person any more than a patient in kidney failure depends upon a specific machine, or a diabetic’s life is tied to a specific batch of insulin. It’s different for a “pre-born” baby, which does not just need care, or medicine, or machinery. That embryo requires the support, the partnership and the body, of one specific individual: the woman carrying it. The way around that is for abortion opponents to simply take the woman out of the story, to erase her from the picture, or to characterize her as nothing more than the place that “pre-born baby” happens to reside. Abortion opponents call a woman, as did an Oklahoma state representative, Justin Humphreys, an unborn child’s “host,” who deserves to be punished, if she becomes pregnant, for being “irresponsible,” and “inviting that in.” Steve Martin, a Virginia state representative, once used similar language, writing on Facebook that a pregnant woman is “the child’s host (some refer to them as mothers.)” President Trump’s decision to refer to Crystal Champ only as “a homeless, addicted pregnant woman,” to identify her with a series of unpleasant descriptors, to not include her as a main character in Baby Hope’s story, is the extension of that language. If she’s an invisible, nameless nonperson, she’s nothing more than Tupperware for the next generation, a thing that exists and matters only in service to her baby, a woman undeserving of sympathy or rescue or even a name. Those of us who support the right to abortion cannot let women be pushed to the margins, erased and unnamed. We must insist, in the face of an administration that sees us as less-than and not-there, as empty vessels or wily seductresses that we are fully present, entirely human, that we, too, have lives, and that we, too, have rights. Baby Hope’s biological mother is named Crystal Champ. Insist that she, and all pregnant woman, stay in the picture. "

The F.B.I. expressed “grave concerns” about the accuracy of a Republican memo accusing the bureau of mishandling the Russia inquiry. The bureau’s statement thrust the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, above, into the deepening clash with President Trump and other Republicans over whether it should be released. Our Washington correspondent’s analysis: Mr. Trump’s allies are trying to shift the focus away from Russian election interference, and portray the actions of investigators as the real scandal. ____ 2. President Trump’s first State of the Union address, despite its call for unity, may have worsened partisan tensions on Capitol Hill. “I have never seen a president who cares nothing about reaching out to people who did not vote for him,” said a Democratic senator. Here’s an annotated transcript of the speech, and some of the best writing about it from across the political spectrum. ____ 3. In other news from the Justice Department: We got an exclusive look at legal documents that show that prosecutors are seeking information on FIFA and Olympic organizations in a far-reaching investigation of international sports corruption. Above, Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore., which was chosen to host the 2021 world track and field championships without a bidding process. And prosecutors moved to dismiss the corruption case against Senator Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat. That will allow him to run for re-election without the cloud of an indictment hanging over him. ____ 4. An Amtrak train carrying numerous Republican lawmakers to an annual retreat crashed into a large truck in Virginia. The White House said that at least one person was killed and another seriously injured, but that the lawmakers and their staff members were fine. Senator Jeff Flake said in a TV interview that he had been in one of the front cars and helped carry an injured man from the truck to an ambulance. ____ 5. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resigned after criticism of her financial investments in tobacco and health care companies. Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, above, was appointed to the agency in July by Tom Price, who served as Mr. Trump’s first Health and Human Services secretary — until he too was forced to resign, for traveling on private jets and charging them to the government. ____ 6. The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its final meeting under its departing chairwoman, Janet Yellen, above. The rate remains in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. Jerome Powell, a member of the Fed’s board since 2012, will take the oath of office as the new chairman on Monday. ____ 7. Larry Nassar, the former doctor for the U.S. gymnastics team sentenced to more years than any human has ever lived, is back in court. But it’s a different courtroom in Michigan, handling a separate case involving sex abuse against minors. About 65 women and girls have signed up to speak for this sentencing. The judge in this case, Janice Cunningham, said that there were more than 265 victims in total. ____ 8. An amateur fossil hunter led experts to a rare cluster of dinosaur footprints on a slab of rock under a NASA parking lot in Maryland. At one end of rock, above, is a single footprint from a young, long-necked sauropod. At the other end is one from a nodosaur, an armored plant-eater as heavy as a small elephant. Alongside are smaller footprints from a baby nodosaur, following its parent. “I was in ecstasy as a tracker,” the fossil hunter said. ____ 9. The Super Bowl’s coming up this weekend, and our Cooking team has recipes at the ready for staples like chili, wings and dips. But they suggest eating sensibly in preparation, offering, for instance, this Italian potato-pasta soup with greens. ____ 10. Finally, the former adult film actress known as Stormy Daniels appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” just moments after the State of the Union ended. She didn’t confirm — or deny — reports of an affair with the president. On another channel, and in another vein, “The Good Place,” above, airs its season two finale on Thursday. Our critic says the NBC show’s optimism about human nature is refreshing in an era of artistic bleakness. “It’s made humane and sidesplittingly entertaining television out of the notion that people — and even the occasional immortal demon — are redeemable,” he writes. Have a great night. ____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

313,"President Trump’s first State of the Union address drew an audience of 45.6 million, about two million fewer than the number who watched his speech to a joint session of Congress a year ago. The viewership figure, tallied by Nielsen from the broadcast networks and cable channels that aired the 80-minute address on Tuesday night, reflects Mr. Trump’s preferred manner of watching television: the old-fashioned way, on a TV set, in real time. It does not include streaming data. The television audience was also smaller than the one for President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union address in 2010, which had 48 million viewers. Mr. Trump’s joint session speech last year drew 48 million viewers, according to Nielsen, about four million fewer than the 52 million who watched Mr. Obama’s joint session speech in 2009. The comparison, though, is complicated by the fact that more people stream these days than they did even five years ago. Fox News won the night, with an audience of 11.5 million. The leading broadcast networks were CBS and NBC, each with an audience of roughly seven million for the president’s speech. Both benefited from highly rated lead-ins: CBS aired an hourlong special on Super Bowl commercials, and NBC turned to its hit new game show centered on Ellen DeGeneres, “Ellen’s Game of Games.” The speech was also carried on several cable networks, including MSNBC and CNN, as well as PBS and the Spanish-language channels Univision and Telemundo. With Mr. Trump speaking considerably more slowly than his predecessors, his State of the Union address was the third longest in the last 50 years. Digital viewing is difficult to measure because statistics are not compiled by a third-party service, like Nielsen, that is regarded as an industry standard. CNN said that it had 1.7 million video starts on its website and across its apps during Mr. Trump’s address, and that viewership peaked a little before 10 p.m. with 320,000 concurrent users. Coverage on Tuesday included Megyn Kelly’s debut as a prime-time analyst on NBC and the first night for Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, as an ABC pundit. During a luncheon with news anchors on Tuesday, Mr. Trump predicted that his address would have a bigger audience than the Grammys. He got that one right: The Grammys had 19.8 million viewers on Sunday, a drop of 24 percent from last year. In the late-night numbers, Stephen Colbert, who returned to a live format on Tuesday, easily had the highest household rating with a 2.9 share, dwarfing the 2.3 for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and 1.9 for Jimmy Fallon’s “The Tonight Show,” according to Nielsen. Mr. Kimmel, whose main guest was Stormy Daniels, the pornographic actress who reportedly got a settlement to keep a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump quiet, had the highest rating among the advertiser-coveted 18-to-49-year-old demographic in the 25 leading markets. "
314,"GENEVA — The United Nations rattled Israel on Wednesday by disclosing that it was examining more than 200 companies doing business with Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank but deferred naming any of them until it had completed a review of their activities. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a long-anticipated report that an initial review of 321 companies had identified 206 that were involved in doing business with the settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Of those identified, 143 were based in Israel and 22 were in the United States, the United Nations said. The remaining 41 companies were spread among 19 countries, mostly in Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands, France and Britain. “The violations of human rights associated with the settlements are pervasive and devastating, reaching every facet of Palestinian life,” including restrictions on movement, freedom of religion, education and land ownership, the report said. It observed that “businesses play a central role in furthering the establishment, maintenance and expansion of Israeli settlements” and said that they should consider whether it was possible to operate in such an environment in a manner that met their obligation to respect human rights. The report was a result of a resolution passed by the Human Rights Council in March 2016 that called for a database detailing the companies engaged in a list of specified activities that directly enabled, supported or profited from Israeli settlements. Those activities included supplying construction machinery or materials, surveillance equipment and security services, as well as providing banking and financial services. "
315,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, consider the State of the Climate address that wasn’t delivered and join Team Climate on a burger taste test. As was widely expected, President Trump didn’t say anything about climate change in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. And why would he? It’s clear by now that the issue simply isn’t a priority for him. But that got us thinking: If one were to give an update on the state of American climate policy after one year of the Trump administration, what would it look like? We’d start with the fact that the administration has pushed to dismantle nearly all federal regulations related to climate change. That includes the Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions from power plants and a federal flood standard that would have required new infrastructure projects to prepare for a changing climate. (See our updated deregulation tracker for the full list.) And it includes a disavowal of the Paris climate agreement. But you’d also want to note that Mr. Trump hasn’t been able to halt many of the most important trends around the country toward lower emissions. Plenty of states, like California and New York, are still pressing ahead with their own local climate policies. The coal industry, responsible for a quarter of the nation’s emissions, continues to shrink, edged out of the energy market by less expensive natural gas despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to save it. "
316,"WASHINGTON — An American interceptor missile missed its target in a test off the Hawaiian coast on Wednesday, Defense Department officials said, renewing concerns of how the United States will defend itself in the event of a missile attack by North Korea or another adversary. A Pentagon official said that the interceptor, an SM-3 Block IIA missile that is being developed by the Raytheon Company, was launched from a test site in Hawaii. Officials likened the test launch to an attempt to hit a bullet with another bullet. It was the second failure over the past year of a test of the SM-3, known as the standard missile; the last one was in June. Mark Wright, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency, confirmed “a live-fire missile flight test” from Kauai. He did not confirm that the test had failed. But two Defense Department officials, speaking on grounds of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the test’s failure, said that the missile missed hitting the incoming dummy missile. The failure comes as tensions with North Korea are running high. But it was somewhat routine for a missile defense system that even advocates will not promote as providing a defensive shield. Around half of the tests over the 13 years since the system became operational have been declared fully or partly successful. Last August, the United States did successfully intercept a medium-range ballistic missile off the coast of Hawaii. North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in November that flew both higher and longer than previous launches. Analysts said that missile had exhibited a potential range of more than 8,000 miles, able to reach Washington or any other part of the continental United States. Pyongyang has worked hard to be able to overwhelm defense systems that the Pentagon has placed in California, Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea regularly practices firing salvos of missiles because the American system is designed to intercept only one or two incoming warheads at a time. Analyses of recent North Korean flight tests and missiles that have been paraded through the streets of Pyongyang suggest that the North may also be seeking to develop maneuverable warheads. Such a tactic, if successfully developed, would help warheads dodge antimissile interceptors. Tests of the United States’ multibillion-dollar efforts at missile defense have had mixed results. A Pentagon report last year criticized the long-range system, saying that it “demonstrates a limited capability to defend the U.S. homeland from small numbers” of medium- and long-range missiles “launched from North Korea or Iran.” Military officials said that it was unclear why Wednesday’s test failed. On Tuesday, President Trump used his State of the Union speech to lash out at the North Korean government. He said that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had brutalized his own people, and that he must be made to relinquish his nuclear program. "
317,"No one can accuse the Trump administration of being boring, even when it comes to telecom. According to leaked documents, there is a proposal going around  the White House to build a federally owned 5G telecommunications system — the next version of a mobile broadband network — or perhaps even to nationalize the 5G networks that private telecom companies are now building. (5G is the “fifth generation” wireless protocol, which promises to be faster and more secure than its predecessor, 4G, but requires new antennas and cell towers.) The White House proposal, which at the moment is just an idea, appears driven by concerns about security threats related to China’s development of 5G networks. But the strongest case for building a national network is different. Done right, a national 5G network could save a lot of Americans a lot of money and revive competition in what has become an entrenched oligopoly. Done wrong, on the other hand, it could look like something out of Hugo Chávez’s disastrous economic playbook. Americans spend an extraordinary amount of money on bandwidth. The cable industry is the worst offender: Since cable providers have little effective competition, cable bills have grown at many times the rate of inflation and can easily reach thousands of dollars per year. Mobile phone service is not exactly a bargain, either. And with plans to connect cars, toasters and pets to the internet, broadband bills may continue to soar. These bills, collectively, function like a private tax on the whole economy. Could a public 5G network cut that tax? A national 5G network would be a kind of 21st-century Tennessee Valley Authority. The government would build or lease towers across the country, prioritizing underserved areas, and set up a public utility that sold bandwidth at cost. This cheap bandwidth would be made available for resale by anyone who wanted to provide home broadband or wireless, thus creating a new business model for small local resellers. "

319,"Does Donald Trump actually believe in contraception? Today we’re going to talk about how this administration is hacking away at government support for family planning. But in order to get there, we’ll have to spend a minute discussing the president’s sex life, and Stormy Daniels, the porn star. I know you’d much rather get into the serious issue right away, but bear with me. Daniels recently became famous when The Wall Street Journal reported that she had been paid $130,000 in hush money shortly before the election to keep quiet about a one-night stand she’d had with Trump. That was back in 2006, right after Melania gave birth to Barron. Lately, Stormy has been signing denials while making TV rounds and winking broadly. The best evidence that the interlude did occur is an interview she gave In Touch magazine in 2011. Her description of their one-night stand was so boring, it seems impossible she was making it up. The only truly interesting part was Daniels’s report that Trump really hates sharks. (“He was like, ‘I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.’”) We know people cared about that part because of the flood of donations to pro-shark charities. The sex, in case you’re interested in that sort of thing, sounded pretty run-of-the-mill. The only unusual part was that she said Trump did not use a condom: “And I was really kind of upset about it because I am so, like, careful.” Our president spoke highly of condoms back in the day, when he did endless radio guy-talk sessions with his old pal Howard Stern. On the other hand, he volunteered that he had been surprised when his squeeze Marla Maples announced she was pregnant: “She said, ‘I think I’m so happy! We’re about to have a child.’ I said, ‘Excuse me?’ I didn’t know about this.” The wife Trump ditched for Marla was Ivana, who later claimed she had gotten pregnant on their honeymoon even though she was using an IUD. “Three years later, the same thing happened!” the first former Mrs. Trump reported in her recent biography. And then again. The failure rate for IUDs is currently about 0.8 percent, but Ivana’s were apparently less reliable than a fortune cookie. "
320,"NATIONAL An article on Tuesday about Melania Trump’s reaction to reports that her husband had an affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels misstated the time period in which the affair reportedly occurred. It is reported to have occurred after President Trump’s son Barron was born, not while his wife, Melania Trump, was pregnant. • An article on Tuesday about partisan gerrymandering of electoral districts misstated the title of Mark Gersh. He is the former president of NCEC Services, not its current one. NEW YORK An article on Tuesday about Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen’s decision to retire from Congress when his term expires referred incorrectly to Representative Frank LoBiondo’s status in office. Mr. LoBiondo announced in November that he would not seek re-election; he has not yet left office. BUSINESS DAY A picture caption with an article on Tuesday about a new provision in the tax code that encourages investment in areas with high poverty and sluggish job and business growth referred incorrectly to Baltimore’s location. The city is in the Mid-Atlantic region, not New England. • The Vocations column on Sunday about Tara Hartson, a surveyor in Ellsworth, Me., relying on information from a source, referred incorrectly to Ms. Hartson’s academic background. While she studied at Carleton College, she did not receive a bachelor’s degree from that institution. She received a bachelor’s from St. Olaf College. OBITUARIES A picture caption with an obituary on Jan. 21 about the writer Julius Lester misstated the consequences of his public criticism of James Baldwin during his tenure at the University of Massachusetts. He was moved from the department of Afro-American studies to the department of Judaic and Near Eastern studies; he did not lose his professorship.

wrote this week about some scenarios that could become illegal if Australia approves espionage legislation introduced in December. Then, on “The Drum” on Wednesday night, I talked more about Australia’s tolerance for a lack of government transparency. But it’s not exactly a subject for live television — at least not with me explaining it — so I thought I’d return to the issue here in this week’s newsletter. First a bit of context: Australia is not alone in trying to clamp down on information. Japan passed a special secrets law in 2014, over widespread opposition; the United Kingdom has been looking at how to tighten its controls with longer prison sentences; and American investigations into government leaks have increased since Sept. 11, tripling under President Trump. Countries like Turkey, Cambodia, China and Cuba have also made a habit of creating and enforcing laws that allow for maximum control over government information. At a time of rising nationalism worldwide, “national security” has effectively become a catchall category — a legitimate concern expanded to include documents, digital communication and political issues that may not have much to do with national security. Sometimes it takes a bit of luck — a pair of filing cabinets filled with government documents showing up at a used furniture store in Canberra, for example — just to see what kinds of things end up getting classified. And as we now know from “The Cabinet Files,” a lot of it ends up being about politics, not security. As Gaven Morris, the news director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, put it: “Consistently, we’ve seen overreach where governments seek to suppress information because it is embarrassing, not because there is a genuine security risk.” But there are actually several other areas of public life in Australia that make journalism more difficult, or that reveal the degree to which this country tolerates a lack of transparency. A few examples: • Campaign Finance Australia’s campaign finance system is riddled with loopholes and delayed disclosures. At the federal level, it takes more than six months (up to 19 months in fact) for the public to learn how much parties have raised and from whom. Donors are identified only if they have contributed more than 13,500 Australian dollars, or about $10,000, which means individuals and corporations can anonymously make multiple donations without the public knowing. At the same time, Australian politicians are not required to explain what they do with the money. Compare that to Norway, where 74.4 percent of the money used in political campaigns came from government subsidies, with clear and accessible disclosure about contributions. • Suppression Orders Australia’s courts routinely prohibit reporting on certain aspects of criminal cases. While legal scholars maintain that suppression can be valid at times, Australian experts are growing increasingly concerned about its overuse. Jason Bosland, a law professor at the University of Melbourne, has been at the forefront in researching the issue. He has concluded that the many orders lack legal foundation and go beyond what is necessary or in the public interest. For example, there is a major case of global interest working its way through the courts now. It’s subject to a suppression order, and I cannot legally tell you about it. In other cases, courts have ordered that already published journalism be removed from Australian news sites, even though the information in them could be found elsewhere — undermining public trust in both journalism and the justice system. • Defamation Without any equivalent to the American First Amendment, freedom of speech in Australia is more negotiable and often subject to litigation. Suing for defamation is relatively easy in Australia, with presumptions favoring those who sue. Journalists, media organizations — and increasingly anyone who publishes on social media platforms — routinely lose in court or expect to lose and settle. The costs can be high, even prohibitive, stamping out some stories before they are ever written. “Don’t get the idea that the defamation field is balanced. It is heavily weighted in favor of plaintiffs,” wrote Peter Bartlett and Sam White, two well-known media lawyers, in a recent press freedom report. (Full disclosure: Peter is our lawyer). “The vast majority of cases are settled,” they wrote, “not on the merits of the claim, but on a purely commercial basis. The cost of going to judgments is just too great.” Now, it may be that there are strong arguments for restricting information and limiting journalism — arguments that I, as a journalist, may have a harder time fully agreeing with. But regardless of whether you think our tribe is full of sensationalists to be protected against or heroes to be lauded, it’s worth asking: Why are governments increasingly so insecure about letting us all see what they are up to? As my colleagues Max Fisher and Amanda Taub from the Interpreter recently asked: Is there something wrong with democracy, something that has made its principles and freedoms lose their appeal? As always, your thoughts are welcome, in our Facebook group and by email: nytaustralia@nytimes.com. On that happy note, here are some examples of journalism worth fighting for, and smiling at, along with a weekly recommendation that crosses generational lines. ______ Don’t miss this blockbuster scoop from our Washington team, which opens with an argument in the West Wing — “a confrontation,” they write, that “marks the first time Mr. Trump is known to have tried to fire the special counsel.” ______ Cape Town’s water supply is running dangerously close to empty. Within months, taps in homes and businesses will be turned off. The city’s four million residents will have to line up for water rations at 200 collection points. And the police are not expecting peace and calm. It almost sounds like science fiction, but it’s really just science: climate change. ______ I don’t think I can improve on the subhead for this investigative story: “Everyone wants to be popular online. Some even pay for it. Inside social media’s black market.” Read it and then Tweet it out so the bots can see it. ______ What do love and cryptocurrency share? More than you might think. This week’s Modern Love column breaks it down: “All along, I thought I was holding something of value because I could see and feel it. But realness and value are products of shared and equal faith, no matter if in things unseen.” ______ This week, in addition to all things espionage, we have news, science, sports, Netflix, a new Australia Diary and some serious Margot Robbie coverage.

At a time when so much seems so serious, yes, including the top of this newsletter, “Wonder” is a wonderful sigh of emotional accessibility. Here’s the glowing New York Times review if you don’t want to take my word for it. "
323,"WASHINGTON — For years, immigration advocates have defined hundreds of thousands of young people brought to the country illegally as children by the sympathetic term “Dreamers.” Long irritated by the rhetorical branding, President Trump finally came up with his own rejoinder: “Americans are Dreamers, too.” The point was to shift the terms of the polarizing immigration debate and reinforce the argument that those born in the United States or living here legally deserve sympathy as well. But if Mr. Trump believed the line in his State of the Union address would help bring the sides together for the bipartisan agreement he says he seeks, he received little encouragement on Wednesday. The two sides appeared further apart than ever. Although Mr. Trump characterized his immigration proposal as a “down-the-middle compromise,” his speech further alienated him from the bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to negotiate a deal. Rather than act as a catalyst for cooperation, it seemed to only deepen the divide. And it underlined the political ramifications of the nativist language that the president used in the 2016 campaign and during his first year in office. The president faces a year in which a bitterly divided Congress and a swirling Russia scandal could rob him of any high-profile legislative successes. He is sure to play up the benefits of the landmark tax cuts that he helped push through last year, as he did at the White House on Wednesday in an appearance with families who will benefit from the plan. But his proposal for a $1.5 trillion building program to fix the nation’s roads, bridges, airports and other structures generated little enthusiasm, and he offered few other major concrete ideas for legislation. It was the starkly divergent reactions to his discussion of immigration, however, that stood out most on Wednesday. Democrat saw his speech as a dark and hard-edge portrayal of immigrants as gang members and killers, and they seemed more, rather than less, resistant to a deal with Mr. Trump that would upset their liberal base. While some conservatives were unhappy that Mr. Trump had, in their view, gone too far, Republican officials focused their ire on the Democrats for what they considered their intransigence. “The Democrats are going to be even less disposed to do anything the president suggests even if it’s in their interest,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates more limits on immigration. And “it hardens attitudes among Republicans that the Democrats are simply unreasonable and you can’t talk to them.” Jason Grumet, the president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, an organization in Washington that favors an agreement, said Mr. Trump clearly wanted to reach an immigration deal but was not receiving good advice about how to achieve that. “Last night’s speech didn’t preclude a deal, but it sure squandered an opportunity to advance one,” he said. In the address, Mr. Trump offered what he called an “open hand” on the issue of immigration and challenged Congress to “finally get the job done” on a long-delayed overhaul of the system. But in describing the outlines of a plan that he said “fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first,” Mr. Trump turned to the disturbing imagery of teenage girls murdered by immigrant members of the MS-13 gang. With their parents in the audience, Mr. Trump described the night that “these two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.” Asking the parents to stand, the president said: “Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you.” Democrats, in particular, reacted angrily, saying the president was linking immigration to gang violence and murder. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, called the remarks “dangerous” and counterproductive to resolving the debate over the fate of the Dreamers. “The president presents himself as generous toward Dreamers, but he’s holding them hostage to the most extreme anti-immigrant agenda in generations,” Ms. Pelosi said. “We heard more insulting words of ignorance and prejudice — prejudice toward patriotic immigrant families last night.” They also heard Mr. Trump try to appropriate the term Dreamer with his applause line about Americans. Publicly and privately, the president has recoiled at using the nickname, instead referring to them as “the DACA people” or the “folks from DACA,” after the acronym for President Barack Obama’s program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that gives them work permits and protection from deportation. During a White House dinner with the top Democrats in Congress in the fall, Mr. Trump urged them not to use the word Dreamers in public. He has experimented with phrases to turn the argument around for months. “We must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling and forgotten Americans,” Mr. Trump said in September when he ordered an end to the DACA program. “Above all else, we must remember that young Americans have dreams, too.” The term Dreamers was tied to legislation that has never passed Congress called the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or the Dream Act. Mr. Krikorian said that for too long, liberals had been able to set the terms of the debate. “The very notion, Dreamers, was a marketing coup quite frankly,” he said. “The president’s attempt at taking back the term Dreamers is likely to resonate.” Stephen Miller, the president’s top immigration adviser, and other aides devised a four-part plan to carefully navigate the difficult political terrain that has prevented numerous earlier attempts to overhaul immigration during the past two decades. Part 1 was a concession to immigration activists that would give 1.8 million young immigrants a path to citizenship, effectively restoring and expanding Mr. Obama’s DACA program by enshrining it into law. Part 2 would create a $25 billion trust fund for a border wall. Part 3 would end decades of rules allowing legal immigrants to bring their families to the country. And Part 4 would shut down a lottery program aimed at encouraging immigration from underrepresented countries. The White House described the plan last week as “extremely generous” and predicted that it would gain wide support from both sides of the aisle. That was probably overly optimistic. Senators from both parties met before Mr. Trump’s speech on Tuesday to continue negotiations — but without much regard to his four-point plan. One Democratic aide said that the group was largely ignoring the president’s proposals and was making good progress toward a measure that could receive at least the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. Staff members for the group are scheduled to continue discussions over the weekend. White House officials dismissed the criticism, pointing to instant polls that showed that large numbers of people agreed with the president’s immigration comments and noting that the speech drew positive reaction from Republicans, conservatives and law enforcement officials. “It made by heart swell to hear him say Americans have dreams, too,” said Mary Ann Mendoza, whose son was killed in a head-on collision with a car driven by an illegal immigrant who was high on meth. She said Mr. Trump had made a good-faith immigration proposal. “I think the Democrats need to embrace that. They need to go into it with an open mind and get to work.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, rejected the notion that Mr. Trump was refusing to compromise as “laughable.” She pointed out that the president’s plan would provide legal status for nearly three times the number of people who had signed up for protection from deportation under the DACA program started by Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump’s advisers insisted that Democratic complaints were more evidence that liberal lawmakers did not want to find a solution to fix the immigration system and protect young immigrants. “They simply are sitting on their hands and being angry instead of coming to the table to have real negotiations,” Ms. Sanders said Wednesday on CNN. "
324,"WASHINGTON — Aboard Air Force One on a flight home from Europe last July, President Trump and his advisers raced to cobble together a news release about a mysterious meeting at Trump Tower the previous summer between Russians and top Trump campaign officials. Rather than acknowledge the meeting’s intended purpose — to obtain political dirt about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government — the statement instead described the meeting as being about an obscure Russian adoption policy. The statement, released in response to questions from The New York Times about the meeting, has become a focus of the inquiry by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller in recent months have questioned numerous White House officials about how the release came together — and about how directly Mr. Trump oversaw the process. Mr. Mueller’s team recently notified Mr. Trump’s lawyers that the Air Force One statement is one of about a dozen subjects that prosecutors want to discuss in a face-to-face interview of Mr. Trump that is still being negotiated. The revelation of the meeting was striking: It placed the president’s son and his top campaign officials in direct contact with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, and an email to the president’s son emerged saying that the information was part of Russia’s effort to help the Trump campaign. The special counsel is investigating how those revelations were handled in real time in part because the president was involved in his administration’s response. Some lawyers and witnesses who have sat in or been briefed on the interviews have puzzled over Mr. Mueller’s interest in the episode. Lying to federal investigators is a crime; lying to the news media is not. For that reason, some of Mr. Trump’s advisers argue that Mr. Mueller has no grounds to ask the president about the statement and say he should refuse to discuss it. What is already clear is that, as Mr. Trump’s aides and family members tried over 48 hours to manage one of the most consequential crises of the young administration, the situation quickly degenerated into something of a circular firing squad. They protected their own interests, shifted blame and potentially left themselves — and the president — legally vulnerable. "
325,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s long-awaited plan for overhauling the nation’s crumbling infrastructure includes spending $200 billion in federal money over the next decade to spur an additional $1.3 trillion in spending from cities, states and private companies on major projects, White House officials said on Wednesday, a formula that faces long odds on Capitol Hill. The increased infrastructure spending would be offset by unspecified budget cuts. Officials would not detail where those cuts would come from, or how the proposal would effectively leverage at least $6.50 in additional infrastructure spending for every dollar spent by the federal government, a ratio many infrastructure experts consider far-fetched. The officials said Mr. Trump would leave it up to Congress — where there is little consensus about how to pay for such a plan — to figure out the details, giving lawmakers wide latitude in creating what would need to be a bipartisan bill against the backdrop of the midterm elections. Asking a polarized Congress to hash out a complex and contentious plan could complicate an already steep climb for a proposal that was a pillar of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. That difficulty was underscored by a cool reception for Mr. Trump’s proposal from Democrats and labor groups, longtime champions of boosting infrastructure spending, on Wednesday. “That’s not a plan. That’s a hope,” said Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill. “It’s sort of pathetic.” Democrats and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have pushed Mr. Trump’s administration to commit far more federal dollars, funded by tax increases. The Chamber of Commerce proposed a federal gasoline tax increase this month that it estimates would raise nearly $400 billion over a decade, as part of a broader infrastructure package that includes private funding, worker training and streamlined permitting. Senate Democrats called last year for a $1 trillion infrastructure program, financed by closing tax loopholes. They seemed unimpressed by the latest details of Mr. Trump’s plan. "
326,"Desperate for a strong regional ally in the fight against the Islamic State, both the Trump and Obama administrations eagerly worked with Kurdish forces in Syria, even though allies of those forces were waging an insurgency across the border in Turkey, a NATO ally. Now, American successes against the Islamic State are threatened by Turkish attacks on the Syrian Kurds. The clash, long feared, could provoke a wider war and a division of Syria into zones of influence. But stopping it would require a diplomatic commitment on all sides that has so far been lacking. The confrontation began last week when Turkish forces crossed the border into Syria and attacked Kurdish troops, who control the northwestern town of Afrin. Since then, events have escalated, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatening to take the fight to the Kurdish-controlled town of Manbij, where American Special Operations forces are based. He is also talking about expelling the Kurds and resettling the area with Syrian refugees. The Kurds, known as the People’s Protection Units, dominate the Syrian Democratic Forces, an umbrella organization that receives American training, weapons and air support. The Turks consider them terrorists, indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that has waged a separatist war in Turkey for more than 30 years. While the Syrian group plays down its ties to the organization in Turkey, and there are differences, links do exist. The two groups have common roots, but experts say the Syrian contingent has largely kept a 2012 promise not to provide material support to the Turkish Kurds, who are formally recognized as a terrorist group by the United States and Europe. Despite the complications of Americans working with one Kurdish group while another group waged an insurgency against a NATO ally, the decision made sense. Turkey was so focused on overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that it refused to help America fight ISIS. It left its border wide open, enabling foreign fighters to swell ISIS’ ranks. The Kurds, on the other hand, wanted to fight ISIS, which threatened their forces, and they were good at it. Still, the United States should have done more to prevent the two parties from going to war with each other even before the ISIS threat receded. "
327,"Nearly 7,000 Syrians who were granted temporary permission to live and work in the United States as a civil war devoured their country will be allowed to stay for at least another 18 months, the Trump administration announced on Wednesday, in an acknowledgment that Syria continues to be rattled by conflict. The decision came as a major relief to Syrians and their advocates. Over the past year, the administration has ended Temporary Protected Status, as the humanitarian program is known, for Salvadorans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, decisions that will collectively expose more than 326,000 people to deportation. The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, said that the situation in Syria justified allowing Syrians to remain in the United States. “After carefully considering conditions on the ground, I have determined that it is necessary to extend the Temporary Protected Status designation for Syria,” Ms. Nielsen said in a statement. “It is clear that the conditions upon which Syria’s designation was based continue to exist, therefore an extension is warranted under the statute.” But the extension arrived with a caveat: Those who came to live in the United States after Aug. 1, 2016, will not be eligible to join the program, a distinction that the Syrian community and its advocates said left some Syrians vulnerable. Though he was relieved to hear of the final decision, “it’s been very stressful the last few months, especially seeing other countries, that they were terminated from their T.P.S. status, so we were preparing for the worst,” said Nawwar Kabbani, 33, a software architect from Aleppo who was able to start working when he received the temporary permission five years ago. “I’ve been looking at the news every five minutes for the past two days.” "
328,"In Missouri, an acolyte of President Trump is running for the U.S. Senate and denouncing “manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.” The candidate, Courtland Sykes, a conservative Republican, is seeking to oust a moderate Democrat, Claire McCaskill. That diatribe by Sykes is worth quoting as a window into the backlash against #MeToo and empowered women: “I don’t buy into radical feminism’s crazy definition of modern womanhood and I never did,” Sykes wrote on his campaign’s Facebook page. “They made it up to suit their own nasty, snake-filled heads.” “I don’t buy the non-stop feminization campaign against manhood,” he added. “I want to come home to a home cooked dinner at six every night, one that [my fiancée] fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix.” Speaking of those daughters, Sykes clarifies: “I don’t want them [to] grow up into career obsessed banshees who … become nail-biting manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.” Sykes, who has not been endorsed by Donald Trump and who seems unlikely to be elected, says that young women are turning against feminism because of distaste for Hillary Clinton: “They look at her personal life’s wreckage and didn’t want to become like her.” "
329,"“What makes America great? The answer is simple, really. Americans make America great.” That line could have been taken straight from Donald J. Trump’s State of the Union address, but instead it was in a trailer for the horror movie “The First Purge” that debuted during coverage of the president’s speech on Tuesday night. The “Purge” franchise, set in a dystopian America in which residents are allowed to commit mayhem and murder one night every year, has always been timely. The third and most recent previous installment, “The Purge: Election Year,” was released in summer 2016 and outgrossed its predecessors, making $118 million worldwide. “The First Purge,” as its title implies, is a prequel, depicting the events that led to the creation of the deadly annual free-for-all by the New Founding Fathers of America party. The teaser features seemingly patriotic scenes of American flags, the Statue of Liberty, and fireworks as a folksy narrator growls lines like, “You are the lifeblood of the nation, and your rights as Americans must be safeguarded.” The 30-second spot ends with the movie’s title emblazoned on a red, “Make America Great Again”-style baseball cap. “The First Purge” hits theaters, aptly enough, on July 4.

Perhaps, he writes, “the only guy who has the credibility with the base to actually grant amnesty is the same guy who called Mexicans rapists.” Read more » _____ Dan McLaughlin in National Review: Mr. McLaughlin found Mr. Trump’s use of his guest’s inspirational stories during the speech to be a sign of “weakness,” though the stories themselves were powerful reminders of “what a perilous world we still live in.” Overall, however, Mr. McLaughlin, a Trump skeptic on the right, was pleased to see the Republican president promote the benefits of tax cuts, solidarity with Iranian protesters and the need for compromise over immigration. Read more » _____ The editors at The Washington Examiner: The editors at The Washington Examiner heard the president deliver an argument for a strong America. Strength, in their understanding, is less about power and more about resilience. They found the theme “cheering” and “uplifting” and, importantly, “a break from his invocation of strength in authoritarian ways.” Read more » _____ Ramesh Ponnuru in Bloomberg: Presidents tend to use State of the Union addresses to accomplish a few goals, Mr. Ponnuru writes. Apart from garnering good reviews and shoring up popularity, historically, presidents have used the opportunity to lay out policy priorities and “lay the groundwork for future legislative proposals.” In this, Mr. Ponnuru explains, Mr. Trump failed, with one very notable exception. On immigration, the president “outlined an extremely ambitious agenda with enough detail to make for a useful debate.” Read more » _____ Joan Walsh in The Nation: Ms. Walsh wants to be fair and give credit where credit’s due: “He praised ‘beautiful clean coal,’ which was surreal, but he didn’t praise Nazis or white supremacists or say there are good people ‘on all sides’ of the racial divides he has widened.” However, she writes, that’s not enough to erase what she calls a “crisis of democracy that got more dangerous just in the last 36 hours.” Read more » _____ Eric Levitz in New York Magazine: Before Mr. Trump’s comments on immigration, Mr. Levitz admits, he “endorsed a series of vague, but nonetheless bipartisan — if not outright Democratic — policy proposals.” But the “great unifier’s mask really slipped,” according to Mr. Levitz, when the president made a case against “chain migration.” Read more » _____ Jamelle Bouie in Slate: Mr. Bouie doesn’t see what other commentators saw in the president’s address. “Far from signaling some pivot toward respectability,” he writes, this State of the Union speech serves as a reminder that “the president sees attacking people of color as a top priority.” Read more » _____ Richard Wolffe in The Guardian: Mr. Wolffe isn’t so sure about the sincerity of the president’s love for America.

331,"STOKE-ON-TRENT, England — Rain predictably pelted the windshield on the nearly 40-mile journey down the dark motorway back to his home on the outskirts of Manchester, but Geoff Cameron wasn’t about to let a soaking interrupt him. Not after all these years here. Even after playing a full 90 minutes for the second time in three days, and even after the most damaging league defeat in his six seasons as a Stoke City player, Cameron had plenty to say. Over the course of the next hour, after some expletive-laden venting in the wake of a costly 1-0 home loss to Newcastle United, he invited questions on a number of subjects: Stoke’s increasingly dire predicament in the Premier League, his brush with political controversy last year and the challenges of life as an American abroad. Cameron also naturally ruminated on the United States’ ill-fated World Cup qualifying campaign, heading into a summer of unforeseen spectating. A sample: ■ “There’s no doubt in my mind that if Jurgen Klinsmann was still our head coach, we would have qualified for the World Cup.” ■ “People can have their opinions and say I’m a bad player and this and that. Well, I’ve been over here for this long for a reason. So I think I have to be doing something right.” ■ “My goal is to play this game until I’m 40.” ■ “Bruce Arena made decisions that cost us going to the World Cup. And I don’t have a problem saying it, because we had the right group of guys.” ■ “I don’t think Bruce likes my bluntness.” Cameron, 32, knows he has to move on, especially with Stoke firmly plunged into a relegation battle that cost Mark Hughes his job as manager a week into January. But I asked him to spend a little more of the ride discussing the United States’ failure to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986, which Cameron admitted had left “such a bad taste in my mouth.” “Our names will go down as the team that didn’t qualify,” Cameron said. “It’s on us as players, but at the end of the day, I’m convinced if they would have kept Jurgen and not done such a drastic change, I think we would have qualified. I know we would have qualified. Instead we’ve gone backward.” Cameron remains aggrieved that despite his lengthy run in perhaps the world’s best league and a reputation at his club that prompted a BBC Radio Stoke commentator to call him “our Mr. Dependable,” Arena, the United States manager at the time, kept him on the bench for the final two World Cup qualifiers. Cameron was told by Arena, even before the national team convened in October for the two games, that he would not be starting against Panama or Trinidad and Tobago because of concerns about his fitness. But Cameron said he couldn’t understand that reasoning, especially after he logged a full 90 minutes in Stoke’s victory over Southampton on Sept. 30 before reporting to the United States camp. Needing only a draw in Trinidad to secure a spot in Russia, Arena opted for the same attack-heavy formation that had delivered a 4-0 home win over Panama days earlier and kept Cameron, his most experienced and athletic central defender, on the bench against the speedy hosts. As every American fan knows now, those tactics backfired. A rough night for Omar Gonzalez and Matt Besler in central defense and an eventual 2-1 defeat, combined with unexpected victories for Panama and Honduras, consigned the Americans to an embarrassing fifth-place finish out of six teams in the region — leaving Arena with just three wins in eight qualifiers after having replaced Klinsmann in November 2016. “Listen: I hold my hand up — I didn’t play well against Costa Rica,” Cameron said of a 2-0 loss in a qualifier on Sept. 1, in which his poor performance alongside Tim Ream dropped both out of favor for the October games. “I made a mistake; their second goal was my fault. But it was the 88th minute and we were down, 1-nil. I tried to do something to help the team and I got caught out. “But I would have more respect for a coach to say: ‘You know what, Geoff? I don’t fancy you today. I think this is a better lineup.’ I’d say: ‘O.K., no problem, you told me the truth.’ But if you tell me I’m not fit enough, that’s like an insult to me as a professional.” In response, Arena said in a telephone interview: “Could Geoff have been in the starting lineup that day? Yes. But the problem with Geoff throughout 2017, at club and national team level, was inconsistency and some injuries. “Geoff started five games starting in November 2016 through October 2017. Our record was 1-3-1 — that plays a role. I don’t think 2017 was that impressive of a performance for the player. When the stars and the moon and the sun are aligned properly, Geoff is a very good player. They don’t all align properly all the time.” (Cameron did start five games for Arena in that window — four qualifiers and a friendly — but the Americans’ record was 2-1-2 in those games.) In a subsequent appearance two weeks ago at a coaches convention in Philadelphia, Arena asserted that “the chemistry of the group wasn’t right” and mentioned “a couple of bad eggs.” He expressed disappointment that there had been a few players on the national team “that we could never get to.” “You’ll read about one of them in the next day or two in The New York Times,” he told the gathered coaches, implying — without speaking Cameron’s name — that he had been referring to him. In the aftermath of the World Cup qualifying debacle, Arena stepped down, Sunil Gulati announced he would not seek re-election after three terms as the president of U.S. Soccer and Cameron was left to wonder if he would ever play for his country again. But he cannot afford to dwell on any of that now, because Cameron’s club is in peril. There is a new manager to win over — Paul Lambert has replaced Hughes — and Cameron concedes that, to establish himself, “it’s almost like you’re starting from square one again.” The difference between his club and national team status is that Cameron, since his arrival at Stoke in the summer of 2012, has been a near-automatic choice to start when healthy under his two previous managers: Hughes and Tony Pulis. Four days after watching the Trinidad loss from the bench, and after flying more than 8,000 miles back and forth, Cameron was back in Stoke’s starting lineup on Oct. 14 against league-leading Manchester City. Then, after recovering from a late-October concussion that sidelined him for six weeks, Cameron started five games in a span of 15 days, including Hughes’s final three games in charge — at three different positions. “It often upsets Geoff that he gets moved around,” Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland said. “But the problem is he’s so versatile.” Martin Smith, the editor of a longtime Stoke City fanzine called The Oatcake who also contributes to coverage of the club in The Stoke Sentinel newspaper, said: “I wouldn’t say he’s anybody’s favorite player, because favorite players are usually the ones who score the goals and things like that. But I genuinely think he’s an appreciated player. You really see the value in Geoff when he isn’t available. When he’s not there, we really notice it.” Stoke conceded a league-worst 50 goals in its first 23 matches to fall to 18th place and is subjected to frequent reminders that in the Premier League’s first 25 seasons, the team with the leakiest defense has been relegated 24 times. But Smith argues that the various injury absences of Cameron (who has missed nine league games) and the club captain Ryan Shawcross (eight) largely account for Stoke’s woes at the back. Stoke surrendered only 23 of those 50 goals with Cameron on the field — 12 of them in two routs against the perennial powerhouses Manchester City and Chelsea. The BBC Radio Stoke broadcaster, Matt Sandoz, who commentates on Stoke’s matches and hosts a radio call-in show after matches called “Praise & Grumble,” said it’s “very rare we get a grumble about Geoff.” “I couldn’t recall the last time,” Sandoz said. “Obviously he’s got his flaws, like any player, but because he’s been so consistent and so reliable, Stoke fans would never flinch to see his name on the team sheet.” The bond between club and player is such that, according to Sandoz, “it would be really strange to see Geoff Cameron playing his football elsewhere.” But Cameron has no desire to relocate before the eventual return he is planning to Major League Soccer, despite news media rumors on the eve of Wednesday’s transfer deadline that multiple Premier League teams had targeted him. He takes pride in his long association with the club and regards the drawn-out transfer saga that landed him there nearly six years ago as destiny. On that drive home from the Newcastle defeat, Cameron revealed that he had agreed to contract terms with Everton before joining Stoke and was poised to team up with his fellow American Tim Howard, only to have M.L.S. block the deal because it wanted more money from Everton than the reported $3 million Stoke had offered to sign Cameron away from the Houston Dynamo. “Timmy called me and said, ‘Don’t sign for Stoke, Everton wants you,’ ” Cameron said. “But I’m happy the way it worked out, because I’ve created my own path. It’s cool I’ve been able to make my own name for myself at my own club.” Like many Stoke players, Cameron is willing to endure the near-hourlong commute each way to live in one of the more fashionable sections of the Manchester area. He rents a modern, five-bedroom house; walks his dogs, Duke and Mya, in a nearby field before driving to training every morning; and, as he has gotten older, happily calls himself a homebody who prefers to cook his own meals and spend time with the dogs. He maintains steady contact with friends and family back in the United States but rebuffed questions about his relationship status, saying it was the one topic he prefers to keep private. “When you have time to shut your body down in this game, you have to shut your body down,” Cameron said. “So I’m very regimented in my life. “But I have my dogs, so I don’t really get lonely.” A decade ago, during the 2007-8 season, 12 Americans played at least one game in the Premier League. This season, only four Americans are on league rosters and just three have made it onto the field: Cameron; Newcastle’s DeAndre Yedlin; and Huddersfield’s Danny Williams. When Cameron first arrived in England, several of his countrymen lived within driving distance. Howard was at Everton. Stuart Holden, who had played with Cameron in Houston, was at Bolton. Maurice Edu and Brek Shea soon followed Cameron to Stoke. “On Sundays we would grill out, American-style, and watch NFL Red Zone together,” Holden said. But that support system has frittered away. Howard, Edu and Shea are back in Major League Soccer. Holden is a commentator for Fox Sports. And Cameron has had to learn to look after himself. Cooking has become his “No. 1 hobby,” with pasta Bolognese and chicken in a balsamic reduction ranking as his go-to dishes. On the rare occasion he allows himself a night out, Cameron likes to drop in on Matt & Phred’s jazz club in Manchester’s Northern Quarter once or twice a month. But his free time more typically features a trip to the Altrincham Market food hall — or to a local chiropractor for extra maintenance. Having crossed the five-year threshold in terms of British residency, Cameron also has begun studying for the exams required to secure a British passport. The British mentality, meanwhile, gets more ingrained with each passing season; Cameron, for example, now refuses to wear a long-sleeved jersey or gloves in Stoke’s matches, no matter how grim the weather gets. “I just feel like it’s wrong now,” Cameron said of his on-field fashion choices. “But it’s funny. If I say I miss the sunshine, all the boys will say: ‘Shut up. You’re a Brit now. You love this weather.’ So I’m a Brit when it suits them and I’m a Yank when it doesn’t. I’m in a lose-lose situation all the time.” Butland, who is widely regarded as Stoke’s best player and who is soon headed to the World Cup with England, admitted he and his teammates “like to wind Geoff up.” One subject, though, is off limits. Butland has resisted the urge to needle Cameron about the United States’ qualifying failure. “I didn’t give him stick about the World Cup because I know how disappointed he was,” Butland said. “Maybe in time, but it’s still a touchy subject. He’s made it quite clear how much he’s enjoyed playing for his country and how much America means to him.” After a recent run of nine defeats in 12 league games, Cameron and his Stoke teammates are in the midst of a sudden and steep fall following three ninth-place finishes in Hughes’s first three seasons. Yet for Cameron, it’s merely the latest in a series of challenges. He had to overcome a knee injury as well as his concussion in 2017, with the World Cup elimination and his first dose of unflattering headlines off the field mixed in. Early last year, while still recovering from knee ligament damage, Cameron told Sports Illustrated that unlike several of his national team colleagues, he would support “a temporary pause on immigration for the purpose of evaluating and improving vetting procedures” in response to a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations enacted by President Trump. Ever since those comments, and a tweet during the presidential election in which he called Hillary Clinton a “crook,” Cameron is known to a segment of the American soccer public as the player who makes politically charged statements. His February immigration comments drew a backlash, which Cameron said included death threats via social media, that has gradually curbed his long-held willingness to discuss politics publicly. “Now I just kind of leave it alone,” Cameron said. Pressed about how he feels about the travel ban nearly a year later, Cameron insisted: “I never said I supported a Muslim ban. I said I support a better vetting procedure. And I still do.” As for being branded a Trump supporter, Cameron said: “I’m not like a hard-core Republican. I wasn’t walking around wearing ‘Make America Great Again’ hats. I just couldn’t vote for Hillary — I just didn’t like Hillary as a person or a politician. I tend to side with more Republican or conservative views, but if there was someone that I thought was a better candidate than Trump or Hillary, I would have voted for them hands down. “I still get tweets that say, ‘Geoff’s a good footballer but I hate his politics.’ It hurt me at the beginning, because I was like, ‘This is what people think of me?’ But then I got to the point where I was like: ‘You know what? Screw it.’ These people don’t really know me.” It is an example of the defiance he has tried to adopt from his combative national team teammate Clint Dempsey. Before returning to M.L.S. in August 2013, Dempsey made 218 Premier League appearances, establishing a record for American outfield players that Cameron is now chasing. “You had Timmy, Kasey Keller, Brad Friedel, Brad Guzan — Americans have been known over here for the quality of our keepers,” said Cameron, who has made more than 160 Premier League appearances for Stoke. “But no one really respected us as players. “Clint came over here and changed the game for us. He did it with a chip on his shoulder and he’s given me the encouragement to say, ‘I’m American, so what?’ “You have ups and downs in your career, but you can’t let that define you as a player. I’m not going to let missing the World Cup define me. Obviously it’s a massive disappointment that we didn’t make it, but neither did Wales — and they have a lot of good players.” There is more defiance in Cameron’s voice when he talks about Stoke’s relegation scrap. He has two more seasons left on his contract, and he is determined to spend them at the highest level. “I’m not ready to leave this rain,” Cameron said. “I’m here 10 months out of the year. This is home for me. “I’m comfortable driving on the other side of the road.” "
332,"In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night President Trump said that illegal immigrants “have caused the loss of many innocent lives,” and he paid special attention to the gang known as MS-13. Many of its members, he said, “took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors” and then ended up murdering American citizens. In the gallery as his guests were the parents of two teenagers from Brentwood, N.Y. on Long Island, Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, who were killed by the gang in 2016. They cried when Mr. Trump told the story of their children’s death. Kayla, 16, had been feuding with MS-13 members at school and on social media, prosecutors have said, and Nisa, on the eve of her 16th birthday, was with her on Sept. 13, 2016, when the gang members attacked as they were walking down a street at about 8:30 p.m. Both girls were bludgeoned to death with baseball bats and machetes. That night on Long Island brought attention to the working-class, immigrant community, where just seven months later, MS-13 struck again. Four Latino young men — three of whom were immigrants — were killed in the woods behind a soccer field in nearby Central Islip. The authorities arrested more than 15 members of MS-13 for the homicides. In a span of 17 months on Long Island, there were 17 murders attributed to MS-13. MS-13 was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by refugees from El Salvador escaping civil war. The abbreviation stands for Mara Salvatrucha, which roughly translates to “Salvadoran street posse.” The government has said that it is has an estimated 10,000 members across the country, though that figure has been widely disputed. In the mid-1990s, the government started deporting the immigrant gang members, which helped grow its leadership base in El Salvador. At the same time, MS-13 migrated to other areas of the country with large immigrant populations. Today, it is considered transnational, existing in countries like Honduras and Mexico. The gang draws heavily on teenage boys — or younger — for recruits, and generally does not survive on the global trafficking of drugs, guns or people. The members recruit through extortion and intimidation, and often to be initiated, they must kill. Not all members are immigrants, however. But many of the their targets are. The girls killed on Long Island, Kayla and Nisa, were American-born. But the four Latino young men murdered in 2017 all came from immigrant families. Two of those victims had fled gang violence in Honduras and had pending asylum applications. As federal prosecutors on Long Island said of MS-13’s methods: “Much of what they do and how they behave boils down to violence for the sake of violence.” The “loophole” in Mr. Trump’s speech has been immigration authorities’ approach to children who arrive at the border alone — “unaccompanied alien children,” in government parlance, who are eligible for special protections. Children who are fleeing violence in their home countries can apply for asylum. Others, after a lengthy court process, would be eligible for legal residence if they prove they were abused, neglected or abandoned by a parent in their home country. Young migrants have surged across the border in recent years because of the gangs and poverty in Central America. They often end up living with family members or court-appointed guardians while their cases are adjudicated. In Brentwood, where Kayla and Nisa went to school, more than 4,000 school-age migrants entered the district over the past several years, officials have said. Mr. Trump, and the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, visited the area last year, vowing to decimate the gang. Mr. Sessions said that MS-13 smuggled members into the country using the unaccompanied minors program. And yet, local authorities and community activists say, the reality is many gang members were recruited in the United States as vulnerable new arrivals. Mr. Trump’s proposal did not make clear what would happen with unaccompanied minors crossing into the United States, other than increasing border security to no longer allow gang members “to break into our country.” Mr. Trump also singled out Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez for his efforts in fighting gang violence, saying Agent Martinez “commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.” Agent Martinez was part of an effort called Operation Matador, which started in May 2017. Since September 2016, Suffolk County police said they have arrested more than 300 gang members, and for those they cannot charge locally or federally, they cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who arrest gang members who are in the country undocumented.

334,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue. • Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed. • Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow? • The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional. • Boeing is powering the Dow again. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations. The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often. Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release: That’s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates. But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive. What soothed investors’ concerns? Facebook said on its call with analysts that the average price per ad increased 43 percent in the quarter. “The impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,” Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, told analysts. The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours. The social media giant reported its fourth-quarter operating profit jumped 61 percent to $7.35 billion after the close Wednesday. The numbers: $4.27 billion— The company’s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge. $12.97 billion — Facebook’s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. 1.4 billion — The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter. DealBook’s take: Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook’s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter. But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the “time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.” Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016. Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016. — Peter Eavis The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed’s inflation language. Today’s statement on inflation: The statement from the December meeting: Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed’s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824. Reactions: Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote that the change to the Fed’s inflation language was “decisive” and a hawkish signal. The bank also noted: “Adding to the conviction of higher inflation, the FOMC noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low. This shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.” Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics: “In short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell’s first press conference. We’re expecting continuity of approach, at least for a while.” Greg McBride, Bankrate.com: “While there is a lot of continuity between Yellen and Powell, many other faces on the committee are changing, and this could mean a Fed that is more inclined to raise interest rates than what we’ve become accustomed to under Janet Yellen.” Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write: The analysts add: The context: A S&P Dow Jones Indices committee meets twice a year to review the makeup the Dow industrials. G.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow’s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years. — Stephen Grocer A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT’s Stacy Cowley reports: The European Union appears to be leaning against striking a special deal for London, instead giving the financial center more limited access to the European single market. More from Jim Brunsden of the FT, who first reported on the news, citing unnamed sources: — Michael J. de la Merced Stephen Cutler, who until the end of 2015 was the bank’s general counsel, will become a litigation partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, according to the WSJ. Since then, he has been a vice chairman of the firm. Before joining JPMorgan in 2006, he worked as the head of enforcement at the S.E.C. and as a top securities lawyer at what was then Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. More from Sara Randazzo of the WSJ: — Michael J. de la Merced It’s Canson Capital Partners, which wasn’t even licensed to operate until three months ago. Its founders: • Matteo Canonco, a former global head of financial sponsors at HSBC • James Simpson, a former co-head of advisory for Europe at HSBC More from Dinesh Nair of Bloomberg, who interviewed Mr. Canonaco: — Michael J. de la Merced Shares of Boeing are up 6.3 percent after the company’s earnings easily beat expectations. The aerospace company reported a profit of $3.06 a share excluding the tax gain. Analysts had expected $2.90 a share. Revenue jumped 8.9 percent to $25.4 billion. Analysts had forecast $24.7 billion in sales. Boeing’s rally Wednesday has accounted for about 50 percent of the Dow Jones industrial average’s 250 point gain in early trading. Boeing’s 12 percent rally over the past year has powered the Dow’s run to record highs. Earlier this month when the Dow surpassed 26000 just eight days after topping 25000, Boeing accounted for about a third of the index’s 1,000-point gain. — Stephen Grocer At least, that’s what the president said in last night’s State of the Union address. But how much progress can he make on either front? More from Julie Davis and Michael Shear of the NYT: Mr. Trump offered few details on his infrastructure proposal. A report by McKinsey & Company says that a comprehensive fix would cost $1.8 trillion, while the American Society of Civil Engineers put the price tag at $2 trillion. All but $200 billion is supposed to come from private investors, but lawmakers are skeptical. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, told reporters, “You tell me how we pay for it, and I’ll tell you what we can do.” “Leveraging private dollars is a good start,” he added, “but we got a lot of work to do.” Don’t forget immigration Congress has until Feb. 8 to agree on government funding, and Democrats say they still want a deal to protect the young immigrants known as Dreamers. The White House’s immigration proposal isn’t sitting well with them — nor with some House Republicans. Meanwhile, businesses are preparing for the worst if legal protections for the Dreamers expire in March. The Washington flyaround • As the national deficit approaches $1 trillion, both parties are expressing concern — while pushing to increase spending. (NYT) • The Justice Department and the F.B.I. are bracing for the release of a secret memo alleging improprieties in the surveillance of a Trump campaign aide. (NYT) • What companies are doing with their tax savings. (NYT) • The head of the C.D.C., Brenda Fitzgerald, bought shares in Japan Tobacco despite leading an agency charged with reducing tobacco use. (Politico) • Expect populist politics to stick around, Eduardo Porter writes in his latest Economic Scene column. (NYT) • Todd Ricketts, the Chicago billionaire, will replace Steve Wynn as the Republican National Committee’s finance chairman. (WaPo) • The Treasury Department’s list of Russian oligarchs was compiled primarily from Forbes’s list of global billionaires. (Forbes) President Trump also touted the trickle-down effect of the tax overhaul during Tuesday’s State of the Union address: The tax law indeed has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers. Much of those perks have come in the form of one-time bonuses. Many companies have also said they would increase base wages, expand benefits and raise charitable donations. Here’s a closer look at what companies are doing: Warren Buffett has called the U.S. health care system “a hungry tapeworm on the American economy” because of its ever-growing costs. So his Berkshire Hathaway has teamed up with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase to create a new — and as of now largely undefined — health care provider. Our colleague Peter Eavis had four questions about the initiative: • What is it, beyond the thin description of an independent company “free from profit-making incentives and constraints”? • How big will it be? • What expertise will these companies bring? • How will this venture cut costs? The numbers that matter • $18,764: the average premium for family coverage for employees nationwide, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. • 30 percent: the current amount of the premium paid for by workers. • 5 percent and 7 percent: how much the shares of Anthem and Cigna fell yesterday. (Insurers and prescription benefits managers as a whole took a hit on the news.) Critics’ corner • Margot Sanger-Katz and Reed Abelson offer reasons to temper expectations. (Upshot) • Robert Cyran writes, “Amazon is already perceived as a potential threat to many U.S. businesses. Add other big employers, and the threat is multiplied.” (Breakingviews) One of the icons of 20th-century corporate America, the long-struggling company will now be controlled by Fujifilm Holdings of Japan. It’s a complicated transaction • Xerox will be folded into an existing 55-year-old joint venture. • Xerox investors will receive a special cash dividend of $9.80 a share and will own 49.9 percent of the combined business, which will be publicly traded. • The move is expected to save at least $1.7 billion in costs, though Fujifilm will cut 10,000 jobs. The context: Xerox has struggled over the years with a decline in corporate printing, and it spun out its business services unit last year. Two of its biggest investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, have pressured the company to explore a deal — including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture. Behind the deal: Fujifilm relied on Mitsubishi UFJ, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Morrison & Foerster. (It is also borrowing from Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.) Xerox took advice from Centerview Partners and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Blackstone’s $20 billion deal (including debt) for control of the company’s financial and risk division highlights the growing ambitions of private equity firms — and how they need to spend nearly $1 trillion in uninvested capital. Behind the deal Blackstone believes that the financial and risk division, which includes Thomson Reuters’s Eikon terminal service, can continue to grow. “We are excited to partner with Thomson Reuters — one of the most trusted companies in financial technology,” Martin Brand of Blackstone said in a statement. Meanwhile, Thomson Reuters gets a cash infusion as it competes against Bloomberg LP and tries to deal with customers spending less on financial data. Bloomberg pointed out that the company’s controlling Thomson family is essentially retreating to the news business. Critics’ corner • Gillian Tan writes, “Despite the $20 billion price tag, the deal seems like a bargain.” (Gadfly) • Lex writes, “Any spinoff would put paid to the Thomson family’s decade-long hopes for combining a media business with financial services.” (Lex) • The trial in Waymo’s lawsuit accusing Uber of stealing its driverless car technology is set to start today. (NYT) • The Justice Department and the S.E.C. are investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures about a software update that slowed older iPhone models, according to unidentified sources. (Bloomberg) • Google’s rivals have complained to European regulators that the search giant is still stymying competition in online shopping, despite an order to change its behavior. (WSJ) • An app that inadvertently revealed the locations of military personnel is the latest sign that we need better control over our data, writes Zeynep Tufekci, a professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina. (NYT) • SoftBank’s Vision Fund finally struck a deal to invest $300 million in Wag, the dog-walking start-up. (NYT) January has been the worst month for the virtual currency in three years, with its price down 30 percent. And it’s because of the very thing that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were supposed to be free from: central authorities and regulators. • The S.E.C. froze a $600 million initial coin offering yesterday run by AriseBank. • China has continued to clamp down on Bitcoin mining. • South Korea is still weighing legal checks on virtual currency trading. Add in Facebook’s banning of ads for digital money, and mining or trading virtual currencies has become a lot harder. But not everyone has gotten the memo: The Japanese messaging service Line has plans to open its own virtual currency exchange, while the embattled publisher of Penthouse magazine wants to promote its own adult-entertainment-focused token. As Steve Wynn faces allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct, the board of his casino empire is increasingly coming under scrutiny, too. The proxy adviser ISS has long criticized the compensation of Mr. Wynn over the years, going so far as to say that the company had an “overall corporate governance profile that ranks among the worst, not the best, of U.S. companies.” The board said that it was setting up an independent committee to look into the allegations. It will be led by Patricia Mulroy, Wynn’s only female director and a former official at Nevada’s gaming commission. Meanwhile, investigating Wynn are gaming regulators for Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau. The misconduct flyaround • Vice said that its chief digital officer, Mike Germano, would not return to the company after sexual harassment allegations against him prompted an internal investigation. (NYT) • #MeToo has put pressure on companies, especially financial firms, to disclose information on their work force diversity. (Reuters) • Hillary Clinton said that she should have fired a 2008 campaign aide after he was accused of sexual harassment.

336,"On Dec. 22, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio signed Senate Bill 164 banning doctors from performing abortions in cases in which a fetus is likely to have Down syndrome according to prenatal testing. Despite being staunchly pro-choice, I was primed to sympathize with the bill’s supporters more than ever, given my personal circumstances. I’d just moved to Ohio shortly after giving birth to my daughter in August. My husband and I are both (very differently) disabled: he, quadriplegic; me, neuroatypical (anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders). Moreover, one of his close family members has Down syndrome. Rhetorical gestures toward “protecting” the lives of disabled individuals constitute a familiar refrain in anti-abortion justifications for legislation like SB 164, with supporters claiming to combat the systemic devaluation of the lives of people with disabilities. But the reality of how this brand of legislation uses the idea of disability to gain political traction is much more complicated. The business of birth itself is often structured around the specter of disability. My husband and I had just been made privy to this via my own pregnancy and birth experience. An early ultrasound revealed our daughter’s possible congenital lung malformation; that, coupled with my own neuroatypicality, our family history of Down syndrome and my husband’s spinal cord injury, made us an eyebrow-raising trio for every clinician we encountered over the course of my prenatal care. For six months, I dutifully shuffled into Southern California business parks for twice-weekly ultrasounds, nonstress tests and countless appointments with specialists, growing ever more anxious at the looming prospect of we-didn’t-know-what. Our daughter’s potential lung problem fully resolved on its own in utero — she was born asymptomatic at birth and has been ever since — but I remained designated as “high-risk,” the pregnancy now haunted by solemnity and fear. When I gave birth, we were ushered into a postpartum room that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. We had been promised that it would be, so my husband asked whether a piece of furniture or two meant for the birth partner could be moved so that he could fit into the corner to hold the baby. The staff member looked at him as if he’d asked whether she could spoon-feed caviar to our newborn. “No furniture can be moved from the room,” she answered, her tone one of clipped finality before her determined exit. After 30 hours of labor, I was in no mood to argue (well, not rationally), but I did very nearly laugh at the absurdity of the whole thing: We could spy on a potential abnormality for months via sound waves and some goo, but we couldn’t move a chair for a father who already existed? The juxtaposition between the high-level prenatal surveillance afforded to us on the basis of a potential disability and the lack of postpartum accommodation for our own disabilities was telling; we have plenty of cultural systems in place to avoid disability, but not many to deal with it as it already is. The abortion ban in Ohio purports to be “anti-ableist,” but in many ways, it belies the same collective anxiety about disabled futures. Anti-abortion legislation and rhetoric often circulates stereotypical, infantilizing imagery about people with cognitive disabilities as innocents in need of protection from nondisabled saviors. What’s more, many of the same proponents of bills like SB 164 are simultaneously unwilling to call out attempts by Congress and the Trump administration to dismantle the Americans With Disabilities Act. This brand of anti-abortion activism is ready and willing to use disabled populations as political pawns but is not yet equipped to imagine futures in which disabled people are autonomous individuals deserving of the full span of human rights. Abortion-rights rhetoric sometimes falls into this trap, too, resorting to familiar ableist scapegoating and fearmongering tactics like calling out the “horrors” of parenting a disabled child in a misguided attempt at defending reproductive rights. Disabled lives are often presumed to matter and treated as valuable only for the furthering of the agendas of others. The continuing debate in many states over legislation like SB 164 underscores our fraught current cultural relationship to disability: a fear-based hyperfocus on prevention, eradication and tragedy, rather than a human reality that must be accommodated in the present. Programs that aim to promote independence and autonomy — such as those addressing disabled parents’ rights, education, health care, marriage rights, financial success and equal pay for equal work — often go underfunded or unnoticed, and the higher rates of vulnerability to sexual assault and molestation for both disabled children and adults often receive little attention from either side of the political aisle. Meanwhile, legislation that aims to preserve the “sanctity” of a potential disabled life is sometimes championed as disability rights activism. Our continued failure to recognize disabled lives as inherently valuable irrespective of their relationship to nondisabled ones, even as the state of Ohio plans to coerce parents into unsupported roles as caregivers, belies a lack of cohesion as to what “disability rights activism” is and who should be at its center. As is made clear by our focus on disability as a potential reality during pregnancy even as we often fail to implement even rudimentary accommodations or attempt to secure equality for existing disabled parents and children, it remains difficult for us to visualize everyday lives in which disability is fully integrated into our cultural fabric. In public dialogue, and in our cultural imagination, there is often a “before” and an “after” to life with a disability, but not a satisfactory “now.” "
337,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • In his first State of the Union address, President Trump called for Democrats’ help in addressing immigration and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure. Here’s our wrap-up of the speech Tuesday night. The president also hailed the “extraordinary success” of his administration’s first year, and stayed uncharacteristically on script. Few new policy proposals emerged. Here’s a 90-second version of the 80-minute speech, as well as an annotated transcript. And a panel of our journalists provided live commentary. • We also checked the facts behind 19 of Mr. Trump’s claims. • One of President Trump’s biggest selling points on Tuesday was the surging economy. But selling himself to the American people is tougher, as only 37 percent approve of the job he is doing, our chief White House correspondent writes. "

339,"Pretend you are the lead detective on a hit new show, “CSI: Terrible Stuff on the Internet.” In the first episode, you set up one of those crazy walls plastered with headlines and headshots, looking for hidden connections between everything awful that’s been happening online recently. There’s a lot of dark stuff. In one corner, you have the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election with digital propaganda. In another, a rash of repugnant videos on YouTube, with children being mock-abused, cartoon characters bizarrely committing suicide on the kids’ channel and a popular vlogger recording a body hanging from a tree. Then there’s tech “addiction,” the rising worry that adults and kids are getting hooked on smartphones and social networks despite our best efforts to resist the constant desire for a fix. And all over the internet, general fakery abounds — there are millions of fake followers on Twitter and Facebook, fake rehab centers being touted on Google and even fake review sites to sell you a mattress. So who is the central villain in this story, the driving force behind much of the chaos and disrepute online? This isn’t that hard. You don’t need a crazy wall to figure it out, because the force to blame has been quietly shaping the contours of life online since just about the beginning of life online: It’s the advertising business, stupid. And if you want to fix much of what ails the internet right now, the ad business would be the perfect perp to handcuff and restrain — and perhaps even reform. "
340,"In its fantastic second season, NBC’s “The Good Place” found empathy within the devil. Michael (Ted Danson), an immortal bureaucrat charged with torturing four souls in The Bad Place — a version of hell where his prisoners are meant to inflict their neuroses on one another — develops a conscience and helps them escape. While they argue their eternal cases in front of an omniscient judge (Maya Rudolph), Michael explains himself to his infernal supervisor. “I was just trying to prove that humans could be made to torture each other,” he says. “Instead, they helped each other. They were bad people. This wasn’t supposed to be possible.” People never learn, people don’t get better: These are unsurprising beliefs from a minion of hell. But they’ve also been the guiding principles of the last two decades of TV. From the dawn of “The Sopranos” through the rise of Netflix, acclaimed antihero dramas have focused on bad people getting worse or good people going bad. (In “Breaking Bad,” the concept is right in the title.) There are many delights to “The Good Place,” which ends its too-short 13-episode season Thursday: its ingenious twists, its riffs on the banality of damnation. (Hell is stocked with Hawaiian pizza and plastered with movie posters for “Pirates of the Caribbean 6: The Haunted Crow’s Nest or Something, Who Gives a Crap.”) But the most refreshing thing about “The Good Place,” in an era of artistic bleakness, is its optimism about human nature. It’s made humane and sidesplittingly entertaining television out of the notion that people — and even the occasional immortal demon — are redeemable. For a generation now, the moral journeys of TV’s best shows have mostly run in the other direction. Tony Soprano spent six seasons in therapy yet learned nothing except how to be a better criminal. The corrupt police officer Vic Mackey, in “The Shield,” rationalized his brutality as what it took to bust gang members. "
341,"The conflict between Turkey and the Kurds has escalated since Turkey started a military offensive against the Syrian Kurdish enclave of Afrin on Jan. 20. The Kurdish militia, the People’s Protection Units, which is the United States-led coalition’s top partner in the fight against the Islamic State, controls Afrin. And Turkey is a critical NATO ally. The Trump administration is floundering. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has ignored President Trump’s appeal to avoid actions that might risk conflict between Turkish and American forces and torpedo the campaign against the Islamic State. Mr. Erdogan has vowed to carry the battle further east to militia-controlled territory stretching all the way to the Iraqi border, where an estimated 2,000 American Special Operations Forces are deployed. Turkey blames Washington’s support for the People’s Protection Units for the meltdown in American-Turkish ties. Many of the militia’s top cadres are drawn from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., the armed group that has been waging a bloody campaign for self-rule inside Turkey. The State Department lists the P.K.K. as a terrorist organization but does not so designate the People’s Protection Units. Turkey insists that the P.K.K. and the militia are the same. Turkish officials believe that once the Islamic State is defeated, the People’s Protection Units will melt back into the P.K.K. and train its American weapons on Turkey. American officials retort that it was Turkey’s tolerance for — if not outright collusion with — thousands of jihadist fighters who flowed into Syria through Turkey that forced them to embrace the militia. Both arguments have merit. The truth is that Turkey’s Kurdish problem was not concocted by Western powers but is a result of decades of brutal suppression of its Kurdish population. Syria, a former Ottoman dominion, has always figured in the fight. In the early 20th century, Kurdish rebellions erupted across Anatolia and were savagely suppressed. Turkey’s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who won the Kurds’ support against Allied occupation, embarked on an unremitting campaign of assimilation. The Kurds were dismissed as “mountain Turks.” Thousands fled to Syria, then under French mandate, where Kurdish intellectuals, tribal leaders and sheikhs united around a society called Xoybun, established to liberate Kurds from Turkey’s grip. "
342,"SEOUL, South Korea — When President Trump wanted to highlight the brutality of North Korea’s government during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he pointed to a man in the audience who had traveled thousands of miles on crutches to find freedom. The story that man, Ji Seong-ho, tells of his escape is remarkable even by the standards of North Korean defectors. When Mr. Trump pointed him out, Mr. Ji jubilantly raised his crutches as television cameras captured the moment. In 1996, Mr. Ji was 13, his parents’ eldest son, living in a mining village near the city of Hoeryong in northern North Korea. The country was in the midst of a famine that would kill more than two million, by some estimates. Surviving on roots and corn stalks, Mr. Ji’s family became so weak that they spent most of the day lying on the floor, sometimes hallucinating, he said in a 2014 interview. His grandmother had died of hunger the previous year. In school, teachers were too weak to teach. Few students showed up to class. Mr. Ji said he began stealing coal from moving freight trains, to barter it for corn. “There must have been 100 of us. When the train moved out of the station at night, we came out of hiding and crawled up the cars like zombies,” Mr. Ji said. “If we missed the train, our families would have nothing to eat for a few days.” Villagers could steal the coal only between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., when the train was not guarded by armed police officers, he said. They had no flashlights. On the night of March 7, 1996, as Mr. Ji was hurling sacks of coal off a train for his sister to gather up, he fainted from hunger and exhaustion and tumbled between two cars. When he came to, he was beside the rails, the train pulling away. His left leg and arm had been cut off. His frantic sister was crying for help, even as other villagers scurried away with sacks of coal. He was carried to a local clinic, where a doctor operated on him twice, without anesthesia or a blood transfusion, he said. “I could feel my spine rattling as he sawed off the bones,” Mr. Ji said. “I could hear blood dripping into a basin underneath. The doctor kept talking to me to keep me from passing out.” After he recovered, he began going to markets and train stations on his crutches, begging and pilfering food. But he said he never thought of deserting North Korea until 2000, when he made his way illegally to China. There, he was given food in churches and saw that “animals in China were fed better than North Koreans.” A month later, when he returned home with some food for his family, the secret police caught him and beat him for 20 days, he said. “It was not the beating that really hurt me,” he said. “One of them said: ‘You cripple, begging in China before foreign cameras! You are an embarrassment for the leader and the country.’ “It was then that I realized I had no future in North Korea.” Later, he got in touch with a friend from his hometown who had made it to South Korea. He spoke to him on a cellphone that picked up Chinese signals near the border, and learned how much better conditions were in the other Korea. “They don’t beat the handicapped in the South,” he said his friend told him. “I had never seen people with Down syndrome until I came to South Korea,” Mr. Ji said. “In the North, they gather such people and keep them from public view.” In April 2006, Mr. Ji crossed the Tumen River into China one last time, nearly drowning when he lost his balance in a river swollen with snowmelt. His younger brother, who was fleeing the North with him, pulled him out. In China, the brothers split up. Mr. Ji feared he would be a burden for his younger brother on the risky and difficult journey to South Korea. “Our thinking was that at least one of us must make it to South Korea, so we can make money and bring our parents and sister out of North Korea too,” he said. Without a guide, Mr. Ji and three other defectors trekked through the jungles of Laos. They made it to Thailand, where he was told that South Korean diplomats could help him. At the South’s embassy in Bangkok, diplomats were surprised to see their first North Korean defector on crutches. They hurried him to Seoul, where the government provided him with an artificial arm and leg. ”It was all confusing, because I had never known that a society was supposed to protect its disabled,” Mr. Ji said. Mr. Ji reunited with his younger brother in South Korea, where his mother and younger sister joined him years later. But his father was caught trying to flee the North and died in prison. In Seoul, Mr. Ji studied law as an undergraduate and founded Now Action and Unity for Human Rights, an organization of North Korean defectors, young South Koreans and ethnic Koreans from the United States who campaign for human rights in the North. He frequently speaks at international conferences on North Korean human rights. He has told the story of his escape from the North, most of which could not be independently confirmed, to various journalists and rights groups. Mr. Ji says he has never thrown away the crude makeshift crutches that his father made for him. He said they symbolize “that you can achieve anything if you do not give up.” He triumphantly raised the crutches in Congress when Mr. Trump introduced him, calling his story “a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.” But Mr. Trump’s mention of Mr. Ji in his speech also raised some eyebrows, given the president’s stance on immigration and tough border enforcement. “Ok, Ji Seong-ho’s story is tragic, but wouldn’t it also make him exactly the kind of refugee Trump wants to keep out of America?” one Twitter user wrote.

343,"Reactions to Donald Trump, India’s budget, and fast skiers. Here’s your Morning Briefing:        "
344,"Gone are the days when hearing directly from the president was a special event. Now President Trump is a regular, unfiltered presence on Twitter, often before Americans have had their first cup of coffee. Still, his first State of the Union address on Tuesday prompted some of the traditional rituals: the viewing parties, the instant analyses, the debates over what the president should or should not have said. (Plenty of Democrats followed a newer tradition they deemed #SOTUBoycott and turned on Netflix instead.) Our national correspondents watched the speech to gauge the mood in competitive congressional districts in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois and Texas, where Republicans are waiting to see if a wave of Democratic enthusiasm could be enough to cost them seats in 2018. PALATINE, Ill. — Bob Schmidt, 36, glanced up from his beer just in time to see President Trump pause from his State of the Union address and heartily applaud for himself. “Ugh,” Mr. Schmidt said, turning away from the flat-screen televisions hanging over the bar. “I voted for him and he’s the joke of the country. I don’t know how, but I’m happy with him and I’m embarrassed by him at the same time.” "
345,"“This, in fact, is our new American moment,” President Trump declared in his State of the Union speech. “There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.” But which American Dream? Trump portrayed a dark and menacing world in which immigrants, who stand at the heart of the American idea, were equated with gangs, murderous criminals and “horrible people.” In his 80-minute speech, the word “woman” did not come up once. Other words or phrases never mentioned included “peace,” “human rights,” “equality,” “Europe,” “multilateral,” “civil rights” and “alliance.” The Constitution flitted onto Trump’s radar chiefly in the context of appointing his kind of judges. If there was a theme, it was the demonization of immigrants and of the rest of the world, combined with an exaltation of American might. He spoke of building a “Great Wall” on the Mexican border, but it may as well have been against the rest of humanity. Trump once again put the world on notice that the rules-based, post-1945 world order founded on alliances like NATO and American-backed multilateral organizations is one he would rather shred than bolster. Of course, the world has learned that this president’s bark is worse than his bite. Still, he keeps on barking. That is not reassuring. In perhaps his clearest signal of contempt for the views of allies, Trump announced that he had signed an executive order revoking President Barack Obama’s January 2009 order to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility. Trump’s order directs that “the United States may transport additional detainees to U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay when lawful and necessary to protect the nation.” "
346,"President Trump had promised a unifying speech, and he was true to his word, delivering a State of the Union on Tuesday night perfectly pitched to satisfy a party now thoroughly unified behind him. Buoyed by a booming economy, a becalmed international scene and a congressional majority that has obligingly placed the skids under an independent investigation it was inevitably going to dismiss anyway, the president stood at a new pinnacle of his year-old administration. It was one from which all concerned could glimpse at last a future of soaring popularity that might well see Mr. Trump through his first term, and his party through what had been looking like a dire midterm election. The sense of almost giddy relief seemed palpable in the Capitol, where Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans greeted him with sustained applause, repeatedly rose into enthusiastic standing ovations, and at the end delivered a thunderous chorus of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” that would have done any party rally proud. Mr. Trump, for his part, played at Ozymandias, complete with frown, and wrinkled lip, and the sneer of cold command. He moved around the podium snuffling, nodding, mugging, gesticulating, applauding his own words, and squinting heroically (profile turned to the left!). He bit off choice words ferociously and gestured contemptuously toward the Democrats whenever they failed to join in the applause. He took full credit for every good thing that has happened in the last year, and if he did it with less grace and more braggadocio than most, well, that is what politicians do. The economy, in the ninth year of its expansion, is good, and the Islamic State has been vanquished, for now, even if it had already been reduced to a single, besieged city in the desert. If it seems remarkable that this thrice-married serial groper, who demonstrated during the campaign that he did not understand the most basic tenets of Christianity, would shout out: “We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is ‘In God We Trust!’” — well, that’s par for the course as well, in our post-hypocrisy age. "
347,     
348,"WASHINGTON — An Amtrak train carrying Republican lawmakers to their annual policy retreat crashed into a large truck in rural Virginia on Wednesday, killing one of the truck’s passengers. Two other passengers from the truck were injured — one seriously — and taken to a hospital. Two members of the train’s crew and at least two passengers, including Representative Jason Lewis, Republican of Minnesota, were also taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The crash occurred around 11:20 a.m. about 10 miles northwest of Charlottesville. By early afternoon, the train was on its way back to Charlottesville, where buses were waiting to finish the trip. The deceased passenger was identified by the local authorities as Christopher Foley, 28, of Louisa County, Va. The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the crash. Republicans had chartered the train to carry them from Washington to the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, where the party is holding its annual policy retreat through Friday. Several lawmakers who were aboard the train estimated that more than half of the Republican members of the House and Senate, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, were on board, many with spouses. Mr. Ryan spoke by phone with President Trump to update him after the crash, White House officials said. The crash was a jarring start to an annual tradition that is intended to let lawmakers escape the noise of the Capitol for a few days to socialize and set priorities for the coming year. This year’s retreat is scheduled to include remarks by Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other members of the cabinet. Instead, lawmakers still tired from attending Tuesday night’s State of the Union address found themselves staring out the window at a violent crash scene, wondering whether anyone had been hurt as what appeared to be a large, white garbage truck lay mangled on its side. The trailer of the truck was separated from its cab during the collision and garbage was strewn in all directions around the vehicle. “It was a pretty shocking event,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who was seated in the last car of the train and had a clear view through the window. Mr. Cole was standing in the aisle at the time of impact and managed to stay on his feet, but others were knocked to the floor. Senator Bill Cassidy, a first-term Republican from Louisiana, said he was sleeping when a loud noise and jarring motion awoke him. He saw fellow lawmakers and staff members knocked over in the train’s center aisle. “I’m a physician and when you are a physician you are aware that at any moment bad things can happen,” Mr. Cassidy said in an interview later. A group including Mr. Cassidy, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and a handful of former doctors, including Representatives Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, Michael C. Burgess of Texas, Phil Roe of Tennessee, Larry Buschon of Indiana and Roger Marshall of Kansas all raced backward through the train to find an exit. Mr. Cassidy’s wife, a retired doctor, as well as a House doctor soon joined them. So did Mr. Buschon’s wife, Kathryn, an anesthesiologist; she tried unsuccessfully to intubate one of the victims. Mr. Cole watched them stream through his car one by one and argue with Amtrak personnel to let them disembark. “They were demanding, ‘Get me off this train,’” he said in an interview. “We weren’t going to stop them.” “You think of them as members of Congress, but they’re trained physicians,” he added. “They really wanted off this train.” At the crash site, Mr. Cassidy said, it was quickly clear that one of the three men who had been riding in the truck was already dead. From inside, Mr. Cole could see a tarp pulled over the man. Another was on his feet, hurt but not seriously. Mr. Cassidy said he and the others focused on a third man in serious condition. They lifted his legs to try to get blood to his head and heart. Another performed CPR. Eventually paramedics arrived to take the man to the hospital. “We worked on him for about 20 minutes, and then put him on a stretcher and carried him to the ambulance,” Mr. Flake said. Authorities did not immediately identity the truck’s passengers. The mangled truck indicated that it belonged to Time Disposal, a waste and recycling collection service that operates in the area. For lawmakers like Mr. Flake, the episode brought back memories of another still-fresh tragedy: when a lone gunman opened fire on members of the congressional baseball team last June, gravely wounding Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, members of the Capitol Police and a lobbyist. “It was all too reminiscent of the baseball shooting,” Mr. Flake said. “Similar type of feeling.” By the time the train was moving again, Mr. Cassidy said, the mood was somber. “I don’t think anybody’s gathered their thoughts as to what to do next,” he said. In a statement after the crash, the group putting on the conference said the retreat would proceed mostly as planned. The retreat would now include a moment of prayer for the victims, as well as a security briefing from the House sergeant-at-arms and the Capitol Police. "
349,"The Department of Justice on Wednesday dismissed all the remaining charges against Senator Robert Menendez, a decision that underscores how a 2016 Supreme Court ruling has significantly raised the bar for prosecutors who try to pursue corruption cases against elected officials. The motion to dismiss comes less than two weeks after prosecutors said they were intent on retrying Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and it allows him to run for re-election without having to face a second trial. The Justice Department on Wednesday cited last week’s decision by Judge William H. Walls to throw out several charges the senator had faced, including bribery counts stemming from accusations that Mr. Menendez lobbied on behalf of a wealthy Florida eye doctor in exchange for political donations. All charges against the doctor, Salomon Melgen, were also dismissed. “Given the impact of the court’s Jan. 24 order on the charges and the evidence admissible in a retrial, the United States has determined that it will not retry the defendants on the remaining charges,” said Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declining to provide any more details about the agency’s rationale. The unraveling of the case against Mr. Menendez is the latest example of how difficult it has become to win public corruption cases after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision to overturn the conviction of the former Republican governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, who had been accused of accepting luxury items, loans and vacations in exchange for helping a businessman, Jonnie R. Williams Sr. That decision drastically limited the kinds of “official acts” performed by lawmakers that can constitute bribery or corruption, with the court ruling that only specific actions could be deemed to cross a legal line. "
350,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump announced Tuesday in his State of the Union address that he had signed an executive order to keep the Guantánamo Bay wartime prison open, he ad-libbed a line that was not in his staff-vetted prepared remarks, declaring that “in many cases,” terrorism detainees who are captured in the future will now be sent there. With that, Mr. Trump signaled that he still wants to fulfill a vow he made during the 2016 presidential campaign to fill the prison back up — even though he sent no new detainees there in his first year. But the problems with Guantánamo that so far have steered his administration to other options have not changed. “This is much easier said than done,” said Robert M. Chesney, a University of Texas, Austin, law professor who worked on a detention policy task force at the Justice Department in 2009. “Nothing in the new executive order changes the various legal and policy obstacles that help explain why no one was brought there in 2017, despite his campaign pledge.” Even if one rejects the Obama administration’s arguments that it is too expensive to imprison people at the American military base in Cuba and that it is a tainted symbol that fuels anti-Americanism, Guantánamo is unattractive because of three sets of practical problems, he said. They involve the Islamic State, transfers and the military commissions trial system. Mr. Trump’s new order was largely symbolic, rescinding an already obsolete executive order that President Barack Obama signed in January 2009. In it, Mr. Obama had directed the prison shuttered within one year. His administration failed to achieve that goal, although it did winnow the number of detainees to 41 from 242. Mr. Obama also refused to send any new detainees there. Mr. Trump’s order, by contrast, stated that the government may send new detainees to Guantánamo “when lawful and necessary to protect the nation,” which was already his administration’s policy, in theory. And if any new detainees are someday sent there, the order directs that they receive periodic reviews before a parole-like board established under Mr. Obama. Finally, Mr. Trump directed Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, to consult his colleagues and then recommend a policy within 90 days about what to do with newly captured terrorism suspects — “including policies governing transfer of individuals” to Guantánamo. Mr. Mattis has been reluctant to send new detainees to Guantánamo, seeing it as an unnecessary headache for the military, according to a person familiar with administration deliberations. By contrast, other officials — including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who, while a senator, regularly voiced support for using Guantánamo, and John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, who formerly oversaw the prison as the leader of the Southern Command — are said to be more enthusiastic about trying to find a way to do so. Mr. Trump had been on the verge of signing a version of the detention order in August when Mr. Kelly became his chief of staff. One of Mr. Kelly’s first acts was to send the draft back to national security departments and agencies for further work. The direction to Mr. Mattis to reconsider detention policy grew out of that move, as well as a push late last year by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. Mr. Graham is a longtime advocate of holding terrorism detainees in military custody. He was upset after the Trump administration used the civilian criminal justice system to handle two new terrorism suspects — an apparent Islamic State sympathizer who ran over people with a truck in New York, and a man suspected of participating in the 2012 attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, who was captured in that country. Government lawyers had maintained that there was no clear legal authority to place either man in military custody because there was insufficient evidence that either was part of a group covered by Congress’s Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But Mr. Graham argued for a less restrictive interpretation that would permit such newly captured suspects to be held in military custody for a period of interrogation without defense lawyers. He met separately in December with Mr. Sessions, Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly to argue that the administration was keeping the Obama-era approach, which he saw as misguided, and was promised that the Trump team would start a policy review. Mr. Graham is also said to have proposed one alternative procedure: using Guantánamo to hold new terrorism suspects when they are captured abroad, and using the military brig in Charleston, S.C., for future terrorism suspects arrested on domestic soil. It remains unclear what policy Mr. Mattis will recommend. One problem with using Guantánamo is the legal risk that would be created by sending an Islamic State suspect there, as opposed to the Qaeda and Taliban suspects sent there years ago. It is contested whether the A.U.M.F. can be legitimately interpreted to cover the war against the Islamic State, as the government contends. Guantánamo detainees have the right to file habeas corpus lawsuits challenging their detention in court, so sending an Islamic State suspect there would give a judge an opportunity to rule against the government — jeopardizing the legal basis for the broader war effort. In theory, Congress could solve that problem by specifically authorizing the use of military force against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to throw his support behind that idea, saying, “I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists — wherever we chase them down.” (It was then that Mr. Trump ad-libbed his line that many would now go to Guantánamo.) But Congress has been debating since 2014 whether and how to enact an Islamic State-specific A.U.M.F. It has been paralyzed by a lack of consensus over whether to impose new limits on the war effort, like limiting its duration, geographic scope and extension to associated forces. Another problem with using Guantánamo is that once a detainee touches the base, it becomes difficult to get rid of the detainee later. That is because Congress made it harder for Mr. Obama to close the prison by imposing legal restrictions on transferring detainees who have been held at that base — but not other ones — to other countries. Finally, once a detainee has been held at Guantánamo, the transfer restrictions also forbid sending the detainee to the United States for a civilian trial. That eliminates a way to secure a sentence that would provide a legally stable justification to keep such a prisoner locked up for life — or a legal justification to execute him or her. The alternative is to use the military commissions trial system at Guantánamo. But that system has floundered in practice, with contested cases bogging down in years of pretrial hearings. Mr. Trump acknowledged that problem in November, explaining why he had decided to keep the New York truck attack suspect in the civilian criminal justice system. “Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantánamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, adding: “Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!” "
351,"WASHINGTON — Now back to our regularly scheduled acrimony. While a toned-down President Trump called for more bipartisanship in his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, the reality is that relations between the two parties on Capitol Hill — and between Democrats and the White House — are badly strained if not downright toxic at present. The speech seemed to do little to ease tensions and in fact may have exacerbated them. Mr. Trump will find fulfilling his stated goals on public works projects, immigration and other top initiatives very difficult given the polarized atmosphere. Deep divisions were on display in the House chamber as Democrats sat stone-faced through most of the president’s remarks — rarely rising to offer even polite applause. Republicans cheered line after line, reserving one of their loudest roars for Mr. Trump’s celebration of “our massive tax cut” — a proposal opposed by every single Democrat in the House and Senate. Mr. Trump also celebrated overturning elements of the new health care law and drove home his success at lifting federal regulations and appointing conservative judges — other areas where he is at odds with Democrats. “I have never seen a president who cares nothing about reaching out to people who did not vote for him,” said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as he exited the Capitol after what he and many other Democrats considered a divisive speech meant mainly to appease Trump backers. As the president hailed a “new American moment,” reaction to the speech reflected the same dynamic of the past year — Republicans embracing Mr. Trump as a president who will advance their agenda despite quiet concerns about his behavior, while Democrats were appalled. "
352,"WASHINGTON — Representative Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who was swept into office with the Tea Party wave of 2010 and became one of the best-known investigators on Capitol Hill, said on Wednesday that he was leaving the House. “There is a time to come and a time to go,” Mr. Gowdy wrote on Twitter. He said he did not plan to file for re-election in the coming weeks and would not seek higher office. Mr. Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor who is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has been threatening to leave elected office for years. He has told associates that he wants to be a federal judge, ideally at the appellate level. On Wednesday, he said only that he planned to return to the world of criminal justice. A person familiar with the lawmaker’s plans said that Mr. Gowdy had turned down an offer by the Trump administration to nominate him for a judgeship on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and that he planned to enter private practice in South Carolina instead. “Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,” he said in a statement. “As I look back on my career, it is the jobs that both seek and reward fairness that are most rewarding.” "
353,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. clashed publicly with President Trump for the first time on Wednesday, condemning a push by House Republicans to release a secret memo that purports to show how the bureau and the Justice Department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. “The F.B.I. was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,” the bureau said in a statement, referring to the House Intelligence Committee. “As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” The high-profile comment by the F.B.I. thrust Christopher A. Wray, the bureau’s director, into a confrontation with the president, who had abruptly fired Mr. Wray’s predecessor, James B. Comey. Mr. Wray had pleaded in recent days at the White House to keep the document private. Mr. Trump wants to see the memo released, telling people close to him that he believes it makes the case that F.B.I. and Justice Department officials acted inappropriately when they sought the highly classified warrant in October 2016 on the campaign adviser, Carter Page. Democrats, who have sided with law enforcement on the matter, made a last-minute attempt to halt the process late Wednesday night when Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Representative Devin Nunes, its Republican chairman, charging that the Republicans had made “material changes” to the memo after voting to release it on Monday and before they sent it to the White House for review. Those changes, Mr. Schiff argued, meant that the committee should halt the review process and vote on the new, altered memo — a proposition that could potentially take days. "
354,   
355,"Before last night’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump invited news correspondents to the White House, where he told them, “I would like to see the country united.” But hours later, he gave a speech meant to rally only part of the country. He complimented coal and welding in a love letter to the white working classes of Appalachia and the Midwest. By admonishing people who don’t stand for the national anthem, he reminded us that as president, he has picked fights with black N.F.L. players protesting police brutality. He repeatedly disparaged nonwhite people during his speech. Instead of unifying the country, President Trump made it clear, yet again, that he supports only white Americans — to hell with everyone else. The contrast between President Trump and President Barack Obama couldn’t be more apparent. President Obama understood that our country’s diversity was one of its greatest strengths and painted an inclusive picture of how America could move forward. “Our unique strengths as a nation — our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law,” he said in 2016, in his last State of the Union address. “These things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.” But President Trump wants to divide the country between the white Americans he prizes and their purported foes, who may lurk around any corner unless he and Congress carry out the policies he described last night: the most extreme crackdown on immigration since 1924, an expansion of our nuclear arms program, the removal of federal employees who “undermine the public trust or fail the American people” and the continued operation of the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, which as of December 2017 held 41 people who are subject to indefinite detention in violation of due process.

357,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Stephanie Clifford, the former pornographic-film actress known as Stormy Daniels, is not making life easy for the Trump administration. Just minutes after President Trump’s first State of the Union address ended Tuesday night, Ms. Clifford appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” where she did not deny — or confirm — having an affair with Mr. Trump. On Tuesday afternoon, a statement claiming to be from Stormy Daniels emerged that forcefully refuted all allegations of an affair. But on Mr. Kimmel’s show, Ms. Clifford strongly implied that she had not written that denial letter. (A lawyer for Mr. Trump had issued a separate letter signed by Ms. Daniels on Jan. 10 denying the affair. That letter was not in question here.) Mr. Kimmel pointed out that the signature on the more recent statement did not appear to match her autograph on other documents. She agreed, saying, “It does not look like my signature.” He then asked where she thought the letter had come from. “I do not know where it came from,” she said. “It came from the internet.” According to a report last month in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign team paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 to sign a nondisclosure agreement about an alleged affair. While she did not explicitly admit to Mr. Kimmel that she had signed such an agreement, she seemed to come close. At the end of the interview, Mr. Kimmel tried one more trick to coax out a definitive response. Ms. Clifford deftly deflected it. "
358,"The Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the United States is expected to bump up against its borrowing limit a month earlier than previously expected, a function of last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, which is resulting in less revenue for the Treasury Department. According to the budget office, the borrowing limit will most likely need to be raised in early March after the “extraordinary measures” to extend borrowing employed by the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are exhausted. The budget office previously projected that the debt limit would need to be raised beyond its current level of $20.5 trillion in late March or early April. The reason for the change stems from the tax cuts, which went into effect in January and are expected to translate into less revenue for the federal government. The Internal Revenue Service released new withholding tables this month to reflect the new, lower tax rates, which will result in companies withholding less money from worker paychecks. Beginning in February, the government is expected to see $10 billion to $15 billion less tax revenue each month. The Trump administration has said that faster economic growth spurred by the tax cuts will eventually allow the cuts to pay for themselves. Mr. Mnuchin has acknowledged that the additional revenues will be backloaded over the 10-year budget window and that he does not expect to see an increase in government revenues this year. On Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin called on Congress to lift the debt limit by the end of February in order for the United States to borrow more money to pay its bills. He said that the trajectory of the national debt was something that concerns President Trump but dismissed suggestions by Democrats that the tax cut was only worsening the fiscal situation, saying that if economic growth can be sustained at an annual rate of 3 percent, the tax cuts will pay for themselves. (Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, expects growth in the first three months of 2018 to fall to 2.3 percent.) "

360,"It has been one year and 28 days since my last tweet. I deactivated my account shortly after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted, “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won’t happen!” on Jan. 2, 2017. The tweet struck me as an unsettling portent of how Trump’s presidency was likely to unfold: rash, petty, ostentatiously uninformed, with no regard for public safety or the mechanics of governance. The internet makes neighbors of us all, and my conscience demanded I put some virtual real estate between myself and the befuddled, racist mobster seemingly determined to dismantle and loot the republic. If seeding nuclear war wasn’t a violation of Twitter’s terms of service, then Twitter wasn’t a service I wanted to endorse. Exactly one year later, on Jan. 2, 2018, President Trump tweeted, “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” How exquisite it would have been to be wrong. Trump essentially daring Kim Jong-un (just a hop, a skip, and a Pacific away from my house in Seattle) to prove his nuclear capabilities is what finally pushed me over the edge, but the cliff itself was built of years of accumulated grievances with Twitter’s culture of harassment and its leadership’s torpid failure to fix it. When you work in media, Twitter becomes part of your job. It’s where you orient yourself in “the discourse” — figure out what’s going on, what people are saying about it and, more important, what no one has said yet. In a lucky coup for Twitter’s marketing team, prevailing wisdom among media types has long held that quitting the platform could be a career killer. The illusion that Twitter visibility and professional relevance are indisputably inextricable always felt too risky to puncture. Who could afford to call that bluff and be wrong? So, we stayed, while Twitter’s endemic racist, sexist and transphobic harassment problems grew increasingly more sophisticated and organized. Those of us who complained about online abuse were consistently told — by colleagues, armchair experts and random internet strangers — that we were the problem. We were too soft. We, who literally inured ourselves to rape threats and death threats so that we could participate in public life, were called weak by people who felt persecuted by the existence of female Ghostbusters. Meanwhile, Twitter’s leadership offered us the ability to embed GIFs. "
361,"Teachers across the country will soon be able to train for an active shooter on school grounds using a computer simulation that includes realistic details like gunfire, shattered glass and the screams of children. This vivid and realistic digital simulation was created by the federal government. It was modeled after a real school and includes 20 classrooms, a library, a cafeteria and a gymnasium with blue-padded walls. To depict the chaos of a school shooting, the software developers studied audio dispatches from the mass killings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. “It is a very traumatic, very panicky situation,” said John Verrico, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which funded the $5.6 million program. “We tried to make the environment just that disturbing.” Since the attack on Columbine High School in 1999, mitigating the damage of on-campus shootings has been an increasingly urgent priority. More than two-thirds of public schools nationwide practiced their response to a shooting in the 2013-14 academic year, according to the Department of Education; 10 years earlier, fewer than half of schools did so. Lockdown drills are now commonplace, and if safely escaping is not possible, teachers are advised to protect students by shutting off the lights, barricading doors and silencing cellphones. "
362,"In the 200 years since Mary Shelley wrote “Frankenstein,” her monster has turned up in countless variations — but few of them have been as wild or politically pointed as the monster in Ahmed Saadawi’s “Frankenstein in Baghdad,” which leads our list of recommended titles this week. It’s not the only fiction with politics on its mind: You’ll find a pair of satirical Chinese novellas, a symphonic look at Germany’s fraught history and, in Leni Zumas’s “Red Clocks,” a dystopian vision of American patriarchy. In nonfiction, we have Thomas Jefferson’s daughters and Donald Trump’s erosion of democratic norms, along with the battle for civil rights, the experience of immigrant high schoolers, and memoirs about bird-watching and bipolar disorder. And yes, we know that Frankenstein was actually the name of the doctor. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books FRANKENSTEIN IN BAGHDAD, by Ahmed Saadawi. (Penguin, paper, $16.) In Saadawi’s intense and surreal novel, an Iraqi junk peddler named Hadi starts to bring home the body parts of bomb victims, stitching them together in the hope that if he can create a whole corpse someone will give it a proper burial. The ensuing hallucinatory story is “funny and horrifying in a near-perfect admixture,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. Saadawi has “written a complex allegory for the tribal cruelties in Iraq in the wake of the American invasion.” WHEN THEY CALL YOU A TERRORIST: A Black Lives Matter Memoir, by Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Asha Bandele. (St. Martin’s, $24.99.) Khan-Cullors, an activist and a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, wrote this memoir with the journalist Bandele. Khan-Cullors grew up poor in Los Angeles, and attended a gifted program in a middle school in Sherman Oaks, a nearby affluent neighborhood. “There’s a persistent longing that threads through this book,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, “not so much for the consumerist dream represented by Sherman Oaks, but for the secure relationships she saw her wealthy, white classmates taking for granted.” A MORE BEAUTIFUL AND TERRIBLE HISTORY: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History, by Jeanne Theoharis. (Beacon, $27.95.) This history revisits the hostile reception that greeted civil rights activists half a century ago. It’s particularly attuned to how the legacies of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. have been co-opted into a narrative of uplift, with civil rights history sanitized for public consumption. “At bewildering moments like this one,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, “it’s clarifying to read a history that shows us how little we remember, and how much more there is to understand.” RED CLOCKS, by Leni Zumas. (Little, Brown, $26.) This highly absorbing novel imagines a near future of America in which abortion is illegal in all 50 states. Zumas has a perfectly tuned ear for the way society relies on a moralizing sentimentalism to restrict women’s lives and enforce conformity. “I doubt any reader will need to suspend disbelief for even a moment,” Naomi Alderman writes in her review. HERE IN BERLIN, by Cristina García. (Counterpoint, $26.) In a series of short quasi-fictional encounters, the Cuban-American novelist uses a chorus of voices to explore the long, ghostly reach of Germany’s history, in which the remembered or purposefully forgotten past seems as alive as the present. “We can none of us ever get entirely free of our ghosts, either personal or national,” our reviewer Wendy Lesser writes, “and Berlin, with its peculiar history of destruction and division, seems designed to bring that realization to the fore.” THE NEWCOMERS: Finding Refuge, Friendship, and Hope in an American Classroom, by Helen Thorpe. (Scribner, $28.) Thorpe spent a year with teenage refugees in a Denver school’s “newcomer class,” documenting their lives as the presidential campaign stirred up nativist resentment. Partly a story of assimilation, it also details the author’s own growing awareness of other cultures. Reviewing it, Nina Burleigh describes the book as “a delicate and heartbreaking mystery story, as Thorpe slowly uncovers the secret catastrophes in the lives of young immigrants” who “arrive mute, and … gradually gain the words and confidence to describe the journeys that led to the classroom.” TRUMPOCRACY: The Corruption of the American Republic, by David Frum. (HarperCollins, $25.99.) Frum argues that the Trump presidency is not only about Donald Trump but also about the deeper structural problems of America in general, and conservative America in particular. He thinks that what the country faces is nothing less than a threat to the democratic order. “The thing to fear from the Trump presidency is not the bold overthrow of the Constitution,” Frum writes, “but the stealthy paralysis of governance; not the open defiance of law, but an accumulating subversion of norms; not the deployment of state power to intimidate dissidents, but the incitement of private violence to radicalize supporters.” THE YEARS, MONTHS, DAYS, by Yan Lianke. Translated by Carlos Rojas. (Black Cat, paper, $16.) A pair of novellas in which the noted Chinese novelist (and frequent target of government censorship) paints a darkly satirical portrait of characters adrift in a depraved society. “His books read like the brutal folklore history couldn’t bear to remember,” Jamie Fisher writes in her review, “and his characters feel stranded, forgotten by time.” BIRDING WITHOUT BORDERS: An Obsession, a Quest and the Biggest Year in the World, by Noah Strycker. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $27.) Follow one young birder as he spends an entire year traveling the world to see as many species of birds as he can — a number that ends up being a record-breaking 6,042. Our reviewer, the ornithologist Richard O. Prum, says Strycker’s memoir is “lighthearted and filled with stories of exotic birds, risky adventures and colorful birding companions. You don’t get deep insights into why Strycker did this, but you get the sense that he would be fun to bird with.” JEFFERSON’S DAUGHTERS: Three Sisters, White and Black, in a Young America, by Catherine Kerrison. (Ballantine, $28.) Kerrison follows the lives of the third president’s three daughters, including Harriet Hemings, born to his slave Sally Hemings. Our reviewer Mary Beth Norton calls the result “a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha’s and Maria’s experiences with imaginative attempts to … reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet’s life in slavery and freedom.” GORILLA AND THE BIRD: A Memoir of Madness and a Mother’s Love, by Zack McDermott. (Little, Brown, $27.) McDermott spent years battling bipolar disorder with the support of his Midwestern mother, who didn’t quit even when he was in a psych ward. As powerful as that story is, though, the real appeal of his memoir lies in “the sheer, sharp pleasure of his prose,” as Marya Hornbacher writes in her review, and in the book’s generous range: “a tragicomic gem about family, class, race, justice and the spectacular weirdness of Wichita, Kan.” "

364,"WASHINGTON — Ahead of his first trip as secretary of state to South America, Rex W. Tillerson warned countries in the Western Hemisphere on Thursday about the dangers of the region’s growing trade with China and Russia. “China’s offer always comes at a price,” Mr. Tillerson said in a speech at the University of Texas, Austin, where he was once a student. “Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people.” In wide-ranging remarks, Mr. Tillerson also pledged more help in Mexico’s fight against drug cartels and Colombia’s peace initiative and efforts to cut back on coca production. He also called on both Cuba and Venezuela to embrace democracy, and said that updating the North American Free Trade Agreement and striking other trade deals were a priority. But his most pointed remarks came in his warning against Russian military sales and trade with China, which has displaced the United States as the largest trading partner for Chile, Argentina, Peru and Brazil. “Our region must be diligent to guard against faraway powers,” he said in an echo of what Chinese officials say about the United States in Asia. Left unsaid, though, was that the Trump administration has pulled back from trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is intended to serve as a check on China. The Chinese have been eager to fill the vacuums left by the United States on the world stage. Later Thursday, Nikki R. Haley, the United States’ ambassador to the United Nations, was also deeply critical of Russia, saying, “Russia is not our friend.” She touted what she said was the Trump administration’s hard line against Russia, pointing to expanded sanctions and to the decision to send weapons to Ukraine. “In the last year, this administration has been tougher on Russia than any American administration since Ronald Reagan,” she said. Mr. Tillerson delivered his speech exactly one year after he was confirmed as secretary of state. It was the most confident of his tenure, as he easily fielded students’ questions with great detail and without notes. Stories have receded about Mr. Tillerson’s troubled relationship with President Trump and of his own imminent departure, a narrative supplied privately by critics in the White House. Indeed, Mr. Tillerson is widely expected to remain in his post at least through the summer, and his relationship with Mr. Trump appears to have stabilized. Asked in December whether he was enjoying his job, Mr. Tillerson gave a tight smile and offered: “I’m learning to enjoy it.” He has also been learning to build enjoyable details into his packed travel schedule. On Friday morning, Mr. Tillerson is expected to tour the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City. He will then fly to Nahuel Huapi National Park in Bariloche, Argentina, a vast wilderness on the northern edge of Patagonia, where he plans to ascend an Andean summit on horseback. In a briefing for reporters, a senior State Department official said the trip to Bariloche was meant to highlight scientific and research exchanges between the two countries. Unmentioned was how much Mr. Tillerson likes horseback riding. But back at the State Department, morale remains troubled amid serious cutbacks, a grinding reorganization and an exodus of senior diplomats that continued on Thursday. Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the under secretary of state for political affairs, announced his resignation as the department’s third-highest ranking official. He will serve until his successor is confirmed by the Senate, according to Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, a process that is likely to take months. The timing of Mr. Shannon’s announcement was driven by his promise to stay through Mr. Tillerson’s first year, said Steve Goldstein, the department’s under secretary for public affairs. Mr. Goldstein said Mr. Shannon had been hoping to spend more time with his father, following his mother’s death late last year. In a statement, Mr. Tillerson praised Mr. Shannon’s “devotion to service that has and shall continue to inspire State Department colleagues.” John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, released a statement saying the “nation owes him a debt of gratitude.” Of the five “career ambassadors,” the department’s highest rank, who were in place in January 2017, only one will remain after Mr. Shannon departs. Scores of others who held ranks just beneath Mr. Shannon’s have left. Mr. Shannon was unusual in that he seemed to thrive during Mr. Tillerson’s first year. In the administration’s first months, Mr. Tillerson often decided against attending formal functions at the White House and sent Mr. Shannon to serve in his place. When Mr. Trump met with the leaders of Japan, Britain and Canada, Mr. Shannon was by the president’s side. But within the department, Mr. Shannon was widely rumored to be unhappy with Mr. Tillerson’s decisions to ignore many of the department’s top experts, as well as his failure to identify a cadre of senior leaders or fill vacancies in a large number of ambassadorships. It was often Mr. Shannon who delivered the news to senior diplomats that they were being pushed out of their jobs or would not get the postings they had been promised. "

366,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The resignation of the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only adds to a list of Trump administration scandals that has already become terribly long. This newsletter first published a list of those scandals last year, and my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick and I have updated it to include a few new entries from this week. “There have been 4 new stories about Trump administration self-dealing in the last day alone,” Jonathan Chait of New York magazine tweeted yesterday. (Chait’s story is here.) The C.D.C. director, Brenda Fitzgerald, quit after a damning exposé by Politico’s Sarah Karlin-Smith and Brianna Ehley. They reported that Fitzgerald had purchased shares in a tobacco company after taking charge of the agency that discourages smoking. Other revelations include conflicts of interest involving Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development (via The Washington Post); the Trump family real-estate business (via The Palm Beach Post); and Trump’s infrastructure advisers (via Democracy Forward Foundation). Even apart from the Russia story — be sure to read the latest Times scoop on Russia if you haven’t yet — this administration is more scandal-plagued than any other in memory. "

369,"At 8:30 a.m. on Friday, dozens of economics journalists will simultaneously flood the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for a monthly ritual known officially as the Employment Situation and informally as “jobs day.” The monthly employment report is almost certainly the single most-watched of the government’s economic indicators. It’s where we learn how many jobs employers added the previous month, as well as what happened to the unemployment rate, hourly earnings and dozens of other measures of the labor market’s health. The report can move markets, influence monetary policy and set off political ripples — especially if President Trump, as he often does, weighs in on Twitter. Jobs day has also become something of a monthly club meeting for economics nerds, complete with its own clubhouse (Twitter) and secret language: “beats” and “misses,” U-3 and U-6 (two different measures of unemployment), and an alphabet soup of obscure acronyms and abbreviations. Reporters, economists and policy wonks race to post charts; call out interesting tidbits; and, inevitably, argue about how to interpret the latest batch of data. I’ve participated in this frenzy nearly every month since 2011. I have covered job reports for The Wall Street Journal, for the data journalism site FiveThirtyEight and now for The Times. When jobs day happened to fall during my two-week break between news outlets last year, I couldn’t stay away — I covered the report on my personal Twitter account. (You think that’s bad? A colleague at The Upshot, Neil Irwin, did the same while on his honeymoon.) No matter the venue, the mission is the same: to distill the data to its essential themes as quickly as possible. The trouble is, the report doesn’t always make that easy. To understand why, it helps to know a bit about the jobs report. For one thing, it’s really two reports stitched together. One, based on a survey of employers, provides information on jobs: how many were created (or eliminated) the previous month and how much those jobs pay. The other, based on a survey of households, focuses on individuals: how many are working or not working, along with information on their age, race, education and other characteristics. "
370,"WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — President Trump turned up the pressure on Democrats on Thursday to come to an agreement with Republicans on protections for young undocumented immigrants, asserting that opposition leaders “talk a good game” but cared more about politics than actually resolving the matter. In a speech to Republican lawmakers at their annual retreat, Mr. Trump complained that Democrats were unwilling to budge and would rather see him fail than make progress on immigration or other issues that would benefit the country. At the same time, he warned his fellow Republicans that they would have to make compromises themselves to reach a deal. “They talk a good game with DACA, but they don’t produce,” Mr. Trump said of Democrats, referring to the Obama-era policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that he has ordered canceled. “Either they come on board or we’re just going to have to really work” to elect more Republicans in the midterm congressional elections in the fall. Mr. Trump moved in September to end the DACA program, which grants work permits to immigrants brought to the country illegally as children and protects them from deportation, on the grounds that President Barack Obama exceeded his authority by creating it through executive action. But Mr. Trump has expressed support for protecting those immigrants, known as Dreamers, through legislation if Congress can agree. He gave lawmakers until March 5 to take action, though his cancellation of the program is now tied up in the court system. The president’s comments on Thursday in his speech at the retreat, held at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, came hours after he denounced Democrats on Twitter for “doing nothing about DACA.” "

What’s happening: Ms. Johnson, who’s currently the home-rental company’s chief business affairs and legal officer, will become its chief operating officer. Meanwhile, Mr. Tosi, who had been Airbnb’s chief financial officer since coming over from Blackstone, will leave the company to focus on his investment fund. Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company’s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis. Between the lines • Ms. Johnson had been a rising star at Airbnb, often compared to Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg as the company’s business-minded grown-up in the room. • Mr. Tosi had been increasingly at odds with Airbnb’s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, over strategy. (The Information covered their disputes — which were over both strategy and tactics — in great detail.) The context Airbnb is heading ever so slowly toward an initial public offering. It hired Ken Chenault as its first outside director, for example, and promoting its most successful business mind to C.O.O. is another step in that direction. Still losing its C.F.O. — particularly one well versed in Wall Street — could set those plans back a bit. The company line Here’s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson: And here’s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies: And here’s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi: — Michael J. de la Merced Some of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook. Facebook’s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe. The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook’s future growth. The company’s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada. Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe’s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States’, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower. All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada. What does this mean for Facebook as European countries introduce measures aimed at protecting their citizens that may go beyond what the company is used to in the United States? Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe’s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook’s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond. — Peter Eavis Its price on Thursday: $8,915 Its all-time high hit on Dec. 18: $19,511. That’s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin’s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg. The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday. Regulators are increasingly worried that Bitfinex, a widely used (and famously opaque) exchange, has been propping it up.

(CNBC) The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, is reporting that Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and Google’s parent, Alphabet, are in talks to build a tech hub within the kingdom. Details, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point. The context Saudi Arabia is seeking to diversify its economy away from oil, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has made developing Saudi Arabia’s tech sector a key part of his “Vision 2030” plan. In late 2016, he traveled to Silicon Valley to promote those reforms, and the kingdom has taken bigger steps in recent years into the tech investing world. That year Saudi Arabia poured $3.5 billion into Uber, and its Public Investment Fund put $45 billion into SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, which is making eye-popping investments in tech companies. An interesting point, from the WSJ article: It isn’t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company — and therefore command a higher multiple — but it’d be interesting to see bankers make that argument. — Stephen Grocer The former G.E. chairman and C.E.O. will focus on tech and health care companies in his new role as a partner at N.E.A., one of the biggest V.C. firms in the world (that isn’t named SoftBank).

Mr. Immelt is only the latest corporate chieftain to find his next act in venture capital. Earlier this week, Ken Chenault announced that he would become chairman of General Catalyst Partners. Mr. Immelt himself famously dallied with Silicon Valley last year, when he was in the running to become Uber’s next C.E.O. — Michael J. de la Merced The good news: Its fourth-quarter earnings handily beat expectations. The average price per ad went up 43 percent.

Schmidt, who has been covering the Russia investigation for The New York Times. Background reading: • The F.B.I. has condemned a push by House Republicans to release a secret memo that purports to show how the bureau and the Justice Department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. • As a matter of political reality, the memo has everything to do with defending President Trump from Mr. Mueller’s investigation.

373,"TEL AVIV — When Vice President Mike Pence spoke to the Knesset on Jan. 22, legislators who oppose a two-state solution sent a clear signal that they have taken President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital as a green light to proceed with initiatives to annex portions of the West Bank. The signal came in two parts: As Mr. Pence reiterated America’s commitment to Israeli-Palestinian peace, every member of the governing right-wing coalition stayed silent while opposition legislators rose to applaud. More stunningly, the Knesset’s speaker, Yuli Edelstein, declared that Israel will “develop the whole of the country, including Judea and Samaria,” referring to the biblical names for the entire West Bank. But none of the legislative initiatives toward that goal addresses the implications for Israel’s security that would come with them. That is a potentially fatal lapse, because what now seems to be under serious consideration would have disastrous consequences for Israel’s security and would undermine American interests throughout the Middle East. It is no accident that none of the proposals suggests annexing the entire West Bank. Even the most zealous legislators realize that absorbing all of the West Bank’s 2.7 million Palestinians would threaten Israel’s existence as a Jewish and democratic state. Consequently, those seeking to block prospects for separation from the Palestinians into two states look for a “luxurious annexation”: absorb as much of the land, with as little of the population, as possible. Competing proposals put forward by the end of January included annexing all Jewish settlements in the West Bank without touching areas populated by Palestinians. Another would annex the Gush Etzion and Ariel settlement blocs plus the Jordan Valley. Yet another would create a region called “Greater Jerusalem.” "
374,"President Trump’s immigration proposal has put Democrats in a bind; they know it and he knows it. Trump’s immigration “framework” — first outlined on Jan. 25 — represents an unusually sophisticated strategy. He proposes to more than double the number of Dreamers granted a path to citizenship, a significant concession to Democrats. In return, he seeks approval of a set of policies strongly opposed by the left, each of which is designed to stem what Trump sees as a threatening increase in the nonwhite population of the United States. What kind of numbers are we talking about? According to the Pew Research Center: There are now an estimated 690,000 registered Dreamers in the United States, all of whom were brought to this country as children before 2007. Trump’s offer would increase the number offered a path to citizenship to 1.8 million by adding those who are eligible for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), but who never registered. For a Democratic Party whose electoral strength depends on Hispanic support (64 percent of Latinos identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party in 2016) preventing the deportation of the Dreamers and providing them with legal status has become a matter of political necessity. Trump, acutely aware of the importance of DACA to Democrats, deliberately turned the status of Dreamers into a crisis on Sept. 5 when he ended the Dreamers program. Since then, DACA has been the subject of constant debate and negotiation. Democrats have continued to threaten to shut down the government, when the Treasury runs out of money on Feb. 8, if no favorable agreement can be reached. "
375,"Late last year, Tom Nichols, a professor at the Naval War College and a NeverTrump conservative, proposed a little thought experiment for Republicans skeptical of Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s Russia ties. “Let’s play Alternate Universe,” he wrote on Twitter. “It’s 2017, and President Hillary Clinton is facing charges that Chelsea met with Russians who offered oppo on Trump. Chelsea didn’t call the FBI; and Clinton nat sec adviser Jake Sullivan lied to the FBI about talking to the Russians.” Nichols laid out the unfolding drama over a series of tweets. President Clinton fires the F.B.I. director after he declines her request to “let it go” on Sullivan. “Then, at least three other Clinton campaign officials end up indicted. All of them are tied in some way to a hostile foreign power.” Later, she threatens to “yank FOX’s license” because she didn’t like its critical coverage. “I’m sure … totally sure …” Nichols added with no little irony, “that stalwarts of the G.O.P. would say: Look, this is a nothingburger, you can’t define ‘collusion,’ it’s just ‘the coffee boy,’ and on and on.” I’m reminded of Nichols’ astute tweets as the Republican campaign against the Russia investigation kicked into higher gear this week. At the State of the Union on Tuesday night, Trump was overheard telling Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, that he was “100 percent” committed to releasing House Committee Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes’s secret memo on the Russia investigation, over fierce F.B.I. objections regarding “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” "
376,"Diplomacy and politics may go hand in hand, but their partnership isn’t one of equals. It is logical — especially in a democracy — for a country’s diplomacy to serve its political leaders. Sometimes, however, smart leaders allow diplomacy to influence politics. For that influence to be truly worthwhile, governments around the world must solve an acute problem: Global diplomacy today is not very effective, in part because it is misunderstood and starved of resources. The best diplomacy carries out foreign policy professionally, yet most countries let amateurs practice it. I’m talking about appointees who receive diplomatic posts thanks only to political connections. To resolve at least some of the many conflicts, disputes and other problems around the world, governments must start building or strengthening professional diplomatic services, providing them with proper training and career development, and giving them all the tools, resources and authority necessary to get the job done. Few countries come close to this standard today. No one is born with the ability to practice international diplomacy — to manage a country’s relations with other states, understand and engage foreign societies, influence governments and publics, conduct difficult and consequential negotiations, anticipate threats and take advantage of opportunities. These are skills that have to be acquired. The mantra among career diplomats has long held that on-the-job training — not lessons in a classroom — is the only way to learn how to practice diplomacy. As a result, many countries’ official representatives don’t get anything that resembles proper training before they are posted abroad. They are left to figure things out as they go along, taking months or even years to get a decent grasp of what exactly their job entails. Some governments have outsourced a big part of diplomats’ work to lobbyists and consultants. Many embassies in Washington use the costly services of public relations firms to do their bidding. At the same time, some of their own employees arrive with barely any knowledge about how Washington works and how to navigate the government bureaucracy. Another recent trend — no doubt following an example of a regrettable American practice — has been to increase political appointments in ambassadorial and other diplomatic posts. "
377,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s re-election campaign raised $15.2 million in the last three months of last year, and spent $1.2 million on legal fees — with much of the cash going to law firms responding to investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election — according to campaign finance reports. The reports, filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday evening, indicate that Mr. Trump’s campaign and two fund-raising committees it formed with the Republican National Committee — Trump Victory and Trump Make America Great Again — entered this year with $32.3 million in the bank. That is an unusually large nest egg for a president at this point in a first term, reflecting an earlier and more aggressive start to re-election fund-raising that began almost immediately after Mr. Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in a campaign in which she drastically outspent him. Mr. Trump and his team seem determined not to repeat that. They have worked to woo major donors of the sort who were slow to embrace Mr. Trump — paying to host fund-raising events at upscale venues like his hotel here. One of the joint committees paid $7,000 last month for catering and facility rental at Wynn Las Vegas, the casino hotel founded by Stephen Wynn, who had served as the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee until stepping down last week after being accused of a yearslong pattern of sexual misconduct. The top donor to Mr. Trump was the New York private equity executive Stephen A. Schwarzman, who gave $344,000 to Trump Victory. The Dallas oil heir Al G. Hill Jr. donated $200,000 in October, before dying in December at 72. A considerable portion of the money raised in the fourth quarter, more than $4 million, came from supporters who gave $200 or less. "
378,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The F.B.I. clashes with President Trump, Africa’s first bobsled team prepares for the Olympics and “House of Cards” returns. Here’s the news: • In Washington, the F.B.I. clashed publicly with President Trump for the first time over Republican efforts to release a secret memo that purports to show surveillance abuses. The aim of the memo, our Washington correspondent writes, is defending Mr. Trump from the Russia inquiry. Meanwhile, we learned that a White House statement last summer about a pre-election Trump Tower meeting with Russians has drawn the interest of investigators. (Above, Mr. Trump with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, center, and the director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray.) Our correspondents gauged the reaction to Mr. Trump’s first State of the Union address among a wide spectrum of Americans. One viewer put it this way: “I’m happy with him and I’m embarrassed by him at the same time.” "
379,"On Tuesday evening, Arsenal suffered another one of those indignities that tend to pockmark its seasons. This time, the humiliation came in the driving rain of South Wales and at the hands of Swansea City: facing a team at the bottom of the Premier League table, Arsenal dominated the game, monopolized possession and then went and lost anyway, 3-1. For Arsenal’s fans, these defeats have become wearily familiar in the last decade or so, as Arsène Wenger’s two-decade reign at the club has drifted into a sort of managed decline. They have turned Arsenal into a place hard-wired to treat every disappointment as an existential crisis. The reaction, now, is so habitual that it is almost comforting, one of the few fixed points in soccer’s ever-changing landscape. There are the calls for Wenger to abandon — or be relieved of — his post with immediate effect. There are the videos, drawn from Arsenal’s compelling YouTube fan channels, of despair and rage, going viral. There are the fuming calls to phone-in programs, the cascade of former players bemoaning a great institution on its knees. Occasionally, when things get really bad, there are light aircraft. Tuesday should have been a classic of the genre. Losing at Swansea in any circumstance, for a club of Arsenal’s ambition, would be a setback. Given that Arsenal has now won only three of its last 11 Premier League games, and that it sits 8 points behind Chelsea for the fourth, and final, Champions League spot for next season — the bare minimum requirement for a passable campaign, by Wenger’s own estimation — this defeat qualified as indicative of a deep-rooted problem. And yet, by Wednesday morning, none of it had materialized. There were no grumblings of mutiny, no furious videos racking up the retweets, no flood of thinkpieces about where it has all gone wrong, no rending of garments or gnashing of teeth. "
380,"Can private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It’s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House. There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success — a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school — there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be. But companies haven’t stopped trying. Just this past week, the ambitions reached new heights when three of today’s most successful business leaders said they would form an independent company aimed at lowering the burden that health care places on the economy while improving the system for their employees. In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves. “The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.” Joining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care? "
381,"To the Editor: Re “The Decline of Anti-Trumpism” (column, Jan. 9): While I agree with David Brooks that it is not helpful for the anti-Trump movement to become consumed with some of the same misguided standards of many of the president’s apologists, I think that it is important to consider why Republicans are choosing to simply look the other way, or worse, lavish him with the acclaim that he so clearly relishes. One of the most lasting memories of those old enough to have lived through Watergate is of patriots like Howard Baker and John Dean who risked their political careers by speaking publicly about unacceptable threats to our democracy by President Richard M. Nixon. They chose allegiance to the Constitution and the country over obsequious actions like those of Senator Lindsey Graham and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Brooks would do better by focusing on what powerful leaders can do to stand up for and help preserve our democracy rather than lamenting the excesses of those who have adopted the same “lowbrowism” that is found both in Trump supporters and opponents.

BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N.Y. "
382,"It’s hard to come away from the State of the Union address without a heightened sense of foreboding about President Trump’s intentions toward North Korea. The signs increasingly point to unilateral American military action. To which we say: Don’t. The references to North Korea in the address were worrying enough. Mr. Trump called the country’s leadership “depraved.” He trumpeted his “campaign of maximum pressure” to ensure that the North does not succeed in perfecting a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the continental United States. He asserted that “past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.” He pledged, “I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.” Mr. Trump seemed to be building a case for war on emotional grounds, invoking the case of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who died last year after being detained by North Korea. “Tonight we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with total American resolve,” the president said. The Warmbier family was among the president’s guests in the gallery. To an extent, such words were in line with his history of bellicosity toward North Korea, whose nuclear program and brutal regime are indeed grave threats and demand an effective response. Last year he threatened to answer North Korean provocations with fire and fury “the likes of which this world has never seen before.” What made Mr. Trump’s latest comments most alarming was the context. They were delivered as South Korean efforts to dial down the tension with the North, through dialogue and joint participation in the Winter Olympics, appeared to be bearing fruit. And they came just after it was reported that the administration had abandoned a long-delayed plan to nominate a prominent Korea scholar, Victor Cha, as its ambassador to Seoul. Mr. Cha, a senior Asia adviser in the George W. Bush administration and now a Georgetown University professor, has the credentials and experience often lacking in administration nominees. He completed the vetting process required of potential senior government officials, and South Korea had agreed to his appointment. "

385,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Samantha Bee continues to speak out against workplace harassment, and on Wednesday’s “Full Frontal” she focused on so-called forced arbitration clauses, which often serve to silence women when they accuse co-workers of misconduct. Bee sat down with the former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who sued Roger Ailes in 2016 for sexual harassment and is now pushing Congress to pass legislation limiting the use of forced arbitration. Bee admitted to making fun of Carlson “for 12 straight years at my previous gig” — “The Daily Show” — but she said fighting workplace harassment should be a bipartisan effort. The other late-night shows focused on President Trump’s State of the Union address, and each host seemed to have his own particular beef with it. Some were skeptical of the president’s appeals to bipartisanship. Bee took issue with the way the president addressed the debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that protects from deportation young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. “My duty — and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber — is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities and their right to the American dream,” he said. “Because Americans are Dreamers, too.” “Oh my God, what a beautiful, proud, thoughtful way to say that you will only help white people,” Bee responded. On “The Daily Show,” Roy Wood Jr. offered a response to the State of the Union, specifically for the black community. Stephen Colbert interviewed “Melania Trump” about the state of her union with the president. Lupita Nyong’o, who stars in the new film “Black Panther,” will talk to Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday. A. O. Scott, our chief film critic, has watched every movie Woody Allen has made.

387,"CAIRO — When it comes to securing a second term in power, Egypt’s president is leaving little to chance. Potential rivals in the March election have been sidelined, jailed or threatened with prosecution. The news media is largely in his pocket. On polling day, Egyptians will have a choice between President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and one of his most ardent supporters — an obscure politician drafted at the 11th hour to avoid the embarrassment of a one-horse race. As he cruises toward victory, Mr. Sisi need not worry either about foreign censure: President Trump has hailed the Egyptian leader as a “fantastic guy,” and most other Western leaders have been largely silent. Across the world, autocratic leaders are engaging in increasingly brazen behavior — rigging votes, muzzling the press and persecuting opponents — as they dispense with even a fig leaf of democratic practice once offered to placate the United States or gain international legitimacy. The global tide is driven by a bewildering range of factors, including the surge of populism in Europe, waves of migration, and economic inequality. And leaders of countries like Egypt, which had long been sensitive to Washington’s influence, know they run little risk of rebuke from an American president who has largely abandoned the promotion of human rights and democracy in favor of his narrow “America First” agenda. In Cambodia, Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled the country for 33 years, has led a sweeping crackdown on opponents before elections this summer. In November, Mr. Trump flashed a big thumbs-up as he posed for a photo with Mr. Hun Sen, who later praised the American president for what he called his lack of interest in human rights. "
388,"MANBIJ, Syria — The front line between rival American-backed and Turkish-backed militias in northern Syria, just eight miles north of Manbij, snakes over mostly barren hillsides and through newly planted olive orchards. It consists of many miles of bulldozed earthworks, with fortified bunkers every few hundred yards. This is the line, along the Sajur River valley, that Turkish forces would have to cross if ordered to carry out President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s threat to extinguish Kurdish control in northern Syria, and it is also the line the American military has said it will not give up to Turkey, its NATO ally. The possibility of a military conflict between two NATO allies is unprecedented but, after years of deteriorating relations between Turkey and the United States, not unthinkable. If Turkey were to attack Kurdish forces and their allies in Manbij, and the American military intervened, the strains on the NATO alliance would be extreme. The local front-line commander for the Manbij Military Council, Shiar Gherde, is keenly aware of the tenuous nature of his position, but his worries are not tactical. “This is a political conflict now, more than a military one,” Mr. Gherde said during a tour on Wednesday of his fighters’ fortifications. And politically, as he saw it, the Americans are on their side. The Manbij Military Council is aligned with the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, and while the majority of the council’s fighters are Arabs, most of its field commanders, like Mr. Gherde, are Kurds. Mr. Gherde took out his Samsung tablet to consult a military map online, thanks to a strong signal from his enemies’ Turkcell network. Like most Kurdish commanders, Mr. Gherde has no formal rank. He pointed to the northeast at a hillock surrounded by whitish earthworks, which he said was the local Turkish base, then consulted his map to work out the distance: 3.5 kilometers, or about two miles. Clearly visible, the base was out of rifle range, and even out of range of their big .50-caliber machine guns nestled just behind the berms. "
389,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. That Republican memo that’s roiling Washington? It could become public as early as Friday. President Trump cleared the way for the release of the memo, which is said to criticize the F.B.I.’s actions in obtaining a warrant to spy on Mr. Trump’s campaign adviser Carter Page, above. That puts the ball in the House Intelligence Committee’s court. The uproar has everything to do with the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s role in the presidential election. We discuss it on today’s episode of “The Daily.” Speaking of which, “The Daily” celebrated its first birthday. It’s been a smash hit. Here’s the back story on it. ____ 2. The White House is also trying to turn up the pressure on Democrats to bargain on protections for the young, undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. In a speech at a Republican retreat in West Virginia, above, Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for not applauding at his State of the Union address. Earlier, he boasted — incorrectly — that the address drew the highest number of viewers in the speech’s history. He was off by millions (and his address ranks ninth). Optimist, salesman, bully: We looked at the wildly diverse roles Mr. Trump has assumed during his first year in office. ____ 3. Our international correspondent at large is no stranger to war zones. He and a photographer went to the front lines near Manbij, Syria, where rival militias — some backed by Turkey, others by the U.S. — are facing off. The possibility of a military conflict between two NATO allies is unprecedented — but, after years of deteriorating relations, not unthinkable. ____ 4. Across the world, autocratic leaders are engaging in increasingly brazen behavior — rigging votes, muzzling the press and persecuting opponents. The global tide is being driven by a bewildering range of factors, among them surging populism, waves of migration crises, economic inequality and the disappearance of rebukes from the U.S. In Egypt, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, above at an African Union meeting this week, is running practically unopposed for another term. Potential rivals in the presidential race, scheduled for March, have been sidelined, jailed or threatened with prosecution. ____ 5. “Who wouldn’t do the same to feed a family?” That was our correspondent covering the Rohingya crisis, describing how some Rohingya refugees fabricate tales of suffering to compete for relief supplies. The false narratives, while understandable, can buttress Myanmar’s denials of ethnic cleansing. Some are offered by children, who may simply be repeating tales of horror that they’ve heard. But the Muslim minority’s collective suffering is all too real. Nearly 700,000 have been driven out of Myanmar in recent months by a military campaign of murder, rape and other atrocities. ____ 6. The Winter Games open in South Korea next week under a shadow that rivals any in Olympic history: the threat of nuclear war. Security is already ultratight: The South mobilized tens of thousands of security personnel, including 50,000 soldiers, to protect the 100,000 spectators expected to converge each day on Pyeongchang, just 50 miles from North Korea. Even the arrival of Pyongyang’s athletes hasn’t convinced everyone. “North Korea will cause trouble one way or another,” said one analyst. ____ 7. The new book “Rise and Kill First,” by the journalist Ronen Bergman, is an exceptional blend of history and investigative reporting. The 750-page tome reveals new details about targeted killing by the Israeli intelligence services. Here’s an excerpt. “Bergman never loses sight of the ethical questions that arise when a state, founded as a refuge for a stateless people who were targets of a genocide, decides it needs to kill in order to survive,” our critic writes. ____ 8. In honor of Black History Month, our top movie critics compiled a list of 28 essential films that help tell the complex story of black filmmaking in America. Above from left, Tony Curtis, Cara Williams and Sidney Poitier in “The Defiant Ones.” Thursday would have been Langston Hughes’s 116th birthday. Our Op-Ed writer recalls how much his poems meant to her as a child — and asks why she was assigned only his poems about dreams, not demands, in school. ____ 9. The comedians Phoebe Robinson, left, and Jessica Williams are not only best friends, they’re also longtime collaborators who have turned their repartee into a hit podcast, “2 Dope Queens.” We caught up with them ahead of the release of their new four-episode HBO series, which makes its debut on Friday, with appearances by their stand-up comedy pals and celebrity guests like Jon Stewart and Sarah Jessica Parker. ____ 10. Finally, meet the killer whales who talk back. Wikie and her calf Moana, above, can mimic human sounds, like “Amy,” “bye-bye” and a very rude raspberry. Listen to Wikie say hello.

391,"Welcome to Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site. Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for February, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. (Unfortunately, streaming information provided in our Watchlist listings applies only to viewers in the United States.) ‘42 Grams’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist As part of the wave of innovative Chicago fine-dining destinations, chef Jake Bickelhaupt’s 42 Grams picked up two Michelin stars within a year of opening, in part because of its uniquely intimate setting and ever-evolving menu. With Bickelhaupt’s wife, Alexa, running the front of the house, the two entered into a successful partnership that nonetheless buckled under the combined stresses of their personal and professional lives. “42 Grams” offers up the eye candy of a typical foodie doc, but it also witnesses the volatility and ego that sabotage their dreams.
— ‘Being John Malkovich’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman burst onto the scene with this wholly original, playfully surreal comedy about a portal into John Malkovich’s head that allows people to experience his state of being for 15 minutes at a time. Kaufman and director Spike Jonze delight in playing around in this metaphysical space, while also offering up such absurd creations as an office space on a half-floor and a 60-foot Emily Dickinson puppet. Yet “Being John Malkovich” is sneakily moving, turning on the common and melancholy yearning of what it’s like to want to escape your own skin.
— ‘Blue Crush’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist Loosely based on Susan Orlean’s magazine article “Surf Girls of Maui,” this late-summer hit from 2002 may be primarily about beautiful beaches and bodies in motion, but it overachieves in every respect. Director John Stockwell, who made the fine teen romance “Crazy/Beautiful,” has a good handle on the emotional state of a gifted young surfer (Kate Bosworth) who’s trying to make it back in the water after near-fatal incident. Her comeback follows the usual sports-movie formula, but for surfing footage so spectacularly rendered, that much is forgiven.
— ‘Friday Night Lights’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist Before “Friday Night Lights” was developed into one of best dramas in recent network history, it existed onscreen as a solid adaptation of Buzz Bissinger’s nonfiction book about a football-obsessed small town in Texas. Director Peter Berg doesn’t have time to explore fully the characters and social complexities of Bissinger’s book, but he does capture the pressure-cooker atmosphere of a place where football is religion. All that pressure is brought to bear on the coach (Billy Bob Thornton), who’s expected to win every game or lose his job.
— ‘In Good Company’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist “In Good Company” has a record-scratch of a premise: A middle-aged advertising executive (Dennis Quaid) not only cedes his position to a new boss half his age (Topher Grace), he’s also dealt the added humiliation having that young man date his daughter (Scarlett Johansson). Yet writer-director Paul Weitz, fresh off “About a Boy,” works the premise through an unexpectedly low-key comedy-drama, where the power dynamic between the two men shifts back and forth, revealing vulnerabilities about each.
— ‘Moon’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist Duncan Jones’s auspicious directorial debut feels composed of equal parts “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “Dark Star.” Like the “2001,” it’s a metaphysical head-trip about an astronaut (Sam Rockwell) relying on a possibly diabolical sentient computer (GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey) for companionship. Like “Dark Star,” it has an abundance of low-budget charm, with a space station set that looks like an old rental, and an openness to whimsy. Rockwell stars as a loopy energy contractor who’s thrown into chaos just as his final year on a lunar outpost is about to end.
— ‘Nightcrawler’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist With a title that sounds like a reference to a B-movie monster, “Nightcrawler” offers a ferocious beast in its antihero (Jake Gyllenhaal), an amateur cameraman who seeks out grisly footage to feed the “If it bleeds, it leads” maxim of local broadcasts. His combination of ambition, shamelessness and moral vacuity makes him perfect for the job — and also the perfect target for the writer-director Dan Gilroy’s dark, scabrously funny attack on media venality. Gyllenhaal’s natural charisma makes it frighteningly easy to accept his character as a go-getter type, which allows Gilroy to escort the audience to some disturbing places.
— ‘Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane’
Starts streaming: Feb. 1
Add it to your Watchlist The Rolling Stones haven’t exactly been hurting for documentary immortalization, having already been the subject of films by the Maysles Brothers (“Gimme Shelter”) and Martin Scorsese (“Shine a Light”), just for starters. But the montage maestro Brett Morgen (“The Kid Stays in the Picture,” “Jane”) cuts together a fascinating, in-depth profile of the band from a combination of audio from new interviews and 50 years worth of archival film and video. If nothing else, the film is a reminder that the Stones were once revolutionaries, not just a bunch of dinosaurs playing the hits in football stadiums.
— ‘A Most Violent Year’
Starts streaming: Feb. 7
Add it to your Watchlist “A Most Violent Year” is the perfect example of the type of top-drawer production that would have thrived in theaters in the ’60s and ’70s — it might have shared marquee space with a film like “Serpico” — but doesn’t fit any contemporary model for success. This superb third feature from J.C. Chandor (“Margin Call,” “All Is Lost”) stars Oscar Isaac as a straight-arrow heating-oil magnate who has to bend the rules when payments on a new waterfront fuel yard come due and his drivers are suddenly harassed by violent carjackings. That leads some of the drivers to start carrying, themselves. We watch as a good man is led down the road to corruption.

Add it to your Watchlist In his first big swing for the studio fences, director Jeff Nichols (“Mud,” “Take Shelter”) leaned heavily on Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” for inspiration, but he couldn’t help making a Jeff Nichols film instead. Audiences didn’t know what to make of this interstellar curiosity, but cult fandom surely awaits this story of a father (a typically wired Michael Shannon) who steals back his son — a boy with extraordinary and perhaps otherworldly powers — from a religious cult that has been built around him. “Midnight Special” has that “Close Encounters” mix of obsession and wonder, but it is filtered through a more peculiar sensibility.

Add it to your Watchlist Quentin Tarantino’s biggest hit is also among his most audacious, a historical revenge fantasy along the lines of “Inglourious Basterds” but with the action leading to a Mississippi plantation during slavery. Tarantino tramples over any sacrosanct notions of how such a racially sensitive topic might be approached — and in the same year “12 Years a Slave” won an Oscar, no less. But there’s plenty of righteous exploitation-style kick to this story of a freed-slave (Jamie Foxx) who teams up with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to liberate his girlfriend (Kerry Washington) from an evil slaver (Leonardo DiCaprio).

But the election of Donald Trump turned “The Final Year” into an excruciating run-down of hard-won negotiations and accomplishments that were deemed likely to undone by the coming administration. Depending on your political persuasion, it’s either a bittersweet reminder of Obama-era policymaking or a cause for schadenfreude.

Geza Morcsanyi and Alexandra Borbely star as workers at a slaughterhouse who happen to have the same dream every night, where they’re deer that meet in the forest and fall in love. It seems only natural that the two are fated to be together, but reality and dreams turn out to be some distance apart.

Add it to your Watchlist The nation’s most prominent and controversial feminist lawyer, Gloria Allred was in the news recently for representing one of the women accusing Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican candidate for United States Senate, of sexual misconduct with a minor. This admiring documentary profile from Sophie Sartain and Roberta Grossman catches Allred just as she was shining a big media spotlight on a wave of Bill Cosby’s accusers. But the film also takes a broader view of Allred’s advocacy for women, and how it was able to develop considerable power.

Add it to your Watchlist This promising (and expensive-looking) Netflix Original series has a “Blade Runner” look and an intriguing premise, set in a future where human consciousness can be preserved on disks and transferred to new bodies. Joel Kinnaman plays one such body, a handsome specimen with martial-arts skills who’s trying to solve a murder while experiencing echoes of previous corporeal forms. “Altered Carbon” has the look of modern noir — and a reputed abundance of sex and violence to match — but the premise opens up the possibility for a hard sci-fi treatment of memory and identity.

394,"Every major policy overhaul has unanticipated consequences, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be no exception. One tantalizing possibility for this one: The Republican tax overhaul helps Democrats in the midterm and 2020 elections by bringing forward the date at which a few critical states — Georgia and possibly even Texas — flip from red to blue. How might this happen? It stems from the new caps on the home mortgage interest and state and local tax deductions. Restrictions on building have pushed up the costs of housing in expensive coastal blue-state cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. High income and property taxes piled onto exorbitant rents and mortgage payments amount to cost-of-living force fields that already deflect talented workers to relatively affordable red-state cities, like Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C. The tax act’s ceiling on deductions is likely to make many blue-state metro areas even more expensive — at least in the short run. With the Republican changes to the tax code, the high-cost dynamic that has effectively redistributed some probable Democratic voters from left-leaning to right-leaning states will be thrown into overdrive. Furthermore, the lowered corporate tax rate is also more likely to spur capital investment, business expansion and job growth in places that are both economically thriving and comparatively cheap — many of them urban areas in red states — which should bring a relative abundance of attractive new opportunities and cost-conscious job seekers. It’s only mildly surprising that Republican tax reform would stick it to Democratic states and goose the growth of powerful Republican states. But it might come as a shock that this could speed us toward the date when these states are no longer reliably Republican. "
395,"Most presidents will at some point benefit from a surging economy and stock market, but none has claimed more credit for them than Donald J. Trump, as he did again during this week’s State of the Union address. Among the highlights: • “$8 trillion and more” in stock market gains. • “2.4 million new jobs” created since his election. • “Over 3 million workers have gotten tax-cut bonuses” and “rising wages.” • All thanks to “the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.” Since the president has frequently complained that the media denies him credit for any of this, I thought it only fair to assess the degree to which the undeniably strong economy, low unemployment and surging stock market are because of Mr. Trump’s achievements, notably his sweeping tax bill. It turns out that’s no easy task, especially since Mr. Trump has only been president for a year, and the tax legislation is little more than a month old. Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagan’s 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passage. “It’s not like chemistry or physics where you can do a controlled experiment and change one variable,” said Joel Slemrod, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, and co-author of a seminal study of the economic impact of the 1986 tax reform act. “We can never be entirely sure because we don’t know what would have happened without the tax act.” Even so, “there are specific things that are hard to imagine being attributed to anything else” other than the tax legislation, said Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor Slemrod’s co-author on the study of the 1986 reform. With that in mind, here’s a look at the major areas where Mr. Trump claims credit. The S.&P. 500 index rose 23 percent during Mr. Trump’s first year in office, an increase surpassed only by Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama, both Democrats who took office in the wake of financial crises and stock market crashes. Mr. Trump’s policies and Republicans in Congress deserve some credit, given that economists expect the cut in corporate taxes to raise company earnings, and stock prices are fundamentally a reflection of earnings expectations. "
396,"For all of Bill de Blasio’s first term, New York City saw uninterrupted growth in tax revenue and continued economic expansion, enabling him to spend like no other mayor in the city’s history, growing the payroll and work force to a new level. With the Trump administration threatening to cut federal aid, the coming year’s budget represents the first potential check to the mayor’s spending habits. On Thursday, Mr. de Blasio released a preliminary budget that contained few new projects and offered little guidance on how the city would deal with possible cuts from Washington. In fact, the mayor called for an increase in spending to $88.7 billion in the next fiscal year, and he adjusted spending up for this fiscal year, to $87.4 billion or about $3 billion more than projected at this point a year ago. City officials acknowledged that at least $700 million was already at risk because of changes to federal payments for public hospitals and a dampening of the value of tax credits for affordable housing. The situation could worsen when President Trump releases his budget later this month. Mr. de Blasio also underscored the “risks from Albany” in his presentation, and highlighted the harm of a projected $400 million in cost shifts or cuts to state funding for the city in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s budget proposal. Notably, the mayor’s plan includes no new money for the ailing subway system, a source of constant bickering between the mayor and Mr. Cuomo. The governor has sought more than $400 million in additional city spending for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Mr. de Blasio has countered that about the same amount should come from the state, accusing Albany of diverting funds from the transportation authority over the years. Mr. de Blasio said that he would not consider adding money for transit “under current circumstances.” “The responsibility resides in Albany,” he said. “The power resides in Albany.” The mayor is scheduled to go to the Capitol next week for the so-called Tin Cup Day, the joint legislative budget hearing where city leaders make their pitches for funding. Republican lawmakers have made the ritual particularly unpleasant for Mr. de Blasio, and this year is not likely to be an exception. As if to underscore his fraught relationship with Albany, when the mayor spoke of threats from the Trump administration, he lumped them together with threats from Albany. “We are keeping a watchful eye on the risks that are coming our way up I-95, and down the New York State Thruway,” Mr. de Blasio said. A spokesman for the state Division of the Budget, Morris Peters, said that this year’s state budget allocated $16.5 billion in aid to the city, which he said was more than 40 percent of funding awarded to all local governments, and a half-billion dollar increase from the previous year. If the preliminary plan had been expected to provide hints as to how the mayor would adjust the spending-as-investment approach to municipal governance that characterized his first term, there were few signs of such a shift. The record number of city workers — currently at 320,000 full- and part-time employees — is still set to rise to 324,000 this year. The city is pressing forward on a plan to secure 300,000 units of affordable housing, and add a public preschool program for 3-year-olds. Carol Kellermann of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission called it a “wait-and-see” budget. When the mayor last updated his plan in November, she said in an email, “we looked forward to more information on how the city would respond to possible losses of federal and/or state support in the January preliminary budget. Still waiting and not seeing.” The absence of new transit funding could open a third front in the battle over who gets blamed for the failures of the subway system, and the cost of fixing it: Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, has vowed to put more money into the budget for the authority. Mr. Johnson has appeared interested in trying to move the mayor on the issue, but on Thursday, he drew closer to Mr. de Blasio and said that he would not support more money for the M.T.A. without guarantees from the authority that the money would be well spent. “I would be open to more money if we had real accountability,” he said. “I think the mayor wants to fix the subway system, but does not want the city to be left on the hook.” The 2019 budget — about $16 billion greater than when Mr. de Blasio took over City Hall in 2014 — included hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending, about $150 million more for the homeless as well as money for expanding early education and accelerating the rollout of body-worn cameras for police patrol officers. That spending is made possible, in part, because the city continues to benefit from huge and growing revenue from property taxes, which were expected to rise to $27.7 billion in the 2019 fiscal year and up to $30 billion by 2021. The fairness of the rates paid by New Yorkers — which can vary dramatically by neighborhood and housing type — are the subject of a lawsuit. Mr. de Blasio has vowed to look at changes to the system but on Thursday said he did not support lowering property taxes. Mr. de Blasio also stressed that new spending had been offset by savings at city agencies, though not by cuts to workers whose salaries and benefits make up more than half the city’s budget. “This administration is focused on making New York the fairest big city in America,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement ahead of his presentation. “Every decision in this budget was weighed on whether it brought us closer to that goal.” Some of the biggest spending increases could be found in the capital plan. About $750 million more would go to the mayor’s housing plan, and some $82 million to buy new boilers in public housing buildings, where some residents have suffered from a lack of heat this winter. Another $72 million over this fiscal year and next would go to building four prekindergarten locations. For some budget watchdogs, the uncertainty over federal cuts was a reason for the city to buttress its reserves and demonstrate restraint. But doing so could also provide a perverse incentive to leaders in Washington or Albany, who may see such measures as a sign that the city could afford to pay more. “It’s a losing game to show money,” said Doug Turetsky of the city’s Independent Budget Office. “You have to be cautious,” he added. “Others” — meaning federal and state officials — “are looking for where they can make their budgets fall in place.” "
397,"Karen Reyes spends her days teaching a group of deaf toddlers at Lucy Read Pre-Kindergarten School in Austin, Tex., how to understand a world they cannot hear. For the first time in her four-year teaching career, Ms. Reyes, 29, is at a loss. One of nearly 9,000 educators protected under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, Ms. Reyes has struggled to explain to her students, through sign language and pictures, the uncertainty of her future. When President Trump rescinded the  program in September, he gave Congress until early March to find a replacement before deportations are set to begin for the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children who gave their names to the government and were granted work permits. Ms. Reyes’s teaching days may be numbered — to 119 to be exact. “I don’t know what I’m going to tell them,” Ms. Reyes said through tears. “They understand when I go on an airplane. Maybe they’ll just think I’m on a never-ending flight.” Educators played a crucial role in helping young unauthorized immigrants realize DACA’s potential. The National Education Association, for instance, held clinics at which it encouraged eligible families to apply for the program, and worked with school districts to declare themselves “safe zones” for undocumented students and their families. Much to the chagrin of educators and advocates, the program, created in 2012 by President Barack Obama, has become a bargaining chip for the White House. Mr. Trump has conditioned its codification in law on Democratic acceptance of tough  demands, including an end to decades of family-based migration policies, a wall on the Mexican border and a crackdown on other immigrants in the country illegally.

399,"Three big banks were punished for market manipulation this week — and tucked into the punishment was a single sentence that could pay big dividends for the banking industry. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, banks that violate financial rules are disqualified from access to a streamlined process for certain types of business they conduct, unless they receive a waiver from federal regulators. That provision, known as the bad actor rule, was created to make legal settlements with regulators riskier and more financially painful for banks — an incentive for them to avoid the conduct that precipitates such settlements. On Monday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reached settlements with Deutsche Bank, HSBC and UBS Group for a type of market manipulation called spoofing. The banks collectively paid just under $47 million to settle the civil charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. But while the commission and Justice Department trumpeted their crackdown on market manipulation, the settlements included language that gave all three banks an automatic waiver from the bad actor rule — drawing sharp criticism from one Securities and Exchange commissioner, a Democrat. “I am extremely disappointed by the C.F.T.C.’s actions in this case,” the commissioner, Kara Stein, said on Thursday. “They did not consult with the S.E.C. before injecting themselves into securities markets in which they have little or no expertise. The implications of the C.F.T.C.’s actions are deeply troubling and may put U.S. investors at risk.” "

401,"LONDON — A man accused of driving a van into Muslim worshipers outside a London mosque, killing one person and injuring nine others, was found guilty of murder on Thursday, after a trial that raised questions about the radicalizing influence of far-right groups in Britain. The man, Darren Osborne, 48, had denied responsibility for the June 2017 assault near the Finsbury Park Mosque, in north London, though he admitted that he had hoped to kill Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, as well as the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, at a different location. After an eight-day trial at the Woolwich Crown Court, jurors took an hour to declare him guilty both of murder and attempted murder. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. The court heard evidence suggesting that Mr. Osborne had been radicalized relatively quickly. According to Mr. Osborne’s partner, Sarah Andrews, his Islamophobic views developed in the weeks before the attack, as he became convinced that not enough was being done to combat Islamic extremism. Ms. Andrews said Mr. Osborne had become “obsessed” with Muslims, particularly after watching “Three Girls,” a BBC dramatization of an abuse scandal in Rochdale, England, in which mostly young, white girls were groomed by men who were mostly of Pakistani heritage. She said Mr. Osborne then dived into the right-wing media sphere and “seemed brainwashed” by that world. Devices seized by the police showed internet searches for a variety of such sites, including that of the English Defence League, a far-right anti-Muslim group. "

403,"When the Houston Astros visit the White House this season to commemorate their World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, Carlos Beltran will not be with them. Beltran said on Tuesday President Trump did not have anything to do with his decision, but he added that he was “disappointed” with the government’s response to the damage Hurricane Maria inflicted on Puerto Rico, Beltran’s home island. Beltran, speaking at the Thurman Munson Awards Dinner in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, cited his desire to spend that time with his family at their New York City home as a reason for his decision. “I’m retired so I’m not really part of the team anymore,” he said. “My family is my team now.” He stopped short of criticizing President Trump specifically over the response to the hurricane damage in Puerto Rico, some parts of which are still without electrical power more than four months later. “I mean, he’s the President of the United States,” Beltran said. “Sometimes we don’t like what he does, or we like the things that he does, but at the end of the day, he’s the president. It’s got nothing to do with that.” But Beltran, who announced his retirement after finally earning a championship ring in his 20th major-league season, noted the difference in the government’s response to the damage in Puerto Rico compared with the reaction to Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston in August. “One thing that really impressed me a lot was how fast that city was able to get back on its feet,” Beltran said. “But the situation in Puerto Rico has been different.” He added: “We’re very disappointed in the government that we haven’t gotten the same benefits. Being a part of the United States, you expect at least to be treated the same way when tragedies like this happen.” Beltran and his wife, Jessica, donated $1 million to relief efforts in Puerto Rico in September, and he said his foundation was in the process of rebuilding 200 houses on the island. White House visits by sports champions have become more politically fraught since President Trump took office. The Golden State Warriors, the 2016-17 N.B.A. champions, said they did not want to make the traditional trip, and then the president withdrew their invitation. Some members of the Philadelphia Eagles, who won the Super Bowl on Sunday, have already said they would not go to the White House. No date has been set for the Astros’ visit to the White House. Generally, championship baseball teams visit the White House during a road trip to Baltimore. But since the Astros do not visit the Orioles until late September, the team might make the trip during spring training. “I’m not going to go, but I wish those guys the best,” Beltran said. “I hope they have a great time and enjoy their visit to the White House.” "

405,"On Monday night, Carter Page was finally ready for his Fox News close-up. It had been nearly a year since he began his one-man public-relations offensive to rebut accusations that, as a Trump campaign adviser, he colluded with Russia. He had appeared numerous times on CNN, MSNBC and the networks, typically opposite their star anchors. Unlike almost everyone else caught up in the Trump-Russia scandal, Page was not only willing to submit to public questions; he would even answer them. Though he didn’t bring much clarity to his role, the appearances did make for great, albeit surreal, television. Like the time he insisted to Anderson Cooper that his conversation with the Russian ambassador during the Republican National Convention was not actually a “meeting.” “Anderson,” Page explained, “a great analogy is you and I were members of the same health club here in New York previously. And I remember walking by you, even though we didn’t know each other, and I said, ‘Hi, Anderson,’ and you said hello, and we, you know, had a nice little exchange for half a second. Now, does that to you constitute a meeting?” But for all the media stardom these and other interviews brought Page, he had been essentially given a cold shoulder by Fox News; he hadn’t appeared on the network since a few cameos in March and April. When I met with Page late last year for a story for the magazine, his absence from Fox’s airwaves seemed to gnaw at him even more than the considerable distance that Trump’s advisers had sought to put between him and the president. After all, Page understood why Trump wouldn’t want to be associated with him: Page viewed himself, as he put it last year, “the biggest embarrassment surrounding the campaign.” But Fox was another matter. Considering how roughly he was treated by the mainstream media, he assumed that Fox would have come to his aid. Besides, Page’s father was a devoted Fox viewer, and it would have been nice if he could have watched his son on his favorite shows. So it was understandable why Page’s wide, goofy smile was even wider and goofier than usual on Monday night when he appeared on Laura Ingraham’s prime-time show on Fox News. Page was there to give his first interview since House Republicans, three days earlier, released a memo, written by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee, alleging that the F.B.I. had improperly spied on Page in an attempt to harm Trump’s presidential campaign. “Carter, it’s good to see you tonight,” Ingraham told Page, teeing up a softball. “I know you have not spoken out about this House Intel memo yet or the reaction to it. What is your reaction?” Page swung away: “Well, my first reaction, Laura, when I saw it was, there was a lot of details that kept dripping out, and it sounded really bad. And when I actually saw it, it was even worse than I could’ve possibly imagined.” Ingraham nodded sympathetically. As she later said on her show, “I feel sorry for Carter Page.” Another of Ingraham’s guests, Mollie Hemingway, a writer for the conservative website The Federalist, proclaimed: “If the civil rights and civil liberties of Carter Page can be violated, they can be violated for anyone.” For Page, the cavalry has finally arrived. Until now, his fight had been a lonely one. Indeed, the reason that Page, unlike others ensnared in the Russia scandal, has been so ubiquitous is because no one would argue for him on his behalf. Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn each have teams of high-priced lawyers; Page has a “chief strategic legal adviser” to give him occasional counsel, but Page says he’s representing himself. George Papadopoulos has his fiancée to defend his honor; Page, who is single, refused to put me in touch with any of his friends for fear of entangling them in his own problems. "
406,"The driver was drunk, the police said, his blood alcohol content nearly three times the legal limit. One of his victims was an N.F.L. linebacker who was just reaching his prime. But on Tuesday, two days after the crash, it was the driver’s immigration status that moved President Trump to post his first tweet of the morning. Decades of research have shown that immigrants are less prone to commit crimes and to be incarcerated than people born in the United States. But more and more lately, Mr. Trump has been using individual criminal cases to advance an argument that illegal immigration, as well as many forms of legal immigration, is dangerous to Americans and must be curbed. Now the White House, along with some Republicans in Congress, is arguing that any deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation must include provisions to tighten border security and roll back some types of legal immigration. Here’s how a linebacker’s death became part of that debate. Edwin Jackson, a linebacker from Atlanta, was the Colts’ third-leading tackler of the 2016 season before sitting out 2017 with an injury. He was riding in an Uber car driven by the crash’s second victim, Jeffrey Monroe, who was from nearby Avon, Ind. "

408,"WASHINGTON — State and local law enforcement officials are fighting a Trump administration proposal to move oversight of a $275 million drug prevention program to the Justice Department, fearing that such a move would steer the country’s drug-fighting strategy toward federal legal crackdowns and away from years of holistic, community-based approaches. A draft budget plan by the Office of Management and Budget would place federal law enforcement officers in charge of the drug trafficking grants rather than the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which has served as the White House’s clearinghouse for drug strategy across the government and as a neutral arbiter in the historically territorial relationship between federal, state and local authorities. The move would also effectively gut the drug office, whose influence has waned since President Trump took office. The office manages the grants, known as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, sending millions of federal dollars to 28 task forces across the country, composed of state, local and federal law enforcement officers, who use the money to combat drug trafficking in their communities. Directors of the grant program have descended on Capitol Hill this week to try to bolster support from Congress, which would need to approve any White House changes to the drug office or the program. Lawmakers have shown little appetite to alter a federal initiative that benefits state and local authorities and constituents. “In the middle of this huge epidemic, is now the time to start rearranging the deck chairs?” said Chauncey Parker, the director of the program task force in New York City and a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office. “O.N.D.C.P. are the experts and the professionals on this issue, and they’re the best ones from a holistic standpoint to be able to take a look at all of this.” The proposal has sent confusing signals to law enforcement officials who saw an ally in Mr. Trump given that he campaigned as a “law and order” candidate and courted state and local police in his election bid. In justifying potential changes to the grant program, the White House’s budget office has in recent months said privately that it believes federal authorities should be leading the charge on drug enforcement, according to two people familiar with the conversations. "
409,"WASHINGTON — A week ago, President Trump stood before Congress as an improbable unifier. “Tonight,” he declared, “I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.” This week, Mr. Trump is back to being a disrupter. After accusing Democrats of being un-American and even treasonous for refusing to applaud during his State of the Union speech, he said on Tuesday that he would welcome a government shutdown if he cannot reach a spending deal with Congress that tightens immigration laws. A week ago, Mr. Trump called for a grand compromise with Democrats on the legal status of the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers — a deal, he said, “where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.” After all, the president added, “Americans are dreamers too.” On Tuesday, his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, said that many Dreamers failed to register for protected status with the government because they were “were too afraid to sign up” or were “too lazy to get off their asses.” He said he doubted Mr. Trump would extend the March 5 deadline that shields them from deportation. Mr. Trump’s threat of a shutdown seemed to have little effect on the delicate negotiations on Capitol Hill to raise spending caps on military and nonmilitary spending — an agreement that, if passed by both houses of Congress, would pave the way for long-term deal to fund the government.

He does not. “Most men would get discouraged,” he says, referring to those he comes on to. “Fortunately for her, I am not most men.” He is Pepé Le Pew. Does he remind us of anyone else? In advance of Valentine’s Day, and to better understand the inner workings of a man who appears to have no inner workings, I bypassed last week’s State of the Union address and spent the evening watching all 17 Pepé Le Pew cartoons, from his 1945 debut in “Odor-able Kitty” to 1962’s “Louvre Come Back to Me!” And I can now share what I have learned — about love, the French, narcissistic personality disorder, men, women, the president of the United States and the smell of Limburger cheese. But first, for younger readers: Pepé Le Pew is a Warner Bros. cartoon character, part of the Looney Tunes stable during the golden age of American animation, alongside Bugs Bunny, the Road Runner, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. He was never a marquee star of the same magnitude of, say, Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner. He appeared in just 17 stand-alone cartoons, virtually all of them directed by Chuck Jones. Still, he made a fragrant impression: “For Scent-imental Reasons” (1949) won the Academy Award for best animated short film. If it seems surprising that there were only 17 Pepé Le Pew cartoons, it may be because they seem so similar. Each begins with a cat, usually but (interestingly) not always female, getting a stripe of white paint on its back, usually (but not always) by accident. This makes our hero, Pepé, mistake the cat for one of his own kind — and his response to those of his own kind is always deep and passionate love. He has a curious way of expressing it, though. Even though he is French (which in the Looney Tunes world is shorthand for relentless amour), his terrible smell repulses the objects of his affection, who struggle valiantly to get away, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. “Odor-able Kitty” ends with Pepé with a chain around his ankle. “Now we are inseparable, are we not, darling?” he says. The shot follows the chain across the room to the cat, whose leg is also bound. The last we see of the pussy, she is desperately hacking away at the chain, trying to get free. "

Though some pundits stoked panic with their coverage of several days of market plunges before Tuesday’s leap, stock prices are still near their record highs, the economy is creating jobs and many workers are finally getting decent raises after years of stagnant wages. Which doesn’t mean that there’s nothing to worry about. In recent months, time after time, both the current administration and its allies in Congress have called into question their credibility and competence to manage the economy or handle a financial crisis if one were to occur. President Trump has repeatedly patted himself on the back for a surging stock market, seemingly unaware that stocks can go down, not just up. His Treasury Department in December released a one-page analysis that made outlandish economic assumptions to justify giant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy families. Republican lawmakers in Congress went even further, attacking the Congressional Budget Office and Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, both nonpartisan, because those analysts had the temerity to warn that the tax law would add to the federal deficit. Mr. Trump wants everyone to know that his election delivered a booster shot to the economy and stocks. “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,” he told reporters in November. Truth is, the president was just lucky enough to have inherited a growing economy and a rising stock market. Though his tax cuts were an expensive gift to investors, he has not been in office long enough to have fundamentally changed that trajectory. But his erratic behavior and poor policy choices are clearly worrying the majority of Americans who disapprove of the president. One reason some investors have become nervous recently is they fear that the tax cuts, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers sold as a way to stimulate the economy, could end up hurting the economy in the not so distant future. The tax law and a push by the Trump administration to increase military spending will reduce federal revenue and force the Treasury to borrow more money when the economy is close to full employment. This could stoke inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. That, in turn, would slow the economy. The prospect of a recession or financial crisis on Mr. Trump’s watch is unnerving, because he is as confident in his own abilities as he is lacking in knowledge and sound judgment. When confronted with criticism, he lashes out like an intemperate child. On Monday, he said Democrats who did not applaud during his State of the Union address were un-American and treasonous. If the stock market falls further, will the president try to reassure the public, or will he launch a Twitter fusillade blaming the drop on, say, a conspiracy hatched by the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge fund manager who wants Mr. Trump impeached? "
414,"TEL AVIV — It is hard to spend a week in Israel and not come away feeling that Israelis have the wind at their backs. They’ve built an awesome high-tech industry, and everyone’s kid seems to work for a start-up. Even Israeli Arabs have caught the bug — the number studying for B.A. degrees at Israeli universities rose 60 percent in the last seven years, to 47,000. Regionally, the Arabs and Palestinians have never been weaker, and under President Trump, Israel has never had a more unquestioningly friendly United States. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, asking Israel for nothing in return. The Arab states barely made a peep. Alas, though, all of this wind has whetted the appetite of Israel’s settlers and ruling Likud Party to go to extremes. Reuters reported on Dec. 31 that the “Likud Party unanimously urged legislators in a nonbinding resolution … to effectively annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, land that Palestinians want for a future state.” Sure, the world would scream “apartheid,” but Israeli rightists shrug that the world will get used to it. Nikki Haley will cover for Israel at the U.N. Sheldon Adelson will keep Trump and the G.O.P. in line. And the Arab regimes, which need Israel to counter Iran, will look the other away. It always plays out that way, and the settlers see that, so, they ask, why wait? They think they can annex the West Bank without giving Palestinians citizenship; they’ll just let the Palestinians vote in their own elections. And then it popped into my head: I’ve seen this play before. It was May 17, 1983 — the day Israel, a year after invading Lebanon, signed a peace accord with Beirut. “Signed” isn’t exactly right. Israel (backed by the U.S.) imposed virtually all its security demands on a weak Lebanese government, including a framework for normalizing trade and diplomacy. Back then, Israel also had a right-wing leader, Menachem Begin, embraced by a superfriendly President Ronald Reagan. Egypt had just signed a peace treaty and dropped out of the conflict, and another young Arab leader — Lebanese Christian warlord Bashir Gemayel — beckoned Israel to join him in crushing the Palestinians and remaking the Middle East together. "
415,"Two leading Senate Republicans released a document late Tuesday that they said bolstered Republican allegations that the Justice Department relied heavily on a politically tainted dossier in seeking permission from a secret federal court to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide. The document, a letter sent last month to the F.B.I. and Justice Department by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, quoted from Justice Department requests to the court to spy in late 2016 and last year on the former aide, Carter Page. A classified Democratic memo seeks to rebut the Republican accusations of political bias. President Trump is expected to allow that memo to be made public, but is likely to redact parts of it, people close to the White House said. That decision is certain to anger Democratic lawmakers, who expressed concern on Tuesday that the president would edit the memo — not for national security reasons but to remove parts that he viewed as politically embarrassing or damaging. The Senate letter accuses the F.B.I. of relying largely on unverified information produced for the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign to convince a federal judge of the need to eavesdrop on Mr. Page as a possible Russian agent. The letter said the Justice Department’s initial application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to spy on Mr. Page, filed in October 2016 after he had left the Trump campaign, “appears to contain no additional information corroborating the dossier allegations” posed by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who had been working with a research firm paid by the Democrats. That court approved the surveillance for 90 days, and renewed it three times. Republicans have said that the so-called Steele dossier was the main justification for the F.B.I.’s investigation into possible Russian influence over the Trump campaign, casting doubt on the inquiry’s legitimacy. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have said that Republicans are distorting the roots of the inquiry in an effort to bolster Mr. Trump. Last week, Mr. Trump declassified a memo by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that leveled similar allegations to those posed by Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham. Mr. Trump, who had a brief window to block the memo’s disclosure on national security grounds, did not ask that any of its substance be redacted. Administration officials said that Mr. Trump had read the Democratic memorandum, which seeks to undermine Republican claims that top law enforcement officials had abused their powers when they sought a warrant to wiretap Mr. Page. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to say whether the president intended to handle the matter the same way he did the Republican memo. That document also contained accusations of F.B.I. bias. But people close to the White House said they anticipated that the president would release the Democratic memo — with parts blacked out — once it went through a national security and legal review. Ms. Sanders said that process “will take several days to complete.” She said Mr. Trump met Tuesday afternoon with Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, to discuss the Democratic memorandum. The White House said last week that the Republican memo was reviewed for national security and legal concerns, too, but it was released with no redactions. And Mr. Trump was overheard telling a Republican member of Congress that he would “100 percent” release the memo before he had read it. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee and the author of the Democratic memo, said that Mr. Trump should not block parts of the document from the public unless it was for national security reasons. Mr. Schiff said on CNN that he was concerned about “political redactions.” “That is, not redactions to protect sources or methods, which we’ve asked the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. to do, but redactions to remove information they think is unfavorable to the president,” he said. One Republican familiar with the Democratic memo’s contents said that there were a number of issues related to the sourcing of information that would have to be blacked out from public consumption. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of South Carolina, accused Mr. Schiff of playing politics with the contents. “Adam Schiff’s comments about redactions recognize the fact that the Democrat memo was hastily put together and has a number of areas that must be addressed before it’s released to the public,” Mr. Meadows said. He added that he expected Mr. Trump to allow it to become public with as few redactions as possible. House Republicans and Democrats spent Tuesday arguing about the contents of their dueling memos as they awaited Mr. Trump’s review. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, introduced a resolution disapproving of the Republican memo and urging Mr. Trump to “expeditiously” review and declassify the Democrat’s rebuttal “without any redactions based on political considerations.” The resolution was rejected 236 to 190, along strict party lines. Speaker Paul D. Ryan again stood by the Republican memo during a news conference, but dodged a question about Mr. Trump’s claim that the memo had vindicated him in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. “FISA abuse matters to each and every one of us as citizens,” Mr. Ryan said, referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. “And if our government abused the FISA process, a unique, selective process, which if mishandled could complicate and compromise on American civil liberties, we should care about that.” "

417,"WASHINGTON — As the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter is not a public figure, but he is responsible for paper flow to the president, a job of crucial importance in the Trump administration. He frequently travels with President Trump on Air Force One, and he helped write Mr. Trump’s first State of the Union address last month. But despite initial support from John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, and other West Wing staff aides, Mr. Porter announced his resignation on Wednesday, a day after his two former wives accused him in interviews of physical abuse when they were married to him. His troubles were not a complete secret at the White House: Two people close to the White House said that the allegations against him made by his former wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, had contributed to a delay in granting him a permanent security clearance. In a statement, Mr. Porter said that “these allegations are simply false,” even as details of the alleged abuse and photographs of one of his former wives with a black eye that she said he had given her were widely circulated. The White House’s initial response was consistent with the way both Mr. Trump and his aides have handled allegations of harassment or abuse against the president or his allies and advisers since the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump vigorously defended Roy S. Moore, the failed Alabama Republican Senate candidate, against allegations that included child molestation, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, has said that multiple women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct were lying. In the White House, Mr. Porter, 40, had been widely regarded as a rising star. A Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and former Senate aide, Mr. Porter was an ally of Mr. Kelly’s and a steady force in a West Wing populated by aides vying for face time with — and influence over — the president. But, a year into his job, Mr. Porter did not have the permanent security clearance that aides of his rank always have. "
418,"President Trump, who has taken credit for a rising stock market as a measure of his own success, complained on Twitter Wednesday that “good (great) news” in the economy led to an abrupt decline in stock prices, his first comments about the stock market since its sharp drop earlier this week. In the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the “old days,” stocks would rise on good economic news, saying “Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake.” The tweet did not elaborate on what he meant by the “old days” or explain further his analysis of why stocks plummeted on Friday and Monday. Until Wednesday’s tweet, the president had been unusually silent about the stock market, which has been rocked by volatility, including a decline in the Dow Jones industrial average of almost 7 percent over two days. At one point on Monday, the Dow was down almost 1,600 points, or about 6 percent of its total value, the markets plunging at the same moment as Mr. Trump was giving a speech in Blue Ash, Ohio. It closed that day down 1,175 points. Mr. Trump’s assertion that the fall was pegged to good economic news stems from Friday’s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment. Rising wages are good for those who receive them, and for the presidents who seek to stimulate them, but investors see them as a sign of possible inflation and higher interest rates. Analysts pegged the sell-off in stocks to the strong employment numbers as investors feared the Federal Reserve might quicken the pace of its interest rate hikes. White House officials had released only a terse statement after the market’s decline earlier this week. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement on Monday that “the President’s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers.” "

420,"IN A LARGE, low-lit room is a triangle-shaped table arranged with 39 place settings, the site of a distinguished gathering. It is laid with plates that rise a few inches off the table, as if levitating, each one sumptuously painted with wings or petals or licks of flame emanating from a glowing center: variations on the vulva. As you move along the table, which is 48 feet long on each side, the plates become small sculptures, bulbous and gleaming. Beneath them are runners embroidered with elaborate designs and names in gold thread — women of accomplishment who are familiar and unfamiliar, mythical and rarely spoken of: Sappho, the ancient poet; Anna Maria van Schurman, the 17th-century artist, thinker and theologian; Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female physician in the United States. The whole assemblage stands on a floor of luminescent triangular tiles covered in more gold — 999 names of other heroic women written in curling letters. The room is like a temple — a holy place, distinct from the everyday. When Judy Chicago’s “The Dinner Party” opened on March 14, 1979, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, no one had ever seen anything like it. It was theatrical, audacious and definitively feminist: a work of stark symbolism and detailed scholarship, of elaborate ceramics and needlework that also nodded to the traditional amateurism of those forms, a communal project that was the realization of one woman’s uncompromisingly grand vision, inviting both awe and identification. It caused an immediate sensation. But that was only the beginning of its tumultuous life. One cold day in December, I met Judy Chicago, who is 78, at the Brooklyn Museum, where “The Dinner Party” is now permanently installed. Her style, like “The Dinner Party,” is flamboyant and groovy and uncategorizable. She wore jeans, a leopard-print silk shirt under a black vest embroidered with sequins and a double strand of gold beads. Her lipstick was purple, her curly hair dyed a reddish-pink, with tinted glasses to match, giving her a dreamy, psychedelic look. But the eyes peering out from behind those glasses were sharp and commanding. We walked into “The Dinner Party” accompanied by Chicago’s husband and constant companion, the photographer Donald Woodman, who that day played the part of a benign bodyguard. Chicago regarded her creation with the fierce and slightly bemused love of a parent for a grown child. The work is so thoroughly assimilated into art history that its authority feels like a given, but Chicago remains protective of it. She vividly remembers its difficult birth — the years of painstaking labor, the organizing, over five years, of a volunteer force of 400 to help her, the doubt about whether it would ever be finished and the eventual triumph of its debut. Chicago’s intention, she told me — with a mixture of self-deprecation and utter seriousness — had been to rededicate the history of Western civilization to the women who are often left out of it. She wanted to make a work so large that it could never be erased. When I asked her what it was like to be in the presence of the piece now, sadness crept into her voice. She said she felt relief. “From the beginning, you know, I was determined — it needed to be permanently housed, because if it hadn’t been, it would have simply reiterated the story of erasure it recounts. It just — I had no idea it was going to take this long.” WHEN “THE DINNER PARTY” was first shown in San Francisco, over 100,000 people came to see it in the three months it was on display. Chicago was feted in national magazines and interviewed on the radio. She received letters from women all over the country telling her how moved they were by the piece, how it had changed their lives. But a backlash was brewing. Colleagues whispered that it was not a work of art but a piece of clumsy political rhetoric. A Los Angeles Times art critic cruelly bashed it, calling it “a lumbering mishmash of sleaze and cheese.” The tour of the show was canceled, with minimal explanation. "
421,"This awards season has been all about hitting the zeitgeist, or at least that’s what the media, present company included, has been telling itself and you. Best picture nominees ought to tap into the #MeToo moment or, failing that, anxieties born in the age of Trump. But is that narrative really true? And does it fully explain how a fairy tale about a janitor who hooks up with a fishman became the movie to beat? The film, “The Shape of Water,” stars Sally Hawkins as a cleaning lady who falls for a merman held captive in a government lab, and leads the race with 13 Oscar nominations, more than any other movie. It has also scooped up key precursor awards that often culminate in Oscar gold — last weekend, the Directors Guild of America gave the filmmaker Guillermo del Toro its top prize, two weeks after the Producers Guild of America did the same. That a fantasy film has made it this far is highly unusual. While some fantasy and sci-fi movies have been nominated for best picture (“Avatar,” “District 9,” “Inception” and “Mad Max: Fury Road”), with the exception of “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” it is hard to name one that has gone all the way. Meanwhile, should Mr. del Toro nab best director, which is expected, it will mark the fourth time a Mexican filmmaker has done so in the last five years. ¡Viva Mexico! The movie’s winning trajectory has had its bumps. “Shape” was not nominated for best ensemble performance at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and, as forecasters invariably note, no film since “Braveheart” (1995) has won the best picture Oscar without previously landing a SAG ensemble nomination. But while the winner of the SAG ensemble prize was “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” presumably making it the stiffest competition facing “Shape,” the “Three Billboards” filmmaker, Martin McDonagh, did not get an Oscar nomination for best director, while Mr. del Toro did. Advantage, fishman. "

Pyeongchang and Pyongyang: The South Korean host of the Winter Olympics and the North Korean capital have confusingly similar names. There does not seem to be any significance in the shared syllable, which is derived from the same Chinese root character meaning “to pacify” or “to be level or flat.” Pyongyang means “peaceful land” or “flat land,” and Pyeongchang means “peaceful flourishing” or “peaceful prosperity.” In the South, conservatives have criticized the government of President Moon Jae-in for welcoming the North’s participation and derided the Games as the “Pyongyang Olympics.” Liberals and the Moon administration countered that the event should be called the Pyeonghwa, or peace, Olympics. The host town originally spelled its name “Pyongchang” in English, but added a letter in 2000 and capitalized the C to become PyeongChang to distinguish itself from the North’s capital, our correspondent noted. Most news organizations, including The Times, decline to capitalize the C. But confusion persisted despite the rebranding.

423,"When Baquer Namazi, the oldest American known to be held in Iran, was released on medical leave Jan. 28 from Tehran’s infamous Evin Prison, it was an unexpected and unusual act of mercy. There was even some hope that Mr. Namazi, an 81-year-old former diplomat for Unicef, might be granted parole. On Tuesday, those hopes were dashed as the authorities ordered the ailing Mr. Namazi to return to jail, a decision so lacking in compassion that the Trump administration must intervene.     "
424,"To the Editor:  Senator Jeff Flake’s remarks denouncing President Trump’s comment regarding Democratic members of Congress who did not applaud during the State of the Union address stand in stark contrast to the silence emanating from the Senate and House leadership. These same leaders sat in silence on multiple occasions during President Obama’s State of the Union addresses, as was their privilege, and without concern that this right would be publicly characterized as “un-American” or “treasonous” by the president. Though Senator Flake and I likely differ on policy preferences, we, and many other Americans across the political spectrum, hopefully share core beliefs in the importance of civil liberties and discourse. Only through courageous stands such as Mr. Flake’s will we continue to overcome the threat to those beliefs. TIM BREWER, LOS ANGELES To the Editor: Some suggest that President Trump is diverting us from bad economic news by his preposterous claim of treason. Others have reminded us that in Stalin’s Soviet Union, refraining from applauding was in fact treasonous. And some see this as still more evidence that Mr. Trump has no idea what he is talking about. With the term “treasonous” having been uttered by Stephen Bannon (referring to a meeting involving Donald Trump Jr.), and with Robert Mueller’s investigation getting close to the president himself, I believe that Mr. Trump is purposely using the term in an offhand way so as to trivialize it, empty it of its gravity. “Somebody said treasonous. I mean, yeah, I guess, why not.” No one throws out the term “treason” quite that casually, unless he wants to turn it into nothing more than a mere insult. Fearing that it will most likely be applied to him, he wants to make us all gradually forget the weight of the accusation. EVA KITTAY, NEW YORK To the Editor: Re “Gulp. I’m Guilty of Treason,” by Frank Bruni (column, Feb. 7): In equating obsequious praise of himself with love of country, President Trump disturbingly mimics Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. Mr. Kim had his uncle Jang Song-thaek shot; his offenses included clapping only halfheartedly during Mr. Kim’s election as vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. Officially, Mr. Jang was found guilty of “treason.” Vladimir Putin, an autocrat whom Mr. Trump praises effusively, modified Russian treason laws to allow a crackdown on opposition parties, although many of Mr. Putin’s opponents seem to mysteriously vanish even without the aid of a treason prosecution. Mr. Bruni is dead on target in noting that Mr. Trump’s own actions more closely approach the true meaning of treason than those he degrades with his slurs. CARL MEZOFF, STAMFORD, CONN. "

426,"SEOUL, South Korea — In the run-up to the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, some South Koreans have been grumbling that this may as well be the “Pyongyang Games.” Since the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, announced on Jan. 1 that he was interested in sending a delegation to the Games, there has been a flurry of inter-Korean agreements. Twenty-two North Korean athletes will participate in the Olympics, and they will arrive with some 230 cheerleaders in tow. The two Koreas are fielding a joint women’s ice hockey team. And at the opening ceremony on Friday, they will march under a single flag, the Korean Unification Flag. The international news media has been buzzing about the new prospects for a secure peace on the Korean Peninsula, but not everyone in the South is happy about the welcome the North is receiving. And this time it’s not just the usual South Korean conservatives who are moaning. The idea that people in the South belong with their Northern brethren isn’t universal, especially among the young. The exigencies of daily life — jobs, housing, income inequality — are far more pressing than uniting with what may as well be an alien country. Unification increasingly sounds like an abstract ideal, taught only in school and repeated ad nauseam by the political class. President Moon Jae-in appears to be paying a heavy political price for the rapprochement. Engagement to foster peace is worth exploring. But pulling out all the stops to accommodate Pyongyang on the basis that the two Koreas are one “minjok” (nation) — as Mr. Moon seems to be suggesting — comes across as outdated and out of touch. "
427,"WASHINGTON — Senate leaders struck a far-reaching bipartisan agreement on Wednesday that would add hundreds of billions of dollars to military and domestic programs over the next two years while raising the federal debt limit, moving to end the cycle of fiscal showdowns that have roiled the Capitol. The accord between Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, his Democratic counterpart, would raise strict caps on military and domestic spending that were imposed in 2011 as part of a deal with President Barack Obama that was once seen as a key triumph for Republicans in Congress. The deal would raise the spending caps by about $300 billion over two years. The limit on military spending would be increased by $80 billion in the current fiscal year and $85 billion in the next year, which begins Oct. 1. The limit on nondefense spending would increase by $63 billion this year and $68 billion next year. But the accord was not without dramatics, and its passage in the House is not a foregone conclusion. As proof of that, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, took the House floor on Wednesday morning in opposition, protesting that the deal did nothing to bring lawmakers closer to protecting young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. She then delivered a record-breaking speech that tied up the House for the entire day and into the night. The budget agreement, coming a day after President Trump threatened to shut down the government, would effectively negate Mr. Trump’s demands to broadly reorder government with deep cuts to nondefense programs like environmental protection, foreign aid and health research that were to offset large increases in military spending. Mr. Trump is to release his second budget request on Monday, but the deal — championed by the top congressional leaders from his own party — amounts to an unequivocal rebuke of many of the budgetary demands he has put forth. The deal would give Mr. Trump military bragging rights. “The bottom line is that, thanks to President Trump, we can now have the strongest military we have ever had,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Wednesday. "
428,"Journalists at The Los Angeles Times have repeatedly clashed with their Chicago-based parent company, Tronc. So when they heard that a local billionaire was closing in on a deal to buy the newspaper, many of them cheered. Someone even popped a bottle of champagne. On Wednesday, it was official: The Los Angeles Times was being sold to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a health care mogul and former surgeon, for $500 million. The deal includes The Times’s sibling paper, The San Diego Union-Tribune, and smaller publications in the California News Group. The deal, with Dr. Soon-Shiong’s private investment arm, Nant Capital, also includes the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. The agreement — which Tronc announced early on Wednesday, when many Times employees were still in bed — brings to a close a tumultuous period marked by the ouster of top leaders, the suspension of the newspaper’s publisher and a contentious unionization effort. In recent months, the frustration in the Times newsroom erupted into public view, as The New York Times, HuffPost and other news outlets published articles on the tensions between staff and management at the 136-year-old newspaper. With The Times receiving national attention for reasons having nothing to do with its exemplary coverage of sexual harassment in Hollywood or the natural disasters in its backyard, Tronc had a public-relations problem just as it was trying to develop new strategies for producing and distributing its journalism. The sale, which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, would leave The Times under local ownership for the first time since the Chandler family sold the Times Mirror Company to a Tronc predecessor, the Tribune Company, in 2000. The entry of Dr. Soon-Shiong would end a period of corporate control that included severe layoffs, cost cuts and, for a time, a frat house culture in its top ranks. By agreeing to sell the paper, Tronc also seems to be retreating from the national and international ambitions the company entertained after Michael W. Ferro Jr. became its chairman and biggest shareholder two years ago. “We are pleased to transition leadership of The Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune to local ownership,” Justin Dearborn, Tronc’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We are certain that the journalistic excellence in Southern California will continue long into the future.” If the sale has come as a relief to Tronc executives and Times journalists alike, it leaves Dr. Soon-Shiong with the unenviable task of owning a major daily paper at a time when the newspaper business is increasingly reliant on the support of deep-pocketed patrons. With the purchase, he would become the latest wealthy businessman to take ownership of a struggling newspaper in a big city, following Jeff Bezos with The Washington Post, John Henry with The Boston Globe and Sheldon Adelson with The Las Vegas Review-Journal. “We look forward to continuing the great tradition of award-winning journalism carried out by the reporters and editors of The Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune and the other California News Group titles,” Dr. Soon-Shiong said in a statement on Wednesday. Dr. Soon-Shiong — who grew up the son of Chinese immigrants in apartheid South Africa and largely made his fortune selling generic medicines and developing a new cancer drug — became a major Tronc shareholder and vice chairman two years ago as part of the company’s effort to stave off a takeover attempt by Gannett, the publisher of USA Today. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Dr. Soon-Shiong said he considered newspapers a “public trust.” But his relationship with Mr. Ferro soon deteriorated, leading to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s removal from Tronc’s board last year. He takes over one of the most decorated newspapers in the country, with 44 Pulitzer Prizes. But The Times has struggled in recent years as newspapers across the country have lost heft and cultural importance. Last decade, the paper weathered the cost-slashing reign of Samuel Zell, who took Tribune Company into bankruptcy. In 2014, after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings, the company spun off its newspaper division, creating Tribune Publishing. When Mr. Ferro, a Chicago entrepreneur and a former owner of The Chicago Sun-Times, took a major stake in Tribune Publishing in 2016, he introduced grand plans that included the use of artificial intelligence. He also rebranded the company as Tronc, which stood for Tribune online content, a name that has gotten laughs in newsrooms ever since. (The brand name appears formally as tronc, in lowercase letters, in company statements.) The Times, with bureaus in cities including Lagos and Rio de Janeiro, was to be the linchpin of Tronc’s global ambitions. But over the past year the paper proved too much to handle. In August, Tronc ousted top members of the Times management team, including Davan Maharaj, its editor and publisher, and installed the former Yahoo executive Ross Levisohn as publisher. Lewis D’Vorkin, a former chief product officer at Forbes, later joined the paper as editor in chief. Editors and reporters had hope for their new leaders, but the relationship quickly soured. After a recording of a staff meeting was leaked to The New York Times in the fall, Mr. D’Vorkin chastised employees, calling anyone involved in the leak “morally bankrupt.” Newsroom tensions rose. Last month, on the day when journalists at the paper celebrated their first successful unionization vote since its founding in 1881, Mr. Levinsohn was placed on leave after National Public Radio reported that he had been accused of sexual harassment at two previous jobs. Morale sank further with the suspension of the Times business editor Kimi Yoshino. To calm the discord, Tronc last week replaced Mr. D’Vorkin with Jim Kirk, a former publisher and editor of The Sun-Times, who had joined Tronc in August. Tronc said on Wednesday that its investigation into the publisher, Mr. Levinsohn, had found no wrongdoing. He will remain at the company in a new role: chief executive of a newly formed division called Tribune Interactive. Despite the tensions between the staff and Tronc leadership over the past year, Times reporters distinguished themselves with an investigation into the former dean of the medical school at the University of Southern California and their coverage of The Walt Disney Company’s ties to the city of Anaheim. “Our readers expect and deserve the high-quality, independent journalism that has defined The Times for decades,” The Times Guild steering committee said in a statement. “The L.A. Times Guild looks forward to working with a local owner who can help us preserve The Times as a guardian of our community and as the voice of the American West.” Inside The Times, there is hope that the paper might pursue a business model similar to those at The New York Times and The Washington Post, which have seen increases in paid subscriptions. But the future remains murky. The publisher job is open, and it was not immediately clear if Dr. Soon-Shiong plans to name a new top editor in place of Mr. Kirk. Dr. Soon-Shiong, a part owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, has a fortune that Forbes estimates at some $8 billion, but he is not so well known as some of the city’s other billionaires, including David Geffen and Eli Broad, whose names have surfaced in the past as potential buyers of The Times. Dr. Soon-Shiong, who donated to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and met with Donald J. Trump when he was the president-elect, has also come under scrutiny for his medical research and business dealings, leaving the Times newsroom with a new potential problem: an owner who is himself a newsworthy figure. At first glance, though, Dr. Soon-Shiong represents a welcome alternative to Tronc, whose scattershot plans have baffled some media analysts. “Their future under Tronc was just going to lurch from one crisis to the next, because Tronc’s strategy was so opaque and the quality of leadership they brought aboard was so dismal,” said Bill Grueskin, a professor at the Columbia Journalism School and a former top editor at Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal. “Almost anything has to be better than what they were facing.” "
429,"Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier described as a Nazi by the Illinois Republican Party, is poised to win the Republican primary in the state’s Third Congressional District. He is running unopposed, all but guaranteeing he will soon be the official Republican candidate for the House of Representatives. “There’s no way in the world they can knock me off the ballot,” said Mr. Jones, 70, who has unsuccessfully sought the nomination five times. His campaign website has a section devoted to conspiracy theories about the Holocaust, which he called “nothing more than an international extortion racket.” The Republican primary in the district, a Democratic stronghold that includes part of Chicago and its southwestern suburbs, is on March 20. A spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said it had difficulty recruiting anyone to run against Mr. Jones because “it is a very Democratic district.” The final deadline for certifying primary candidates passed last month, but the spokesman said the party would consider lending its support to an independent or write-in candidate. That deadline is in June, according to the State Board of Elections. “The Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones,” the Illinois Republican Party chairman, Tim Schneider, said in a statement. “We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the Third Congressional District.” Besides Mr. Jones himself, few say he stands a chance of winning the general election in November. A Republican has not held the seat since 1975. "

431,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Tesla’s much-awaited fourth quarter results. • Athenahealth names Jeff Immelt as chairman. • Senate leaders reach a deal to raise spending. • Shares of Snap jumped 40 percent after it reported results. • Trump: Investors are making a mistake. • What’s next for the Wynn empire now its founder has gone? • Send us your questions for the C.E.O.s of Merck, Stitch Fix and Salesforce for Corner Office. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The headline numbers were okay: Tesla reported a loss of $3.04 per share, narrower than the $3.20 per share that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were forecasting. Tesla took in $3.29 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, more or less in line with the $3.28 billion that analysts were expecting. But a crucial measure of profitability disappointed. Tesla’s gross margin in its automotive business, which reveals the profitability of actually producing its cars, came in at 13.8 percent, below the “about 15 percent” that Tesla itself forecast when it reported third-quarter results. The culprit? The Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market car. Many of the costs associated with the Model 3 are being booked in the income statement but difficulties in producing the car mean sales are low. As a result, the gross margin on the Model 3 was negative and is expected to remain so in the first quarter of 2018, Tesla said. The company did not specify how negative the gross margin on the Model 3 was. "
432,"For two weeks this month, the world’s attention will focus on Pyeongchang, South Korea, to marvel at the incredible athletics performed at the 2018 Winter Olympics. In this teaching resource, we suggest a variety of ways teachers across subjects — from English language arts to science and social studies — can turn these Olympics into opportunities for learning. But before they delve into the specifics, you might share this broad overview with your class: Your Questions About the 2018 Winter Olympics, Answered. There, they can learn everything from how to figure out what’s on when to why ski jumpers aren’t killed every time they jump. How are you teaching with the Olympics in your classroom? Let us know in the comments. _________ 1. Sports Writing Good sports writing brings readers directly to the action, so they can visualize the buzzer-beating 3-point shot, the game-changing interception or the nerve-racking back flip on the high beam. In writing about the 23-year-old American figure skater Jason Brown competing to a song from “Riverdance,” Patricia Lockwood paints a vivid scene: Have students read Ms. Lockwood’s description, as well as another capturing an action-filled sports moment, such as Ben Shpigel’s description of a decisive Super Bowl play: What do students notice about the writing? What literary techniques does the writer use? What words or descriptions stand out, and why? Then assign students to watch an Olympic event on TV and describe a dramatic sports moment in detail, paying close attention to word choice, sentence structure and tone. For fun, you can ask students to remove any references to the actual name of the sport in their descriptions, and then have them read their sports moment aloud. The rest of the class should listen carefully and try to name the Olympic event. _________ 2. Global Politics In “How South Korea Left the North Behind,” The Times explores how the two countries have diverged in the last 30 years: Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have sharply escalated recently, with North Korea firing a ballistic missile over Japan and threatening to launch missiles into waters near Guam, and President Trump mocking the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man,” and Mr. Kim responding by calling Mr. Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” But then the Olympics approached, and suddenly the tone seems to have changed. Athletes from North and South Korea will march under one flag; the two countries will field a joint women’s hockey team; and a North Korean pop orchestra will stage performances in South Korea during the Games. Do the 2018 Winter Olympics offer a real chance to ease political and nuclear tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula? Have students watch the video ”Can the Olympics Bring the Koreas Together?” and read the related article. Then have students argue, in writing or discussion: Will the 2018 Winter Olympics be a turning point in relations between North Korea and South Korea? Are these latest overtures of cooperation and civility the beginning of a new chapter? Can sports actually promote peace? Or is something else going on? _________ 3. Design and Fashion The Olympics are more than just an athletic competition; they are a fashion runway as well, especially during the opening and closing ceremonies. In her Nov. 2 On the Runway column, Vanessa Friedman wrote in anticipation of this year’s Games: She continued: Have students read the entire column — especially so they can consider how “one of the biggest challenges of designing for the Olympics is balancing national pride and technical needs.” Then, ask students to watch an event at the Olympics, such as the opening ceremony or men’s curling (this 2010 video provides some context), from a fashion critic’s point of view. They should choose one country’s outfits — perhaps their favorite or the most interesting — and describe the clothing in writing. Then, assign students to propose a new clothing design for a country, perhaps for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo or the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. They should draw a sketch and write a description. Alternatively, they can design a unified Korean team logo for the North Korean and South Korean athletes who will march together under one flag, or a logo for Russian athletes who will compete under a neutral flag as an Olympic AthleteFrom Russia, or OAR. They can submit their designs to The Times by Feb. 9, and some designs may get published. _________ 4. Geography Over 90 countries are taking part in the 2018 Winter Olympics, and that means students can explore geography while watching their favorite sports. Have students select a participating country, research that country’s performance in previous Winter Games and keep track of the up-to-date 2018 medal count. They can also read relevant news articles by selecting their country from the pull-down menu on the Pyeongchang 2018 Game News page. For additional context, students could research their country’s history, culture and geography and how they might affect its performance in the Winter Games. At the end of the Olympics, students can present an overview of their country’s performance at the Games and what they learned. To turn this research into a competition with other students around the world, the class can participate in Fan School’s Olympics challenge. For this challenge, students must make predictions by the end of the opening ceremony on Feb. 9 about medal counts as well as news coverage in The Times. To help make their predictions, students can use this interactive displaying medal results at the Winter Games from 1924 to 2014. _________ 5. Physics Have students use the language of physics to describe what is taking place in various Olympic events. To help them deconstruct athletic feats like the quadruple jump in figure skating or the backside double-cork 1080 in snowboard slopestyle, students can use Times interactives that slow down and narrate the action in the following sports: Figure skating (augmented reality)
Giant slalom
Halfpipe snowboarding
Ice hockey (augmented reality)
Luge
Short-track speedskating and Short track (augmented reality)
Ski jumping
Snowboard slopestyle and Slopestyle (augmented reality) Make sure they use relevant academic vocabulary they have studied in class, such as kinetic energy, angular momentum, friction and aerodynamics. To continue exploring physics, visit our 2010 lesson plan “Getting Physical: The Physics and Other Science Behind Winter Olympic Sports.” _________ 6. Argument Writing and Discussion Any event that brings together delegations from over 90 countries for two weeks is bound to stir up some controversies and questions. Teachers can use these issues as prompts for argument writing and discussion before, during and after the Olympics. Each prompt includes a link to a related Times article. Note: The list below is just a starting place, since certainly more issues will arise before the Games are completed. 1. Did the International Olympic Committee make the right decision in banning Russia from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics because of state-backed doping during the 2014 Sochi Games? Did it make the right decision in allowing Russian athletes who can prove they are “clean” to compete under a neutral flag? 2. Did the National Hockey League make the right decision not to hold a three-week break during its season to allow players to participate in the Winter Games, as they did in 2014? 3. Did North and South Korean politicians make the right decision in deciding to field a joint women’s hockey team for the sake of “a grand gesture of sports diplomacy”? Is the decision unfair to the individual players who have worked hard to get to the Olympics, yet might lose playing time or be benched for some games? 4. How anxious should the world be about holding the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, “in the shadow of a nuclear standoff” and just 50 miles from the world’s most heavily fortified border? Should participating countries hesitate to send their delegations because of North Korea’s recent nuclear and ICBM tests? Should visitors be reluctant to attend the Games this year? _________ 7. South Korea Ask students: How much do you know about South Korea? They can do a quick-write and pair-share. Then, have them take our Country of the Week quiz, which tests students on their map skills, along with their geography and culture knowledge. Next, invite students to plan a last-minute trip to the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. They can use this Times guide to figure out logistics for a visit to the Olympics. And have them tack on extra vacation time after the Games to experience more of South Korea. They can use the Times Travel section, the internet and guidebooks to do their planning. The final product can be a written day-by-day itinerary, including location, activities and highlights, plus a travel map. Here’s an example of a possible entry: Day 10
Location: Busan, South Korea
Activities: Jagalchi market, Busan Sea Life Aquarium, Dongbaekseom Park and Haeundae Beach
Day’s Highlight: Wander the stalls and fish tanks at the Jagalchi market to see rows and rows of seafood caught fresh that morning. Buy a fish, then head upstairs to one of the small restaurants to have it cooked — and eat it with chopsticks! "
433,"MEXICO CITY — Immigration has been on the United States-Mexico agenda for years. In recent times, three American attempts at comprehensive immigration reform, which included amnesty for undocumented Mexicans in the United States and a temporary-worker visa program, have failed. A bilateral effort between 2001 and 2003 also collapsed. Nothing affects Mexico more than United States immigration policy, and the centrality of the issue in American politics is more prominent than ever. The most urgent challenge is to find a way forward for the so-called Dreamers, the beneficiaries of President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Nearly 800,000 young people brought to the United States by their parents as children applied for and were given protected status by the Obama administration. Thanks to DACA, they no longer needed to fear deportation, were able to work legally and had realistic hopes that one day they would be on a path to citizenship in the only country they knew. More than three-fourths of the Dreamers are Mexican. That’s why people here follow their fate closely. President Trump rescinded Mr. Obama’s DACA policy. He has proposed a four-pillar overhaul of American immigration policy that most Democrats and Latinos in the United States detest. Strangely enough, however, it might benefit Mexico, especially if it is accompanied by additional changes in the issuance of temporary-worker visas, and in particular those known as H-2A and H-2B. The first pillar of Mr. Trump’s proposal — regularizing the status of the Dreamers and a million other young people who also could qualify for DACA status with a long and winding road to citizenship — works to Mexico’s advantage. Somewhere near 1.5 million of these young people are Mexican; that is roughly one-quarter of all undocumented Mexican citizens in the United States. Granting them the equivalent of amnesty, with the beacon of eventual citizenship, satisfies one of Mexico’s most crucial immigration demands. The second pillar — $25 billion for a border wall — is obviously offensive to Mexico, but the country’s lame-duck president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has been much more adamant in his opposition to paying for the wall than to its actual construction. Mr. Peña Nieto either doesn’t believe it will ever see the light of day or lacks the backbone to oppose it. But Mr. Trump’s wall is something Mexico can simultaneously reject and live with, particularly if it will take years to build and if it merely complements segments of fences erected by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. Mr. Trump’s third pillar is the most insulting for many Americans, since it eliminates the family reunification principle for accepting legal immigrants from abroad. Intended to deter “chain migration,” it would replace the family criterion with a merit-based system. In the future, only spouses and underage offspring (as opposed to parents and siblings today) of American citizens would be allowed permanent residence, and eventually citizenship. The net effect would be to “whiten” immigration and limit the share of Mexicans. Since the largest group of foreigners applying for family reunification is by far Mexican (three times as many as Chinese citizens, for example), this would reduce the number of applicants from Mexico who get green cards. Nearly 200,000 Mexicans got green cards in fiscal year 2016; halving that number through a lengthy and tedious procedure that frustrates many Mexicans would not be as bad as shutting down the whole program. The last pillar would suppress the lottery system that grants a small number of immigrant visas to applicants from underrepresented nations, mainly African. Again, this would surely “whiten” immigration and is thus a despicable proposal, but it does not affect Mexico. There is no lottery system for Mexicans. So, viewed somewhat cynically from the perspective of strict Mexican national interests, the four-pillar plan has inconveniences for Mexico but also many advantages. That it is racist as well as unworthy of the American immigration ideal and inflames the worst demons in American society is another matter. As Mr. Trump says, countries have to look out for their own interests. To make this plan attractive to Mexico, its leaders need to persuade the American president to increase the number of temporary-worker visas. Again, by far the largest number of these permits are extended to Mexicans. H-2A visas, for seasonal agricultural workers, have no congressional cap; H-2B visas, for seasonal nonagricultural activities, do, but it can be lifted and has been for several years. The Trump administration can increase these numbers significantly without congressional approval. An immense reconstruction effort is underway in Texas and Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and, with virtual full employment, there is a huge demand for low-skilled, low-wage labor in those regions. It can come only from Mexico. Were Mr. Peña Nieto to make such a suggestion and were Mr. Trump to accept it, both countries’ interests would be well served. In the early years of this century, a comprehensive package like this was called “the whole enchilada.” Half a loaf, or whatever nutritional metaphor one prefers, is not bad. "
434,"To the Editor: Re “Lawyers Tell Trump to Refuse Mueller Interview” (front page, Feb. 6): So, Donald Trump’s attorneys do not want him to answer the special counsel’s questions pertaining to the Russia investigation because they fear that: 1) he will not tell the truth and thus could be charged with lying to investigators or 2) he will tell the truth and thus incriminate himself for crimes he may have committed or 3) both of the above. What a very sad state of affairs for this country when the president cannot be relied upon, or not permitted, to tell the truth. RICHARD M. CLAYTON
LEWISVILLE, N.C. To the Editor: The very idea of letting an unsupervised President Trump answer questions from Robert Mueller’s attorneys must be making Mr. Trump’s attorneys’ hair stand on end and their teeth start chattering. The Trump approach of making things up as he goes along, his childish exaggerations and his outright lying could have disastrous effects on their job tenure, not to mention his. SHIRLEY STUART, BERKELEY, CALIF. "
435,"The border between the United States and Mexico is in the news every day, in ongoing debates about immigration and spending on security initiatives. But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; El Paso and Ciudad Juárez; Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales across the border in Mexico; San Diego and Tijuana; Big Bend National Park and Boquillas, Mexico. “You’ve arrived,” announced our obliviously cheerful GPS navigator, as my buddy and I stared, white-knuckled and slightly teary-eyed, at a padlocked gate barely illuminated by the headlights of our rented S.U.V. We’d already traversed 9.2 hair-raising miles of a twisty, sandy unpaved road that an early-December freeze had turned into icy slush, our tires shifting side to side, our high beams no match for the pitch-black darkness. And now we were wondering what it was going to be like to spend the night in the car, in a vast, sparsely populated patch of far West Texas. But, after a few deep breaths and a modicum of quarreling, we carefully reversed course and slipped and slid 9.2 miles back to the main road, taking comfort in the jackrabbits playfully crossing our path in a single bound and Don Williams serenading us with “I Believe in You” on the satellite radio (“I don’t believe … that right is right and left is wrong, and north and south can’t get along”). Back on blessed pavement, and this time following the explicit instructions I had confidently ignored, we made our way to Terlingua Ranch, a community nestled in the snow-dusted Christmas Mountains, to a gorgeous rental house (where, incidentally, the heat would malfunction and we’d sleep fully clothed in a 41-degree bedroom, blue with cold and tickled pink to be alive). It’s hard to convey how humbling it is to visit this little pocket of the United States-Mexico border, a place the National Park Service calls “one of the last remaining wild corners of the United States.” Boosters market Texas as a “whole other country,” but the land within and without Big Bend National Park really is. One of the least-visited of the federal park system, Big Bend is four hours by car from each of the nearest international airports, in El Paso and Midland. You have to really want to get here (or live here, which makes you a different breed altogether). And those who do, those inclined to make the long trek to the park and its attendant ghost towns (Lajitas, Study Butte, Terlingua), are seekers of a sort, not entirely unlike the homesteaders and fortune hunters drawn to these badlands long ago. But nowadays the treasures are silence and darkness and undeveloped natural beauty and all those other things that seem to be in short supply of late. If you’re longing for a respite from this era’s relentless beeping and buzzing and yelling and “Dear God, what now?” news alerts, what better place than one with limited cell service and unreliable electricity, where you step outside in the morning and hear nothing but the grumbling of your stomach and the muffled flap of a bird’s wings high above? Big Bend’s dramatic confluence of river, desert, and mountains makes it easy to wax poetic with words like “majestic” and “epic,” and even those fall short. There’s enough in these 800,000 acres for a lifetime of exploring, the tangible result of a landscape that has borne witness to shallow sea and coastal plain and volcanic upheaval. Eons of geological time are visible in everything from the walls of a towering canyon to the dull, dusty stone at your feet that hides the lacy remains of some ancient sea creature. From the grassy banks of the Rio Grande to the cactus-studded expanse of the Chihuahuan Desert to the oak-and-juniper-carpeted Chisos Mountains, Big Bend is a dream for photographers, a paradise for birders (more than 400 species), the promised land for amateur (and professional) geologists. Huge swaths of land are accessible for day hikes and backpacking (200 miles of trails), camping and river trips. More specifically, there’s the Fossil Discovery Exhibit, where you can gaze upon a life-size replica of the skull of a Bravoceratops (“wild horn-face”), pieces of which were unearthed in the park in 2011. At the Boquillas Hot Spring, situated smack-dab against the Rio Grande, you can sink into a 105-degree pool contained by the remnants of an early 1900s bathhouse and dangle an arm over the rock boundary into the swift-moving, considerably colder water as it passes you by on its 1,900-mile journey to the Gulf of Mexico. (Some advice: Decide when you’re going to visit ahead of time, so that you can don the proper attire in advance. There are no changing rooms, and the vault toilets are like something out of “Trainspotting.” I’d like to take this moment to apologize to whichever park ranger found the bra I left behind in my haste to get out of there.) At any location in or near the park, you can simply look to the ever-changing sky, particularly in the evening, when fiery sunsets of pink and orange and dusty blue give way to an unfathomable darkness spattered with a breathtaking bounty of stars, including a clearly visible Milky Way (Big Bend is a stargazing mecca, officially designated by the International Dark-Sky Association); like me, you may have the stupefying realization that this is what the night sky actually looks like. If you do nothing else but motor around in your car, you’ll have a blast. On our various drives, my friend and I spotted a little family of javelina lumbering across the blacktop, a coyote leaping effortlessly over a fence, numerous roadrunners dashing headlong across the pavement, and a golden eagle resting in some creosote along the side of the road, as if patiently waiting to cross. Finally, where else can you, at least for now, cross the border into Mexico in a rowboat? The Rio Grande (or the Río Bravo del Norte, from a southerly perspective) is all that separates Texas and Mexico within the boundaries of the park, winding its way for 118 miles between forbidding canyon walls; making the abrupt southeast to northeast shift that gives Big Bend its name; and changing in color (chocolate milk in one light, celadon in another) and flow (sometimes grande, often pequeño). There’s hardly a more delightful way to pass over a border; on our first of two trips, we had barely rounded the bend of the descending trail from the Boquillas Crossing Port of Entry before a young man in a “Houston Strong” T-shirt was rowing his way across the river to get us in a waterlogged metal boat, the “seats” covered in what looked like bathmats. It’s $10 round-trip for this makeshift ferry, which hauls its tiny load of camera-wielding tourists back and forth all day during official crossing hours. Once on shore it’s up the hill by foot, burro, or bed of pickup truck to a trailer, where your passport is stamped and you’re granted formal entry into Boquillas del Carmen, the colorful, sparsely settled remains of a former mining town. Borders are always porous, particularly the riverine kind, and so it goes for this one. “Maps that split country into zones of topography, climate, vegetation, and such things have much more neatly sweeping lines of demarcation than nature has usually been willing to go along with,” wrote John Graves, Texas’s beloved chronicler of land and lore, and that goes for people too. For decades the Boquillas border crossing was decidedly informal, illegal but never monitored, a conduit for supplies, a lifeline for loved ones residing on opposite sides, a day’s amusement for tourists. But it always was an international boundary and as such subject to the day’s prevailing sociopolitical anxieties. The crossing was shut down in 2002, in response to Sept. 11, and reopened 11 years later, this time with automated passport control. And now looms another threat. In Boquillas proper, the specter of the wall seems to be just that, haunting the dish towels and koozies for sale on every corner, their hand-embroidered wildflowers, roosters, and javelinas accompanied, in slightly crooked letters, by a simple phrase: “No wall.” A succinct “Trump no bueno” was all we got from a congenial gentleman who walked us into town, that and the declaration in small black letters on his white baseball cap: “The border makes America great” (that message brought to you by El Paso’s Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic congressman running against Senator Ted Cruz in November). The people here exhibit a sort of seen-it-all-before serenity, which seems appropriate, as this battle royal is going down a few miles from rock formations whose strata reveal the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, i.e., a visible record of the extinction event 66 million years ago. Existential musings aside, a visit to this village of a few hundred people feels much as it has for years. We perused the blankets and molcajetes at the shop at José Falcon’s, then took a seat on the colorful patio of the adjoining restaurant for cheese enchiladas, clay copitas of sotol and sweeping views of the Sierra del Carmen range (and, incidentally, a fellow skinning rabbits and goats next door). The joy in a trip to Boquillas, other than its old-world charm, is the hospitality of the people, allowing a visitor brief proximity to the kind of community you’d expect to find in a remote, only recently electrified town 150 miles away from the nearest city. At Boquillas Restaurant, the proprietor offered to give us the souvenirs we happily picked out before realizing we had run out of cash (had too many of the excellent margaritas). We promised we’d return the next day, which we did, to find our items waiting for us in a neat pile on the counter. “Here’s a song about building bridges instead of walls,” said singer-songwriter Trevor Reichman, the featured talent the night we visited the Starlight Theatre, Terlingua’s main watering hole and music venue. As in Boquillas, you can walk the length of this onetime mining camp in a couple of minutes. And you’ll meet eccentric locals who possess the same equanimity that comes from living in isolated and unpredictable terrain. You’ll even detect the same age-old tension between insider and outsider, though the boundaries are a little less fraught. This seemed to me best encapsulated by a sign on the door of a nearby shop that trades in rocks and cactuses and sundry dusty things: “Keep investors, hipsters, and trust-fund babies out of Terlingua. Just look at what happened to Marfa.” Of course, right next to that is another sign, this one directing customers to just slide a check or cash under the door if there’s no one minding the store. Out here one ranch flies the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag; next door is “Just Resist.” But it seems, to this outsider, at least, that once again community trumps ideological differences among people who look out for one another and demonstrate a surprising forbearance of city folk unaccustomed to the extremes of weather and limits of technology, city folk who awake night after night to the howling of coyotes and, in the morning, find their prints in the frosty dust outside the door. Over an excellent made-from-scratch breakfast at the Bad Rabbit at the Terlingua Ranch Lodge (“Do you want your grits thick or runny? Eggs soft or hard?”), our server warned us away from an “unimproved” road to a nearby city, because of course we hadn’t learned our lesson from the start of our trip. “You’ll have an adventure whether you plan it or not,” she said, after we regaled her with our back-road brush with death (from embarrassment, likely). She’s right. Heed warnings regarding rapidly changing weather and full tanks of fuel. Follow directions, literal and otherwise, regarding flashlights and high-clearance vehicles, snakes and scorpions. Avoid the entire area altogether during the more temperate weeks of Spring Break and Thanksgiving (or, as our white-hatted friend in Boquillas put it, “the fiesta of the turkey”). Do all that and you’ll have a wonderful experience, against a backdrop of almost inconceivable magnificence, along a stretch of border where, for now, you can climb to the top of a bluff pockmarked with perfectly round mortar holes left by ancient civilizations, look down on the gently moving river, and wave to people on the other side, a stone’s throw away and a world apart.

From reality TV to the White House and back again — it’s been quite a ride for Omarosa Manigault Newman, who left the Trump administration last month under disputed circumstances. She’ll go from being a communications director to being shut off from the outside world in the first American celebrity iteration of “Big Brother.” Eleven contestants, who also include the former basketball player Metta World Peace and Keshia Knight Pulliam of “The Cosby Show,” will make small talk, form friendships, bicker and betray one another under 24-hour surveillance; they compete for a $250,000 grand prize.

After registering a 1.7 percent gain on Tuesday, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index spent much of Wednesday in positive territory, led by large industrial companies positioned to capitalize on global growth and investors hunting for potential bargains from recent selling. But slumping oil prices weighed on the energy stocks throughout the afternoon. Crude oil futures closed down 2.5 percent in New York. Exxon Mobil fell 1.8 percent, and Chevron dropped 1.6 percent. The energy sector, which fell 1.7 percent, helped pull the S.&P. 500 back into negative territory in the last hour of trading. The broad index fell 0.5 percent. Other indexes also dropped. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9 percent. "

442,"‘America first does not mean America alone,” President Trump declared last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This sudden burst of pragmatism from an avowed nationalist showed what a difference a year can make. Denouncing the “false song of globalism” during his presidential campaign, Trump, on his third full day in office, canceled the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade deal with Japan and 10 other countries. He then denounced Canada, Germany and South Korea for exporting more to the United States than they import. He promised to renegotiate trade pacts with Europe, Canada and Mexico and get a better deal for American workers. In Davos, however, he reached out with conciliatory words to the very free-trading and globalizing elites he has consistently maligned. Clearly, Trump’s views on trade and globalization have evolved since his insurgent campaign. This may well be because of the rapid gains in the past year of a country he did not mention by name. In fact, Trump chose in Davos to affirm that “America is open for business” because it was in these same Alpine heights, three days before Trump was inaugurated as president, that China seized the opportunity to claim leadership of the global economy. With the United States seemingly in a protectionist crouch, China had become, despite all its problems, indispensable. “In a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China,” Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, said last year while introducing his guest, the Chinese president and general secretary of China’s Communist Party, Xi Jinping. As the usual gaggle of hedge-funders, Silicon Valley executives and government officials looked on, Xi rose to defend free trade and globalization against the relentless attacks of Trump. “Some people blame economic globalization for the chaos in our world,” Xi said. “One should not retreat to the harbor when encountering a storm, for this will never get us to the other shore of the ocean.” Xi then confidently quoted Dickens. “ ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ These are the words used by the English writer Charles Dickens to describe the world after the Industrial Revolution. Today, we also live in a world of contradictions.” Never mind that Dickens was actually describing the world before the French Revolution. Xi’s claim of openness was, to say the least, riddled with contradictions of its own. It is increasingly difficult for foreign companies to do business in China; Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial policy aims to increase “indigenous innovation” and self-reliance. When Trump, a year later in Davos, denounced such “unfair economic practices” as “industrial subsidies and pervasive state-led economic planning,” there was little doubt which nation he had in mind. Yet Xi is entitled to some of his rhetorical point-scoring. The financial crisis of 2008 greatly weakened the American economy, but it left China relatively unscathed. More important, China, whose share of world trade in the mid-1970s was less than 0.5 percent, is today the world’s leading exporter — the hub of new and increasingly dense transcontinental trading networks that bypass the United States. “When the United States grows, so does the world,” Trump claimed in Davos. But America’s status as the linchpin of the global economic order is now endangered. The trading system China dominates has reduced the long dependency of Latin American and sub-Saharan African countries on American and European markets. China is now bringing to a close the first phase of globalization, begun by Europe and the United States in the 19th century. In the process, it is making East Asia the new center of the world economy. It has fallen upon Trump, as president of the United States, to respond to this momentous historic shift, and he has done so with his characteristic mix of threats, boasts and volte-faces. But to grasp China’s economic achievement, and its ramifications, it is imperative to ask: Why has a market economy directed by a Communist state become the world’s second-largest? Or, to rephrase the question: Why shouldn’t it have? Why shouldn’t China’s rise have happened the way it did, with state-led economic planning, industrial subsidies and little or no regard for the rules of “free trade”? "

447,"BERLIN — After more than four months of tortuous negotiations, with her fate and Germany’s hanging in the balance, Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday announced a deal for a new government. But it was telling that Ms. Merkel, in power for 12 years, looked more weary than jubilant. The new deal with the same old coalition partners — her conservative alliance and the left-leaning Social Democrats — is precisely the government that Germans had voted against in inconclusive elections last September. It leaves the far-right Alternative for Germany as the country’s leading opposition party. And it comes at a high cost for Ms. Merkel, the incredible shrinking chancellor, who had to relinquish key ministries. But what is troubling for many Germans is not necessarily bad news for Europe, which for years has depended on stability in Berlin and has been waiting in limbo as Ms. Merkel stumbled toward a deal. The new arrangement must still be approved by the Social Democrats’ rank and file. But if endorsed, the coalition may provide France’s new president, Emmanuel Macron, with the partner he has been looking for to help buck up the European Union and move it away from the austerity policies that were identified with Ms. Merkel’s old team and often blamed for stifling growth. “Good news also for Europe!” tweeted Pierre Moscovici, the French finance commissioner of the European Union. In the new coalition, the powerful German Finance Ministry, once led by a hard-line Merkel ally, Wolfgang Schäuble, will be run by a Social Democrat. The party was critical of the government’s tightfisted policies and may prove more flexible. “A slightly weakened Germany could be one of the things that helps create a sense of a more balanced Europe,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. “Certainly, the fact that Wolfgang Schäuble is not finance minister will be greeted with enormous relief,” he said, referring to anger in parts of Europe over painful austerity measures after the eurozone crisis. It is hard to overstate the scope of German influence over European affairs during the Merkel era, especially in economic policy. Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Mr. Schäuble became the face of the German-led austerity policies imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece. Even as the Obama administration and an array of economists called for looser policies, the Germans held firm. Beyond economics, Ms. Merkel has been the rock of European foreign policy, demanding a tough line on maintaining economic sanctions against Russia after the conflict in Ukraine while other European countries were far less enthusiastic. And it has been Ms. Merkel who has pointedly stood up to President Trump, to the cheers of many Europeans and others who have embraced her as a defender of the liberal order. But now the political landscape has shifted, not only in Germany, but also elsewhere in Europe. The rise of Mr. Macron in France, if celebrated by those who support a stronger European Union, is also being interpreted as a rebalancing of power away from Berlin. But France still needs Germany, not least to help bridge a growing rift between east and west on the Continent. Nationalist leaders in Central and Eastern Europe, led by Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, are challenging the liberal consensus at the heart of the European bloc. The window to reshape Europe is short: Come fall, the last leg of the Brexit talks, a hard-fought election in the German state of Bavaria and the prospect of European elections will make it harder. The answer of Ms. Merkel and the Social Democrats — in no small part to persuade Germans that their “grand coalition” straddling left and right was still needed — was to cast their lot fully with the mission to salvage the European project. In what is otherwise a fairly unexciting governing pact, the Europe chapter — short and vague, but prominently displayed on the first five pages of the 177-page document — stands out. “A New Departure for Europe!” its ambitious headline reads, before listing proposals that include working toward greater powers for the European Parliament and creating a European Monetary Fund to help protect the eurozone against financial crises. Not all of Mr. Macron’s most prominent proposals, like a European finance minister, are featured in the coalition document. But Germany will increase its contribution to the European Union budget, the paper pledges. And it will cooperate with Europe on defense and migration. “It’s the first time that Europe is the first chapter in a German coalition treaty,” said Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. “This is a clear signal that the government wants to work with President Macron on reforming and strengthening Europe.” “On the open-to-closed spectrum, this was a signal for openness,” he added. But unlike in France, where Mr. Macron ran on a transparently pro-European platform, campaigning with a European flag and playing the European anthem on election night, Europe hardly featured on the German campaign trail. “The challenge is that this was never tested in a real election,” Mr. Leonard said. Alternative for Germany immediately dismissed Wednesday’s deal as proof that Europe’s elites were ignoring the concerns of ordinary voters once again. “One wonders, why Mr. Macron doesn’t just move into the Chancellery,” scoffed Alexander Gauland, a former member of Ms. Merkel’s conservatives who became a lawmaker for Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD. Ms. Merkel’s conservatives, he said, had betrayed their values and become “an empty shell.” The fact that the Interior Ministry’s portfolio was broadened to include a “heimat” — homeland — department to address issues of identity and integration did nothing to appease the AfD. Björn Höcke, a well-known far-right firebrand in the party, called the coalition deal “un-German.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, a tired-looking Ms. Merkel praised the deal as the “basis of a good and stable government, which our country needs, and which many around the world expect from us.” For many, the coalition deal represented a bittersweet success, a sort of short-term fix with potentially steep political costs: a backlash in the making that could push ever more voters to the extremes. In the two years since Ms. Merkel opened Germany’s door to more than a million migrants, the country’s political landscape has changed drastically, and much of the chancellor’s ability to forge consensus has eroded. All three parties now returning to government had their worst election results since the 1940s. “The Merkel era is synonymous with a strong and stable Germany; that’s what we had for the last decade,” Mr. Enderlein said. “That era is coming to an end. And we don’t yet know what comes after.” There is no guarantee that this coalition will last a full term, he said. There is not even a guarantee that it will happen: The unhappy grass roots of the Social Democratic Party still need to approve it by postal ballot and many balk at the thought. Two stints as Ms. Merkel’s junior partners saw the party’s vote share slump from 34 percent in 2005 to 20 percent in September. Recent polls give it 17 percent support, just two percentage points more than the AfD. Some worry that another four years in a coalition could see the AfD overtake the Social Democrats. But the alternative may be no better: If the coalition collapses and Germany is forced to call a snap election, the extremes will benefit — both inside and outside the main parties, analysts predict. “This is the worst possible outcome,” said Mr. Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations, “except for all the other ones.” "

449,"It has been over six years since I last floated in zero gravity through the tunnel that connects the space shuttle to the International Space Station. I visited this orbiting laboratory on four occasions between 2001 and 2011. Every time I approached the station, I was in awe of its complexity and its beauty. But more than anything, I was in awe of the fact that we had the nerve to even attempt to build something of this magnitude. It was the United States that led the international coalition of 16 nations to build the space station. Constructing this outpost in outer space took dozens of missions spanning well over a decade to complete, and considerable money. It is clearly one of the more complicated engineering projects humans have undertaken. It’s not perfect and it’s not designed to last forever, but what the International Space Station offers humans and nations is remarkable: an important opportunity to collaborate on shared scientific goals, mostly free from politics and almost entirely free from the influences of our planet. In the years since I left NASA, the space station has started to experience a surge in commercial activity. Two companies, SpaceX and Orbital ATK, now regularly deliver cargo to the station. Just this week, SpaceX launched the Falcon 9 Heavy, a rocket powerful enough to lift 141,000-pound payloads. And after a few years’ hiatus, crew members will once again leave American soil for space and make their way to the space station as soon as next year, courtesy of Boeing and SpaceX. There’s more: The aerospace company Sierra Nevada is planning to deliver cargo in the near future. And Bigelow Aerospace has visions of private customers paying to visit the space station, staying overnight in an attached inflatable module built by the company — a hotel in space. The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, a nongovernmental organization, now manages commercial science for the space station. And as the cost of access to low earth orbit continues to decline, more opportunities for commerce in space will emerge, with the International Space Station at the nexus and the United States at the helm. But all of this will come to a screeching halt (though you won’t hear the “screech” in the vacuum of space) if the Trump administration ends funding for the International Space Station program beyond 2024, a step it is  considering. The reasons are unclear, though President Trump has said that he wants to prioritize human travel to the moon. Whatever the priorities, this sort of trade-off is shortsighted. Cutting funding for the station, now between $3 billion and $4 billion a year, would be a step backward for the space agency and certainly not in the best interest of the country. Over the past year, the United States abandoned its leadership position on the global stage in many ways. We stopped leading the effort to combat climate change. We stopped leading on trade and commerce, and raised questions about our continued commitment to multilateral organizations and military alliances. We stopped leading on human rights and the rule of law. If we fail to continue funding the International Space Station, America will sacrifice its rank as the global leader in space exploration and commercial space innovation. NASA programs have benefited the people of our planet since the founding of the agency in 1958. Solar technology, miniaturized computer chips, CT scans and M.R.I.s are just a few examples of the technologies that were developed and delivered to the American consumer as a result of NASA’s innovation. Because of our country’s leadership, we benefited first and we benefited the most. Much more than any other country, in fact. Funding scientific research is one of the most productive ways to put taxpayers’ dollars to work. It not only creates jobs but also creates industries that otherwise would never exist. It’s easy to see how a dollar spent on our space program is returned to the taxpayer many times over. Budgeting is about making tough choices, but to abandon one of our most successful and innovative endeavors — one in which we are the global leader — just as it is clearly transitioning to a hub of commercial activity would be extremely shortsighted. Other countries will undoubtedly fill the void left by American withdrawal — most notably China and Russia, countries we consider significant rivals. Not only would they reap the economic and political benefits of leading in space but they also could change the direction of the world’s collective space endeavors in a way inimical to American interests and values. If we want our nation to continue leading in space, fully funding NASA’s existing programs is absolutely essential. And if we want to some day send astronauts back to the moon or to Mars, we need to fund those efforts as well. It might seem costly in the short term, but the return is well worth the investment. "
450,"An F.B.I. investigation into the mysterious death of a Border Patrol agent found unconscious off a remote West Texas highway in November has been unable to determine how he was injured, though the bureau said on Wednesday that it had found no evidence suggesting he had been attacked. In a statement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it could not find anyone who had witnessed the episode in which the agent, Rogelio Martinez, was killed besides his partner, Stephen Garland, who survived but has no recollection of what happened. “This investigation has not conclusively determined how Mr. Martinez and his partner ended up at the bottom of the culvert and no suspects have been linked to this incident,” the F.B.I. said. Just hours after the agents, who had been on duty, were found in a dark culvert off Interstate 10, about 100 miles east of El Paso, politicians seized on the news as a flash point in a broader debate about immigration and border security. President Trump called it an “attack” and further evidence that a wall was needed along the United States’ border with Mexico. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said it underscored the constant dangers of safeguarding often rugged and remote terrain. But the F.B.I. report makes clear that the authorities knew very little in the moments after the episode. There was, however, a faint clue: Disoriented and injured, Mr. Garland called a Border Patrol dispatcher for backup because they had both been injured. He also said something about running into a culvert, but the dispatcher could not make out exactly what he said. "

452,"WASHINGTON — When the White House wants to gather evangelicals for one of its many issue-specific “listening sessions,” the Rev. Johnnie Moore is often one of the first to hear. It wasn’t always clear that Mr. Moore, a 34-year-old Southern Baptist minister who was a co-chairman of the Trump campaign’s evangelical advisory board, would be a frequent White House guest. Some critics, and even some evangelicals, wondered whether conservative Christians’ sometimes uneasy alliance with the Trump campaign was a marriage of convenience that would be abandoned after Inauguration Day. But one year in, conservative religious leaders are hailing the president’s actions in office. “This White House, the front door is open to evangelicals,” said Mr. Moore, who estimates that he has visited at least 20 times since Mr. Trump took office, averaging nearly once every other week. “It hasn’t been evangelicals reaching into the White House. It’s been the White House reaching out to evangelicals. Not a day goes by when there aren’t a dozen evangelical leaders in the White House for something.” This week will be a culmination of those ties. On Thursday, Mr. Moore will join what he calls the “Super Bowl for peacemakers” here: the annual National Prayer Breakfast, where around 3,000 clergy members, politicians and business leaders will eat, network and listen to speeches, including one from President Trump. Mr. Trump will stand before an audience that has cheered the president’s first-year agenda as its own: announcing that the American Embassy in Israel would move to Jerusalem, anointing a national “prayer Sunday,” appointing Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, signing anti-abortion legislation, opening a “conscience and religious freedom division” at the Department of Health and Human Services and fighting to end the Johnson Amendment, which threatens religious organizations with the loss of their tax-exempt status if they endorse political candidates. Many evangelicals did not see such a list of accomplishments as inevitable. Mr. Trump’s formal evangelical advisory board ended with the campaign. But his continued attention to evangelical causes is not a coincidence. Mr. Moore and others have helped remnants of the board remain active in the White House, providing the administration with a constellation of religious figures to lend its platform gravitas among evangelicals. Mr. Moore, a former Liberty University vice president who now lives in California, is one of around a half-dozen original members of the evangelical advisory group who pays regular visits to the White House, which can start with policy briefings from West Wing staff and agency officials and end with impromptu visits to the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will banter, then pray, with them. The group, which also includes Tim Clinton, Robert Jeffress, Darrell Scott, Samuel Rodriguez and Paula White, who has been called Mr. Trump’s personal “spiritual adviser,” is a frequent and influential voice in the ears of senior administration officials. Jennifer Korn, who as a deputy director of the public liaison office manages contact between the White House and faith groups, sends out invitations to policy briefings and the “listening sessions.” Ms. Korn invites senior West Wing advisers such as Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Kellyanne Conway to visit the groups, which range from 20 to 100 guests and are often tied to specific faith-related legislation, executive orders and court appointments. Ms. Trump recently sat in on a meeting with female faith leaders that Mr. Moore and Mr. Jeffress attended. “We are the front door to the White House,” Ms. Korn said, echoing Mr. Moore’s words. Mr. Jeffress, another core member from the campaign board, has been one of Mr. Trump’s most reliable evangelical advocates, regularly appearing with him in Trump Tower in New York and then in the White House. “I can’t look into the president’s heart to know if he really personally believes these positions he’s advocating, or whether he thinks it’s smart politics to embrace them because of the strong evangelical influence in the country,” Mr. Jeffress said in an interview. “But frankly, I don’t care. As a Christian, I’m seeing these policies embraced and enacted, and he’s doing that.” Mr. Jeffress, who once said President Barack Obama’s politics could lead to the rise of the Antichrist, said the issues that evangelicals discuss at the White House “go beyond what most assume,” including opioid abuse and criminal justice overhaul. He and Mr. Moore are sympathetic to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, that shields young undocumented immigrants, which is often viewed as a progressive cause. When he is in the Oval Office with faith leaders, Mr. Moore said, they try to “personalize” issues for Mr. Trump, including in a recent discussion on DACA, when the group told the president that he should view the issue as a father and grandfather. Mr. Moore, who has spent time in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Bahrain and Israel speaking out against religious persecution, said that evangelical advocacy in the White House also helped expedite the confirmation of former Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas as ambassador for international religious freedom, a post for which he and the core group of evangelical voices in the White House had long pushed. Evangelicals voted heavily in Mr. Trump’s favor in the presidential election and, polls show, continue to back him. “Evangelicals were so great to me,” Mr. Trump said last year. Yet the symbiosis between conservative Christians and Mr. Trump was never perfect, and some of that tension has lingered into his presidency. The Rev. A. R. Bernard, the pastor of the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn and a member of the campaign board, announced that he was no longer associating with the White House evangelical group after Mr. Trump’s failure to condemn white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville, Va., in August. Mr. Bernard, who said he had made at least four visits to the White House, saw Mr. Trump as largely indifferent to faith leaders’ to-do list. “There was nothing hidden. He wanted that voting bloc. He wanted their votes,” Mr. Bernard said of Mr. Trump’s engagement with evangelicals during the campaign. “It was transactional. He wanted to do whatever he thought would get those votes.” When reports emerged last month that a pornographic-film actress was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about her claims of an affair she had with Mr. Trump, it further complicated his relationship with evangelicals, who maintained that it is not the responsibility of the president to live a pure life. “He’s not the pastor of our country,” Franklin Graham, a member of the camp advisory board, said on television. Tony Perkins, the president of the evangelical Family Research Council, said that evangelicals would give Mr. Trump a “mulligan.” Mr. Jeffress agreed. “Evangelical support for President Trump has always been based on his policies, not on his personal piety,” he said. Mr. Scott, a pastor at the New Spirit Revival Center in the Cleveland area, is one of the early members of the campaign advisory board who continues to visit Mr. Trump in the White House. He said Mr. Trump’s interest in evangelicalism stemmed not from opportunism but from wanting to atone for a life largely devoid of conventional religiosity. Mr. Scott said that the president’s bluster was withheld when he visited with faith leaders, and that Mr. Trump would often apologize if he cursed in front of them. “I find his reverence for clergy very old-school,” Mr. Scott said. “When he’s in the room with clergy, he adopts the position of the lesser. He seems to regard the clergy as the greater.” Mr. Trump has the view of “while you guys were off pursuing a higher calling, I was off building buildings,” Mr. Scott said. “Now it’s time for me to catch up.” This week, as he shuffled from meeting to meeting and dinner to dinner ahead of the prayer breakfast, Mr. Moore said he hoped evangelicals’ new clout in Washington would give them a new face. “People sort of think of evangelicals as these bumpkins. That always drives me crazy,” Mr. Moore said before he dashed out of a downtown Washington cafe. “I think we are far more informed than people give us credit for.” "
453,"Congress now appears likely to reach a budget deal to keep the government functioning without treating as bargaining chips hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children. It also appears, though, that President Trump will consider undoing his threat of deportation for these young “Dreamers” only if Congress considers the first deep cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s. The changes the president is demanding stem from a nativist, zero-sum view that what’s good for immigrants is bad for America. That view runs counter not just to the best of American tradition and principles, but to evidence of what’s best for the country. The programs targeted by Mr. Trump are designed to make legal immigration more diverse and humane. One is the lottery system that offers the chance for visas to people from countries that are underrepresented as sources of American immigrants; the other is family-based immigration, which offers visas to close relatives of citizens and legal residents. Mr. Trump, who has regularly smeared immigrants as terrorists and criminals, has lately been focusing his fear-mongering on the diversity visa program. Last month, his Department of Homeland Security released a report that dishonestly claimed that those who entered the country via the lottery were more likely to be tied to terrorist attacks. The Cato Institute found that lottery visa holders actually killed only eight of 3,037 Americans murdered by foreign-born terrorists since 1975. The immigrants chosen in the lottery, moreover, are not chosen “without any regard for skill, merit or the safety of our people,” as Mr. Trump said in his State of the Union address. They must have at least a high school education or two years of experience in skilled work, and they must also undergo criminal, national security and medical checks. The 50,000 recipients of the visas are not guaranteed permanent residence, only a chance at getting through the rest of the immigration process. Mr. Trump has said that the family reunification program — which he and other immigration opponents prefer to call “chain migration” — opens the floodgates to “virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.” In fact, relatives other than spouses, parents and minor children are subject to annual caps and country quotas, so that, today, the backlog is almost four million applicants, most of them facing many years of waiting to get a visa. Mr. Trump would allow no new applicants other than immediate family members, and even these would no longer include parents. Imposing these restrictions and ending the diversity visa lottery would cut in half the number of legal immigrants. "
454,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence, dispatched to Asia to blunt a North Korean charm offensive at South Korea’s Olympic Games, said Wednesday that the United States planned to levy the toughest sanctions yet on the North over its nuclear and missile programs. Mr. Pence’s threat, delivered in Tokyo, came two days after he had signaled openness to meeting with North Korean officials at the Games, somewhat muddying the harsh message he had been sent to project. But in Japan, the vice president quickly reverted to form. Speaking alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr. Pence said he planned to “stand with our allies and remind the world that North Korea is the most tyrannical and oppressive regime on the planet.” “We will continue to intensify our maximum pressure campaign until North Korea takes concrete steps toward complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” Mr. Pence said. He did not detail the precise timing or content of the sanctions. Analysts said they could target Chinese firms that do business with North Korea. The Olympics, which open Friday in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang, are likely to showcase the diplomatic thaw between North and South, with the two teams marching together in the opening ceremony under a single flag and competing together in women’s ice hockey. On Friday, North Korea announced it would send the only sister of its leader, Kim Jong-un, to South Korea as a member of its official delegation. That sets up at least the possibility of a landmark meeting with Mr. Pence, though Mr. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, is under Treasury Department sanctions for her role in North Korea’s human rights abuses, which would make a meeting highly unlikely. Indeed, Mr. Pence is drawing attention to abuses in North Korea at every stop of his Asia trip. He is bringing as a guest to the Games the father of Otto F. Warmbier, the Ohio college student who was imprisoned in Pyongyang and fell into an irreversible coma. Mr. Warmbier died soon after being returned to his parents, Fred and Cindy, in Cincinnati. “We will not allow North Korean propaganda to hijack the message and imagery of the Olympic Games,” Mr. Pence said. “We will not allow North Korea to hide behind the Olympic banner the reality that they enslave their people and threaten the wider region.” Last week, Mr. Trump paid tribute to Mr. Warmbier’s parents, as well as a North Korean defector, Ji Seong-ho, during his State of the Union address. He later gathered Mr. Ji and other defectors in the White House, where they shared harrowing tales of imprisonment, abuse and escape from the North. “The human rights issue is creeping into their strategy,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a former top Asia adviser to President Barack Obama. “The reason this is important is because it raises the question of the regime’s legitimacy.” Mr. Medeiros played down the significance of Mr. Pence’s remark on Monday in which he said of the North Koreans: “I have not requested a meeting, but we’ll see what happens.” “In retrospect,” Mr. Medeiros said, “it seems he was just being coy because he’s doubling down and tripling down on maximum pressure and the alliance buildup.” On Thursday, North Korea seemed to take the possibility of a meeting off the table. “We have never begged for dialogue with the U.S., and will be the same in the future,” Jo Yong-sam, a North Korean Foreign Ministry official, was quoted as saying by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. White House officials did not return phone calls requesting comment on Mr. Pence’s plans. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, when asked at a White House briefing about the possibility of a meeting, demurred on whether he supported one. “Vice President Pence is quite capable of making the call on that there while he’s in Korea,” Mr. Mattis said. Asked whether the United States had drawn closer to war with North Korea during the Trump administration, Mr. Mattis said that American policy “is firmly in the diplomatic lane,” and that “we have seen much stronger diplomatic action.” Still, he added that the Pentagon was supplying the White House “with viable military options” to deal with North Korea — an issue that has nettled some White House officials, who believe that the Pentagon has dragged its feet in providing options for striking the North. During his visit to Tokyo, Mr. Pence inspected a Japanese Patriot antimissile battery, which would be used to try to shoot down an incoming North Korean missile. There was little talk of economic issues, even though Mr. Pence has in the past conducted an economic dialogue with Japan’s finance minister, Taro Aso. Mr. Pence’s tough words about North Korea could widen fissures between the Trump administration and South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who has pursued a more conciliatory approach to the North. Analysts said that the North Koreans, if they began to fan the possibility of talks with Mr. Pence again, could try to exploit those gaps. “When the Olympics are over, and the U.S. wants to resume military exercises, the North Koreans can say, ‘We made this unprecedented offer of a meeting,’” said Michael J. Green, who served as a top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush. "
455,"Do you remember back when everybody thought John Kelly was going to calm down the Trump White House? Stop laughing. Although it has been another wow of a week, hasn’t it? We had one top administration official, Rob Porter, resigning over claims of domestic abuse regarding two ex-wives. Kelly defended Porter as “a friend, a confidant and a trusted professional” shortly before a picture popped up of one former Mrs. Porter sporting a black eye. This was a little bit after Kelly himself made headlines for suggesting that some young immigrants couldn’t qualify for federal help because they were just “too lazy to get off their asses” and file some paperwork. Meanwhile the president, apparently unsupervised, was calling for a government shutdown and lobbying enthusiastically for an expensive new military parade. Because he saw one in Paris and thought it was cool. A good chief of staff advises the president against doing things that will make the administration look stupid or crazy. So, are we all in agreement that Kelly, retired general turned Trump chief of staff, appears to be … a failure? And sort of a jerk in the bargain? When Kelly first came over to run the Trump team there was near-unanimous expectation that he’d be the adult in the room. And indeed the chain of command got more efficient and some problem employees were evicted. However, there’s a limit to how long you can live off your laurels for firing Omarosa and The Mooch. Kelly did nothing about the fact that the White House is loud and mean and generally unfathomable. Except make things even worse. This, after all, is the guy who’s intervened whenever Donald Trump is in his expansive give-me-an-immigration-bill-to-sign phase, and pushed him over to Haiti-is-a-shithole territory. "
456,"President Trump and Devin Nunes have been muddying the waters of the Russia investigation, so let’s try to clarify those waters so that they’re as clear as vodka. Here are a dozen things we know. 1. Russia interfered in the U.S. election. The U.S. intelligence community concluded that President Vladimir Putin had “a clear preference” for Trump and “ordered an influence campaign” to hurt Hillary Clinton. The Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states that Russian hackers (mostly unsuccessfully) had targeted their election systems before the 2016 election. Russia oversaw an online campaign using fake American accounts to spread anti-Clinton messages. Twitter found that 50,000 Russian accounts fired off 2.1 million election-related tweets in the fall of 2016, and in the final weeks around the election accounted for 4.25 percent of retweets of Trump’s own account. 2. Trump has longstanding business interests in Russia. The Times has explored these, beginning with a trip to Moscow in 1987 to try to build a hotel there. As recently as 2013 on another Moscow visit he was still optimistic, tweeting “TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next,” but the buildings have never come to fruition. More successfully, Trump has attracted murky investments from Russia, raising speculation that Russia might have gained some leverage over him. A Russian oligarch paid Trump an eyebrow-raising $95 million for one Florida property. A Reuters investigation found that people with Russian addresses or passports had invested nearly $100 million in seven Trump properties in southern Florida. “I know the Russians better than anybody,” Trump boasted in 2014. 3. Trump has consistently displayed a soft spot for Putin. At various times, Trump has described Putin as “so nice,” “so smart” and doing “an amazing job.” Trump defended Putin from allegations that he interfered in elections and killed journalists. “You think our country is so innocent?” he scoffed. Trump told another interviewer, “I think our country does plenty of killing also.” 4. Trump picked people with ties to Russia. He named as a foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who was investigated by the F.B.I. as far back as 2013 for possible ties to Russian intelligence (Page denies any wrongdoing). To run his campaign, Trump selected Paul Manafort, who had long experience working for Russian interests and once wrote a memo offering a plan to “greatly benefit the Putin Government.” Trump’s aides also tweaked the Republican Party platform in a way that would please Moscow. 5. Russia confided in the Trump campaign. In April 2016, the Russians told George Papadopoulos, another Trump foreign policy adviser, that they had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” It’s not clear what Papadopoulos did with that information. 6. Trump aides secretly met with Russians. In June 2016, Russia offered the Trump campaign “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.” Instead of calling the F.B.I., Donald Trump Jr. responded, “I love it,” and arranged a meeting with the Russians and top campaign officials. 7. A Trump ally secretly communicated with a Russian mouthpiece. In August 2016, Trump ally Roger Stone communicated with Guccifer 2.0, believed to be an outlet for Russian military intelligence. Separately, Stone tweeted that “it will soon [be] Podesta’s time in a barrel”; seven weeks later, WikiLeaks began releasing emails Russia had hacked from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman. 8. … more secret contacts. WikiLeaks, presumably representing Russian interests, engaged in secret correspondence with Donald Trump Jr. 9. Kushner met a Putin ally. Jared Kushner met in December 2016 with a Russian, Sergey Gorkov, who is close to Putin. Kushner also privately asked the Russians about using Russian equipment to establish a secret communications channel to the Kremlin. 10. Trump aides falsely denied contacts. Campaign officials denied innumerable times that there had been any contact with Russia. “Of course not,” said Mike Pence shortly before the inauguration. “Why would there be any contacts?” Good question. In fact, there were at least 51 such contacts, including 19 face-to-face interactions, by the count of CNN. 11. Russia is still at it. Russian bots are joining Trump supporters in tweeting hashtags like #MAGA and #FullOfSchiff. These same Russian bots are promoting Fox News links that disparage the Russia investigation. 12. This is not normal! Actually, I doubt that there was anything so straightforward as a secret quid pro quo. Indeed, some of these links are so blatant that they seem confusingly exculpatory: Why would anybody conspiring with Putin raise suspicions by publicly praising him? Yet the Russian interference itself is beyond doubt. The Mueller investigation has led to two guilty pleas and two indictments so far, and it must continue. Frankly, it’s suspicious that Trump is throwing up so much dust and trying so hard to delegitimize the investigation. He is not acting innocent.☐ "
457,"WASHINGTON — Two weeks ago, the Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer could barely look at each other on the floor as Congress careened into a government shutdown. Their relationship was considered so badly frayed that a bipartisan group of lawmakers intervened to help them save face and temporarily end the impasse. Yet on Wednesday, the two happily linked arms and delivered a major budget deal containing eye-popping spending increases and clear political benefits for both sides as lawmakers head into a crucial midterm election season. It just shows how tens of billions of appropriately scattered dollars can soothe any hard feelings. The agreement, the subject of intense private negotiations between Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been percolating for days. They consulted with Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, but the White House, by design, did not play a big role in the talks. Mr. Schumer gleefully pointed out that fact on the floor by noting that the deal “was completed without a great deal of help from the White House.” The talks got serious immediately after the shutdown when Mr. McConnell approached Mr. Schumer and asked how they should proceed on the spending divide. They ended Tuesday in Mr. McConnell’s office with Mr. Schumer inviting Mr. McConnell, a die-hard University of Louisville basketball fan, to New York to attend a future Louisville game against Syracuse University. (By earlier arrangement, Mr. Schumer will speak Monday at the university’s McConnell Center.) Both sides were heavily invested in trying to produce a result that would get them out of the stubborn cycle of budget dysfunction and, just as important, get them through the November elections without another politically damaging shutdown or threat to default on the federal debt.

460,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “A genuine breakthrough.” That’s what Senator Chuck Schumer called the far-reaching budget deal he struck with Senator Mitch McConnell in a rare bipartisan moment. The agreement would add hundreds of billions of dollars to military and domestic programs over the next two years. But it has only tomorrow to pass in the House before a federal shutdown, and there’s opposition on both sides of the aisle there. Representative Nancy Pelosi spoke on the House floor for hours to protest the bill, which did not include protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. Above, a TV screen showed footage of her remarks on Capitol Hill. ____ 2. Stocks on Wall Street wavered again, and markets appeared to be recovering from days of tumult. If you’re a young investor, and this is your first market hiccup, we have some advice. President Trump, in his first comments about the stock market plunge, blamed the “good (great) news” on the economy for the abrupt declines, and called the volatility “a big mistake.” ____ 3. “Kim Jong-un’s Ivanka” will be part of North Korea’s delegation at the Olympics opening ceremony. She’s the sister of Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader. (Her nickname in South Korean media offers a hint of her influence in his secretive government.) Kim Yo-jon’s visit — the first to the South by an immediate member of the North’s ruling family — will most likely include a meeting with President Moon Jae-in. But the real question is whether she, or any other top North Korean official, will meet with Vice President Mike Pence. ____ 4. The Los Angeles Times is being sold to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire doctor who grew up in apartheid South Africa, for $500 million. The deal comes after months of turmoil and turnover at the paper. Dr. Soon-Shiong was once a major shareholder in Tronc, the newspaper’s parent company. He told us in a 2016 interview that he considers newspapers a “public trust.” ____ 5. Silicon Alley is growing — rapidly. In the latest jump in Manhattan’s tech footprint, Google is buying the Chelsea Market, a mammoth food mart, office building and tourist attraction, for $2.4 billion. Google’s New York headquarters, across the street, already has more square footage than the Empire State Building, and Amazon, Facebook and Spotify are also expanding in the city. ____ 6. Chile killed Tony the Tiger. Facing skyrocketing rates of obesity, the government is waging war on unhealthy foods, including nixing iconic cartoon characters from cereal boxes. Nutrition experts say the broad effort is the world’s most ambitious attempt to remake a country’s food culture. ____ 7. Online porn is everywhere, and young people sometimes learn much of what they know about sex from it. Our magazine looks at a new approach in use in some after-school programs in the U.S.: teaching young people to view pornography more critically. They call it “porn literacy.” ____ 8. Two writers have discovered an unpublished manuscript they believe Shakespeare consulted to write some of his most famous plays. How’d they do it? With the help of software typically used by professors to nab cheating students. The authors are not suggesting that Shakespeare stole his material, but rather that he was inspired by the imaginative, florid language in “A Brief Discourse of Rebellion and Rebels,” written in the late 1500s by a minor figure in the court of Queen Elizabeth. ____ 9. The U.S.-Mexico border is in the news every day, in continuing debates about immigration and spending on security initiatives. But what is it like to visit? To find out, we sent writers to five sister cities there, to see the sights on each side. In Tijuana, our intrepid correspondent embarked on a delectable gastronomic tour. Above, a torta she dubbed the best sandwich of her life. ____ 10. Finally, in honor of the Olympics, here is our guide to South Korea’s prime export: K-pop. That’s the term used to describe the ecstatic and outrageously polished pop music that has become essential to the country’s global image. The style and sound are unmistakable — pinpoint precision, flamboyant fashion and smoothed-over borrowings from American R&B and hip-hop. Above, the boy band EXO. K-pop acts will perform throughout the Winter Games and the music will have a notable presence in the closing ceremony, on Feb. 25.

461,"WASHINGTON — Tanks, jets and other killing machines painted olive-drab and tan could be rolling the routes of the nation’s capital later this year for a peacetime parade inspired by President Trump. The Pentagon is in the planning stages for an event that was last held in Washington in the summer of 1991, after the end of the roughly 41-day gulf war was celebrated with a $12 million dollar victory parade. But on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis avoided the word “parade” when tersely responding to reporters at the White House who asked about the possible show of force. “We’re all aware in this country of the president’s affection and respect for the military,” Mr. Mattis said. “We have been putting together some options, we will send them up to the White House for decision.” With the Pentagon plagued with readiness and budget issues, a massive display of military spectacle won’t come cheap or easily. It also very likely runs contrary to Mr. Mattis’s priorities. The Washington Post first reported the Pentagon’s planning for a parade on Tuesday. Mr. Trump and his advisers first floated the idea of a parade of military convoys through Washington soon after he was elected. The committee planning his inaugural ceremony reportedly explored, but rejected, the idea of highlighting military equipment in the traditional parade, from the Capitol to the White House, after Mr. Trump was sworn in. "
462,"Joseph Polchinski, one of the most creative physicists of his generation, whose work helped lay the mathematical foundation for the controversial proposition that our universe is only one in an almost endless assemblage that cosmologists call the “multiverse,” died on Friday at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 63. His death was announced by the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he was a longtime professor and a permanent member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. He had been treated for brain cancer since late 2015. Dr. Polchinski was a giant force in the development of string theory, the ambitious attempt to achieve a “theory of everything,” which envisions the fundamental particles of nature as tiny wriggling strings. The theory has brought forth ideas and calculations that have opened new fields of study and new visions of a universe that is weirder and richer than astronomers had dreamed. In recent years, Dr. Polchinski’s investigation of black holes, the Einsteinian monsters that gobble light and everything else, uncovered a mystery that calls into question what scientists thought they understood about how these objects work. The Firewall Paradox, as he and his collaborators called it, led to a firestorm of speculation about the nature of gravity and space-time. Raphael Bousso of the University of California, Berkeley, who worked with him, said in an email interview that Dr. Polchinski “ranks among the greatest theorists of the last half-century.” Joseph Gerard Polchinski Jr. was born in White Plains on May 16, 1954, the eldest of two children. His father was a financial consultant and manager; his mother, the former Joan Thornton, was an office worker and homemaker. "
463,"The United States has the world’s most capable fighting force. But do we really want to spike the ball at a time when the country is embroiled in two wars, with no end in sight? The president seems to think so. President Trump, apparently taken by the Bastille Day parade in Paris, which he attended last summer, has instructed Pentagon brass to organize an even bigger show of military strength, down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington — tanks, missiles, jets and rows of uniformed troops marching in precision. “We’re going to have to try to top” the French procession, he told reporters. No date has been set, but the planning is underway. It’s all a bit silly. But leaving aside, for the moment, Mr. Trump’s insecurities and his desire to do everything bigger than anyone else, there are some serious reasons to reject his idea. Mr. Trump’s parade would further militarize America’s image. And it would be expensive, costing millions of dollars and most likely tearing up Washington’s streets. Does that make sense when the Pentagon is complaining that its $700 billion annual budget is inadequate, Congress is cutting vital programs, the State Department is being eviscerated and a Republican tax cut for the wealthy has added billions of dollars to the deficit? The United States used to regularly hold national military parades, generally to mark military victories. They took place after the Civil War, World War I and World War II. Most recently, the first President George Bush presided as 8,800 troops, with weapons, marched through Washington after the 1991 Persian Gulf war ended. But after American combat troops were withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, the Pentagon declined a ticker-tape parade in New York for gulf war veterans, saying it would not be proper while Americans were still fighting in Afghanistan. "
464,"With Congress facing another potential government shutdown, Americans across the political spectrum have urged both parties to set aside differences and find a compromise. Many people also believe that, if Robert Mueller produces significant evidence of wrongdoing by Donald Trump, Republicans in Congress should vote to impeach him. Will arguments to “do the right thing” persuade lawmakers? Don’t hold your breath. Such exhortations are rarely heeded by politicians, because the structural incentives of the institution usually trump policy considerations. People often urge members of Congress to take positions that reflect arguments for the public good without regard to electoral or party consequences. They point to so-called profiles in courage, like Edmund Ross, a Kansas Republican who cast the deciding vote to acquit President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, in 1868, or Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a Democratic representative from a conservative district in Pennsylvania, who voted for the Clinton budget in 1993. But those instances are rare. Most of the time, members of Congress do want to pass good public policy, but they also have two other important goals, re-election and increased power in the legislature. These goals offer a road map to the incentives that shape their decision making. When the incentives don’t align, members face problems. In these cases, re-election usually wins out, not least because it is a prerequisite for any other goal. Indeed, profiles in courage are so rare because they routinely cost legislators: Both Edmund Ross and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky lost their re-election bids. Many argue, however, that members should be willing to risk their jobs for the public good, especially on matters of conscience or morality. Historically, some politicians have done this — perhaps most famously Sam Houston of Texas, when he refused to support slavery’s expansion or secession from the Union, which cost him first his Senate seat and then his governorship. But giving up one’s job for a public policy is tougher than it appears. Consider whether you would give up your current job — and likely any future in your current career field — to pass one specific public policy. "
465,"Since before President Trump was elected — and with greater frequency afterward — historians, political scientists and journalists have wondered how autocratic our democracy might become. Here is some evidence of how the public sees it. Bright Line Watch, a consortium of political scientists formed after the 2016 election, just released a survey of 2000 voters that shows public faith in 27 key democratic principles — ranging from the independence of the judiciary to constitutional limits on executive power — has declined across the board. Four political scientists — Gretchen Helmke of the University of Rochester, Brendan Nyhan and John Carey of Dartmouth, and Susan Stokes of Yale — report that from September 2017 to January 2018, voters’ assessments of the ability of the courts, Congress and the Constitution to “effectively check executive power dropped by 7-8 percentage points.” In the same period, “confidence that the elected branches respect judicial independence fell by 17 percentage points.” The results also reveal Helmke and her colleagues warn that these trends constitute a threat to democracy: The release of the Bright Line survey comes at a moment when Trump has once again defied traditional norms and constraints concerning the treatment of political opponents. On Monday, he charged that Democratic members of the House and Senate were treasonous in their failure to applaud him during his State of the Union address. In a speech in Blue Ash, Ohio, Trump described how he saw it: One day later, Trump declared: The decline of public faith in America’s democratic institutions can be seen in the accompanying chart describing Bright Line’s findings. "
466,"He was a long-shot candidate with no prior political experience, and so very few people noticed when Aaron Coleman announced he was running for governor of Kansas last July. Those he told did not take him seriously — he could not even vote in the last election. But in Kansas, there are no minimum age restrictions to run and at 17, Mr. Coleman is one of six teenagers who have announced their bids in the last year to become chief executive of the state. Now, amid significant interest in their novel candidacies, some state lawmakers are clamoring to reform the eligibility process. The attention could create a carnival-like note to the race, and some lawmakers are calling for clearer election guidelines. This week, the Kansas House moved a bill out of committee that would require that candidates for governor fit two criteria: to be eligible to vote in the state and to be a state resident for at least four years. “I’m not discouraging them,” Representative Blake Carpenter, who sponsored the bill, said in an interview. He has “heard people say that a cat or a dog could be on the ballot.” “But as soon as they turn 18, if they want to run for the legislature, knock yourself out,” he said. He added he is not sure when the bill will be taken up by the full House. It would also need to pass the State Senate. But since the bill would not take effect until next January, the teenagers who are running could be seated if they are elected. Five of the teenage candidates interviewed — Mr. Coleman, Joseph Tutera Jr., Tyler Ruzich, Dominic Scavuzzo and Ethan Randleas — have submitted paperwork with the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission. They have not held formal campaign events yet, but said they have been busy speaking to the news media and at forums. Mr. Tutera, 16, who is running as a Republican, had realistic expectations about his effort to become his party’s nominee in August against veteran politicians like Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Gov. Jeff Colyer, who is seeking a full term as governor after the previous officeholder, Sam Brownback, was confirmed to an ambassadorship in January. Neither Mr. Kobach nor Mr. Coyler responded to a request for comment. “The day a 17-year-old wins governor of any state will be the day pigs fly,” said Mr. Tutera, a student at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, Mo. But “hey, we’re here, we’ve got ideas.” His official campaign website, which features the hashtag #TheNewGeneration, offers merchandise for sale, including hats, mugs and phone cases. In a political climate where many are disillusioned, Mr. Coleman, of Overland Park, thought running would be an opportunity to get young people interested in politics and “to strengthen the youth vote.” Inspired by news reports about Deez Nuts, the satirical presidential candidate who was revealed to be a 15-year-old, Mr. Coleman thought he might be able to drum up some support for his progressive ideas despite an unusual political profile — or maybe because of it. He is running as an independent, but said he may seek the Green Party nomination. “Really if you look at it, our generation is getting screwed over so bad,” said Mr. Coleman, who said he is working on his G.E.D. and taking classes at a local community college. “This could educate voters. They might say, if I could run, then you could run. It’s really just about getting more people involved.” The five teenage candidates insisted they should be allowed to voice their ideas in front of voters. Mr. Ruzich, 17, a student at Shawnee Mission North High School west of Kansas City, who is running as a Republican, said he thought it was unfair that he and other young Republican candidates will not be able to participate in the party’s debates. (The rules stipulate that candidates must have voted in the 2014 election to be eligible.) “The Republican Party is, when it comes to young people, in a major crisis. The party is really out of touch with young people,” said Mr. Ruzick, who thinks public schools in Kansas have become a national embarrassment and must be reformed. A sixth teenage candidate, Jack Bergeson, who was not available for comment, is running as a Democrat. Already, many of the young candidates have learned to take advantage of the divisive political climate. Mr. Brownback, the five candidates all say, deeply mismanaged the state’s budget during his tenure in office. Mr. Randleas, 18, from Wichita, liked the idea of cutting taxes, but knocked the former governor for his delivery. “When you’re cutting revenue, you have to cut spending too, or it’s not going to work,” said Mr. Randleas, who is running as a libertarian candidate and is a senior at Wichita Heights High School. He pointed out that candidates like Ron and Rand Paul, Barry Goldwater, and other populist political figures also had their bona fides called into question. President Trump himself entered the 2016 election as a long-shot candidate who nobody thought could win. “They didn’t have any experience,” he said. “I want to be like that, outside trying to make a difference. I’m not a career politician.” Still, Mr. Scavuzzo, 18, a senior at Rockhurst High School who is running as a Republican, said he believes adding a minimum age as an eligibility requirement would be a smart move. But that does not he mean he is not serious about his run. “I am 100 percent trying to win. If you’re not trying to win there’s no point in doing this,” he said. "

470,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has lashed out at the country’s police chief, whom he accused of airing “delusional and mendacious” insinuations against him, just days before the police are expected to publish recommendations regarding potential charges against Mr. Netanyahu in two corruption investigations, possibly including bribery. “Any fair-minded person will ask themselves how people who say such delusional things about the prime minister can investigate him objectively and make recommendations in his case without bias,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote in a Facebook post after midnight Wednesday. “A large shadow has been cast this evening over the police investigations and recommendations in the case of Prime Minister Netanyahu,” he added. Critics said Mr. Netanyahu, now in his third consecutive term in office, was trying to discredit the police in order to delegitimize investigations that could undermine his political future. “Clearly it is unjustified,” Barak Medina, a professor in the law faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the attack on the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich. “The prime minister is trying to create a spin and present himself as the victim.” Like other observers, Mr. Medina drew comparisons to President Trump’s criticism of the F.B.I. and Justice Department amid investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign.

472,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday morning signed into law a far-reaching budget deal that will boost spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and allow the federal government to reopen after a brief shutdown. In an early morning tweet, Mr. Trump said he had signed the bill, adding: “Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more.” Mr. Trump’s signature came quickly after the House gave final approval early Friday to the deal, hours after a one-man blockade by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky delayed the votes and forced the government to briefly close. House Democrats, after threatening to bring the bill down because it did nothing to protect young undocumented immigrants, gave Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin the votes he did not have in his own party and ensured passage. In the end, 73 House Democrats voted yes to more than offset the 67 Republicans who voted no. Just before the vote, Mr. Ryan voiced support for bringing a debate on immigration to the House floor — though he did not make a concrete promise, as Democratic leaders had wanted. "
473,"This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions paused a discussion of the opioid epidemic to, once again, go after marijuana. He suggested that addictive pain medication wasn’t the only problem and that many heroin addicts start out “with marijuana and other drugs.” There is a relationship between cannabis and opioids, but Mr. Sessions has it backward. Marijuana isn’t a gateway drug to opioid addiction; it’s a safer alternative to pain medicines. Mr. Sessions’s vow to crack down on marijuana will only make the opioid epidemic worse. We know that 40 percent of all opiate overdose deaths involve a prescription opiate. So having legal access to cannabis as another option for pain relief may actually reduce consumption of opiates. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but consider the evidence. To start, a large study assessed the effect of medical-marijuana laws on opiate-related deaths between 1999 and 2010 in all 50 states and reported a 25 percent decrease in opiate overdose mortality in states where medical marijuana was legal, compared with those where it wasn’t. The study found that in 2010, medical-marijuana laws resulted in an estimated 1,729 fewer deaths than expected. Other epidemiologic studies found similar results. A study published last year examined opiate-related deaths in Colorado between 2000 and 2015. Researchers compared mortality rates before and after the state legalized recreational cannabis in 2014. For controls, they chose two nearby states: Nevada, which legalized only medical cannabis, and Utah, where all cannabis use is illegal. The study found a 6.5 percent drop in opiate-related deaths after recreational cannabis became legal in Colorado. Likewise, other researchers examined the link between medical cannabis and opiate use in a group of patients with chronic pain in New Mexico, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis. They reported that subjects who had access to medical cannabis were 17 times more likely to stop using opiates for pain compared with those not using cannabis. Because these are all observational studies, they cannot prove a causal link between cannabis use and lower opiate-related mortality. Still, the consistent epidemiologic evidence is hard to ignore. Why might cannabis work so well as an alternative to opioids? It does offer some mild pain relief. But more significant, both opiates and cannabis — like all recreational drugs — cause the release of dopamine in the brain’s reward pathway. That signal conveys a powerful sense of pleasure and craving. Thus, cannabis might pre-empt some of the rewarding effects of opiates, decreasing the general desire to use them. There is also intriguing preliminary evidence that cannabidiol, a major component of marijuana, can blunt craving in individuals with opioid dependence following a period of abstinence. If cannabis were actually a dangerous gateway drug, as the attorney general suggested, it would be very easy to see in the data. We would find that medical-marijuana laws increased opiate drug use and overdose deaths, when in fact just the opposite has happened. We would also expect to see a consistent sequence of drug abuse from cannabis to, say, opiates or cocaine, across different cultures. But this is not the case at all. For example, in Japan, where marijuana use is relatively rare, 83 percent of people who used recreational drugs did not begin with cannabis. This was true as well for 60 percent of South Africans. A more plausible explanation for the common finding that people use a series of recreational drugs is a general propensity for risk-taking behavior, of which drug use is just one manifestation. None of this is to say that marijuana is without risks. It certainly isn’t. Cannabis can impair cognition, attention and intellectual performance, though the effects are reversible. And in some individuals who are genetically at risk, it can unleash psychotic states. But there is little evidence that marijuana use increases mortality. In contrast, opiate overdose is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing about 91 Americans every day. President Trump has rightly called the opioid crisis a “public-health emergency” but has yet to articulate a real policy or allocate the necessary resources to deal with it. At the very least, let’s not spend precious resources on a senseless cannabis crackdown — especially when the evidence suggests that it would only worsen the opioid scourge and cost more American lives.

475,"TEHRAN — An Iranian official dismissed as “old news” on Thursday a report in the Western news media that Washington had reached out to Tehran in December to establish secret, back-channel talks to negotiate the release of prisoners held by both sides. The official, Hamidreza Taraghi, said that he had given interviews as far back as July to Iranian news outlets about similar attempts by the Trump administration to arrange secret talks on prisoners using intermediaries from Oman and from Europe. But Mr. Taraghi, an adviser to the hard-liners around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that Iran had rejected the entreaties then and would never enter into discussions with the Trump administration. “In the nuclear deal, they have shown themselves as dishonest, so what is the use of new talks anyway?” he said, referring to President Trump’s continuing threats to scuttle the pact negotiated with the United States during the Obama administration and with other world powers. Iran acknowledged last May that it had discussed the issue of imprisoned Iranian-Americans with Trump administration officials at a meeting in Vienna on compliance with the nuclear accord. Another effort was made at a similar meeting in Vienna in December, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, but that overture and others were rejected. At least four American citizens and two permanent residents of the United States are known to be held in Iranian prisons. A fifth American, Robert A. Levinson, has been missing in Iran for more than a decade. Mr. Trump has repeatedly posted on Twitter about the fate of two Iranian-Americans in particular: Baquer Namazi, 81, a former Unicef diplomat; and his son Siamak. They were convicted by an Iranian court in October 2016 of collaborating with a hostile power — meaning the United States — after a closed trial. Their convictions and 10-year sentences were upheld last November on appeal. The precise nature of the accusations against them has never been disclosed. Mr. Taraghi refused to provide more details about the prisoners the Trump administration had been seeking to have released, but he said that Iranian officials had been contacted on numerous occasions. “They had diplomats from Oman coming to the island of Kish,” Mr. Taraghi said, referring to an island off Iran’s south coast. “They asked European politicians to convey this message to our Foreign Ministry officials. Things like that.” “Anyway,” he added. “This is old news, already from last summer.” "

478,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. At what point should members of one political party start voting for the other one to force their party to change? Jonathan Rauch and Benjamin Wittes have sparked a debate about that question with a piece in The Atlantic. “We have both spent our professional careers strenuously avoiding partisanship in our writing and thinking,” Rauch and Wittes write. Yet they argue that voting against the Republican Party is now a moral necessity, given its enabling of President Trump’s subversion of the law and his attacks on democracy itself. “If conservatives want to save the GOP from itself,” the subhead of the article reads, “they need to vote mindlessly and mechanically against its nominees.” My colleague Ross Douthat uses his latest column to offer a rejoinder. Forget for a moment about the tweets and focus on the policy, he writes: On policy — waterboarding, Nafta, NATO, Iran, libel laws and so on — the Republican Party is indeed constraining Trump. “And so long as he remains weak and trammeled and conventional in policy, the case that conservatives have a moral obligation to vote like liberals won’t convince,” Douthat concludes. I recommend reading both pieces. I also take issue with both. The radicalism of the Republican Party, on both policy and process, is arguably the country’s biggest political problem. Consider: Even apart from Trump, the party rejects overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change — evidence that’s accepted by virtually every other conservative party in the world. As a result, serious attempts to combat climate change are hamstrung, and all of our children and grandchildren are likely to suffer for it. Or consider that the Republican Party has repeatedly tried to restrict voting rights, often for partisan advantage. Or consider that it refused to fill a Supreme Court seat because the other party held the presidency, risking future paralysis in court appointments. Or consider that much of its domestic policy depends on magical thinking. That’s why its health care bills last year were so bad and why the party runs up the deficit each time it takes power. The Democrats have their own problems, it’s true. They’re rarely blameless in partisan debates. But their problems are of a different magnitude. Does any Democratic sin approach climate denial? No. Rauch and Wittes argue that these reasons are nonetheless insufficient for conservatives to abandon the party. Only the Trumpian attack on democratic norms is. I think they’re wrong about that — and therefore end up with an unnecessarily narrow argument, against which Douthat scores some points. Trump is an outgrowth of today’s radical, norm-shattering Republican Party. In some ways, he took its ideas to their logical extreme without hiding them behind the more polished behavior of, say, Paul Ryan. There is little reason to believe that would-be Republican reformers — like my friend Ross Douthat — are going to succeed in stopping the craziness until the party loses power. Winning parties don’t tend to reform themselves. Which makes the ultimate Wittes-Rauch conclusion persuasive: “The most-important tasks in U.S. politics right now are to change the Republicans’ trajectory and to deprive them of power in the meantime.” I recognize that voting against Republicans is as easy for a progressive to suggest as it is hard for a conservative to execute. But here’s my case to conservatives who do believe in facts and democratic norms (and would rather that Miami stay above water): You are politically homeless right now. Your party has become a destructive force. Its victories — which you may understandably celebrate, like a lower corporate tax rate — don’t make up for the damage the party is doing. And the other party obviously remains too left-wing for you. Your best hope is a sane conservative party. And the only route to a sane conservative party is a string of losses for the current Republican Party. Conservatives aren’t the only ones who would benefit from a better Republican Party, either. Democrats, and the country, would, too. There’s a very long list of issues on which conservative ideas have something important to say: about whether government regulations are the best way to fight climate change; about the benefits of competition and accountability for public schools; about the breakdown in family structure; about the tensions between abortion and eugenics; about avoiding the economic sclerosis of Europe; and on and on. Unfortunately, it’s a fantasy to believe that today’s Republican Party is playing this constructive role. It’s doing significantly more damage than good, and there is little prospect that will change until Republican radicalism brings a political price. Speaking of climate change: Scott Pruitt, Trump’s E.P.A. administrator, claimed this week that even if the climate were changing, it’s good news. “Humans have most flourished during times of … warming,” Pruitt said. In The New Republic, Emily Atkin writes that Pruitt “appears willing to accept any conclusion about climate change as long as it’s not the one shared by most climate scientists around the world.” Porter, out. Rob Porter, a top aide to President Trump, resigned yesterday after evidence became public suggesting that he assaulted his former wives. It’s worth emphasizing that the White House had long been aware of the accusations but nonetheless kept him in a top job. “Trump staff and surrogates accused of domestic violence or assault against women: Rob Porter, Steve Bannon, Corey Lewandowski, Andrew Puzder,” tweeted Shannon Watts, a political activist. “Also, Donald Trump.” In her column, Gail Collins focuses on the role of John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, in the Porter mess.

480,"SEOUL, South Korea — In the highest-level contact between the two Koreas in years, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea plans to meet Saturday with the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the North’s nominal head of state, officials said on Thursday. Mr. Moon’s luncheon meeting with the North Koreans was announced on Thursday, as Vice President Mike Pence arrived in South Korea carrying a message from Washington: not to waver from strong sanctions against North Korea. The high-level North Korean delegation, headed by Kim Yong-nam, the North’s ceremonial head of state, will arrive in South Korea on Friday on a special plane to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics later in the day. The trip’s significance was underscored by the revelation on Wednesday that the delegation would include Kim Yo-jong, the only sister and a trusted aide of Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader. In North Korea’s dynastic system, which upholds the Kim family’s “bloodline” as a sacred leadership qualification, Ms. Kim wields a singular clout that cannot be matched by any nonrelative members of the elite, regardless of their official titles, according to North Korea analysts. Ms. Kim would be the first member of North Korea’s ruling family to visit the South since the 1950-53 Korean War. In 2000, her father, Kim Jong-il, held a summit meeting in North Korea with Kim Dae-jung, then South Korea’s president, but did not keep his promise to visit the South for a second meeting. Kim Jong-il died in 2011, bequeathing power to his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has rapidly accelerated the North’s weapons programs. It remained unclear whether Ms. Kim would be carrying a message from her brother to Mr. Moon, who has said he is willing to meet Kim Jong-un if he is reasonably sure that such a meeting would help end the crisis over the North’s nuclear weapons and missile development. The North Koreans’ trip has raised hopes within Mr. Moon’s government, which has sought to use the North’s participation in the Olympics to expand dialogue with North Korea and ease tensions over the North’s nuclear weapons program. North Korea is sending 22 athletes to the Olympics, as well as hundreds of cheerleaders, musicians, singers and dancers. The two Koreas will march together in Friday night’s opening ceremony in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang, and even field their first-ever joint Olympic team, in women’s ice hockey. Mr. Pence also plans to attend the opening ceremony. But hopes for détente have been tempered by deep skepticism over the North’s sudden overtures. United States officials fear that after a year of increasingly provocative missile and nuclear tests, Kim Jong-un may be on a charm offensive to undermine international sanctions that have begun biting his isolated country. Before leaving Japan for South Korea, Mr. Pence said the United States would not be duped by any false overture. “We’ll continue to seize every opportunity to ensure that North Korea does not use the powerful imagery and backdrop of the Olympics to paper over an appalling record of human rights and a pattern of developing weapons and conducting the kind of missile launches that are threatening our nation and threatening neighbors across the region,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence met with Mr. Moon later on Thursday, and both reaffirmed a principle of “using maximum sanctions and pressure to bring North Korea to the negotiating table for denuclearization,” said Mr. Moon’s spokesman, Yoon Young-chan. Before meeting Mr. Moon, Mr. Pence said he would seek a South Korean commitment to “continue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically so that we can achieve what the world has longed to see, which is a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.” Mr. Moon has supported American-led sanctions against the North, but he has repeatedly called for dialogue. He has also been a vocal critic of any use of military force against North Korea, which is being considered as an option in the Trump administration. In his meeting with Mr. Pence, Mr. Moon again emphasized the need for talks with North Korea, saying that he hoped that the inter-Korean dialogue started by the North’s participation in the Olympics would lead to broader talks on resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis, Mr. Yoon said. With North Korea’s decision to send a high-level delegation, the Winter Olympics have suddenly become an arena for high-profile diplomacy. Although North Korea said its delegates had no willingness to meet Mr. Pence, the vice president again did not rule out the possibility of a meeting on the sidelines of the Games. “There may be a possibility for any kind of an encounter with North Koreans, whether it be informal or whether it take the form of a meeting,” he said. “As I said, we’ll have to wait and see exactly how that unfolds.” In a jarring contrast to the moves toward reconciliation in the South, columns of goose-stepping soldiers and vehicles carrying rockets, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, rolled through the main square in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Thursday as the country celebrated its Army Building Day. “We must ensure that no invaders can infringe upon our dignity and independence,” Mr. Kim said in a speech delivered from the podium overlooking the parade. “The People’s Army must keep in high alert and redouble its preparations for battle as the United States and its followers are making a fuss around the Korean Peninsula.” It was the first parade since Mr. Kim declared in his New Year’s Day speech that a “nuclear button” on his desk could launch weapons targeting the mainland United States. The missiles on display on Thursday included the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 ICBMs, which the North test-launched last year. Other military parades in recent years were broadcast live, but the event on Thursday aired several hours later. Some analysts in the South said that the North might have decided not to ruffle too many feathers as its athletes and officials were abroad. Conservative South Koreans have vehemently accused the North of trying to “steal the show” by staging a military parade the day before the Winter Olympics begin. "

482,"Most American workers this month will see their take-home pay go up, some a little and a few quite a bit, as the new tax act takes effect and less money is withheld for federal income taxes. But for many, the gift will be short-lived. Because the law was rushed and written in a partisan frenzy, withholding may not be accurate and you might owe money to the I.R.S. next year. You might even be advised to file new forms so that more money is withheld — and then the forms and withholding amounts are likely to change again later in the year and then again every year thereafter as the cuts for individuals head toward expiration. This messy uncertainty, not abstractions like an increase in the federal deficit, will be the lived experience of Trump economic policy for most American households. It might seem like just a bureaucratic complication, but this episode could point progressives toward a persuasive economic message, one that reflects the economic realities of the middle class and the striving of people in struggling small communities as well as those in tech-driven metropolises. It’s the experience of the scam economy, where nothing is certain and anything gained might disappear without warning. It’s an economy where risk is shifted onto individuals and families, financial predators lurk behind every robocall and pop-up ad, work schedules are changed without notice and Americans have endless choices about savings, education, health care and other needs but very little clear guidance about how to make those choices wisely or safely. Since the 2016 election, Democrats have looked for an economic story and policy that would speak to the frustrations of Trump voters — even while recognizing that more nuanced analysis shows that “economic anxiety” wasn’t driving most of Mr. Trump’s well-off supporters — without losing their own base. While the headline economic statistics like gross domestic product, low unemployment, wages on a slow but steady upward path have been healthy, other indicators like stagnating wages, Gilded Age levels of inequality, and communities and older industries that have been left behind together create an obligation to think ambitiously beyond the assumptions of Clinton- and Obama-era economics. This overdue introspection has brought several new or revived ideas to the fore: universal basic income, especially popular in Silicon Valley, or a federal jobs guarantee, an idea last heard in the 1970s, revived by the Center for American Progress last May. And perhaps most promising, a new focus on economic concentration and the failure of antitrust enforcement, which has allowed a few behemoth companies, including the tech giants, to wield economic and political power at the expense of consumers and workers alike. These good ideas don’t directly touch the immediate experience of most Americans in the real economy of 2018. What is near universal and tangible is the daily experience of uncertainty and risk, in a world in which economic choices are complicated, predators and scammers are everywhere, and government policy under Mr. Trump seems to move in the direction of making choices ever more complex and risky, while removing protections for consumers and workers. What government does at its best, from the New Deal forward, has been to provide some certainty and predictability: that what you earned would be yours, that what you saved would be there for you and that you wouldn’t have to bear all the risk on your own. Today, Americans’ private retirement savings are often eroded by unnecessary fees, aggressive stock trading and the need to borrow against those savings for emergencies. Higher education is still a path to security for most, but deceptive programs and heavy loan burdens often leave young adults worse off, burdened by debt and a sense of failure. In between school and retirement, jobs are ever more uncertain, with fewer employers providing pensions or health insurance, work schedules too unpredictable for child care and a shift toward “gig economy” jobs that provide not even day-to-day security. Some families, perhaps the top 20 percent, have some ability to absorb these risks. But for the vast majority, there are major setbacks around every corner. Mr. Trump and Congress have done nothing to alleviate those anxieties and, especially in higher education, the financial industry and health care, have worsened them. By contrast, Social Security and bank deposit insurance, while very different New Deal policies, all served the goal of security. They don’t interfere with the free market — they just give people a bit of confidence in navigating it. The Affordable Care Act expanded this social contract, enabling people to share risk rather than taking it all on themselves. The policies of the Trump-Ryan coalition weaken that confidence in three ways. The carelessness about policy, exemplified by the frantic process that led to the withholding mess, is the least important of the three. Specific policies also deliberately shift risk toward individuals: Consider the rules in the new tax act that encourage pass-through businesses, which will lead employers to convert employees into independent contractors, costing them protections such as unemployment insurance and health care. A proposal for paid family leave recently floated by Ivanka Trump and Senator Marco Rubio takes the policy of “give with one hand, take away with the other” to an absurd extreme: New parents could pay for leave from their future Social Security payments, trading a week of paid leave for a week of retirement benefits, as if people could make a rational, informed choice between needs that will typically fall 40 years apart in the life cycle. Finally, this administration has eagerly taken down the guardrails intended to protect individuals from the worst predators: the “fiduciary rule,” which had required investment advisers to act in the interest of their clients; the hard-fought rules that protect students from worthless for-profit colleges and student loans they can’t repay; and even the recent Labor Department rule requiring that employees receive the tips that are intended for them. Virtually every enforcement action of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been put on hold or canceled — even the investigation of the Equifax hack that disclosed the financial records of millions of people — exposing all of us to even more scams and tricks. These rules are particularly vulnerable because they are recent — newer regulations are easier to reverse. They’re recent because it was only in the third through last years of the Obama administration, once the urgency of the economic crisis of the late 2000s had receded, that the administration seemed to see reining in the scam economy as a defining goal and the new rules of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the powers of the C.F.P.B., were finally put into place. But the problem in political terms was that these pieces were not knitted into a big theme. Each action was in its own policy universe: student loans, investor protection, worker rights. Giving people some security from the scam economy is never going to involve one big program or idea, like universal basic income or single-payer health care. It will always involve dozens of policies, even to replace the dozens that are currently being dismantled. But together they add up to a big theme, ensuring that people who pursue education, work hard and try to save for the future have some assurance that they will be able to navigate a complex and quickly changing economic climate. Progressives should give it a name, because it connects with the experience of every American outside of the very wealthy. "
483,"If you want to understand how Kyle Duncan, President Trump’s nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, would serve in that role, consider how he behaved toward my late husband, John Thompson. J.T., as we called him, spent 18 years in prison, 14 of them on death row, for a murder he did not commit. When it emerged that prosecutors in the office of Harry Connick, who was the former New Orleans district attorney, had destroyed evidence of his innocence to gain that conviction, he was granted a new trial, at which he was acquitted. After his release, J.T. considered the long list of innocent men sent to prison by prosecutors in that same office who had withheld evidence. It was clear to him, as it is to any impartial observer, that the district attorney’s office for New Orleans has a track record of failing to turn over favorable evidence to defendants. In 2003, J.T. sued the prosecutors who had hidden the evidence in his case for failing to train their lawyers on the importance of turning over favorable evidence. The jury, considering the blatant destruction of evidence in J.T.’s case, awarded him $1 million for every year he was on death row — $14 million in total. When the prosecutors appealed, they argued, with a straight face, that what had happened to J.T. was so outrageous and illegal that the New Orleans district attorney could not be held responsible. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court. "
484,"After his hit series “Six Feet Under” ended in 2005, Alan Ball indulged his inner fanboy, creating the vampire melodrama “True Blood” and working on the gothic small-town-crime story “Banshee.” The move suited him — his aptitudes for dark comedy and unsettling atmosphere were a natural fit for genre entertainment. But with “Here and Now,” his new family drama for HBO (beginning Sunday), he’s back to making Big Statements, his mode in his Oscar-winning screenplay for “American Beauty” in 1999. “We’re living in a new reality” is the tagline on the show’s billboards, and Mr. Ball wants to say something definitive about it. Unfortunately — and this was also true of “American Beauty,” despite its multiple Academy Awards — he doesn’t have anything new or particularly interesting to say. Straight white people are self-loathing and lame. Dads are depressed but redeemable, moms are pretty much a lost cause. We’d all be better off if we put away our cellphones and got outside. Through four episodes of its 10-episode season, “Here and Now” works the well-plowed soil of middle-age suburban malaise, the ground of Updike, Cheever and their many imitators. The suburbs have been replaced by Portland, Ore., and the ennui-ridden father, Greg Boatwright (Tim Robbins), is 60, the new middle age. (Kevin Spacey’s Lester Burnham in “American Beauty” was 42.) The biggest update is that Greg and his wife, Audrey Bayer (Holly Hunter), have raised the kind of blended family that exists primarily as a screenwriter’s conceit: Ramon, from Colombia (Daniel Zovatto); Ashley, from Liberia (Jerrika Hinton); and Duc, from Vietnam (Raymond Lee); all adopted and all now adults. The brood is completed by the teenage Kristen (Sosie Bacon, the daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick), Audrey and Greg’s biological child, who calls herself “the boring white chick in the family.” "
485,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The Senate is expected to vote today on a far-reaching bipartisan agreement that would significantly increase spending on military and domestic programs over two years. It would also raise the federal debt limit, moving to end the cycle of short-term showdowns on government funding. Republican congressional leaders have championed the deal, even though it would effectively negate President Trump’s demand that large increases in military spending be offset by deep cuts to nondefense programs. If it passes the Senate, the legislation will go to the House. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, delivered a record-breaking speech of more than eight hours on Wednesday opposing the deal because it lacks protection for young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. • If lawmakers cannot pass a temporary funding measure by the end of today, the government will shut down for the second time this year.

486,"They say that Bob Dylan, 76, is on a never-ending tour. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is eight years older and has a day job, seems to have acquired Mr. Dylan’s taste for the road. In the space of three weeks, she is set to make at least nine public appearances. They follow a pattern: a thunderous standing ovation from an adoring crowd, followed by gentle questioning from a sympathetic interviewer. Justice Ginsburg mixes familiar stories with insights about the Supreme Court and the law. She lands a couple of jokes. She promises not to step down so long as she can “do the job full steam.” She describes her friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. The audience swoons, and the show moves on to the next venue.

487,"SEOUL, South Korea — A gaggle of young North Koreans in neon chased me down the mountain on skis, expertly skidding to a stop at my feet as I sat on the slope tightening my bindings. They peppered me with questions: “What’s your name? How old are you? Where are you from? Are you married?” It was 2014 and we were at Masikryong Ski Resort, a pet project of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The multimillion-dollar resort, featuring luxury lodges and pristine slopes about 100 miles east of Pyongyang, had opened a few weeks earlier and I was there on a reporting trip — and to get a little snowboarding in. These North Koreans, all students, told me they were assigned to learn to ski during their university break. Six days a week, eight hours a day, all they did was ski. Even back then, I could see the wheels turning in Mr. Kim’s mind. “To compete at the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2018?” I asked the young men. They chuckled. “Maybe,” they said. Four years later, North Korea is sending skiers — probably including some of those young men I met in 2014 — across the Demilitarized Zone to compete as wild-card entries at the first Winter Olympics to be held on the Korean Peninsula. South Korean athletes, meanwhile, have been training at Masikryong, perhaps the world’s most controversial ski resort, built in defiance of United Nations sanctions and in spite of North Korea’s crushing poverty. This cross-border athletic exchange would seem to encapsulate the spirit of peace and unity at the heart of the Olympics. But I worry that it is too fast, too soon, and that in their haste to ensure an Olympics without provocation, South Korean officials could be rushing headlong into a premature détente. "

What I want to say to members of Congress is no! That’s my money you’re spending. This administration seems to think that America is a piggy bank that can be tapped at will. The proposed deficit is frightening in its scope and should be cause for major alarm for future generations. Where is the outcry? Where is the outrage to counter the profligate spending spree that’s being considered on Capitol Hill? Regardless of which party you belong to or support, sound fiscal management is what grown-ups do to secure our stability and progress — now and for the future. Tell our legislators, that’s my money you’re spending! If you say nothing now, there’s no point in complaining later. BARBARA BELLMAN, PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: Re “Mr. Trump’s Nasty Budget” (editorial, Feb. 13): President Trump’s slashing of Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps is Robin Hood in reverse, robbing from the poor in desperate need and giving to his wealthy supporters through tax cuts. The thievery is most pronounced with his proposed Medicare cuts. Working-class families paid into Medicare all their lives out of their meager incomes with the expectation that it would help pay their medical bills in their old age. Mr. Trump’s proposed cuts would effectively steal from those lifelong contributions by significantly reducing the benefits. Is there no shame? ROBERT J. FIRESTONE, NEW YORK To the Editor: "

The champion, a jovial 5-year-old, cut a striking, cloudlike figure in the ring: His powder-puff fur was painstakingly coifed, and he trotted jauntily across the floor with a step that looked almost lighter than air. “It feels a little unreal,” Bill McFadden, his handler, said. “I came in expecting nothing and just hoping for a good performance and I think I got it.” McFadden, who has been showing the breed at the Westminster Dog Show since 1991, said he believed this would be Flynn’s final year at the competition. He turns 6 in March. “I’d have to ask the owners, but I’m pretty sure I can drop the mic and say he’s retired,” McFadden told Fox Sports. Seven finalists had a shot at greatness this year. Aside from Flynn, Lucy the regal borzoi, a silly pug named Biggie and Slick the joyful Border collie won their groups on Monday night (hound, toy, nonsporting and herding).

That is why I was shocked to learn that Republicans on the committee have decided to physically separate Republican and Democratic staff members in the committee’s secure spaces. The construction of a partition to separate staff is a physical manifestation of a dire problem in Washington. Republicans and Democrats are polarized, and a lack of meaningful dialogue has contributed to the gridlock.

516,"WASHINGTON — One week after Rob Porter, his staff secretary, resigned amid spousal abuse allegations, President Trump said on Wednesday that he was “totally opposed to domestic violence,” his first condemnation of the alleged conduct behind a scandal that has engulfed the White House. His statement, which members of both parties had said was long overdue, came as John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, faced new questions about his handling of Mr. Porter’s case, including how he could have held a temporary high-level security clearance for more than a year in light of the allegations, and as committees in both the House and the Senate announced they would investigate the circumstances surrounding the granting of Mr. Porter’s clearance. Mr. Kelly told senior aides last fall to put an immediate end to granting new interim security clearances like the one given to Mr. Porter and directed them to resolve any issues preventing employees who held them at the time from receiving a full clearance, according to two people familiar with the discussion. At a meeting in the West Wing, Mr. Kelly said he was assigning Kirstjen Nielsen, then his deputy, to enforce the new policy, the people said. But it is not known whether Mr. Kelly, Ms. Nielsen or any other senior officials sought to delve into why Mr. Porter was operating with only an interim clearance. Mr. Porter resigned last week after allegations that he had abused his two former wives were reported by The Daily Mail. In the following days, Mr. Trump repeatedly declined to comment publicly on the episode — or on the issue of domestic violence — even as he went out of his way to praise Mr. Porter and express sympathy with him, noting that he had denied the accusations. But during a tax event on Wednesday at the White House, the president finally weighed in, saying: “I’m totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind. Everyone knows that, and it almost wouldn’t even have to be said.” "
517,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. I’m occasionally going to use this newsletter to update readers about the situation in Puerto Rico, because I think it’s important to keep the crisis there fresh in our minds. There isn’t nearly enough political pressure on the federal government to help the people of Puerto Rico. The basics. Almost five months after Hurricane Maria hit the island, about 25 percent of residents still lack electrical power. The official death toll is only 64, but The Times has estimated that the real number may be 1,052. Thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the island for Florida, and experts estimate that as many as 300,000 more could leave if significant rebuilding doesn’t take place. Without wholesale rebuilding, “the island is likely to find itself back in the same place after the next big storm,” Mekela Panditharatne, an environmental lawyer, wrote in an op-ed this week. Anxiety and depression have surged among the island’s residents. (For more on the brewing mental-health crisis, listen to Caitlin Dickerson on “The Daily” podcast.) Government failures. The federal response has been plagued by mistakes, waste and apparent cronyism. An Atlanta company with a single employee and a spotty record received a $156 million contract to deliver 30 million freeze-dried meals to the island, for example. The company delivered only 50,000. And boxes of food and water stockpiled in a government office in Florida were infested by rats, Bianca Padró Ocasio of The Orlando Sentinel reported last week. As for the cronyism: Whitefish Energy — a Montana-based company with personal ties to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s interior secretary — received a $300 million contract last year to restore power. Whitefish employed only two full-time employees on the day Maria made landfall. The Puerto Rican government terminated the contract after its questionable terms prompted investigations. Looking ahead. To stay up to date on Puerto Rico’s progress, I recommend following The Tampa Bay Times, The Orlando Sentinel and Patricia Mazzei, The Times’s Miami bureau chief. If you want to do something to help, my colleague Nick Kristof suggests donating to the Children’s Health Fund or the Hispanic Federation.

Last night, the party won a Florida legislative seat in a district that President Trump had won in 2016. Democrats also continued to show signs of progress in Oklahoma. But there have also been signs of how much work Democrats have to do to take back Congress. The party fared even worse in a Georgia district last night than it had in 2016, a reminder of how strong Republicans remain in the Deep South. And on Monday, Democrats failed to flip a winnable Minnesota statehouse seat, largely because of mediocre turnout from their base. "
518,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — In their first and second games together at the Olympic Games, the players on the unified Korean women’s ice hockey team suffered humiliating shutout losses against Switzerland and Sweden. But for the only team to compete here with athletes from both North and South Korea, a 4-1 loss against Japan on Wednesday night was the most painful defeat. In what has been an Olympics rife with geopolitical undertones, the game between Japan and Korea was the most political of all, pitting the unified Korean team’s players against rivals from the country of their former colonial occupiers. “I would say the games against Japan, more than anything else, have been something that have brought the North and South Koreans together,” said Randi Heesoo Griffin, who scored the only Korean goal. “We’ve been saying we really need to win this game.” Symbolically, the showdown was much more than a meeting between teams ranked ninth and 22nd internationally. The colonial legacy lingers over any game played between Japanese and Korean teams. This one was played in an especially heated atmosphere: Before the Pyeongchang Olympics began, tensions between the Japanese and South Korean governments had been building over longstanding disputes about history and territory. About a month before the opening ceremony, Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, even hinted he might not attend the Games. At the opening ceremony, most of the news media focused on the fact Vice President Mike Pence, who led the United States delegation, did not stand during an ovation for the unified Korean Olympic team as it marched into the stadium under one flag. But Mr. Abe did not stand, either. And when an NBC commentator suggested during the opening ceremony that “every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural, technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation,” the comment ignited so much anger in South Korea that NBC issued an apology and dropped the commentator from its coverage. North Korea’s participation in the Games, including the presence of high-level emissaries including Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, has fanned Japanese insecurity that the North’s charm offensive will drive a wedge between the South, Japan and the United States. The Korea versus Japan game was “a physical representation of a concern that Japan and the United States have,” said Jim Schoff, a senior fellow in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “‘What if we lose the South to the North in a battle of hearts and minds?’” The volume in the stadium on Wednesday exceeded the first two games that Korea played at the Games, a pair of 8-0 losses, to Switzerland and Sweden. Other than a small group of Japanese spectators who appeared to be mostly family members of that team’s players, the arena was dominated by Korean fans waving flags bearing a pale blue map of the unified peninsula. Together with the North Korean cheerleaders, who have become a familiar presence in the Kwandong Hockey Center over the past week, the spectators sustained their chanting throughout the game, shouting “Be strong!” and “We are one!” on an endless loop of frenzied energy. When Griffin scored her goal, midway through the second period, cutting Japan’s lead to 2-1, the crowd leapt to its feet and roared with joy. For many fans, the political and historic charge of the game was the point. “I am not very interested in hockey,” said Cho Young-kyu, 20, who attended with a group of friends. “I decided to come here because it is a game between Korea and Japan and it is a unified Korean team.” Mr. Cho, who wore a baseball hat with a peace symbol embroidered on it and carried both a South Korean and a unity flag, took glee in pointing out a couple of tiny dots on the unified flag. They represented islands in the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, that are administered by South Korea but claimed by Japan. “These are our islands, not Japan’s islands,” he said. Given the circumstances, Wednesday’s game played out with civility. When Japan scored, there was no booing. Instead, Korean fans quickly rebounded with chants of “It’s O.K.!” The Japanese fans applauded the Korean team at the end of the game. Over all, relations between Japan and South Korea have been on a long-term upward trend. In the late 1990s, South Korea dropped its bans against Japanese films, videos and comic books, and began allowing Japanese performers into the country. In 2002, when the countries co-hosted the World Cup, even after Japan’s team was eliminated, fans rooted for South Korea. But under Mr. Abe, the relationship between the countries has deteriorated. In 2013, Mr. Abe’s party proposed new language for school textbooks that inserted a more nationalist tone, requiring the history books state that there is still a dispute about whether the Japanese Army played a direct role in forcing so-called comfort women from Korea and elsewhere to work as sex slaves for its soldiers. Most foreign historians say the brothels could not have been run without the military’s cooperation. The countries signed an agreement in 2015 to resolve the comfort women dispute, but after the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was elected last fall, he pledged to review the deal. In January, Mr. Moon said he would leave the deal intact, but he called for a renewed and sincere apology from Japan, a declaration that provoked frustration in Tokyo. At a summit meeting with Mr. Moon immediately before the start of the Olympics, Mr. Abe reiterated Japan’s position that the 2015 agreement should be “final and irreversible.” But it was the presence of North Korea that has threatened to open the biggest gap between Japan and the South. “North Korean media and propaganda still remain heavily anti-Japanese, and the North Korean leadership family’s legitimacy is largely based on their anti-Japanese fight,” said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia. “So you have this family and this culture and society who haven’t begun the process of reconciliation, so by definition, any time you have a unified Korean effort it will be relatively more hostile to Japan.” Indeed, during the pairs figure skating short program on Wednesday morning, the North Korean cheerleaders in the stands cheered for the South Korean pair and politely applauded skaters from other countries including China, Russia, Austria and the Czech Republic. But when a Japanese pair skated, the cheerleaders sat with their hands on their knees and did not clap. South Korea’s emerging détente with North Korea worries Japan, which has so far stuck firmly with the Trump administration in calling for implementing sanctions and predicating any substantial talks with the North on denuclearization. Observers say that ultimately, Japan and South Korea have too much in common to let the diplomatic fireworks of the Olympics derail a long-term relationship. “There’s almost a recognition that these historical issues are going to continue to irritate and even at times undermine the ability of Tokyo and Seoul to work together,” said Kathleen Stephens, a former United States ambassador to South Korea and a fellow at Stanford University’s Asia-Pacific Research Center. “But I think the South Korean public is pretty sophisticated about this,” she added. “And they do have a shared interest in trying to work together on the North Korean nuclear missile and defense issues.” Each team could point to a milestone after the game. Japan’s win was its first in three trips to the Olympics. Griffin’s goal was Korea’s first in the Pyeongchang Games, a bright spot for a team — bolstered not only by a dozen North Koreans but also several players raised in North America — that surrendered 20 goals in its three games. For some fans, that highlight offered a ray of hope in defeat. When Griffin scored, Park In-heang, 54, watching from the stands, said he was moved by the possibility that sports might plant the seed of peace. “This is our first goal,” he said. “It makes me see the future.” "
519,"NEW DELHI — The United States has indicated that it will seek to place Pakistan on a watch list of countries that are not doing enough to counter terrorism financing, threatening Islamabad with global isolation, according to a senior Pakistani official. The United States is likely to introduce the motion next week in Paris, where the Financial Action Task Force, a global body created to fight terrorism financing and money laundering, will vote on the matter, the official, Miftah Ismail, a financial adviser to Pakistan’s prime minister, said. Pakistan was on the list from 2012 to 2015, and officials worry that being added again could hinder the country’s access to international markets as it prepares to repay roughly $3 billion in debt this summer. In an effort to stave off returning to the list, Pakistan has quietly adopted sanctions against two groups that the United States accuses of being fronts for the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, moving to seize their schools, ambulances and other assets this week. The United States has been trying for years to get Islamabad to move against Lashkar-e-Taiba, which India accuses of being behind the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai that shut down the city for several days and killed more than 160 people. “We’re talking to the U.S. and trying to get them not to take any action against Pakistan,” Mr. Ismail said by telephone. “I think they’re listening to us and I’m more than hopeful we won’t be gray-listed.” But his optimistic tone faded as he recalled a meeting with United States Treasury officials this month. The Pakistani delegation walked away with the impression that “they are still going to put us on the gray list,” he said, calling the Trump administration’s foreign policy inconsistent. "
520,"WASHINGTON — A broad bipartisan group of senators reached agreement Wednesday on a narrow rewrite of the nation’s immigration laws that would bolster border security and resolve the fate of the so-called Dreamers, even as President Trump suggested he would veto any plan that does not adhere to his harder-line approach. Their compromise legislation sets up a clash pitting the political center of the Senate against Mr. Trump and the Republican congressional leadership. Senators in both parties have been racing against a self-imposed end-of-the-week deadline to write legislation that could win wide support by increasing border security while at the same time offering a path to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Members of the bipartisan group, which calls itself the Common Sense Coalition, said their deal does just that. They were working Wednesday evening to determine whether their bill could garner the 60 votes necessary to break a filibuster. “The president’s going to have a vote on his concept. I don’t think it will get 60 votes,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the group, adding: “The bottom line then is: What do you do next? You can do what we’ve done for the last 35 years — blame each other. Or you can actually start fixing the broken immigration system. If you came out of this with strong border security — the president getting his wall and the Dream Act population being taken care of — most Americans would applaud.” The bipartisan measure, sponsored by seven Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent, would appropriate $25 billion for border security, including construction of the president’s proposed wall at the Mexican border, over a 10-year period — not immediately, as Mr. Trump demands. It would also offer an eventual path to citizenship, over 10 to 12 years, for 1.8 million of the young undocumented immigrants, but would preclude them from sponsoring their parents to become citizens. It would make no changes to the diversity visa lottery system, which Mr. Trump wants to end. But in a morning statement, Mr. Trump urged senators to oppose any bill that did not also embrace the “four pillars” of his immigration approach, which includes a rewrite of the nation’s immigration laws that would close the country’s borders to many immigrants trying to come to the United States legally. “I am asking all senators, in both parties, to support the Grassley bill and to oppose any legislation that fails to fulfill these four pillars,” Mr. Trump said in the statement, referring to the chief sponsor of the measure, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. The Grassley bill would provide a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants, end the visa lottery program, build a border wall and severely limit what he calls “chain migration,” which is family-based immigration. It would also increase the use of radar and tower-based surveillance, sensors and drones mostly along the Southwest border, increase the number of border patrol officers and deploy the National Guard to help construct border fencing and operate some of the surveillance equipment. Mr. Grassley said that in offering the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, a chance to become citizens, Mr. Trump had been “much more compassionate on a compromise than anybody thought.” Limiting family-based immigration — which Democrats call “family reunification” — and ending the diversity visa lottery are anathema to Democrats. But it was unclear how many Democrats would sign on to the compromise as an alternative. Senate Democrats met in a closed-door session to talk about the coalition’s plan, and lawmakers emerged saying that some of their colleagues, who favor improvements in border security but have been deeply opposed to building a wall, had reservations. “I know that people want to get some certainty for these kids,” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota. She said she would support the Common Sense measure, but added, “We’re being asked to make some tough compromises.” Mr. Trump’s decision to weigh in forcefully called into question whether any compromise legislation would be dead on arrival at the president’s desk. His statement came as the Senate was just beginning to debate immigration using a novel approach in which lawmakers are trying to build a bill from scratch on the floor. “He’s not helpful at all,’’ said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. “All he does is create a crisis and can’t help us solve it.” In the statement, Mr. Trump said that the “overwhelming majority of American voters support a plan that fulfills the framework’s four pillars, which move us towards the safe, modern and lawful immigration system our people deserve.” He added that he would oppose a short-term “Band-Aid” approach to immigration that some lawmakers have been discussing, which would protect Dreamers for a few years in exchange for a small increase in border security spending — essentially kicking the issue down the road. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, responded harshly to the president’s remarks, noting with dismay that Mr. Trump in September ordered an end to the Obama-era program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protected the Dreamers from deportation and provided them work permits. “The American people know what’s going on,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. “They know this president not only created the problem, but seems to be against every solution that might pass because it isn’t 100 percent of what he wants. If, at the end of the week, we are unable to find a bill that can pass — and I sincerely hope that’s not the case due to the good efforts of so many people on both sides of the aisle — the responsibility will fall entirely on the president’s shoulders and those in this body who went along with him.” Mr. Trump’s statement was a victory for conservatives in his administration, including Stephen Miller, his top domestic policy adviser, who have been pushing the president to demand an overhaul of the nation’s immigration rules in exchange for his support of a permanent solution for the Dreamers. Several senior White House advisers told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump would not relent in backing his hard-line immigration principles and said Dreamers should blame Democrats if legislation did not pass. One senior adviser, who requested anonymity to discuss legislative strategy, said the president had made “dramatic concessions” by agreeing to a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants. Another made it clear that Mr. Trump would not compromise any further. That position was underscored on Wednesday by a statement from the Department of Homeland Security that slammed a competing immigration measure being offered by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. That bipartisan bill would call for more border security, but would not directly finance construction of a border wall that Mr. Trump has promised. The bill would offer a way for Dreamers to become legal; the homeland security statement described it as a “mass legalization” measure. “The McCain-Coons proposal would increase illegal immigration, surge chain migration, continue catch-and-release and give a pathway to citizenship to convicted alien felons,” the statement said. The top Republicans in both the House and Senate praised the statements from the administration on Wednesday, describing them as a lift for the approach that many of their more conservative members support. “The president has made clear what principles must be addressed if we are going to make a law instead of merely making political points,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Wednesday morning. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin echoed that sentiment, saying that “the president did a very good job of putting a very sincere offer on the table. And that sincere offer that he put on the table should be the framework through which we come together to find a solution.” While the president’s support of Mr. Grassley’s bill is not surprising, his vague promise not to support other bills is notable, as Mr. Trump told lawmakers last month that he would sign any immigration bill that Congress sends him. Republican leaders have said Congress should only pass legislation that Mr. Trump would sign, but how flexible the president would be was a crucial question for lawmakers. Asked about Mr. Trump’s veto threat, Mr. Graham said: “Well, then, we won’t go very far. Then you’ll have three presidents who failed. You’ll have Obama, Bush and Trump.” "

523,"Certain issues have become so noisy and stigmatized that they seem to be all-consuming and invisible at once. Abortion is one of them, and Katie Watson wants to change how Americans talk about it — when, that is, they deign to truly talk about it at all. Rates of abortion may be on the decline, largely because of long-term contraceptive use, but as Watson points out in “Scarlet A: The Ethics, Law, & Politics of Ordinary Abortion,” the procedure is far from a fringe practice. Nearly one in five American pregnancies ends in abortion (a number that doesn’t include “spontaneous abortions,” the medical term for miscarriages). Nearly one in four American women will have an abortion in her lifetime. Yet silence perpetuates a belief that abortion is atypical, even when the statistics say otherwise. The conversational void is then filled by advocates on both sides, who emphasize what Watson calls “extraordinary abortion.” Abortion rights activists highlight severe fetal abnormalities and pregnant 12-year-olds; anti-abortion activists highlight pregnancies that are terminated after viability. Such cases are all too real, but fixating on them distorts our understanding of what abortion ordinarily is. Instead of the most common cases, the ones “we discuss most are the ones that occur least,” Watson writes. “There’s something unreal about the American abortion conversation.” Watson, a bioethicist at Northwestern’s medical school and a senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, comes to the debate with her own convictions. Forty-five years ago, with Roe v. Wade, “abortion was correctly identified as a constitutionally protected right, and it must remain legal,” she writes. “That’s not negotiable for me.” What she wants to do is engage directly with the fact that the majority of Americans, even those in favor of abortion’s legality, have deeply ambivalent feelings about abortion itself. “We should be able to acknowledge the complexity of private decision making,” she writes, “without threatening the right of private decision making.” As a guide to the various ways of thinking about abortion, “Scarlet A” is readable and respectful — and therefore, in its own quiet way, revolutionary. Katha Pollitt’s excellent “Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights” (2014) was also addressed to those Americans in the “muddled middle” of the debate, though Pollitt explicitly set out to persuade them that abortion, by allowing women a measure of control over childbearing and therefore their lives, was an unequivocal moral good. Watson’s goal with “Scarlet A” — to get Americans to just start talking with one another — is less polemical but no less difficult, at least in this distrustful day and age. To that end, she begins with a personal anecdote, recounting a trip to Rome when she came across a “foundling wheel” at a hospital. Installed around the year 1200 at the behest of Pope Innocent III, the rotating compartment allowed parents to place their baby in the care of strangers, at a time when unwanted children were commonly drowned in the Tiber River. “Spinning that 800-year-old wheel reminded me what an old question Roe v. Wade revolved around: ‘I’m pregnant, but I don’t want to have a baby. What can I do?’” “Scarlet A” is an unusual hybrid of a book: part memoir, part legal exegesis, part philosophical tract, part conversational guide. Watson delves into the underlying assumptions behind different positions, taking seriously arguments other than her own. She addresses the ethics of abortion — something those who support access to abortion are often loath to do, because of what she calls the “Russian Doll problem”: “the anti-woman, anti-sex, political pot-stirring motivations” that often come hidden in the guise of morality. About an issue so fraught, she knows she can take very little for granted. She acknowledges the trouble with vocabulary and terms (“pro-choice” and “pro-life” are the least of them) that come with arguments baked in. She explains how Supreme Court decisions helped create certain “masterplots” that circumscribe our cultural assumptions. She breaks down the various secular approaches to abortion ethics — whether they treat the issue as a matter of biology, autonomy or public health. She explores the connection between the decline in clinic blockades and the rise in restrictive abortion laws. As comfortable as Watson is when navigating around treacherous shoals, readers seeking the bland flag of neutrality should look elsewhere. “I don’t claim neutrality,” she writes, “I claim plurality.” The same warning goes for those who insist that the claims of embryos and fetuses necessarily trump those of women. If anything, Watson argues, the “never-ending” abortion debate confirms “that the moral status of embryos and fetuses cannot be proven to the degree necessary” to justify government intervention on their behalf. We can talk about embryos and fetuses to no end, circling one another’s uncertainty, but that still “fails to address the moral status of women, about which we are certain: 100 percent people.” Her commitment to the variety of experience means that she’s more interested in empathy than condemnation. When she brings up Scott DesJarlais — the Republican congressman who declared himself “a consistent supporter of pro-life values” even though he and his wife terminated two pregnancies while they were dating — it’s not to cut him down for brazen hypocrisy; it’s to present him as an example of someone who wanted to end a pregnancy for ordinary reasons, including relationship troubles and fear of fetal disability. Watson notes that such discrepancies between public moralizing and private decision making are common. Abortion providers report that a number of patients and their partners feel justified in terminating their own pregnancies even as they denounce others who do the same. “It takes a generous spirit to imagine sympathetic circumstances motivating other people’s behavior, especially when what they’re doing upsets me,” Watson writes. Silence doesn’t help matters; it allows our most suspicious and least generous selves to thrive. But Watson knows that conversation will not make everyone see things the way she does. Her hope is more modest than that: “Sometimes we talk simply to become known to each other, to confirm we live in the same moral universe, though we may never agree.” "
524,"In his meticulously crafted Netflix special “Tamborine,” Chris Rock says Donald J. Trump might just work out as president, then takes a moment to listen to the silence of the crowd at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. “Yeah, I said it,” he adds, in what has become something of a catchphrase for him. Wearing a simple black T-shirt and jeans, Mr. Rock, 53, made his case based not on Mr. Trump’s potential, but rather on how his disastrous tenure could lead to something better, reminding the audience that the mistakes of George W. Bush led to Barack Obama. “People overlook George Bush’s contribution to black history,” he joked. This was one of the few bits in this triumphant comeback special, posted Wednesday, that I don’t recall from his show in Durham, N.C., exactly one year ago, the opening night of his “Total Blackout” tour. Major chunks of material were the same, yet the comedy still seemed transformed. This special, his first in a decade, is more searching and confessional than his previous work, digging into the end of his marriage after 16 years. He has honed this material, beefing up jokes and cutting out fat, and his comedy has become tighter, funnier if also slicker, shifting from a story of a comic struggling with demons to one describing how he once was lost and now he’s found. Mr. Rock’s humor has long married a supremely controlled craft with an appealing sense of danger. “Yeah, I said it” lets you know he wasn’t supposed to. When he started in New York clubs in the 1980s, he closed some sets by saying: “I was in South Africa the other day. Or was it Boston?” After telling that joke on “The Arsenio Hall Show,” the host asked him if he ever worried that his jokes would upset people. Mr. Rock responded that his next target would be Johnny Carson because of a tabloid report that he had a black grandchild he did not financially support. Mr. Hall cut him off, abruptly ending the interview. Mr. Rock rocketed to fame in the next decade with virtuosic specials that were full of intellectual provocations that would probably cause more controversy today when the politics of comedy are more scrutinized. But as he got older, Mr. Rock chose his spots more carefully, calibrating his gibes when he was host of the Oscars in 2016 (though there was a backlash to one about Asian-Americans) and releasing specials infrequently. One of his few peers, Dave Chappelle, who also recently returned from a long hiatus to make a Netflix special, provides a contrast. It’s hard to imagine Mr. Rock releasing a club set after hardly any time to refine it, the way Mr. Chappelle did over New Year’s. Mr. Rock is too much of a perfectionist. And while Mr. Chappelle shows up at clubs and spends hours onstage riffing, gathering ideas through free association, Mr. Rock’s process is much more focused and linear, like his comedy. Whereas Mr. Chappelle escapes tricky territory through sweeping history lessons or literary flourishes, Mr. Rock builds forceful arguments that culminate in precise and memorable epigrams. “Pressure makes diamonds, not hugs” is the pithiest defense of bullying you will hear. Mr. Rock’s booming act has always been built for bigger rooms, but he goes smaller for this special, with the help of the comic Bo Burnham, whose artfully idiosyncratic direction emphasizes intimacy and studiously avoids cliché. The show begins with a casual shot of the back of Mr. Rock’s head while he is chatting backstage and ends abruptly. When the star drops the microphone, Mr. Burnham fades to black before we hear the familiar sound of it hitting the floor. Crisp images of the front row of the theater, juxtaposed with smoky backdrops and ghostly lighting, make the audience appear on the same level as the performer, creating unusually striking images for stand-up comedy. In filming just the first joke — “You would think that cops would occasionally shoot a white kid, just to make it look good” — Mr. Burnham shifts angles four times, but he also knows when to stop moving the camera. As Mr. Rock confesses he cheated on his wife, he goes in for the close-up and lingers. This risks heavy-handedness but displays a perceptive eye for the importance of a pivot point where the star could lose his audience. Kevin Hart, who recently confessed to cheating on his wife before announcing a tour called “Irresponsible,” might face a similar onstage moment soon. When I saw Mr. Rock play Madison Square Garden in December, he took a few glancing shots at Matt Lauer, the “Today” host who was fired over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, but the comic mostly avoided #MeToo as he does in the new special. Though Mr. Rock evoked the movement at one point by shifting from his mistakes with his wife to a broader question: “What is wrong with men?” Over the course of his career, mixing the voice of a preacher with that of a litigator, Mr. Rock has built up an authority skewering the foibles of the world while keeping his own offstage. This special represents a shift in that dynamic. In describing his flaws, Mr. Rock says he was hooked on pornography. There is a lot of comedy about pornography, but to hear a superstar break down how watching it made him “sexually autistic” is bracing, and may even provide grist to certain warnings against online porn. In that North Carolina show, Mr. Rock went into more detail about his affairs. That was cut from the special, leaving nothing to invite jealousy. His tone is contrite, but it also suggests he has recovered, both from porn addiction and cheating, which he says he’s done with. In an hour dense with jokes, he gets serious. “When guys cheat, we want something new,” he says, still in close-up. “But you know what happens? Your woman finds out and now she’s new. She’s never the same again. You got new but you got a bad new.” Offstage, Chris Rock is soft-spoken, thoughtful, even shy — an alter ego to the strutting superhero he becomes in his stand-up specials whose titles (“Bigger & Blacker,” “Never Scared”) telegraph swagger. In the age of Trump, he has shifted to something quieter, more humble, and yet, with the same old confidence, with lessons learned at the end. Mr. Rock does not wallow in melancholy and regret over lost love. He turns them into a great comedy special, just in time for Valentine’s Day. "
525,"President Trump has been nothing if not bold in his promises to generate supercharged economic growth. When a report showed a strong 3.3 percent growth rate last fall, he said, “I see no reason why we don’t go to 4 percent, 5 percent, and even 6 percent,” and he has spoken wistfully of emerging economies where growth can reach higher than that. Even if you treat those musings as presidential bombast, his administration is making detailed projections that the economy will expand much faster in the decade ahead than it has in recent years — a forecast that underpins the Trump policy agenda. The administration forecasts growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent through the next decade, compared with around 2 percent projected by private forecasters and the economists at the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve. If the administration’s forecast comes true, it will imply an economy 12 percent bigger in 2028 than that projected by the more cautious forecasts — an extra $2.8 trillion in economic activity that year, in today’s dollars. But when you look closely at the details of the forecast, not all of it quite adds up. To come true, it would require  some of the strongest improvements in productivity seen in decades, yet also require that interest rates not react the way they have historically when growth strengthens. "
526,"AMMAN, Jordan — President Trump threatened to retaliate against aid recipients like Jordan for having denounced his decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But on Wednesday, his top diplomat gave Jordan more money. In a remarkably cordial reception that contrasted sharply with Vice President Mike Pence’s visit last month, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson signed an agreement that guarantees Jordan nearly $1.3 billion in annual assistance from the United States for the next five years. The aid pact, an increase over the roughly $1 billion in current annual aid to Jordan, was all the more striking because the Trump administration has proposed eliminating much of America’s foreign assistance budget. The increase partly reflected Jordan’s longtime role as an important partner in fighting extremism in the region and housing millions of refugees from the Syria war. But it also appeared to show the value the administration places on Jordan regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even though Jordan was among the 128 members of the United Nations that voted to condemn the United States two months ago over Mr. Trump’s decision on Jerusalem, the contested holy city that Palestinians want part of as their future capital. Mr. Trump and his United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, vowed back then to “take names” and remember how American aid recipients had voted, implying their assistance would be cut. "
527,      
528,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s military parade will not come cheap. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, estimated on Wednesday that the public display of America’s military might that Mr. Trump has called for could cost between $10 million and $30 million, and said the government would have to come up with a way to cover the cost. Funding for the parade was not included in the White House’s 2019 budget request, which was released on Monday, because it was a relatively new idea, Mr. Mulvaney said at a House Budget Committee hearing on Wednesday. He explained that the final cost would be determined by the size, scope and length of the parade. “We will continue to work with you folks if we decide to continue forward with this initiative,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “Of course, you’d have to appropriate funds for it or we would have to find funds that we’ve already appropriated.” Stan Collender, a former staff member on the House and Senate budget committees, said that the funding for the parade could be found without a formal budget request by using existing money already in the Department of Defense budget or possibly from the Department of Homeland Security or the National Park Service. The president has said that he wants to celebrate the armed forces with a spectacle akin to the Bastille Day parade in France. The last such celebration in Washington occurred in the summer 1991 when the end of the relatively brief Persian Gulf War was celebrated with a $12 million dollar victory parade. "

530,"Near the end of 2015, the playwright Lindsey Ferrentino and the actress Jamie Brewer were watching clips of Donald J. Trump, then a candidate, appearing to mock a reporter with a physical disability. They were horrified — which made their work on a new play, centered on a character with Down syndrome, all the more significant. “From that point forward, the play took on a new meaning for me,” Ms. Ferrentino said. “Big time,” Ms. Brewer added. “Watching you watch that video, seeing your reaction to it, you cried,” Ms. Ferrentino said, turning to her. “I was emotional,” Ms. Brewer said. The play, “Amy and the Orphans,” which opens March 1 in a Roundabout Theater Company production at the Laura Pels Theater, is a barrier-breaking show. Ms. Brewer, 33, and her understudy, Edward Barbanell, 40, are thought to be the only known performers with Down syndrome to play the lead in an Off Broadway or Broadway theater production. The show is about three siblings who reunite after their father’s death, and the road trip that follows. Ms. Ferrentino, who debuted with the critically acclaimed play “Ugly Lies the Bone,” in 2015, was insistent that the title role be played by someone with the disability, even leaving a note in an early draft of the script: “Finding a talented actor with Down syndrome isn’t difficult. So please do it.” Ms. Brewer is a veteran actress best known for her groundbreaking work on the television series “American Horror Story.” Mr. Barbanell, who goes by Eddie, played Billy in the 2005 movie “The Ringer,” starring Johnny Knoxville. He and Ms. Brewer have performed onstage for much of their lives. "
531,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) There are many ways elected officials can respond to criticism from their local newspaper. A letter to the editor. A call to the publisher. A tweet. Or they can just ignore it. Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican at the center of the storm over the release of a classified memorandum challenging the F.B.I. investigation of President Trump and Russia, has come up with a response particularly fitting for our times: He has created his own news site, a curation of news from both nonpartisan and partisan sources. It is called “The California Republican.” Some of the headlines on The Republican, the existence of which was first reported by Politico, have little to do with Mr. Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. But others provide the defense of Mr. Nunes that he may have found lacking in more conventional news media. “There’s another memo you haven’t heard about. What’s in it?” reads one headline, referring to a memorandum written by Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “The Grassley-Graham memo appears to back up the now-famous Nunes memo, according to National Review.” It’s not all-Nunes-all-the-time. Another article pointed to the latest cost overruns involving the high-speed train Gov. Jerry Brown is trying to build in California, over the objections of California Republicans, among them, Mr. Nunes. It’s hard to fault Mr. Nunes for being unhappy with his press coverage. An editorial in The Fresno Bee, for example, referred to Mr. Nunes as “Trump’s stooge.” "
532,"Barnaby Joyce was probably the last politician average Australians would expect to be embroiled in a sex scandal. A comparison to Mike Pence isn’t so far-fetched: They’re both second in charge of a conservative government led by a flashy businessman, and standard-bearers for family values, tilled in the nation’s agrarian heartland. For most of the Australian public, Mr. Joyce was a bumbling farm boy who meant well. Last week, though, a story broke that turned public sentiment against him. Following investigations by two small websites last year, the Sydney-based Daily Telegraph reported that the deputy prime minister was having a child with a former staff member, Vikki Campion. A photo on the front page of the tabloid showed Ms. Campion, pregnant and unwitting, crossing the street. (“Bundle of Joyce” said the headline.) That this story, like so many others, involves personal hypocrisy is hardly surprising. Mr. Joyce has been a strident opponent of gay marriage, basing his opposition in part on what he has called his four daughters’ right to a “secure relationship with a loving husband” and the right of every child “to know her or his mother and father.” What is more noteworthy is the degree to which the Joyce affair has sparked a long-overdue debate about the deference Australian media still accords politicians when it comes to their private lives. Mr. Joyce’s relationship with Ms. Campion, we’ve learned in the past few days, was an open secret among the Canberra press corps. Back in October, Sharri Markson, the reporter who eventually got the print scoop, wrote a piece alluding to a “deeply personal crisis” in Mr. Joyce’s life. Now that the story’s out there, it’s very easy to read between the lines about “vicious rumors” and “personal pressures” in dozens of media clips from last year. The deputy prime minister’s private situation was well known enough that he got into a pub brawl with a constituent about it last year and apparently knocked the man’s hat off. Did the media choose not report on Mr. Joyce because they didn’t have all the facts? Perhaps in part. As the national broadsheet The Australian has reported, repeated inquiries about Ms. Campion’s multiple job titles, let alone her taxpayer-funded salary, were met with stonewalling. Mr. Joyce would refuse to talk about the relationship when they asked. (This week, he released a statement denying that the relationship, and Ms. Campion’s employment in the government, breached ministerial rules.) Another major consideration is that Australian journalists face extremely strict libel laws, the kind Donald Trump would appreciate. And yet The Telegraph wasn’t congratulated by its peers for nailing down a tough story — if anything, it was condemned, with concerns raised about hurting the feelings of Mr. Joyce’s daughters (as if their feelings had not already been hurt); the tawdriness of a long-lens picture of a pregnant woman (undeniable, but perhaps an unfortunate byproduct of those stringent libel laws, which demand absolute proof); and the sentiment that “we’re no saints ourselves.” "
533,"JERUSALEM — As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fought back Wednesday against a police finding that he had accepted nearly $300,000 in bribes, his cool self-confidence betrayed not the slightest worry that he could be forced to step down anytime soon. “The coalition is stable, and no one, me or anyone else, has plans to go to elections,” he declared in Tel Aviv. “We will continue to work together with you for the citizens of the State of Israel, until the end of our term,” in late 2019. If Mr. Netanyahu had entered a dangerous new period in which he must battle for his political survival and avoid imprisonment, he did so possessed of political advantages that no Israeli prime minister has before enjoyed. Beloved by his base and respected even by his adversaries as a guardian of Israel’s security, Mr. Netanyahu remains the dominant figure on the Israeli stage, his combined 12 years as prime minister closing in on the record of David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s principal founder. And he has defended that position in part by steadily chipping away at the institutions that balance the powers of his office in ways that seem to echo the aggressive tactics of President Trump, except that he was doing it before there was a President Trump. He and his governing coalition have campaigned to curb the activist Israeli judiciary, demonized the rambunctious press as a bastion of left-wing partisans, attacked the funding of nongovernmental organizations whose worldview they see as hostile and, as the police closed in, he has done his utmost to discredit them, too.

Most of the fatalities were attributed to an American airstrike that was called in by Kurdish fighters. The Kremlin suggested that any Russians were mercenaries, not soldiers.

Hackers are already using bot armies to promote partisan causes on social media, they said. (Islamist militants and cyberattacks ranked among other top threats.) Separately, Trump administration officials revised earlier claims that White House staff members had been unaware of F.B.I. warnings about problems in the background check of Rob Porter, the president’s staff secretary. Mr. Porter resigned in disgrace last week. Mr. Porter never got a permanent security clearance, but he’s not alone. The president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is also operating on an interim status that gives him access to classified material. _____ • Can Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stay in office? That was the question after the Israeli police said that they had gathered enough evidence for bribery and fraud charges. The attorney general must now decide whether to indict Mr. Netanyahu, a process that could take months. The damning summary of their findings referred to a steady flow of cigars and pink champagne in Mr. Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence in quantities sufficient to stock a small cocktail lounge. _____ • Germans have had reason to reflect on the state of their union: Since last week, the Berlin Wall has been down longer than it stood.

The term is a clear cut above the “marshal” title held by North Korea’s third and current leader, Kim Jong-un. The younger Mr. Kim may stay in power for decades, though, and he already has several titles: “Dear respected comrade,” for one, as well as “supreme commander” of the Korean People’s Army.

536,"WASHINGTON — AT&T is seeking to put the head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division on its witness list in a trial over the government’s decision to block the phone giant’s $85 billion merger with Time Warner, according to two people with knowledge of the pretrial activity. The company’s request for the antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, to testify is highly unusual. By putting Mr. Delrahim on the witness list, AT&T is effectively forcing him to defend his own decision to oppose the blockbuster merger. The trial over the Justice Department’s lawsuit to stop the deal is scheduled to begin on March 19. “I never heard of something like that happening in my time there,” said John M. Newman, an assistant professor of antitrust law at the University of Memphis School of Law and a former trial lawyer for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “It’s a big nasty move to poke a finger at the other side by calling its counsel as a witness.” Mr. Delrahim was included in a list of witnesses submitted to the court by AT&T in recent days, according to two people with knowledge about the company’s demands, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential. AT&T has also asked for internal communications between Mr. Delrahim’s office and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they said. As part of that request, AT&T has also asked for email, phone and other communications between the White House and officials in the Justice Department, the people said. AT&T and Time Warner announced their $85 billion deal in October 2016. If completed, it would create a media and telecom giant with AT&T’s wireless and satellite television service and Time Warner’s movies and television assets. The combination is expected to transform the media landscape and set up the company to have a powerful grip over how consumers get streaming entertainment over mobile devices. But the Justice Department sued to block the merger last November. Mr. Delrahim and other officials said the combination of telecom and media giants would harm competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. "
537,"WASHINGTON — In Pennsylvania, a Republican lawmaker unhappy with a State Supreme Court ruling on gerrymandering wants to impeach the Democratic justices who authored it. In Iowa, a running dispute over allowing firearms in courthouses has prompted bills by Republican sponsors to slash judges’ pay and require them to personally pay rent for courtrooms that are gun-free. In North Carolina, the Republican Party is working on sweeping changes to rein in state courts that have repeatedly undercut or blocked laws passed by the legislature. Rather than simply fighting judicial rulings, elected officials in some states across the country — largely Republicans, but Democrats as well — are increasingly seeking to punish or restrain judges who hand down unfavorable decisions, accusing them of making law instead of interpreting it. Civil liberties advocates and other critics have a different take: The real law-flouting, they say, is by politicians who want to punish justices whose decisions offend their own ideological leanings. Court-bashing is nothing new. As far back as the 1800s, New Hampshire’s legislature disbanded the state’s Supreme Court five times, said Bill Raftery, a senior analyst at the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., who has tracked legislation affecting the judicial system for years. "
538,"You’ve been a White House correspondent for 21 years. To some extent, there’s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn’t like, but nothing compared with this. There’s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term “fake news” — he’s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press. What’s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It’s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you’re getting more in the weeds of what’s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don’t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it’s not about journalists; it’s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you’re bashing the idea of getting truth out. What’s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We’re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn’t know the person’s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don’t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too. Your reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I’m so sad about that. My boss has always said, “You need to know how to play poker.” I don’t. I’m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people’s minds being in the gutter after President Trump’s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don’t play to the camera. I go in there, and I’m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much. "

541,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Fears of overheating may be overdone. • Goldman adds a new co-head of global M.&A. • Expect Wall Street to keep worrying about inflation. • Finra is looking into potential misconduct involving the VIX. • The Justice Department’s antitrust chief may be called as a witness in the Time Warner lawsuit. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Wall Street is worried about inflation right now – and a government report on Wednesday likely didn’t quell those concerns. The consumer price index rose by 2.1 percent rise in January, faster than Wall Street analysts expected. The core index, which excludes food and energy, also came in above forecasts, prompting Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan, to describe it as “hotter than Hades.” While the stock market shrugged off the jump in inflation, bond markets got a bit of a jolt. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year. "
542,"The remote rain forests in Peru’s northeast corner are vast — so vast that the clouds that form above them can influence rainfall in the western United States. The region contains species, especially unusual fish, that are unlike any found elsewhere on Earth. Scientists studying the area’s fauna and flora may gain insights into evolutionary processes and into the ecological health and geological history of the Amazon. Now the area has become home to one of the Western Hemisphere’s newest national parks. Yaguas National Park will protect millions of acres of roadless wilderness — and the indigenous people who rely on it — from development and deforestation. “This is a place where the forest stretches to the horizon,” said Corine Vriesendorp, a conservation ecologist at The Field Museum in Chicago, one of many organizations that worked to win the national park designation, Peru’s highest level of protection. “This is one of the last great intact forests on the globe.” The designation stands in contrast to moves in the United States that may weaken protections for wilderness. President Trump has made a priority of scaling back national monuments like Bears Ears in Utah, and many advisers to the National Park System recently quit, citing concerns about the administration’s commitment to environmental protections. "
543,"One of the striking features of Donald Trump’s first year in office was the all-but-complete abandonment of the populist economic vision upon which he successfully campaigned. Candidate Trump stiff-armed Republican economic orthodoxy and won the Midwest by promising a flood of infrastructure spending, universal health care, protectionism, middle-class tax cuts — a right-wing Keynesianism for the common man. But as president he defaulted to Paul Ryan’s agenda, chasing the Tea Party dream of Obamacare repeal, issuing a budget proposal thick with discretionary spending cuts, and pursuing a tax reform tilted heavily toward corporations. The best way to understand this turn was to recognize that personnel are policy, and since “Trumpism” was an unexpected irruption and Trump himself is not exactly the sort of guy who worries about having a policy brain trust, the people available to staff and guide his administration were inevitably more conventionally conservative than the half-sketched ideas of his campaign. Once Steve Bannon, the only inner-circle figure with an ideological vision, flamed out spectacularly as a Karl Rove-like eminence, a default to Ryanism was all-but-guaranteed, and with it the abandonment of Trump’s promise to remake the G.O.P. as a “worker’s party.” But if that was the major policy story of year one, the drift of Republican policymaking since the failure of Obamacare repeal has been a little different, a little more populist, a little closer to the way that Trump campaigned. Even without a Bannon-like figure consciously shaping policy, Trumpism still exerts a gravitational pull on the Republican Party, because its broad outlines are actually popular in a way that the austerian elements of the overlapping Ryan and Tea Party agendas never really were. This pull exerted itself weakly but meaningfully on the tax bill, which was dominated by a corporate tax cut but also reshaped around the edges to cut more taxes for the middle class and families. It exerted itself a little more on Trump’s decision to replace Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chairman with Jerome Powell, which amounted to a vote for a looser monetary policy rather than the hard-money approach that Republicans had consistently favored under Obama. And then on the budget that just passed Congress, Trumpism was more like a Death Star tractor beam, dragging the G.O.P. well away from all its professed Obama-era priorities: Gone was the sequester, gone was all the talk of cutting and capping and balancing, and instead we got a guns-and-butter budget that would have done Lyndon Johnson or George W. Bush proud. Combine this flood of spending with the Trump White House’s attempt to get a skills-based and restrictionist immigration reform through Congress, throw in some smaller ideas under consideration, like the Marco Rubio-Ivanka Trump paid parental leave plan, and you have a Year 2 of the Trump era in which Trumpism actually seems meaningful again. Not as a completely coherent agenda, obviously, but as a tendency, a force pulling conservatism toward a nationalism-infused deficit-financed populism even when Ryan and Mick Mulvaney are theoretically setting the agenda. This populist pull makes hypocrites of many Republican legislators, as liberals are eager to point out, since it induces them to vote for budgets that they would have denounced as socialism under Barack Obama. But there is pathos to the hypocrisy as well as cynicism. Republicans denounce big spending while in opposition because opposition offers the luxury of principle, and then they accept spending once in power because the nature of governance make them feel like prisoners of the public’s will … and then they look forward to defeat, at some level, because it liberates them to return the true faith, free of the corrupting responsibility to please a public bigger than their base. But if the pathos is real, it is also ultimately somewhat stupid. A political party is not a church with standards too holy for this world, stooping to govern and then reclaiming its sanctity once it returns to opposition. Conservatism should be a governing philosophy, not an endless cycle of corruption followed by exile and repentance. And the fact that “populism” or “Trumpism” — like “compassionate” or “big government” conservatism before it — exerts an inevitable pull on Republican administrations and majorities is a sign that a Trumpian or George W. Bushian mix of cultural conservatism and economic populism is in fact the natural basis for an American center-right majority, resisted only by a Republican ideological apparatus that persists in believing in a limited-government ideal so fine no actual government can implement it. This reality was apparent to Trump, in his crude and demagogic way, as it was apparent to Bush before him. But it is not apparent to enough Republicans at the moment for the party to act on it effectively. So instead of a clear focus on the kind of populism that might advance conservative priorities — direct spending to support work and family and marriage, above all — we get doomed cavalry charges against popular programs followed by a shrugging acceptance of more funding for the welfare-state status quo. Trump is not the right man to break this cycle. But the recent drift back toward campaign-season Trumpism in defiance of the White House’s official blueprints is a sign for those with eyes to see. The populist center-right is the only place where Republicans can stand and plausibly hope to govern. It would be nice if someday they tried to do so, not haphazardly and hypocritically and often stupidly, but intelligently and consistently and well. "
544,"The White House knew about problems with the staff secretary Rob Porter’s security clearance nearly a year before he was forced to resign, F.B.I. director Christopher Wray said this week. We know now that the hold up on his clearance was tied to allegations of domestic abuse — and the Trump White House seems to have known that by last November, too. This contradicts Trump aides’ reassurances that they were as shocked as anyone to read about Porter’s alleged misogynist violence in The Daily Mail last week. (I fail to see how the notion that the executive branch gets its intelligence from The Daily Mail could possibly be reassuring to any sentient creature crawling this planet’s sizzling crust, but many things are beyond me these days.) Wray testified that the F.B.I. sent the White House a partial report about the “problems” with Porter in March 2017, following that with a full background check in July, and a further update in November. The investigation was “administratively closed” in January, several weeks before Donald Trump presumably — according to the White House’s initial timeline — heard about the allegations against his buddy. True to form for the Trump White House, even doing nothing was an unachievably high bar. Not only was Porter allowed to remain in his position (and briefly defended by the administration after the allegations finally became public), at the time of his termination he was reportedly being considered for multiple promotions: speechwriting, an expanded policy portfolio, a crack at deputy chief of staff. CNN reported that chief of staff John Kelly, aware of the allegations for months, “told associates that Porter was one of the few competent professionals on his staff and wanted to ensure that he was being used to his full potential.” One wonders if Kelly saw the photographs of Porter’s ex-wife’s face, the gold and the purple nimbus around her eye, the angry swell, the throb of it. What a luxurious degree of compartmentalization we afford white men — to not only separate Porter the guy-whose-ex-wife-filed-a-protective-order-against-him from Porter the guy-who-is-pretty-good-at-being-a-staff-secretary, but then to weigh their relative importance and choose the latter. (I believe that unit of measurement is called “capitalism.”) Inasmuch as we can judge a person’s interior based on their actions, it’s fair to say that a man who disregards women’s physical and sexual boundaries, as President Trump reportedly has, does not care about women. If it is possible to simultaneously care about women and subordinate their wishes to yours, to prioritize your sexual urges over their bodily autonomy, then what does “care” even mean? I think it’s also fair to say that a man who lashes out at women with physical violence, as Porter allegedly has, harbors some degree of hatred for them. What else does “hatred” mean if not this — the object of our fury, the thing we love to hurt? "
545,"So Kavous Seyed Emami, an Iranian-Canadian university professor and environmentalist, “commits suicide” in Tehran’s Evin prison two weeks after his arrest. His wife Maryam, summoned last Friday, is shown his body hanging in a cell. He is buried four days later in a village north of the capital, without an independent autopsy and after his family has come under intense Revolutionary Guard pressure to accept the official version of events. Tell me another. Seyed Emami’s death is an outrage and an embarrassment to the Islamic Republic. I met him in Iran in 2009, on the eve of a tumultuous presidential election that would lead to massive demonstrations and bloody repression. The theocratic regime that promised freedom in 1979 only to deliver another form of repression stood briefly on a knife-edge. Seyed Emami was a thoughtful, mild-mannered man, a sociologist and patriot with a love of nature. The notion that he would hang himself in a prison where they remove even your shoelaces strikes me as preposterous. “I still can’t believe this,” his son Ramin Seyed Emami, a musician whose stage name is King Raam, wrote on Instagram. Since anti-government protests began late last year, mainly in poorer areas that had been strongholds of the regime, Seyed Emami is the third case of a supposed suicide while in custody. In him, several of the phobias of Iranian hard-liners found a focus. He was a dual national of the kind President Hassan Rouhani, a reformist, is trying to lure back to the country to spur growth. He was an environmentalist, one of the founders of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, at a time when mismanagement and reckless dam building by the Revolutionary Guard and its front companies have contributed to water shortages. He was a Western-educated Iranian of the Rouhani camp, whose confrontation with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is in a particularly delicate phase. Why delicate? Because nobody knows how to handle the succession to Khamenei, who is 78, has ruled for almost three decades and, as divine arbiter (a man standing in for the occulted 12th imam until his expected reappearance), embodies the anti-democratic intrusion of heaven on a system with a veneer of democratic institutions.

547,"SYDNEY — Australia’s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has spent most of his career advocating for rural voters and strong families, and shouting down welfare cheats. But on Wednesday in Parliament, he offered a full-throated defense for remaining in office despite an affair with a former staff member who is now pregnant, and with whom he lived rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy supporter. Such is the scandal known as #barnababy, which in just one week has gone from a debate about privacy, sex and tabloids to an indictment of Australia’s crony politics. “This whole incident is absolutely tailor-made to undercut people’s faith in the Parliament, which is already at an all-time low,” said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in Queensland. The longer Mr. Joyce stays in office, she added, the more resentment about politics grows. All of Canberra, Australia’s capital, seems to be on trial now, with its cozy, clubby ways looking increasingly inappropriate. “It is not a healthy place,” Professor Rimmer said. “It runs on alcohol and gossip and fumes and power.” "
548,"Good morning on this Valentine’s Day-Ash Wednesday. It’s the biggest day of the year for roses. We traced a bouquet from Manhattan’s flower district back to the source, and it turns out that behind the collective show of love is a feat of logistics. It began last summer, at a flower farm around 9,000 feet above sea level, in the mountains of Ecuador, when a rose bush began to show buds, said Stephen Faitos, who runs Starbright Floral Design, a small shop in the flower district. About six months later, those buds were poised to bloom, and the farm opened an online auction in which florists across the world — including Starbright Floral Design, which Mr. Faitos runs with his father — could bid on the blossoms. The roses were then cut, setting the countdown clock ticking on their 19-day life span. They traveled by truck along winding mountain roads to Quito, were packed onto a cargo plane and flown to Miami, inspected by customs and United States Department of Agriculture officials, and flown that same day at La Guardia Airport. Starbright’s drivers were waiting there with a refrigerated truck and chauffeured them into Manhattan, where they joined some 40,000 flowers from around South America that the shop had ordered for Valentine’s Day. They included two dozen colors; 12 shades of red alone. The roses were all a little tired-looking from the journey, the florists said, so workers spent the next few days nursing them back to health — hydrating, cleaning and preening them before arranging them into $100 dozens to be delivered to New Yorkers.

549,"It may not be on any syllabus, but college has always been a time for young people to learn about relationships and sex. But as the internet increasingly influences the ways we interact, it also transforms how students date and find partners. We asked students at nine colleges and universities how technology affects the campus dating scene. Madeline Apple, University of Michigan, Class of 2018 Dating apps may have killed the college dating scene. Because it’s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it’s become harder to actually meet anyone. As students, we are told over and over that college is a time for us to expand our social groups, to meet new people and grow into adults. But the indecisiveness that is built into dating app culture can stunt us — we’re trapped in an endless cycle of swipes! Commitment, already a scary concept to many, becomes even more difficult with the false illusion that the dating possibilities are endless. Frankly, dating apps can also just make things incredibly awkward. My freshman year I swiped through hundreds of people. At one of the last tailgates of the year, a random man walked by me and yelled: “Hey! We matched on Tinder! You are Tinder girl!” I was mortified. Suddenly everyone around me knew that I was on Tinder. And I had swiped through so many people, I had no idea who this guy was. He was just another nameless “match” that I would never get to know. Because, needless to say, I walked away and never spoke to that guy again. Tinder is supposed to bring people together, but it actually pushes them emotionally further apart. The fact that there could be hundreds, if not thousands, of potential dates in your pocket gives an illusion of possibility. In reality, students just become more isolated in a world of fake interactions and awkward run-ins with old matches. We’re not getting out of our comfort zone to meet new people. Why approach someone in person when you can hide behind a Tinder profile? "

554,"Among the numerous harebrained ideas in President Trump’s budget proposal this week, one stands out as especially pernicious: a scheme that would slash an essential antipoverty program and put fresh food further out of reach for 46 million low-income people, or one in seven Americans. The Trump administration wants to cut the budget of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, popularly known as food stamps, by nearly 30 percent over a decade. It plans to accomplish this, in large part, by giving low-income families boxes of pasta, cereal and other nonperishable foods, rather than giving them the full amount of their benefit on electronic cards, as the SNAP program works today. Those cards can be used at about 260,000 retail stores and farmers’ markets nationwide to buy a wide range of fresh and packaged food, allowing recipients to shop with their families’ preferences and dietary needs in mind. The administration argues that its proposal, which also would make it harder for adults living without children or other dependents to benefit from the program if they aren’t employed, is “designed to improve nutrition and target benefits to those who need them, while ensuring careful stewardship of taxpayers’ money.” If Mr. Trump and his aides actually cared about improving nutrition and the lives of low-income Americans, they would be trying to put more money into SNAP, not less. The program has done a heroic job of reducing poverty and improving the lives of millions of people. Studies have found that the program’s beneficiaries are less likely to report not having enough to eat. They are also less likely to take sick days and are shown to spend less on health care compared with similar people who do not benefit from the program. Further, children who grow up in families enrolled in SNAP are more likely to graduate from high school and be economically self-sufficient as adults. Right-wing ideologues in the Trump administration seem to consider SNAP a wasteful welfare program that needs to be brought to heel. In reality, the program is a relative bargain that provides fairly modest benefits to some of the poorest people in the country. The government spent about $70 billion on SNAP in 2017, less than 2 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget. The average beneficiary gets $126 a month. The people who are helped by the program tend to have very low incomes, are retired or have disabilities. A family of three generally has to earn less than $26,600 a year to qualify. "
555,"WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren addressed questions about her racial heritage and vowed in a speech on Wednesday to a group of tribes to do more for Native Americans, using an unannounced appearance to confront a political liability before a potential bid for president. In remarks to the National Congress of American Indians, Ms. Warren quickly, and bluntly, invoked President Trump’s derisive nickname for her, recalling that he had called her “Pocahontas” last year at a ceremony honoring Navajo code talkers from World War II. “The joke, I guess, is supposed to be on me,” she said of a taunt that stems from her longstanding claims of American Indian ancestry, which she has been unable to document. Ms. Warren, speaking from prepared remarks, did not offer new evidence of what she has said is her Cherokee and Delaware heritage, conceding, “You won’t find my family members on any rolls, and I’m not enrolled in a tribe.” “And I want to make something clear: I respect that distinction,” she said to applause. “I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes — and only by tribes.” Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a former professor at Harvard Law School, listed herself as a member of a minority group in a law school directory but has not claimed to be a Native American since being elected to the Senate in 2012.

The organization spearheaded an open letter criticizing his travel ban and has closely tracked his relationship with the media. On Wednesday, it announced that its next PEN World Voices literary festival, with the theme “Resist and Reimagine,” will be held April 16-22 and will include appearances by Roxane Gay; Colson Whitehead; Dave Eggers; Jhumpa Lahiri; and Salman Rushdie, a founder of the festival. While previous iterations have had a more global lens, this one — the 14th — will feature writers from around the world mostly discussing the United States. “We are deliberately training the festival’s wide lens on America itself, probing the fissures and inconsistencies in our own culture,” Chip Rolley, the festival’s director, said in a statement. The festival will unfold across the five boroughs. The opening event will take place on April 16 at the Cooper Union’s Great Hall, with Mr. Whitehead, Leila Slimani and Maxine Beneba Clarke, who will discuss the underground railroad, immigration and the refugee crisis. On April 20, Jelani Cobb, Gregory Pardlo and The New York Times Magazine writer Nikole Hannah-Jones will explore race relations 50 years after the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On April 22, Hasan Minhaj of “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” will discuss being an Indian-American Muslim in the Trump era, and reflect back on his performance at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner. (The president skipped the event.) Also on April 22, Ron Chernow, the author of “Alexander Hamilton,” will speak with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes about his 2017 biography, “Grant,” about the life and presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. And the #MeToo movement is on the festival’s agenda: On April 17, Ms. Clarke and others will present a program of poetry and other readings under the title of “Us Too.” Ms. Gay, a Times Op-Ed contributing writer, will address the movement in a wide-ranging conversation on April 20.

561,"Winston Churchill is supposed to have said: “With integrity, nothing else counts. Without integrity, nothing else counts.” In fact, that seems to be one of those Churchillian epigrams that Churchill never actually got around to saying. But it captures an important truth about politics, that dishonor is like a cancer that spreads inexorably as it feeds upon ambition, protects itself with lies and doubles down with cover-ups. Looking at the chaos in the White House these days, I worry about inexperience, incompetence and lack of judgment. But maybe I worry most about an utter lack of integrity — and the way it is proving infectious. The contagion of dishonor has spread irresistibly through the White House staff, turning aides into con artists. Indifference to ethics has spread through the cabinet and agencies, resulting in endless scandals. And the epidemic has rippled through much of the G.O.P. (with some heroic exceptions), turning lawmakers into enablers and hypocrites. The Rob Porter affair, for example, isn’t just about Porter any more but about what seems to be a cover-up and a dismissiveness toward domestic violence. John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, claimed that he had removed Porter within 40 minutes of learning of credible allegations of Porter’s domestic abuse; to listen to F.B.I. testimony, it now seems it may have been seven months. President Trump said on Wednesday that he is against domestic violence. But when you have to say that, something is wrong. We have a president who has himself been accused of domestic violence (an allegation of rape by his first wife that she later retracted), who has lost two aides to accusations of domestic violence, whose chief of staff (a retired four-star Marine general) in 2016 praised a colonel as a “superb Marine officer” after he had been accused of sexually harassing two women. More broadly, while I understand the sorrow people feel for a colleague who is self-immolating, the White House’s initial comments came across as discounting one of the most common kinds of violence in America today. Some 28,000 Americans are sent to emergency rooms each year because of domestic violence. Almost 20 people are victimized each minute. This isn’t a fringe issue: It claims far more American lives than terrorism. The White House would never be caught with a bank robbery suspect on its staff, so why tolerate someone alleged to be a wife beater? The answer has to do, I think, with a lack of integrity, an absence of a moral compass, a narcissism in which the all-consuming need becomes to protect oneself and one’s boss. Lack of integrity may also be the best way to capture the morphing scandal of the pre-election $130,000 payoff to a porn star to apparently keep quiet about an affair with Trump. It’s bad enough that Trump appears to have been cheating on Melania right after she had their baby (“Oh, don’t worry about her,” he is said to have told the actress). But with the payoff and reported cover-up, Trump is betraying all of us. When The Wall Street Journal first reported the porn-star payout by Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime lawyer, Cohen denounced the report as a “false narrative” of “outlandish allegations.” Oops. Take two. This week, Cohen confirmed the payment in a statement saying that he “facilitated” the transfer with his own cash. It doesn’t seem quite true, as some news organizations reported, that Cohen precisely denied that he had been reimbursed. Cohen’s statement was artful. He denied that he had been reimbursed by either the Trump Organization or the Trump presidential campaign, but not that he had been reimbursed by someone else — say, by Trump himself. (The White House did not respond to my inquiry about whether Trump had personally paid the $130,000.) Sometimes politicians, liberals and conservatives alike, are unprincipled in pursuit of principles they are passionate about. But Trump aides don’t seem to believe in any cause larger than themselves or their leader. That’s alarming because of the risks that even worse might lie ahead. When self-absorbed people are caught in a growing scandal, they overreach. In this case, that might mean the firing of Robert Mueller or Rod Rosenstein, or some military clash that changes the subject. To be clear, I don’t think officials would deliberately turn to war as a solution to political problems, but we all have a remarkable ability to persuade ourselves that what is good for us is also good for the country. Every administration suffers embarrassments. But when there is a basic lack of integrity at the top, these do not easily self-correct; rather, they build upon themselves because of an impulse to cover up and layer new deceptions on top of old deceit. That seems to be what is happening in both the Rob Porter and porn-payoff scandals. The risk is that this stain continues to spread, metastasizing and bringing down everything around it. And to me, it looks as if the Trump administration is now metastasizing. "

563,"WASHINGTON — The meeting, to say the least, had not gone well. Upset at a presidential dressing down, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had just left the White House vowing to resign. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, raced out of the building, found him in his car, banged on the door and implored him to come back inside. The dramatic episode, described by Mr. Priebus in a soon-to-be-released book, proved a turning point in the relationship between President Trump and his attorney general, one that has shaped the administration ever since. More than any president in modern times, Mr. Trump has engaged in a high stakes public conflict with the Justice Department with extensive potential consequences. Mr. Priebus’s account comes in a new chapter included in the paperback edition of “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,” by Chris Whipple, to be published on March 6 by Broadway Books. In interviews with the author, Mr. Priebus gave the first extended description of his tumultuous six months as Mr. Trump’s top aide. Vanity Fair posted an excerpt from the new chapter on Wednesday. Mr. Priebus described a roller-coaster experience trying to impose discipline on one of the most undisciplined figures in American politics, a period that led to his unhappy departure last summer when Mr. Trump unceremoniously announced his resignation on Twitter just before Mr. Priebus disembarked Air Force One in the rain. From rushing out ill-prepared executive orders to arguing over the president’s Twitter fixation, Mr. Priebus struggled as none of his predecessors had before in a job that is historically among the toughest in Washington. “Take everything you’ve heard and multiply it by 50,” he said. Working for Mr. Trump, he added, was “like riding the strongest and most independent horse.” But he expressed admiration for Mr. Trump’s toughness and allowed that perhaps the president was right about Twitter. The meeting that nearly led to Mr. Sessions’s resignation came last May shortly after the president fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was heading an investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and any cooperation with Mr. Trump’s campaign. The dismissal of Mr. Comey, which Mr. Trump in an interview with NBC News linked to his unhappiness with the Russia investigation, triggered the appointment of a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to the ire of the president. Mr. Trump was furious with Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and therefore losing control over it. Mr. Priebus’s account confirms and adds more detail to a New York Times report that the president berated Mr. Sessions in a meeting in the Oval Office, leading him to offer his resignation. Vice President Mike Pence and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, were in the meeting, but Mr. Priebus was not. “Don McGahn came in my office pretty hot, red, out of breath and said, ‘We’ve got a problem,’” Mr. Priebus recalled. “I responded, ‘What?’ And he said, ‘Well, we just got a special counsel and Sessions just resigned.’ I said, ‘What? What the hell are you talking about?’ And I said, ‘That can’t happen.’” Mr. Priebus bolted down the back stairway of the West Wing and out the door to the parking lot and found Mr. Sessions in the back of a black sedan with the engine running and about to leave. “I knocked on the door of the car and Jeff was sitting there and I just jumped in and shut the door and I said, ‘Jeff, what’s going on?’” Mr. Priebus said. “And then he told me that he was going to resign.” “I said, ‘You cannot resign. It’s not possible. We are going to talk about this right now,’” Mr. Priebus continued. “So I dragged him back up to my office from the car. Pence and Bannon came in,” he added, referring to Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, “and we started talking to him to the point where he decided that he would not resign right then and he would instead think about it.” In the end, Mr. Sessions still drafted a resignation letter later that night and sent it to the White House. Mr. Priebus then went to work on Mr. Trump, arguing that he should not accept it. The president reluctantly agreed and Mr. Sessions stayed. But that did not end the danger to the attorney general. A couple months later, Mr. Trump took his anger with Mr. Sessions public by telling The New York Times in an interview that he would not have appointed him attorney general had he known that he would recuse himself. Behind the scenes, Mr. Trump once again demanded Mr. Sessions’s resignation. Citing a White House insider, Mr. Whipple’s book says the president told Mr. Priebus to act on his order. “Don’t try to slow me down like you always do,” Mr. Trump told him. “Get the resignation of Jeff Sessions.” Mr. Priebus, however, did try to slow him down and argued that pushing out Mr. Sessions would result in the resignations of the second- and third-ranking Justice Department officials too. “If I get this resignation, you are in for a spiral of calamity that makes Comey look like a picnic,” Mr. Priebus warned him. Again, Mr. Trump backed down. But in other ways he did not. Mr. Priebus said he and other aides — including Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter; Jared Kushner, his son-in-law; and Hope Hicks, his communications director — regularly tried to convince Mr. Trump that his random, often incendiary Twitter messages were self-destructive. “I told him, ‘Some of it’s not helpful, it causes distraction. We can get thrown off our message by tweeting things that aren’t the issues of the day,’” he said. But he did not get through. “Everybody tried at different times to cool down the Twitter habit — but no one could do it. Not me, Jared, Ivanka, Hope.” Even the first lady weighed in when her husband addressed Congress. “After the joint session, we all talked to him and Melania said, ‘No tweeting,’” Mr. Priebus said. “And he said, ‘OK — for the next few days.’ We had many discussions involving this issue. We had meetings in the residence. I couldn’t stop it.” The challenge was clear from the very start when Mr. Trump called him the morning after he was sworn in ranting about news coverage comparing the size of his inaugural crowd with that of his predecessor. Mr. Priebus tried to calm the new president, but ultimately had to go along. “Am I going to go to war over this with the president of the United States?” he asked himself. Mr. Priebus’s inability to control Mr. Trump or even control who could wander in and out of the Oval Office caused consternation. Mr. Bannon told Mr. Whipple that John F. Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, complained to him about it. “He said to me, ‘It really upsets me that I walk in the Oval Office and it’s like Grand Central Station,’” said Mr. Bannon. Ultimately, Mr. Trump would pick Mr. Kelly to replace Mr. Priebus. But Mr. Kelly, who initially earned plaudits for imposing more order on the West Wing, lately has come under fire for his management of the White House, particularly his handling of spousal abuse allegations that resulted in the resignation of the staff secretary, Rob Porter. Mr. Priebus said that Mr. Trump has spent his whole life resisting the sort of organization that others would like to impose on him. “The idea that he was suddenly going to accept an immediate and elaborate staff structure regulating every minute of his life was never in the cards,” Mr. Priebus said. “At least not on Day 1.” "
564,"To the Editor: Re “Russia at Work on U.S. Midterms, Spy Chiefs Warn” (front page, Feb. 14): The continued political and economic success of our democracy depends on a well-founded belief in the integrity of our election system. Therefore, the Russian attempt to undercut our confidence in electoral integrity is an existential threat. Russian efforts will, if left alone, become ever more sophisticated and effective. Unfortunately, President Trump is concerned only about what he thinks the Russians can do for him in what he hopes will be his campaign to hold on to the presidency. If the Republicans are not yet ready to start impeachment proceedings, the least they can do is pass a congressional resolution calling on the president to demand that all Russian electoral interference cease immediately, backed by an order requiring, in the face of noncompliance, the immediate removal of all Russian diplomats from our country. Cyberwarfare against our electoral system is war. Better to recognize that now and act accordingly. It is not time to react militarily, but it is past time to react effectively. Russia must be isolated from the family of nations. DONALD S. COBURN
MONTEREY, MASS. To the Editor: Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, says we are under attack from Russia. Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I thought that when our country comes under attack we retaliate. So far there has been no retaliation that I know of. Even the modest attempts of the Congress to impose sanctions, which really amounted to a slap on the wrist, have been ignored by our president. Of course you don’t want to give away important information to the enemy, but it would be good to know whether we are taking strong steps to not only counter future attacks but also to give the enemy pause before trying again by making the penalty very painful. ORIN HOLLANDER, JAMISON, PA. To the Editor: Russian efforts, through social media platforms, to influence United States elections succeed because of the inability of individuals to evaluate information they receive and the biases of the source. The plethora of “information” now available on multiple media platforms requires the reader to possess the ability to determine what is reliable information. Schools, particularly high schools, need to have courses that teach critical reasoning and how to evaluate sources of information. The landscape has changed, and so must our education system.

570,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s inaugural committee paid nearly $26 million to an event planning firm started by an adviser to the first lady, Melania Trump, while donating $5 million — less than expected — to charity, according to tax filings released on Thursday. The nonprofit group that oversaw Mr. Trump’s inauguration and surrounding events in January 2017, the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee, had been under pressure from liberal government watchdog groups to reveal how it spent the record $107 million it had raised largely from wealthy donors and corporations. Its chairman, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s, had pledged that the committee would be thrifty with its spending, and would donate leftover funds to charity. In a statement released by the committee, he praised it for carrying out the inauguration and more than 20 related events with “elegance and seamless excellence without incident or interruption, befitting the legacy and tradition that has preceded us.” But the mandatory tax return it filed with the Internal Revenue Service revealed heavy spending on administrative and logistical expenses associated with planning and executing several days’ worth of events for donors and supporters around Mr. Trump’s inaugural ceremonies. By contrast, the return showed that the group’s charitable donations included only a previously publicized $3 million for hurricane relief, as well as a total of $1.75 million to groups involved in decorating and maintaining the White House and the vice president’s residence, and $250,000 for the Smithsonian Institution. The 116-page filing indicates that the majority of the funds — more than $57 million — went to four event-planning companies. "
571,"For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday’s live updates. Newtown. San Bernardino. Las Vegas. Sutherland Springs. And now, Parkland. Five of the six deadliest mass shootings of the past six years in the United States. In each of them, the gunman had an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle. The N.R.A. calls the AR-15 the most popular rifle in America. The carnage in Florida on Wednesday that left at least 17 dead seemed to confirm that the rifle and its variants have also become the weapons of choice for mass killers. It is not hard to see why. Originally designed for troops to kill enemy fighters, the weapon became the military’s M16 and the shorter M4 carbine. It was easily adapted for civilian use, with one major difference: Military versions can fire fully automatically — or in bursts of several shots — by depressing the trigger once. The civilian semiautomatic version requires a pull of the trigger for each shot. But other features that make the AR-15 so deadly on the battlefield remain. It is light, easy to hold and easy to fire, with a limited recoil. Bullets fly out of the muzzle more than twice as fast as most handgun rounds. Equally important for a gunman looking to do a lot of damage in a hurry: AR-15-style weapons are fed with box magazines that can be swapped out quickly. The standard magazine holds 30 rounds. Equipped in this way, a gunman can fire more than a hundred rounds in minutes. The man accused of the killings in Parkland had “countless magazines” for his AR-15, the local sheriff said. And there is still one more reason the weapons are so popular in states like Florida: They are very easy to buy — and for a 19-year-old like Nikolas Cruz, the shooting suspect, far easier to obtain than a handgun. Florida has a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases. But anyone without a felony record, domestic abuse conviction, or a handful of other exceptions — such as a commitment to a mental institution — can walk into a gun store, wait a few minutes to clear a background check, and walk out with an AR-15 -style rifle, magazines and ammunition. Under federal law, you also must be 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles. The AR-15 rifle used in the attack was purchased legally, at Sunrise Tactical Supply in Florida, according to a federal law enforcement official. “No laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,” said Peter J. Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami. Congress explicitly banned AR-15s and other semiautomatic rifles that fit its definition of assault weapons from 1994 to 2004. Since that law expired 14 years ago, in most states it has been just as easy to buy an AR-15-style gun as it is in Florida. (Buyers can also purchase the weapon in person or online from private sellers who are not required to perform a background check — an exemption known as the “gun show loophole.”) Only New York, California, Washington, D.C., and five other states have their own assault-weapon bans, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Washington, D.C., and eight states also limit the large capacity magazines that have made many mass shootings so deadly. Even so, there have been efforts to circumvent the bans, legally and illegally, by making minor changes to the weapons. “These guns are much more deadly than traditional bolt-action rifles or traditional shotguns, but they are regulated the same way” in most of the country, said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords center. Among the six deadliest mass shootings in the last six years, the only one not carried out with an AR-15 style rifle was the Orlando nightclub attack two years ago that left 49 dead. The gunman, Omar Mateen, had a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle, which shares features with the AR-15, though it functions via a different semiautomatic design — and is just as deadly. All of these military-style semiautomatic weapons have something else in common. They have been heavily marketed as home-defense and marksmanship weapons, and their sales have been a major driver of profits for gun manufacturers over the past two decades. “Americans own about five million AR-15s and it should go without saying that virtually all AR-15s are never misused,” a post on an N.R.A. website said a few years ago, describing home protection and shooting competitions as among the ways the guns “are used by good people for perfectly good reasons.” The industry also now calls these weapons “modern sporting rifles.” Gun organizations detest the label “assault rifle,” even though the federal legislation that enacted the decade-long ban specifically described the AR-15 and similar models as assault weapons. (The “AR” in the name, however, does not stand for assault rifle — it actually stands for ArmaLite rifle, reflecting the name of its original manufacturer.) Paradoxically, the industry has boomed when under threat of new regulations, as buyers made new purchases because they feared additional ownership limits were about to be imposed. For similar reasons, the election of Donald J. Trump helped clobber the share prices of some gun makers, as fears of new restrictions eased. The publicly traded gun makers Sturm, Ruger & Company and American Outdoor Brands both lost about a quarter of their market value in the days after Mr. Trump’s victory. Earlier this week the Remington Outdoor Company, one of the country’s biggest and oldest gun manufacturers, said it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection amid plunging sales and mounting losses. "
572,"WASHINGTON — After a gunman in Las Vegas slaughtered country-music fans with assault weapons that mimicked a machine gun, lawmakers from both parties said they would move quickly to ban so-called bump stocks. After a mass shooter massacred churchgoers in Sutherland Springs, Tex., the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, was stirred to action, pledging legislation to bolster the nation’s instant background check system for would-be gun buyers. Congress has effectively done neither. That inaction sank in on Thursday, as lawmakers confronted yet another mass shooting, this time with some of the survivors imploring Congress to finally take action. Republicans called for prayers, but argued that no single fix to the nation’s gun laws would deter a shooting like the one on Wednesday in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead, many of them children. “This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said. “We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together.” Democrats, who have put forward a spate of gun safety bills only to see them left unaddressed by Republicans, who control the House and Senate, seethed with frustration. “This isn’t going to stop, members, it’s going to continue,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a leading gun control advocate, told her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “And we become culpable when we do nothing to stop it.” But the failure to act on the instant background check and bump-stock bills underscored that even on the most modest of gun measures, Congress is simply incapable of a response. What was striking in the aftermath of the carnage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is that, now, even the victims and survivors are willing to call their leaders out. “My message to lawmakers in Congress is please, take action,” David Hogg, a student at the school, said as he looked directly into CNN’s camera on Thursday. “Any action at this point instead of just complete stagnancy and blaming the other side of the political aisle would be a step in the right direction,” he added. Melissa Falkowski, a teacher at the school, told CNN, “It’s very emotional because I feel today like our government, our country, has failed us and failed our kids and didn’t keep us safe.” After the Las Vegas shooting, which left 58 people dead last October, there appeared to be bipartisan agreement to take some kind of narrow legislative action to ban bump stocks, an accessory that can effectively turn a semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun. The National Rifle Association even appeared to endorse restrictions. As attention faded, that influential organization and Republican leaders changed course, arguing that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be best positioned to deal with the problem through existing regulation. Since then, Justice Department officials have publicly and privately indicated that they think they do not, in fact, have the authority to regulate the devices. With the department’s official review still underway, that has effectively suspended the proposal. Senators once again coalesced around another modest bipartisan fix in December, after discovering a lapse that allowed the gunman in Sutherland Springs to buy his weapons despite a domestic violence conviction. Their proposal incentivizes state and federal agencies to report criminal offenses and other information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The House passed the measure last December, but only after it was attached to a dramatic expansion of the right to carry concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country — long sought by Republicans and the National Rifle Association. That concealed-carry legislation is a nonstarter in the Senate, and the background check bill has yet to see a vote. None was planned. Mr. Cornyn, one of the bill’s lead authors, took to the Senate floor on Thursday to urge its consideration. “I personally am unwilling to face another family member who’s lost a loved one as a result of one of these mass shootings that could be prevented by making sure the background check system works as Congress intended,” he said. Neither Mr. Ryan nor Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said anything on Thursday that suggested that would soon change. “Let’s be honest, I have not heard anyone explain how an improved background check system would necessarily have prevented a particular incident,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who helped write a bill mandating near-universal background checks after the slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. “And so to the extent to which we really don’t have a solution for these appalling massacres, I think that makes it harder to get traction for some ideas that I think are constructive ideas.” In Parkland, where students, teachers and parents gathered again on Thursday to mourn, there was little patience for such thinking. Lyliah Skinner, a student who survived the shooting, rejected politicians’ thoughts and prayers and called for action. “If they’re not able to purchase their first drink of alcohol, then how are we allowed to buy guns at the age of 18 or 19?” she asked, adding, “Obviously whatever we have going on, it’s not working.” Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, spoke of the importance of keeping guns from the dangerously mentally ill. A law enforcement official said they needed more police. Robert W. Runcie, the Broward County superintendent, took on lawmakers more directly. “Students have been reaching out to me, reaching out to staff, probably board members and others saying that now — now is the time for this country to have a real conversation on sensible gun control laws,” he said. "
573,"WASHINGTON — A second federal appeals court ruled on Thursday against President Trump’s latest effort to limit travel from countries said to pose a threat to the nation’s security. The decision, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., will have no immediate practical impact. The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear an appeal from a broadly similar decision from the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. In December, in a sign that the Supreme Court may be receptive to upholding Mr. Trump’s latest order, the court allowed it to go into effect as the two cases moved forward. The cases concern Mr. Trump’s third and most considered effort to make good on a campaign promise to secure the nation’s borders. But challengers to the latest ban, issued as a presidential proclamation in September, said it was tainted by religious animus and not adequately justified by national security concerns. The ban restricts travel from eight nations, six of them predominantly Muslim: Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. The restrictions vary in their details but, for the most part, citizens of the countries are forbidden from emigrating to the United States and many of them are barred from working, studying or vacationing here. The Fourth Circuit, by a 9-to-4 vote, ruled that the latest ban, like an earlier one, most likely violated the Constitution’s Establishment Clause, which forbids religious discrimination by the government. The majority based its conclusion in large measure on statements Mr. Trump has made as a candidate and while in office. "
574,"WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Thursday that he would visit Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people this week in the deadliest school shooting in years, and would work with state and local leaders “to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” The president tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims in the hours after the shooting on Wednesday, and as images of terrified students sprinting frantically away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School dominated the news, Mr. Trump’s aides urged him to make a public statement. But he opted not to say anything more until Thursday, when he delivered a subdued seven-minute speech at the White House. “We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life,” Mr. Trump said, “that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.” He made no mention of guns. Wednesday’s incident was the deadliest school shooting since a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. It was the latest mass shooting to elicit a national mourning period and an outcry from Democratic lawmakers, who accused Mr. Trump and Republicans of not doing enough to curb gun violence. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump approved the removal of an Obama-era regulation intended to prevent people with mental disabilities from buying guns. But as he has done in the recent past, on Thursday Mr. Trump answered cries for tighter restrictions on guns by emphasizing the need for Americans to report the behavior of “mentally disturbed” people to the authorities. “So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet hours before he addressed the public. “Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” He delivered similar remarks in November, after a gunman with a military-style rifle mowed down more than two dozen parishioners in a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. Mr. Trump told reporters that the problem “isn’t a guns situation” and that the shooting signified “a mental health problem at the highest level.” In October, after a gunman in Las Vegas killed 58 people and wounded hundreds in the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, Mr. Trump called the assailant “a very sick man” and a “demented person.” Other members of his party echoed Mr. Trump’s sentiments. In a brief news conference, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said that “there may be some mental health issues with this shooting,” adding that it was not the time to jump to conclusions about tightening gun laws. In an address to a conference in Washington, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said law enforcement officers should look for warning signs in their communities. “You and I know we cannot arrest everybody that somebody thinks is dangerous,” Mr. Sessions said. “But I think we can and we must do better. We owe it to every one of those kids crying outside their school yesterday and all those who never made it out of that school.” As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with the National Rifle Association. The organization provided at least $30 million in support during his campaign. Receiving a hero’s welcome at the group’s annual convention last April, Mr. Trump said he would return the favor. “Only one candidate in the general election came to speak to you, and that candidate is now the president of the United States, standing before you,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.” But as with many issues, the president has had a complicated relationship with — and history of comments about — gun control. Mr. Trump had a concealed weapon permit in New York when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor. It is not clear whether he maintained it. He also has spoken favorably about gun rights over the years. However, he has made clear that he is not a game hunter, as his two older sons are. In 2000, as he considered running for president, he wrote in his book, “The America We Deserve,” that “I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.” He added, “With today’s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.” Mr. Trump’s decision to remain focused on mental illness as president incensed several Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Joseph Crowley of New York. “The onus is not on children to #EndGunViolence,” Mr. Crowley wrote on Twitter. “When will you lead, Mr. President?” In an appearance on CNN, another Democrat, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, disputed Mr. Trump’s focus on mental health, and pointed out the high rates of gun violence in the United States compared with other countries. Mr. Blumenthal said that after the Sandy Hook shooting, Connecticut worked to reduce gun violence by passing measures to ban assault weapons and increase background checks. But “we are at the mercy of the weakest states,” Mr. Blumenthal said, “even when we have the strongest gun laws.” Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said in an appearance on CNN that “we’ve been through this a lot, and each time we say enough is enough and then of course it isn’t enough.” Mr. Trump called for the American flag to fly at half-staff at the White House and other public buildings and grounds as a sign of respect for the shooting victims. About halfway through his short address, the president said he wanted to speak directly to America’s children. “I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you and who will do anything at all to protect you,” Mr. Trump said. “If you need help, turn to a teacher, a family member, a local police officer or a faith leader. Answer hate with love, answer cruelty with kindness.” Mr. Trump said he would meet later this month with a group of state governors and attorneys general to make school safety a “top priority.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said details were still being finalized for his visit to Parkland, but on Friday, he is scheduled to travel to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, which sits about 40 miles north of there. Mr. Trump originally was scheduled to visit the Orlando area on his way, but White House officials said shortly after his speech that the Orlando stop had been canceled. "
575,"To the Editor: Re “In Response to Florida Shooting, Trump Focuses on Mental Health Over Gun Restrictions” (nytimes.com, Feb. 15): President Trump has the gall to put out a statement regarding the horrific shooting in Florida that is a boldfaced lie. He said, “We are here for you — whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain.” Not a word about gun control, only mental illness. The statement is an insult to the intelligence of the American public. The shooter had an AR-15 rifle, precisely the kind of weapon that should not be in the hands of anyone other than military personnel in combat or combat training. Mental health, while always a factor, is irrelevant when it comes to the availability of weaponry like this, which in the hands of anyone poses a high risk of violence. This is insane. I fear that like all the other school shootings and mass killings this country has faced in the last year, this one will roil in social media for a couple of days and then disappear in a morass of political idiocy pandering to the National Rifle Association. Only one thing will ease the pain of the victims and their loved ones: a strong and powerful move to guarantee every American citizen’s right to be free of fear from the uncontrolled access to firearms that sets this country apart from virtually all other developed countries around the world. PETER C. ALKALAY, SCARSDALE, N.Y. "
576,"WASHINGTON — The Senate summarily blocked three measures on Thursday — including one backed by President Trump — to resolve the fate of the so-called Dreamers, leaving hundreds of thousands of them facing an uncertain future. As senators struck down measure after measure, a week that began with the promise of a rare open, free-ranging debate on the issue crashed headlong into the same divisions that have prevented Congress from fixing the nation’s immigration system for decades. The lack of consensus left in question whether any solution on the Dreamers can be reached. In a rebuke to the president, senators voted overwhelmingly, 39 to 60, against the White House-backed bill, which would have committed $25 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico, placed strict limits on legal immigration, ended the diversity visa lottery and offered 1.8 million Dreamers an eventual path to citizenship. Senators were 21 votes short of the 60 required to open debate, and the rejection of the president’s plan was bipartisan: Democrats refused its get-tough approach to legal immigration, while many conservative Republicans derided it as amnesty. Before the vote on Mr. Trump’s plan, senators rejected two bipartisan measures, including one written by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and another drafted by a broad bipartisan group of centrists calling themselves the Common Sense Coalition. The votes were a stark reminder that Congress remains paralyzed by the immigration issue. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both tried to overhaul the system, but were stymied by lawmakers frozen into inaction, in part because of powerful interests on both sides. "
577,"The White House is assertively working to make America white again, and Democrats are too afraid to speak that truth. The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect. The pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people. It should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration’s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. “By greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,” the economist Michael Clemens said. “Decades ahead,” he added, “many fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.” The administration’s focus is not random. Nor is it illogical, if one’s goal is to maximize the influence of white people. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country’s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country’s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump’s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution. "
578,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. An assistant football coach who tried to protect students. A freshman trombonist in the marching band. A strong-willed senior with college plans. We’re gathering the stories of the 17 people killed in Wednesday’s mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. The police said a former student barged into the high school with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. It was by one count the 239th school shooting since Sandy Hook. The coach, Aaron Feiss, had himself graduated from the school. “I don’t know when Aaron’s funeral is,” the Broward County sheriff said. “I don’t know how many adults are going to go, but you’ll get 2,000 kids there.” ____ 2. “He always had guns on him.” That was a former classmate of Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old charged with 17 counts of murder. A “troubled kid” who flaunted his firearms and bragged about killing animals, Mr. Cruz was expelled last year over erratic behavior that school administrators declined to describe. The leader of a white supremacist group in Florida said Mr. Cruz was a member of his group and had participated in paramilitary drills. ____ 3. “We are here for you — whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain.” In a televised speech addressing the shooting, President Trump pledged to work with state and local leaders to “tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” He did not mention gun control. It was a shift from his early-morning tweet, which some saw as victim-blaming: “So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” ____ 4. No deal. Senators from both parties decisively turned back Mr. Trump’s immigration proposal, which would have instituted strict limits but helped the so-called Dreamers. The Senate also rejected two more modest measures. “What happens now,” our correspondent writes, “is unclear.” ____ 5. At $107 million, President Trump’s inauguration was the most expensive in history. And freshly released tax filings show that the nonprofit group that oversaw the event spent nearly all of the raised funds — leaving little to fulfill its pledge to donate richly to charities from leftover funds. The group also paid $26 million to a firm started by a senior adviser to the first lady, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, above, for event planning. ____ 6.  Nathan Chen of the U.S., above, and Japan’s star Yuzuru Hanyu are among those to watch today at the 2018 Winter Games. (In Chen’s free skate, he’ll dance to the story of “Mao’s Last Dancer,” the Chinese defector Li Cunxin — who is now the artistic director of the Queensland Ballet in Brisbane, Australia.) One of our reporters described the Norwegian ski team’s recipe for success as “a contrarian mix of humility, egalitarianism and basic respect.” (They also spend about 250 days a year together — and sometimes even share beds.) Here’s the full medal count and schedule, and our complete coverage. ____ 7. Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in as president of South Africa, a day after Jacob Zuma was ousted by his own party. Here’s our profile of Mr. Ramaphosa, a protégé of Nelson Mandela and now one of South Africa’s richest men. He vows to address gaping inequality and fight for the ordinary citizen. And the legacy of Mr. Zuma? Our Johannesburg bureau chief looks back at a nearly nine-year presidency marred by scandal, corruption and mismanagement. ____ 8. Investors fear that rising inflation in the U.S. could prompt a rise in interest rates, potentially crimping global growth. But as our columnist explains, the belief that a combination of inflation and higher interest rates is bad for stock prices could be proved otherwise. It’s unclear how the markets will react, but some experts are saying that stocks may continue to rally. Need a primer? Here’s how inflation works. ____ 9. Borneo’s orangutan population has dropped by about half over 16 years, according to a new study. Habitat loss was identified as a main cause, but hunting of the endangered animals appears to be surprisingly common. The team observed 36,555 nests and estimated a loss of 148,500 orangutans during that period. “Worryingly, however, the largest number of orangutans were lost from areas that remained forested during the study period,” a researcher said. “This implies a large role of killing.” ____ 10. Before our national security reporter Scott Shane went into journalism, the C.I.A. tried to recruit him. But he chose “the better-lit side of democracy.” His essay on the parallels of journalism and espionage came ahead of his streamable chat from Washington tonight (6:30-8 p.m.) with the actress Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a Russian spy, above, in the new film “Red Sparrow.” The director, Francis Lawrence, joins them.

579,"To the Editor: Re “Census Sabotage,” by David Leonhardt (column, nytimes.com, Feb. 9): I couldn’t agree more about just how important the 2020 census is and what is at stake if we get it wrong. With the next census just two years away, the Trump administration has still not nominated a director but has been filling traditionally nonpartisan positions with political hacks. The White House adviser Kellyanne Conway’s former pollster has been added to the census payroll, and until recently the administration even flirted with giving the deputy director position, which has always been filled by an experienced civil servant, to a Republican redistricting expert with no census experience. The administration is trying to add a last-minute question about citizenship that the Census Bureau’s own research shows will lower response rates and make the census less accurate and more expensive. It’s hard not to conclude that some in the Trump administration want to sabotage the 2020 census for political purposes. Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. should reject these efforts. Our democracy depends on it. Our economy depends on it. And our Constitution requires it. CAROLYN B. MALONEY
NEW YORK The writer, a New York Democrat, is co-chairwoman of the House Census Caucus. "
580,"WASHINGTON — The American citizen imprisoned by the military for five months as an enemy combatant told interrogators that he worked for the Islamic State guarding a gas field and monitoring civilians, and captured recruiting files indicate that he registered with the group as a fighter in July 2014, a newly declassified court document said. But the man also insisted to his interrogators that he traveled to Syria intending to work as a journalist and was arrested, later agreeing to work for the Islamic State to gain release from prison, the document also showed. The court filing does not accuse him of having fought for the group. The document, made public late Wednesday, was a description of facts about the man’s case as gathered by the F.B.I. While it did not make his name public, it lifted much of the secrecy with which the government has draped his case since acknowledging that a Syrian militia had captured him and transferred him to American custody. The capture of the citizen, and the Trump administration’s decision to hold him in wartime detention as an enemy combatant, has revived a legal and policy debate about the scope of executive power and individual rights that had subsided since the Bush administration claimed a right to hold two American citizen terrorism suspects indefinitely and without trial. The Obama administration rejected that approach. The filing publicly acknowledged for the first time the basic outline of the man’s life, which has been previously reported based on unnamed sources — including that he was born in the United States but raised in Saudi Arabia, where he is a dual citizen — while filling in many new details about him. They include that he attended college in Louisiana — apparently studying electrical engineering — but did not earn a degree there. He is married and has a 3-year-old daughter, and he took two trips to the United States in 2014, shortly after her birth, in an effort to register her as an American citizen. The filing also contends he likely went to Syria in 2014 for several months and then returned there in March 2015. It says that he lied to the F.B.I. about several details, noting that travel records contradict his account of how long he was in the United States. And it cites Twitter posts and YouTube and Google searches that it portrays as indicating that he was a supporter of the Islamic State. Last September, as the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq was collapsing, the man was captured by a Syrian militia at a checkpoint and identified himself as an American citizen before being turned over to the United States military. The filing said he was carrying $4,200 in American currency, a Global Positioning System device, a Quran, thumb drives with numerous files about weapons, and — in an odd detail it did not explain — a scuba mask and snorkel. The evidence “is more than enough to carry the government’s burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner is part of or substantially supported ISIL and is thus properly detained as an enemy combatant,” the filing said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a habeas corpus lawsuit challenging the man’s detention, winning a right to speak with him and gain his consent to represent him. It is asking a Federal District Court judge to order the Justice Department to either charge him with a crime or release him. People familiar with the case have said that the government lacks sufficient courtroom-admissible evidence to charge the man. Although he spoke freely during an initial interrogation conducted for intelligence purposes — a summary of that conversation is attached to the new court filing — he stopped talking and asked for a lawyer after being warned of his Miranda rights for a law-enforcement interrogation. The Trump administration is now trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to take custody of him, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. A judge has ordered the government to give the A.C.L.U. three days notice before any such transfer so that he could challenge it, if he wants — an order the Justice Department is appealing. Meanwhile, the underlying case is continuing. In a filing rebutting the government’s factual account, the A.C.L.U. argued for a more favorable interpretation of the disputed facts about the scope and meaning of his involvement with the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS. “Contrary to the thrust of the government’s contentions that petitioner is an ISIS fighter, and as petitioner told the government, he sought to understand firsthand and report about the conflict in Syria; was kidnapped and imprisoned by ISIS; and tried numerous times to escape — and not even the government alleges that he ever took up arms against the United States or anyone else,” the A.C.L.U. rebuttal said. In an interview on Thursday, Jonathan Hafetz, the lead A.C.L.U. lawyer on the case, maintained that the Trump administration lacked the legal authority to keep holding his client indefinitely in military custody. “The government has made numerous allegations which are inaccurate and misleading in many respects,” he said. “But the fundamental flaw in its position is that it has no legal authority to hold this citizen in military custody. If the government wants to detain him, it needs to charge him with a crime. Otherwise it must release him.” But the Justice Department filing argued that the government has legal authority to hold Islamic State members as wartime detainees — even if they are citizens. It cited laws enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2002 to authorize using military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and Saddam Hussein-era Iraq, saying they cover the Islamic State. That theory was first put forward by the Obama administration and has been disputed, but no court has ruled on whether it is correct. The Justice Department’s court filing also backstopped that theory by claiming that President Trump, as commander in chief, wields inherent constitutional authority, independent of any act of Congress, to detain wartime enemies when they are captured on a battlefield where American forces are fighting. That claim recalled sweeping assertions of executive power made by the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11 attacks. The Obama administration shied away from invoking purported commander-in-chief powers — instead generally relying only on congressional statutes — but it also did not disavow them. "
581,       
582,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Shortly after 11 a.m. for the last several days, Sung Baik-yoo, the chief spokesman for the organizers of the 2018 Winter Olympics, has leaned into a microphone at a news conference and provided a ticket sales update. The news is always a little more positive than the day before. By Thursday, Sung said organizers were within one percent of their target of 90 percent sold out, a figure that equals about one million tickets sold. Yet the scene at venues here in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from the ski slopes in the mountain cluster to the ice sports stadiums of Olympic Park, tells a story far different from Sung’s pronouncements of success. Swaths of empty blue seats have been a familiar backdrop despite organizers’ efforts to fill in gaps by providing volunteers with so-called passion tickets that allow them to attend events and by bringing in school groups by the busload. So far, fans have been able to show up right before the start of all but the most popular events and buy a ticket. Peter Skinner, an Australian who traveled to the Games from his home in Bangkok, said he regretted purchasing tickets months before the Games started. “We’re never again buying tickets in advance,” said Skinner, as he walked with his wife toward the hockey arena for the first session of the men’s competition. One event they had been looking forward to, the men’s downhill, was postponed along with several other skiing events because of bad weather. They headed to figure skating instead. “It’s sad, it’s half empty,” he said of the sparse attendance he had seen. It is not just the spectators who have noticed. Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway described completing his gold medal run in the men’s downhill on Thursday in front of a mostly empty grandstand as “a little bit strange.” The low attendance may be partly attributed to the fact that South Korea does not have a culture of Alpine sports. It has achieved Winter Olympic success in just two events, speedskating and figure skating. At some Games in other countries, locals have packed venues to watch unfamiliar sports just to be a part of the experience. That has not happened here. A near-capacity crowd watched the short-track speedskater Lim Hyo-jun secure South Korea’s first gold medal on Saturday, but less popular events are taking place in front of blocks of empty seats. “If we had this race in Italy, Austria, Norway, Sweden, it would be packed with 50,000 people,” Svindal said. To be fair, he said, he doubted people in Norway would fill an arena for short-track speedskating, like they did here, but he still wished he had won his medal amid a more raucous atmosphere. “It’s a bit sad.” Empty seats are not a problem unique to the Pyeongchang Games. Organizers of the last two Olympics — in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and Sochi two years earlier — also found themselves under scrutiny as images of half-empty venues were beamed worldwide. Unused seats reserved for sponsors and athletes were blamed then. Organizers are doing the same here. “We find they are the empty seats,” said a spokeswoman for Pyeongchang 2018, though it is unlikely that is the lone explanation. Organizers continue to advertise the Games and are actively encouraging fans to buy tickets on-site. Heightened political tension between North Korea and the United States in the buildup to the Games did not help sales. Less than six months before the Games opened, President Trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea in response to a spate of missile tests by the North. The heavily armed border separating the Koreas is about 40 miles  from the Olympic Park. Occasional ticketing and transportation mix-ups have also caused venues to fill up only after events in them have started. A women’s hockey game on Wednesday between a joint Korean team and Japan was well into the first period when one ticketholder, Jewell Hatton from Pennsylvania, said an attendant stopped her and told her that her ticket was invalid. Organizers had reassigned her seat, and new arrangements would have to be made. “That happened last night, too,” Hatton said. Organizers said some tickets had to be reissued because of additional space required by broadcasters. Groups of South Korean schoolchildren have been a common sight, bused in for field trips as part of a program by the Ministry of Education to educate young Koreans about winter sports. They also fill empty seats quite nicely. At a recent hockey game, a group of schoolchildren hungrily snapped photographs of the all-women cheerleading troupe from North Korea. A program is also in place for Olympic volunteers to take up unoccupied seats. They are required to remove their uniforms so they are not identifiable, and they are obligated to move should a paying spectator show up. “We also hope that this will help to increase the stadium’s atmosphere, so that athletes can perform their best,” a spokesman for Pyeongchang 2018 said. Some foreign fans who have found limited transportation options are also rethinking whether to attend late-night sessions. Organizers run buses to central hubs, but after that, fans are largely on their own amid the freezing temperatures. “I’ve had to call the guy who owns the hotel near where we are staying to come and pick me up,” said Skinner, the Australian from Bangkok. He said he had seen other spectators ask volunteers — and even police officers — for rides. He is staying about three miles from the venues — close compared with some fans. But, he added, “It’s a long way to walk when it’s minus 15.” At least one athlete saw the relative quiet as a silver lining. Laura Dahlmeier, a German biathlete, said that she needs to be able to concentrate as she fires her rifle at the target. “I prefer this to when 50,000 people are screaming,” she said. "
583,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senators pushing to revive legislation that would bring sweeping changes to federal sentencing laws cleared a key hurdle on Thursday, but the effort appeared likely to stall once again. Advocates of criminal justice overhaul from both parties say that their proposals have only gained in popularity since 2015, when a similar and much-promoted bipartisan push petered out amid disputes as 2016 campaigns took shape. A new version of the measure passed the Senate Judiciary Committee 16 to 5 on Thursday, winning plaudits from an unlikely coalition of conservative, libertarian and liberal lawmakers and outside groups that have backed it. What happens next will depend on whether that coalition can persuade Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow a full Senate vote. The prospects appeared dim. Mr. McConnell, who controls the Senate floor, continues to see the issue as a loser for Republicans, despite a wave of similar overhauls embraced by states across the country. He has argued that the issue divides Republicans, many of whom remain averse to lessening criminal penalties of any kind, and could dampen enthusiasm at the polls. It will be up to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the influential chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the lead author of the bill, to try to change Mr. McConnell’s mind, and he suggested that President Trump’s desire for legislative accomplishments could help sway the leader. "
584,"WASHINGTON — Even before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s legal setback this week, a rare fissure had opened up between him and President Trump. The White House rebutted reports that he and the Americans had discussed annexing parts of the West Bank, and Mr. Trump voiced fresh concerns about Israel’s openness to a peace accord. White House officials insisted on Wednesday that the recommendation of bribery and fraud charges against Mr. Netanyahu would have “no impact on the timing or content” of a peace plan. But Mr. Trump has not rallied publicly to the Israeli leader’s defense, and veterans of Middle East diplomacy said his troubles could pose an unpredictable new obstacle to Mr. Trump’s peacemaking efforts. For a president who has embraced Mr. Netanyahu at every turn, the pushback on Israel was striking. Coming two months after Mr. Trump alienated the Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, it suggests that the administration is recalibrating its approach to the two sides as it wrestles with when, and how, to present a peace proposal. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Wednesday in Amman, Jordan, that the plan was “fairly well advanced” and added, “It’ll be up to the president to decide when he feels it’s time and he’s ready to put that plan forward.” The lack of visible progress, and the cone of silence, surrounding the peace initiative have raised questions about how much of a plan the White House really has. Several officials, however, said that the proposal being devised by two of Mr. Trump’s aides, Jared Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, was detailed and substantive, and that Mr. Trump’s willingness to risk friction with Mr. Netanyahu over it showed that he was more, not less, committed. Certainly, Mr. Trump is not missing chances to press his case. Aides recount, for example, that last month, when he reached Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on his cellphone in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Mnuchin relayed that he was in a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan. Mr. Trump requested to speak to the king, whom he then asked for help in dealing with the aggrieved president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. "

586,"The Trump administration is seeking to withdraw the United States from the international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. It is trying to rescind regulations on the issue. It has even scrubbed mentions of global warming from government websites. Yet its attempt to suppress the facts has not entirely succeeded, with federal agencies continuing to issue warnings, including in a major climate report published last year. The latest climate alarm came this week in a Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Here is what the document, issued by Daniel R. Coats, the director of national intelligence, said about climate change and other environmental problems, with my annotations: Only six weeks into the year, this is already coming true. Cape Town, the second-largest city in South Africa, is so low on water after an extended drought that it may be forced to shut off the taps in early April. Water scarcity is a factor in the violent conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and in both countries, control of water supplies is being used as a weapon of war. After running through an accurate summary of the warming trend and the risk it poses, the document appears — though the language is ambiguous — to suggest the possibility of sudden climate change of the sort that might cause global upheaval. Most scientists say that over the next few decades, at least, the likely prospect is a gradual worsening of climate-related problems. But beyond a few decades, they are less willing to rule out catastrophes like the disappearance of polar sea ice, which could potentially cause profound climatic disruption. "

593,"The Senate’s top education leaders will consider reinstating Pell grants for incarcerated students, a move that would restore a federal lifeline to the nation’s cash-strapped prison education system. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said the committee would consider reinstating the federal financial aid grants in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act currently underway. The move would reverse a decades-old decision to strike the benefit from the higher education law and signal a shift toward recognizing education as a centerpiece in efforts to overhaul criminal justice law. The federal student aid could be used to cover the cost of college courses taught in prisons, online or both. Mr. Alexander said that he was open to re-examining Pell grants for prisoners, which were banned in the 1994 crime bill passed under President Bill Clinton. In 2015, President Barack Obama’s Education Department piloted an experimental program that allowed 12,000 incarcerated students to be eligible for the financial aid. If reinstated, millions of dollars would be made available to eligible students in the United States’ prison population of 1.5 million. “Most prisoners, sooner or later, are released from prison, and no one is helped when they do not have the skills to find a job,” Mr. Alexander said in a statement. “Making Pell grants available to them in the right circumstances is a good idea.” Mr. Alexander will find an ally in his committee’s ranking Democrat, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, with whom he has partnered to broker deals, including reauthorizing the country’s elementary and secondary education law and preserving insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. "
594,"WASHINGTON — In 2006 and again in 2013, Republican moderates joined Democrats in the Senate to pass sweeping overhauls of the nation’s immigration laws with a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, only to see the compromises torpedoed by a wave of angry activism in the conservative news media and grass roots. This time, as senators again search for a way forward on immigration, a revolt from the right has so far failed to materialize, in large part because of the intransigence of a different player: a man in the White House who has mostly satisfied immigration hard-liners. President Trump’s gamble was risky. And at first his plan struck many conservatives as too generous because it would offer 1.8 million young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children the opportunity to become citizens. But by coupling his offer with demands to sharply reduce legal immigration — a trade-off many Democrats say they cannot accept — then threatening to veto anything that does not meet those demands, the president has made a bipartisan compromise exceedingly difficult. That may have been the point, as it sits just fine with many on the right who never wanted a deal in the first place. “Trump outsmarted them,” said Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host and author who was one of the many voices on the right who helped bury the 2013 immigration legislation that died when the House refused to take it up. “They won’t cut a deal is my prediction.” This approach has benefits for Mr. Trump and his party. The president keeps a key campaign promise by not agreeing to anything his base would consider too lenient. "

596,"WASHINGTON — In terms of rip-roaring debates, it certainly didn’t rival Calhoun versus Webster. It definitely was not in the pantheon with Lincoln and Douglas. In fact, it really didn’t even measure up to Biden meets Palin. The promised freewheeling, take-on-all-comers Senate showdown over immigration policy never really materialized before it all collapsed Thursday with the defeat of four proposals, including President Trump’s, which suffered the worst loss of them all. After raising expectations of an elevated, old-school clash of ideas, the Senate delivered a dud, a major disappointment to those hoping to see a revived Senate confront the tough, politically charged issues by hashing them out on the floor. Over four days of what was supposed to be a rare, open-ended fight, the Senate chamber was often empty, save the lone Republican forced to preside over the inactivity. In the end, the showdown came down to a series of votes on four doomed proposals rather than a daily competition between lawmakers offering a series of defining amendments as in the past. In the run-up to the final decision, the number of dramatic votes on such amendments reached exactly zero. “I think it’s safe to say this has been a disappointing week,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in the aftermath of the legislative failure. For much of the week, the marble hallways were quiet. The C-Span screen noted frequently that there were “no votes scheduled.” Congressional reporters who had heard legends of gripping floor debates from the turn of the century (the 20th, that is) were bemoaning the missed opportunity. The real work — what there was of it — went on behind closed doors as varying groups of lawmakers tried to put together something that could attract the required 60 votes. "

599,"Donald Trump has turned the political world upside down, again and again, like a kid flipping a coin. Every day we wake up to either a new scandal or several lingering ones. It is astounding. It is maddening. It is numbing. At this moment, he is embroiled in a scandal of a six-figure payment to a porn star who goes by the name Stormy Daniels and who, at one point, gave an interview in which she claimed that the two were engaged in an extramarital sexual affair. He is also embroiled in a scandal over why a top aide, Rob Porter, accused of physically assaulting his two ex-wives, was allowed to remain on the White House staff even after these allegations had been brought to the attention of the White House by the F.B.I. Exacerbating this scandal is the fact that the official White House timeline about the events leading to Porter’s resignation turned out to be a lie, according to sworn testimony on Tuesday by the F.B.I. director Christopher Wray. It is also exacerbated by the fact that after Porter resigned, Trump praised him, and initially failed to say anything about domestic violence in general, reserving that condemnation for a week later, when he said, “I’m totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind.” And of course, there is the omnipresent issue of Russia attacking our elections in 2016 and the investigation into whether anyone in the Trump orbit colluded or cooperated with the Russians, conspired to commit a crime, lied to officers or tried to obstruct justice. That’s just the big three at the moment. We also mustn’t forget that the president has never released his tax returns, he refused to sever ties with his businesses, and he is burning through our money going to golf courses or his properties with decadent regularity. He also defended Nazis and was disrespectful to the hurricane-ravaged people of Puerto Rico. "
600,"With all the noise coming out of Washington, it’s been easy to forget about the Supreme Court. The court has been very quiet: during a recess of nearly four weeks, only the peripatetic Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made news, of a sort. But once the justices get back to business on Friday, that interlude of near invisibility will end. On the agenda for their closed-door meeting Friday morning is an urgent and highly unusual request from the Trump administration for the court’s intervention in the continuing debate over the fate of nearly 800,000 “Dreamers,” the young people brought to this country by their undocumented parents. They have been shielded from deportation since 2012 by the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which President Trump wants to phase out beginning less than three weeks from now. Blocked by a lower court from carrying out that plan, the administration seeks to vault over the normal appellate process, asking the Supreme Court for prompt relief from what Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco calls an “institutional injury to the United States.” The justices’ response — which may come as early as Monday — will tell us more clearly than anything since Inauguration Day what stance the rule-bound court is prepared to take toward the norm-breaking president. Will the Roberts court serve as Donald Trump’s enabler? Or will the court see itself, as it has on rare occasions at other troubled times in the country’s history, as a firewall between the president and the rule of law? With its overheated language and repeated reference to “the ongoing violation of federal law by more than half a million people,” the petition the administration filed last month reads not so much as a legal document but as a recruiting brochure, aimed at a very small but immensely powerful audience of nine. In freezing the DACA program in place last month while lawsuits against its termination proceed, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that the plaintiffs, who include individual DACA recipients, the University of California, and a group of states and California counties, were likely to succeed on their claim that the order to terminate DACA was “arbitrary and capricious” and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act. (On Tuesday, a second federal district judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, in Brooklyn, issued a similar ruling. Cases are also pending in the federal courts of Maryland, Virginia, Florida and the District of Columbia.) Because Judge Alsup sits in San Francisco, any appeal would go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That’s President Trump’s least favorite court, the court that rejected the his bans on immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries, including the current version that is now before the Supreme Court. The morning after Judge Alsup’s ruling, the president tweeted: “It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing sides in a case (such as DACA) always come to the 9th Circuit and almost always win before being reversed by higher courts.” So while filing an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the administration’s lawyers also went to the Supreme Court with a “petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment,” a request to the justices to hear the case this spring without waiting. The Supreme Court’s rules reserve this court-jumping procedure for cases of “imperative public importance.” Only a handful of cases has cleared that bar, including the Nixon tapes case, which effectively forced the president’s resignation and the 1981 case that ratified the agreement that ended the Iran hostage crisis. Invoking those cases, Solicitor General Francisco insists to the court that “that standard has been met here,” an assertion the plaintiffs vigorously dispute. "
601,"BANGKOK — A senior cabinet minister and army general from Myanmar arrived in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Thursday to discuss a trouble-plagued scheme to repatriate Rohingya Muslims who fled military assaults and now are in camps in Bangladesh. In less than half a year, around 700,000 Rohingya escaped attacks in their home state, Rakhine, and what the international community has called ethnic cleansing by Myanmar’s security forces. The Myanmar government insists it is committed to the repatriation of those Rohingya who can prove they recently left Rakhine. The Bangladeshi side says the same. But few expect that the two days of meetings between Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swe, Myanmar’s home minister, and Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, his Bangladeshi counterpart, will elicit much action. Over months of sporadic talks, each side has blamed the other for failing to put in place a voluntary repatriation agreement signed in November. On Monday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh called on the international community to increase pressure on Myanmar to take back the Rohingya. “The problem has been created on the other side of the border, and the solution to this problem also lies there,” Ms. Hasina said while on a visit to Vatican City. “That’s why the bigger responsibility of implementing the agreement lies on Myanmar’s shoulders, but we haven’t gotten that kind of response from Myanmar yet.” The authorities in Myanmar are pointing fingers the other way. “We are ready for repatriation, but the Bangladesh side is not ready yet,” said U Zaw Htay, the spokesman for Myanmar’s presidential office, on Thursday. What neither side is fully talking about is what the Rohingya Muslims, who do not have a formal representative in the talks, want to happen. A long-persecuted Muslim minority, the Rohingya began fleeing Myanmar in huge numbers last August when attacks on Myanmar security posts by Rohingya insurgents unleashed a brutal military response. Hundreds of Rohingya villages were burned to the ground by security forces and associated mobs of ethnic Rakhine Buddhists. At least 6,700 Rohingya met violent deaths in Rakhine in the month after the military’s scorched-earth campaign, according to Doctors Without Borders. Rohingya women physically traumatized by rape continue to cross the border into Bangladesh. Myanmar’s civilian administration, however, refuses to admit to any systematic wrongdoing by the nation’s military. Independent journalists and human rights investigators have not been allowed access to the epicenter of violence in Northern Rakhine, and two Reuters reporters who documented a mass killing with chilling detail remain jailed in Myanmar. The continuing refusal by Myanmar’s authorities to acknowledge any atrocities against Rohingya civilians worries many of those sheltering in Bangladesh. “We will go back, but we must be given safety,” said Mohammed Zahid Alam, a Rohingya who now lives in the Balukhali refugee camp in Bangladesh. “We want a peaceful life.” Beyond the fundamental issue of security, most Rohingya have little interest in returning to a country that has denied them basic rights, like freedom of movement and higher education. Myanmar’s government considers the Rohingya to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Most have been stripped of their Myanmar citizenship, even though they have long roots in the region. Rohingya community leaders in the Bangladesh camps say they will return only if Myanmar’s government gives them the same rights it has given the country’s dozens of other ethnic minority groups. “Our demands are known to all,” said Mohammed Osman, who arrived in Bangladesh in early September and is now a deputy camp block chief. “We want full citizenship rights.” Bangladesh is an overcrowded and flood-prone nation. And with more Rohingya now crammed into the border district where their camps are located than there are native Bangladeshis, political and economic concerns are beginning to trump the remarkable hospitality that many residents have shown the refugees. To provide shelter for the influx of Rohingya, vast tracts of forest and farmland have been cleared. Prices for everything from building supplies to cooking oil have skyrocketed, while local wages have declined because of a sudden surge in Rohingya desperate for any kind of work. Ms. Hasina has made her welcome of the Rohingya part of her political lore. In Cox’s Bazar, the town nearest the camps, posters proclaim her as the “mother of humanity.” But with an election season underway in Bangladesh, the Rohingya could well turn into a political liability for Ms. Hasina’s governing Awami League. Bangladesh’s government says it is proceeding with a controversial plan to turn an uninhabited, low-lying island in the Bay of Bengal into a new shelter for the Rohingya. Meanwhile, the cyclone season may begin in Bangladesh as early as next month, threatening to turn the Rohingya camps into a muddy mess in which disease can thrive. As flooding worsens in the summer, at least 100,000 people may have to be moved from their current shelters because of the threat of landslides on recently denuded hills. Still, even the question of who would pay for the repatriation has yet to be answered, much less whether Myanmar is willing to halt violence against the Rohingya. Last month, technically. In the repatriation agreement signed last November, Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed to the return of willing Rohingya who could prove they had fled to Bangladesh since October 2016, when an earlier Rohingya insurgent assault catalyzed a smaller exodus. The repatriation process was supposed to begin by Jan. 23. That deadline was quietly delayed without much clarity on when the new start date for repatriations might be. A further agreement was signed in mid-January, stipulating that Rohingya returns should be completed within a two-year period. But apart from a token number of people who have returned to Myanmar, including some Hindu families, no one is rushing back. Further, human rights groups accuse Myanmar of doing little to create safe conditions for repatriation. “Burmese authorities have shown no ability to ensure the safe, dignified and voluntary return of Rohingya refugees as provided by international standards,” said a statement from Human Rights Watch. Myanmar officials have said that they will be able to process up to 300 people a day, five days a week, once the repatriation system is set in motion. But if all the Rohingya who escaped to Bangladesh since October 2016 wanted to return home, it would take almost a decade. The Myanmar government has built camps, rows of grim longhouses in Rakhine in which repatriated Rohingya are supposed to stay for an unspecified period of time. The compounds are surrounded by barbed-wire fences and bear an uncomfortable similarity to concentration camps. There is little in the way of trees or shade — and no signs of accessible fields or paddies that could support Rohingya communities. Human Rights Watch has called these camps “open-air prisons.” When and if the Rohingya would be allowed to return to their own villages, many of which were razed by fire, is not clear. Myanmar has begun transferring some land that it terms “abandoned” to other owners. The case of Rohingya who suffered from an earlier outbreak of violence is cautionary. In 2012, communal clashes forced urban Rohingya in central Rakhine from their homes. More than five years later, around 120,000 Rohingya are still confined to what had been deemed temporary camps. (Others fled by rickety boats to other parts of Southeast Asia, dangerous journeys that claimed hundreds of lives.) Unable to leave the camps without special permission, the Rohingya remaining in central Rakhine are dependent on aid to survive. Yet international aid groups say that since the Rohingya insurgent attacks last August it has been much more difficult to deliver food and other necessities to these ghettos. Earlier this week, Myanmar’s state news media announced that the camps in central Rakhine would be closed but gave no details of what would happen to their inhabitants. Mr. Zaw Htay, the presidential spokesman, confirmed that the camps in Sittwe, Myebon and Kyaukphyu will be shuttered. “We will relocate the refugees to appropriate places,” he said. “Now we don’t want to tell the media where we will relocate them.” "

603,"WASHINGTON — The indictment of 13 Russians filed on Friday by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, details the secret workings of the Internet Research Agency, an organization in St. Petersburg, Russia, that disseminates false information online. According to American intelligence officials, the Kremlin oversaw this shadowy operation, which made extensive use of social media accounts to foster conflict in the United States and erode public faith in its democracy.     "
604,"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed down its new set of congressional district lines on Monday, replacing those drawn by Republicans after they captured the state legislature in 2010. The state’s highest court had earlier ruled those lines unconstitutional. The new map, The Times’s Nate Cohn said, “comes very close to achieving partisan balance.” Republicans, who held a big advantage under the old lines, plan to challenge the new ones in federal court. It’s a huge fight, with enormous ramifications. But as they argue over what lines should go where, I ask you to consider a more fundamental question: Why have lines at all? You’re thinking: “Why have lines? Because we have to! We have to have congressional districts!” Well, yes, under current law we do. But Congress can change that law. And in our deeply polarized age, there’s an argument to be made that we might be better off if it did so. There is nothing in the Constitution that says we have to have congressional districts. Article 1, Section 2, says merely that “the House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states.” No particular method is prescribed. And indeed, in the early days of the republic, states did not uniformly use what we now call “single-member district” voting. Most did. But a few states used what was then called “general ticket” voting. Under this system, there were no districts. In those states in the first congressional elections, the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists put up slates, and the side with the winning slate took all or most of the seats. "
605,"MEXICO CITY — With Venezuela suffering one of the most severe economic collapses of modern times, the beleaguered administration of President Nicolás Maduro announced on Tuesday that it had begun a presale of virtual currency backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves. The government, which had announced plans for the new digital currency late last year, said the initiative was a response to a financial crisis marked by a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation. The country is suffering desperate scarcities of food and medicine, soaring crime rates and the collapse of public services and the health system. The crisis has driven hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee the country seeking a better life. The Maduro administration hopes that sales of the digital currency, known as the petro, will help its treasury pay off debt and increase imports of vitally needed goods, as well as raw materials for manufacturing. Venezuelan officials also asserted that the new digital currency — the first to be issued by a nation — would allow investors to do an end run around sanctions imposed against their country by the Trump administration. These sanctions ban the purchase in American markets of new securities issued by the Venezuelan government, and outlaw business dealings with Mr. Maduro and several top administration officials. “For big problems, big solutions,” Mr. Maduro said Tuesday night at a ceremony in Caracas. “We Venezuelans are indomitable.” He called it a “cryptocurrency to take on Superman.” But many analysts and critics of the government did not give the digital currency much hope of success. “I just think it’s a desperate move by a regime that is increasingly isolated and has an economy that has spiraled out of its control,” said Cynthia J. Arnson, director of the Latin American Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The Venezuelan government has said the value of the petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil. But the Maduro administration has not given many details on how this pricing would work, and many investors have said they would not trust the government to faithfully maintain the link between the petro and the price of oil. “The petro will most likely suffer all of the same ills as Venezuelan debt,” predicted David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has researched Venezuela for more than two decades. A spokesman for the United States Treasury Department warned American investors last month that the petro might still run afoul of the sanctions, telling Reuters that the currency “would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government” and could “expose U.S. persons to legal risk.” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democratic, wrote to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in January, asking him to monitor the situation closely. “We have serious doubts about whether Venezuela has the capacity to launch a cryptocurrency,” the letter said. “But regardless, it is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.” Critics of the Maduro administration, including many in the international community, attribute the nation’s economic problems to government mismanagement. Mr. Maduro blames a conspiracy involving the political opposition working in concert with foreign governments, especially the United States. On Monday, Mr. Maduro made an overture to President Trump, inviting him for bilateral talks through a Twitter post. “@RealDonaldTrump campaigned promoting noninterference in other countries’ domestic affairs, “ he said. “The time has come to fulfill it and change your agenda of aggression for one of dialogue.” Mr. Maduro added: “Dialogue in Caracas or in Washington, D.C.?” The Trump administration has sought to justify its sanctions against Venezuelan officials by accusing them of political repression and public corruption. Last month, while adding four more names to the growing list of Venezuelan officials placed in the sanctions list, the Treasury Department criticized the nation’s all-powerful Constituent Assembly for prohibiting three major opposition parties from participating in the presidential election. Mr. Maduro will be running for re-election in the April race, and with his government in control of the electoral machinery and the highest court, he is expected to win. But the United States, Colombia and other countries have already declared that they will not recognize the results. Ms. Arnson said the introduction of the currency could provide a political lift to Mr. Maduro’s re-election ambitions. “Looking like you’re doing something to save the economy, that goes beyond paying off your foreign creditors, is an important part of the electoral strategy,” she said. “But I think this is fantasy-land in terms of being an economic life jacket.” The Venezuelan government’s petro initiative is one of the wildest outgrowths of an explosion in activity around virtual currencies over the last year. Inspired by the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin in 2017, many entrepreneurs raised money by creating and selling their own virtual currencies in so-called initial coin offerings. Many governments around the world have also been examining whether it would make sense to issue their own electronic currencies on something similar to the network that Bitcoin runs on, with the Bank of England and the People’s Bank of China announcing experiments. Russian government officials have also discussed issuing some sort of crypto-ruble, to evade American sanctions. But no government has moved ahead more swiftly, and with more abandon, than Venezuela. The documents that have been put out by the Venezuelan government suggest that the petro’s release will be similar to the offerings done by private companies. The petro white paper said the process would begin with a presale of digital tokens, to gauge demand, and then be followed by an “Initial Coin Offer,” with 82 million petros released to the public. The petros are then supposed to be tradable on virtual currency exchanges around the world, the white paper says. A petro website says the Venezuelan government will accept the petro for tax payments and fees. Mr. Maduro directed the state oil company, PDVSA, and other public companies to handle a percentage of their sales and purchases in petros. Coin offerings have been attractive to entrepreneurs because investors can send their money using Bitcoin or other existing virtual currencies, which do not go through banks or other institutions that could decline the transactions. The movement of money outside of the traditional banking system has allowed coin offerings to go ahead even though American regulators have said that most of them are probably violating the law. The same structure could be beneficial to Venezuela, given that it is facing American sanctions that have made it hard to raise money through established channels. For investors, though, the petro may be a hard sell, given that the system will be designed and controlled by the Venezuelan government, which has not been the most reliable financial player. The design of the petro, while clearly inspired by Bitcoin, would, in some ways, be the opposite of most virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which are designed to operate without any central government or authority in charge. Bitcoin has largely won over investors because there is no central authority that could suddenly change the number of Bitcoins to be released, or the rules of the network. With the petro, on the other hand, the confidence of investors is likely to be only as strong as their confidence in the Maduro government. "

607,"WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is resisting giving up his access to highly classified information, prompting an internal struggle with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, over who should be allowed to see some of the nation’s most sensitive secrets, according to White House officials and others briefed on the matter. Mr. Kushner is one of dozens of White House officials operating under interim security clearances because of issues raised by the F.B.I. during their background checks, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the clearances. The practice has drawn added scrutiny because of Rob Porter, the former staff secretary who resigned under pressure this month after domestic abuse allegations against him became public. Mr. Porter’s post entailed handling and reviewing the flow of documents to and from the president, which routinely includes highly classified material. He had been allowed to continue in the job for more than a year with a stopgap clearance even though the F.B.I. had informed the White House of the damaging accusations against him. Mr. Kushner’s clearance has afforded him access to closely guarded information, including the presidential daily brief, the intelligence summary Mr. Trump receives every day, but it has not been made permanent, and his background investigation is still pending after 13 months serving in Mr. Trump’s inner circle. Now Mr. Kelly, his job at risk and his reputation as an enforcer of order and discipline tarnished by the scandal, is working to revamp the security clearance process, starting with an effort to strip officials who have interim clearances of their high-level access. In a memo issued on Friday, Mr. Kelly said he would revoke top clearances for anyone whose background check had been pending since June 1 or earlier, and review such clearances every month thereafter. Mr. Kushner, frustrated about the security clearance issue and concerned that Mr. Kelly has targeted him personally with the directive, has told colleagues at the White House that he is reluctant to give up his high-level access, the officials said. In the talks, the officials say, Mr. Kushner has insisted that he maintain his current level of access, including the ability to review the daily intelligence briefing when he sees fit. But Mr. Kelly, who has been privately dismissive of Mr. Kushner since taking the post of chief of staff but has rarely taken him on directly, has made no guarantees, saying only that the president’s son-in-law will still have all the access he needs to do his job under the new system. “As I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico,” Mr. Kelly said in a statement the White House released on Tuesday in which he refused to address Mr. Kushner’s security clearance or elaborate on his memo. “Everyone in the White House is grateful for these valuable contributions to furthering the president’s agenda,” Mr. Kelly said of Mr. Kushner. “There is no truth to any suggestion otherwise.” It is unclear whether Mr. Kushner would need to review highly classified information. His current portfolio — which includes acting as an intermediary with Mexico, trying to forge Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, participating in an economic dialogue with China and working on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement — seems unlikely to involve major intelligence or national security secrets. But Mr. Kushner, by dint of his relationship with Mr. Trump, has wide-ranging access to the president and the information that he sees, and senior advisers to the president typically require such access to perform their duties. The fact that the White House chief of staff would take the step of publicly denying that a policy change would harm the president’s son-in-law pointed up the tension in the West Wing after the Porter episode, particularly between Mr. Kelly on one side, and Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, who had been close allies of Mr. Porter, on the other. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have been critical of Mr. Kelly in conversations with the president, who spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., surveying people about whether he should fire his chief of staff. However, since Mr. Porter’s departure, one official said, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have told people around the White House that they have been vocal in their attempts to defend Mr. Kelly but are being treated unfairly in return. One person familiar with Mr. Kushner’s thinking, who insisted on anonymity to describe it, denied that he felt personally targeted by Mr. Kelly or was agitating to have him removed. Another White House official denied that Mr. Kushner had ever raised the issue of the intelligence summary in his discussions with Mr. Kelly over his clearance. But the memo, deliberately or otherwise, has shone an unflattering light on Mr. Kushner, raising questions about whether he can be effective in his post and how much authority he has. That debate threatens to complicate what Mr. Kelly has acknowledged is a long-overdue effort inside the White House to get a handle on the clearance process, a national security imperative over which top officials appear to have placed little priority after Mr. Trump took office. “We should — and in the future, must — do better,” Mr. Kelly said in his memo last week. The questions surrounding Mr. Kushner’s clearance are particularly acute because of the possibility that his extensive contacts with foreign actors — including travel, meetings with leaders overseas and multiple business ventures — might be relevant to the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Kushner initially failed to disclose scores of those contacts on the standard form required for all prospective government officials, and has since amended his submission, substantially delaying his background check. That meant that his background information was not submitted in its entirety until June, after the June 1 cutoff that Mr. Kelly set in his memo. Under the new policy, anyone holding interim clearance to see top secret or sensitive compartmented information whose background investigation had been pending since then is to be stripped of that access by Friday. Even if Mr. Kushner was not in that initial group, the document suggested that his status would soon be reviewed, and that his access going forward would be subject entirely to Mr. Kelly’s discretion. “Similar reviews will occur monthly for long-outstanding adjudications,” Mr. Kelly wrote. The new rules, he said, would “limit access to certain highly classified information for those individuals working with interim clearance status absent explicit chief of staff’s office approval, which would be granted only in the most compelling circumstances.” "

610,"Cameron Kasky, a 17-year-old at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who survived last week’s mass shooting, wrote a beautiful essay for CNN.com that declared: “At the end of the day, the students at my school felt one shared experience — our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools. But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account. This time we are going to pressure them to take action. This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses.” Cameron, God bless you for that sentiment. But just one piece of respectful advice: If your generation and mine want to get serious about a gun control crusade, we all need to get out of Facebook and into someone’s face: the N.R.A.’s. This fight can’t be won on Twitter or Instagram. They do get people into the streets. But social media have created a world of faux activism — “Hey, I tweeted about it” — that the bad guys take advantage of. The N.R.A. is not just in the chat rooms. It’s in the cloakrooms of Congress and state legislatures. And it’s there with bags of money and votes it uses to reward lawmakers who do its bidding and hurt those who don’t. I loved seeing the 100 students from your high school taking buses Tuesday to Florida’s capital to directly press lawmakers. That’s a great start. I hope every high school follows. But, ultimately, nothing will change unless young and old who oppose the N.R.A. run for office, vote, help someone vote, register someone to vote or help fund someone’s campaign — so we can threaten the same electoral pain as the National Rifle Association, which, according to PolitiFact, spent $203.2 million between 1998 and 2017 funding its candidates, defeating gun control advocates and lobbying. This is not about persuading people with better ideas. We tried that. It’s about generating raw electoral power and pain. Because most of the G.O.P. members of Congress who do the N.R.A.’s bidding care about only one thing: their jobs. The pay of a typical congressman is $174,000 — and free parking at Reagan National Airport — and they will sell themselves to whoever can generate the votes to enable them to keep both. "
611,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed on Tuesday to repatriate a Guantánamo Bay detainee to Saudi Arabia, missing a deadline set in his 2014 plea deal and dealing another blow to the struggling military commissions system at the wartime prison. The detainee, Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi, agreed in February 2014 to plead guilty to terrorism-related offenses involving a 2002 attack by Al Qaeda on a French-flagged oil tanker off the coast of Yemen. Under the pretrial agreement, if he cooperated, he was to be sent home within four years to serve the remainder of his sentence in Saudi custody. But on Tuesday, the four-year anniversary of that deal arrived, and Mr. Darbi remained at the American prison. The Department of Defense still hopes the transfer will take place soon, but diplomatic arrangements with the Saudi government are incomplete, Cmdr. Sarah Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Haza al-Darbi’s transfer from Guantánamo detention to Saudi Arabia will not take place today,” she said, adding: “We await assurances from the Saudi Arabian government to move forward on his departure. Al-Darbi will remain at Guantánamo until all transfer details are concluded.” The missed deadline came days after a military commissions judge indefinitely shut down the case against another Saudi detainee — who is accused of orchestrating the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole, and against whom Mr. Darbi testified as part of his cooperation — after more than six years of pretrial hearings. The fate of Mr. Darbi has been closely watched for several reasons. If the United States lived up to the Obama-era deal, it would mean that President Trump would preside over a reduction of the Guantánamo detainee population, which would drop from 41 to 40, despite his campaign vow to fill it back up. But if the government reneged on the deal, legal experts have warned that it would strongly discourage other detainees from cooperating with military commissions prosecutors by pleading guilty and potentially serving as witnesses — a key tool that civilian court prosecutors routinely use to win convictions. Last year, the State Department, under Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, dismantled the Office of the Special Envoy for Guantánamo Closure, which had been created by the Obama administration to make diplomatic arrangements for detainee transfers and to handle any subsequent diplomatic issues regarding former detainees. A remaining official was reassigned to help process Freedom of Information Act requests. In November, shortly after Mr. Darbi’s sentencing, the State Department, in response to a question by The New York Times about whether anyone was actively working on transfer arrangements, said only that it was prepared to support the Pentagon in implementing the plea agreement. At the time, it was unclear what the Pentagon was doing. On Tuesday, Lee Wolosky, who as the last of several Obama administration special envoys for Guantánamo closure arranged for the transfer of more than a dozen detainees to Saudi Arabia between late 2015 and early 2017, criticized the Trump administration’s approach to getting that task done. “It takes weeks or months to lay the groundwork for a normal transfer (which this one is not), from arranging logistics, to negotiating security arrangements, to obtaining the necessary political approvals,” he wrote in a text message. “The D.O.D. historically has not interfaced with the right parts of the Saudi government to get all that done.” On Tuesday, Commander Higgins acknowledged that the Defense Department is taking the lead in talks with the Saudi government about transferring Mr. Darbi. But she declined to address how long those negotiations have been taking place or what assurances the Pentagon is seeking but has not received. "
612,"These three young theater figures are moving into the public eye with confidence and a determination to expand horizons for themselves and their audiences. Playwright, ‘An Ordinary Muslim’ When Hammaad Chaudry was 19, he moved away from Edinburgh, where he grew up the son of Pakistani immigrants, to attend the University of Surrey, about an hour outside of London. He planned to be a lawyer. But after marching to protest the war in Iraq, Mr. Chaudry grew more interested in political activism — and he found his law studies to be tedious and unfulfilling. He found his voice elsewhere: writing plays. At the end of his first year at university, he joined a writing program at the Royal Court Theater in London geared toward young Muslim writers. He would eventually pursue a master’s degree at Columbia University, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Tony Kushner took Mr. Chaudry under his wing. His thesis play, “An Ordinary Muslim,” tells the story of Azeem Bhatti and his wife, Saima Khan, as they navigate the complicated intersection of their Pakistani heritage and contemporary British culture.

613,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Quiet in a U.S. War on Meddling” (news analysis, front page, Feb. 18): After the 9/11 terror attacks, Americans remembered the horror of that day and mobilized at every level to both recover and push back against our enemies. We understood that such terrorists were an existential threat. Now, after the established Russian cyberattacks intended to divide Americans and to tip the election in Donald Trump’s favor, we are once more looking to our leaders for recovery and pushback. If President Trump refuses or is unable for some reason to provide that leadership, then others must fill that vacuum. Russia is not our friend; Russia is an enemy bent on destabilizing our country and weakening our position among nations. MARY F. WARREN, WHEATON, ILL. To the Editor: President Trump apparently fears that acknowledging Russian interference in the 2016 election would delegitimize his presidency. His first response to the recent indictments and evidence that Russians interfered in that election was to tweet, “No collusion.” But his refusal to acknowledge the continuing threat, and direct the resources of our government to stop it, amounts to that very complicity. This abject failure to preserve, protect and defend our constitutional right to free and fair elections from a foreign threat makes him unfit to be president. PETER MOORE, SEATTLE To the Editor: I do wish that all living former presidents would raise their voices in unison to counter President Trump’s selfishness, ignorance, and lies and distortions of the truth, and so affirm the American way of life and government. "
614,"WASHINGTON — President Trump — under pressure from angry, grieving students from a Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last week — ordered the Justice Department on Tuesday to issue regulations banning so-called bump stocks, which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons like those used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas. A day earlier, Mr. Trump signaled that he was open to supporting legislation that would modestly improve the national gun background check system, and on Tuesday night, he posted on Twitter that Democrats and Republicans “must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!” But Mr. Trump’s first embrace as president of any gun control measures was dismissed by gun control supporters as minor. The National Rifle Association supports the background check legislation and also backs bump stock regulation, although not an outright ban. Speaking at the White House days after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Mr. Trump said that he had directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to develop the regulations. “We cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,” Mr. Trump said at a ceremony as he conferred the medal of valor on public safety officials. “We must actually make a difference.” In Florida on Tuesday, the Republican-controlled State House rejected an effort to immediately consider a bill to ban large-capacity magazines and the type of assault rifles used in last week’s attack, even as students from Stoneman Douglas High School watched from the gallery. "
615,"Many months after it became clear that Russians exploited Facebook to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, the reach and impact of Russia’s activities on the social network are still not fully known. The indictment announced on Friday in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, charged 13 Russians and does not accuse Facebook or Instagram of any wrongdoing. But the names of those two networks appear 41 times in the indictment. The dribble of information about Russian actors’ use of Facebook, as well as confusing messages coming from the company, has raised even more questions. Here’s a look at what we know and what other information Facebook might be able to provide. So far, Facebook executives have implied that the influence campaign was minor in the scheme of things. The company has released numbers that suggest the Russians reached a large number of people. In testimony to Congress last year, Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, said that roughly 126 million people may have been “served content” from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll factory, over a two-year period. But Mr. Stretch added that this content was a smidgen of the total content available across Facebook: And on Friday, Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president for ads, noted that more than half of the Russian Facebook ads (56 percent) were served after the 2016 election. "
616,"UNITED NATIONS — In a heated session of the United Nations Security Council that appeared to serve little but to reinforce intractable divisions between Israelis and Palestinians, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, accused Israel of acting like “a state above the law,” before Israel’s ambassador said that Mr. Abbas was “part of the problem.” Amid the name-calling, no one seemed to acknowledge the surprise presence of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, who sat quietly with the American delegation in the Security Council chamber. Mr. Trump has charged him with forging “the ultimate deal” between the Israelis and Palestinians, though there has been little movement on that front. Mr. Abbas was appearing before the Security Council for only the second time, after a 2011 visit in which he advocated Palestinian statehood. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Abbas expressed an “absolute readiness to reach a historic peace agreement,” but said the United States had “not clarified its position.” For his part, the Israeli ambassador, Danny Danon, praised the Trump administration for “working very hard to make progress toward peace.” Mr. Kushner was joined in the Council chamber by Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, with whom he is said to be drafting a peace proposal. No details about that proposal were publicly revealed at the United Nations on Tuesday, though Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt held an hourlong closed-door meeting with the Security Council after the session. Josh Raffel, a White House spokesman, said the administration was still working on its plan, “which is designed to benefit both the Israeli and Palestinian people.” "
617,"MELBOURNE, Australia — More than five years ago, on two different continents and only days apart, an Australian woman and an Australian man entered indefinite detention. For the woman, a defense lawyer at the International Criminal Court, being arrested was a relatively brief but harrowing affair, punctuated by armed men, dark rooms and aggressive interrogation. For the man, a co-founder of WikiLeaks, detention continues, though some might say voluntarily. The lawyer, Melinda Taylor, would go on to represent the man, Julian Assange. Ms. Taylor, now 42, has earned a reputation for defending the rights of individuals condemned by the court of public opinion before they have set foot inside an actual courtroom. Her clients have included Mr. Assange and Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan strongman. Mr. Assange, perhaps best known for publishing leaked United States military documents, has remained inside the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012, after the Swedish authorities issued a warrant for his arrest over a rape accusation. He made headlines again in January when Ecuador announced it had granted him citizenship, and planned to give him diplomatic status, in an effort to evict him from the embassy without his being extradited. Though Sweden is no longer seeking his extradition, Mr. Assange has said he fears that the United States will prosecute him over the document leaks. “I think the situation is untenable, and that there has to be a solution now, not later,” Ms. Taylor said of Mr. Assange. “He’s at risk of an ongoing prosecution by the United States.” "

It’s a seven-hour ride, and our reporter is tweeting from the bus. “This shooting is different from the other ones,” one student told her. “I just have a gut feeling — something is going to change.” Other students were already in Tallahassee, where the Florida House rejected a motion to take up a bill to ban assault rifles. We reported that just an hour after news of the shooting broke, Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia were using it to inflame the gun control debate. They used hashtags like #NRA and #ar15, and posted messages both for and against gun restrictions. ____ "
619,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge blocked AT&T’s move to obtain communication logs between the Justice Department and the White House on Tuesday, hampering the phone giant’s argument that politics played a role in the government’s decision to halt a merger with Time Warner. Judge Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, who is overseeing a trial over the deal, said AT&T did not sufficiently show in pretrial discussions that it was treated differently from other companies. “Defendants have fallen far short of establishing that this enforcement action was selective,” Judge Leon said. The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. The merger would transform the media landscape by combining a television and movie giant with one of the nation’s biggest media distributors. “We respect the judge’s decision and look forward to the upcoming trial,” said Dan Petrocelli, lead trial lawyer for both Time Warner and AT&T. In a statement, the Justice Department said, “We are pleased with and respect today’s decision, which will permit the parties and court to focus on the case at hand.” "
620,"Chazzie is 11 years old. She has long, wavy hair and large, expressive eyes. She listens to Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande. She really likes playing Monopoly. Chazzie was also assigned male at birth. But that, she says, isn’t what’s important. “People just, like, see me as a girl,” she said. On Sunday, Chazzie and five other transgender children and teenagers from across the country hung out in an elegant prewar apartment on the Upper West Side, ahead of their Tuesday appearance on NBC’s “Megyn Kelly Today.” For some, it would be their news media debut. Others have fought for transgender rights in their home states and were well acquainted with the press. But all had the same hope: to shift the conversation about transgender youth from one that dwells on bullying, suicide and murder, to one that focuses on positivity, through an online campaign called the GenderCool Project. The organization was co-founded by Chazzie’s mother, Jen Grosshandler, who left a decades-long career in public relations and marketing about 18 months ago after working for some of the biggest brands in the world. Chazzie was born into an “uber masculine” household, Ms. Grosshandler said, with three older brothers. But from the time she was a toddler, she was drawn to toys and games traditionally associated with girls. When Chazzie was around 4 years old, she walked down the staircase with a white Hanes T-shirt wrapped on top of her head. Chazzie said: “Mom, Dad look at me — isn’t my hair awesome? Isn’t it fabulous? I want long hair,” Ms. Grosshandler recalled. Years later, Chazzie cried while getting ready for school, and asked: “Mom, what happens if I’m a girl? Because I really believe I am a girl. What will happen to me? Will you love me? Will Dad love me? Will my brothers love me?” “That was a huge moment for us,” Ms. Grosshandler said. She eventually left her consulting practice to focus on advocacy. Soon after, she created the GenderCool Project with Gearah Goldstein, a transgender woman who trains people on how to create gender-inclusive environments. “Our mission is to just get rid of the stigmas and just live our lives,” said Nicole, one of the participants. “And that’s what everybody else is doing. So my question to the world is: ‘Why can’t we? Why should we not?’” The project seeks to humanize members of a minority group who are increasingly visible but who find their gender identity at times overshadowing everything else about them. “I think it’s pretty unique,” said Debi Jackson, a family organizer at the National Center for Transgender Equality. There are a lot of websites that explain how to navigate a child’s transition, she said, but they aren’t focused on celebrating the kid you have. Being “gender cool” is about being “cool with whomever anyone else is,” Ms. Grosshandler said. She calls the participants champions. And their stories are aspirational rather than full of adversity. Gia, 14, is one of her school’s top field hockey players and a straight-A student. Nicole, 16, is an actress with perfectly manicured nails who hopes to appear on Broadway one day. Stella, 13, lobbies politicians for protections for trans students. Landon, 15, is an accomplished trumpet player and artist whose latest work explores “how society puts down men and boys for being feminine.” Daniel, 12, is a photographer. (Their last names and hometowns are being withheld to protect their privacy.) On Sunday, they sat side by side, laughing and chatting as if they had known one another for years, even though their first meeting in person was only a day earlier. Later, a spirited game of Never Have I Ever (“Never have I ever been to Sephora!” “Never have I ever legally changed my name!”) was followed by a snowball fight in Central Park. Together, they were buoyant. “We’re all diamonds. Being trans is just one face, one edge of the diamond,” Landon said. “But there is so much else that makes us diamonds. It’s not just a single sliver.” When Gia first transitioned, she was nervous. She had heard only negative stories about transgender people. “I was confused, honestly,” she said. “Should I really transition? Like, what’s going to come of this?” Once she did, her fears subsided. “I haven’t had a single person make fun of me.” That wasn’t everyone’s experience. Stella was bullied, and Nicole said she hadn’t seen her father in four years because he does not approve of her gender identity. “But I had a very supportive family, except for him,” Nicole said. “I had a very supportive school.” She and the other participants said they hoped to make the world a less lonely place. “When other kids see this, they can be like: ‘Oh my God, I’m like that. I’m like that girl,’” Chazzie said, wiping tears from her eyes. “I just want to show other people that they’re not alone.” An estimated 150,000 people ages 13 to 17 in the United States identify as transgender, according to a January 2017 report by the Williams Institute at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, which researches law and public policy on gender identity and sexual orientation. In December, a Williams Institute study of gender nonconforming youths in California found that they were more than twice as likely as their gender conforming peers to have experienced psychological distress. The 2015 National School Climate Survey found that transgender students experienced more hostility than others. And four out of 10 transgender adults report having attempted suicide, according to a 2017 study by Human Rights Campaign and the Trans People of Color Coalition, the majority having done so before age 25. The outlook for transgender youth often improves, however, when they say they feel supported. According to the group Trans Student Educational Resources, those with supportive parents were much more likely to have high self-esteem and less likely to suffer from depression. “I see these kids thriving all the time,” said Stella’s mother, Lisa. “It’s not newsworthy because it’s not tragic or sensationalized.” It’s important to highlight the difficulties faced by trans people, she said. “But it’s also equally important to show how extraordinary these kids are.” Ms. Grosshandler and Ms. Goldstein have rolled their campaign out strategically. They introduced it in February because at this time last year, President Trump rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. And they appeared on “Megyn Kelly Today” because her program appeals to different groups, Ms. Grosshandler said, including “many people who have never met a young transgender child.” Ms. Kelly, a former Fox News host, wasn’t necessarily an obvious choice. But “we felt so strongly that we wanted to talk to folks in every town, in every community,” Ms. Grosshandler said. The GenderCool Project is a call to action, Ms. Goldstein said. “What are you doing for the community? How are you using voices, how are you telling stories, how are you being inclusive?” As a transgender adult, she added, “I wish I had some positive messaging around when I was growing up.” "
621,"MONTREAT, N.C. — The Rev. Billy Graham will lie in repose Monday and Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., and his funeral will be held on March 2, a family spokesman said late Wednesday. Mr. Graham’s body will be taken from Asheville, N.C., to Charlotte on Saturday in a procession that is expected to start at 11 a.m. and take three and a half hours, said the spokesman, Mark DeMoss, whose public relations firm is handling the arrangements for the Graham family.  "
622,"WASHINGTON — Whenever there is a mass shooting, the National Rifle Association has a well-rehearsed response: Say very little until the inevitable discussion about gun control cools down. But as the leaders of the country’s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization’s online video channel. Its hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a “deep state” campaign to undermine President Trump. “Coastal, socialist media elites hate guns so much,” said one of the hosts, Grant Stinchfield, a Second Amendment activist based in Dallas and a radio commentator, that they would take everyone’s away, “leaving only criminals, of course, with the firepower — and all of us at the mercy of evil.” Critics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization’s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House. “There’s no boogeyman in the White House now to make people afraid of,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. “So they have to make us afraid of one another, and that is how they will market guns in an age when they have a president beholden to them.” The channel has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics today, with hosts and guests who are closely allied with Mr. Trump. Few news media operations seem as in sync with the political sensibilities of the Trump era. They attack the enemies he attacks, condemning the news media as “dishonest” and “failing.” They have questioned the credibility of the F.BI., whose failure to act on tips about the suspect in the Florida shooting has intensified criticism from conservatives seeking to discredit the bureau — this week, Dana Loesch, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, encouraged mass demonstrations outside F.B.I. offices. And they often side with Mr. Trump in divisive cultural disputes — some of which have potent racial undercurrents — like his feuding with Black Lives Matter activists and the professional football players who knelt during the national anthem. With broadcast television-quality production and three dozen original series, NRATV has the ability to reach millions of people through the channels that distribute it like Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV.  And it has significant resources at its disposal as part of the N.R.A.’s far-reaching “membership support” program. In recent years, that operation alone spent $35.5 million, according to its most recent publicly available tax filing. But it is just the newest piece of a larger news media operation inside the N.R.A. that receives little attention compared with the group’s political and lobbying activity. The organization produces at least seven print and online magazines that have a combined circulation of more than 11 million, according to the N.R.A. Its biggest social media channels on Facebook and Twitter count about 8.7 million followers. On YouTube, five N.R.A.-controlled channels have shared videos that have received nearly 102 million views. Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the media effort, the size of its online audience or its programming in the wake of the Parkland shooting. As a matter of policy, he said, the N.R.A. does not discuss proprietary matters. NRATV is a budding business for the organization, which has brokered sponsorship arrangements with gun makers like Kimber, Mossberg and Ruger to feature their firearms on its programs. Its series cover a range of topics and interests intended to appeal to gun owners of all kinds, like “Armed and Fabulous,” which profiles rifle-slinging women; “Frontlines,” a newsmagazine hosted by Oliver North; and “Under Wild Skies,” which follows hunters in  pursuit of big-game trophies. But politics and provocation are NRATV’s specialty. It has singled out news outlets and attacked individual journalists like Don Lemon of CNN, who was targeted in an ad that accused the anchor and his network of smearing Mr. Trump and colluding with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. In one video released this month, Ms. Loesch, a former Tea Party activist and Breitbart editor, pretended she was about to burn a copy of The New York Times. Stories that circulate throughout right-wing news media often find their way to NRATV, which has devoted numerous segments to portraying anti-Trump demonstrators as paid shills, violent extremists and evangelists for Shariah law in the United States. Its guests and hosts are not shy of trading in racially charged language and imagery. A promo for a program called “Noir” featuring a Navy SEAL member named Dom Raso opens with a dramatization of a foiled robbery. A black man wielding a knife grabs and forces a white woman to the ground as an armed bystander reaches for his handgun and rushes to her defense.       After Mr. Trump’s inauguration last year, an NRATV correspondent, Chuck Holton, tweeted that it was time to “get busy scrubbing Obama’s mocacchino stain off of America!” — an apparent reference to the color of President Barack Obama’s skin. The N.R.A.’s practice is to keep a low profile after mass shootings, as it did after the massacres in Newtown, Conn., and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. But it was always quietly talking to its members, first by email and later on NRATV, said Danny Barefoot, a partner at Anvil Strategies, an ad agency and communications company that has worked with gun control groups. “In those moments, the goal isn’t to disseminate mass information and persuade a lot of people, ” Mr. Barefoot said. “The strategy is to be a messenger to the N.R.A.’s own people.” Eli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, a site that delivered progressive political videos to targeted audiences on Facebook, said that while videos produced by NRATV after a shooting might not go viral, they helped viewers “feel they’re part of a community, led by a news source that speaks to them.” NRATV can galvanize members in the wake of a shooting in part because the N.R.A. has coached its followers to believe that the organization is the only credible source for news and information on any gun issue or controversy. NRATV’s slogan — “America’s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth” — reinforces a sense of mistrust in traditional news media,  as do its hosts. In the days after the Parkland shooting, Mr. Stinchfield and Ms. Loesch, two of the channel’s most prominent faces, were relentless in their attacks on the news media. “If it can topple us, it gets a direct path to the Second Amendment,” Mr. Stinchfield told viewers this week from the organization’s studio in Dallas. “They will stop at nothing to put us out of business.” Some of his more recent antics have included taking a sledgehammer to a television set as clips from MSNBC, CNN and ABC play onscreen, and inviting North Korea to launch a nuclear weapon on Sacramento, where the California state legislature has approved numerous gun control measures opposed by the N.R.A. Mr. Stinchfield went on to question the competence and motivation of the F.B.I. “It is time the F.B.I. got back to the business of keeping Americans safe, instead of being so focused on political vendettas,” he said. He then turned the microphone over to Mr. Holton, who saw a slippery slope in new gun regulations and identified a new culprit in the proliferation of school shootings: the news media. “People could just as easily call for restrictions on the first amendment,” Mr. Holton said. “They could say, ‘Hey, let’s make it illegal to report on those school shootings because we all know, I mean, there’s no doubt that the media circus that takes place every time one of these things happens causes more school shootings.” "
623,"WASHINGTON — Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly heckled at a nationally televised forum on Wednesday night in Florida after they refused to back new gun control measures. The spokeswoman for the N.R.A., Dana Loesch, offering the group’s first public comments after a shooting last week at a Florida high school, strongly defended the gun advocacy group’s positions in front of students and teachers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” she said, insisting that enforcement of mental health laws, not new gun restrictions, would prevent future massacres. Mr. Rubio, Republican of Florida, also drew the ire of the crowd for refusing to support a ban on assault weapons and for saying that he intended to continue accepting money from the N.R.A. and other groups that support his pro-gun agenda. Ms. Loesch and Mr. Rubio appeared during the two-hour forum, broadcast on CNN from a site near Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Fla., knowing full well that they would be assailed by the gathering of people directly affected by the mass shooting last week. President Trump and Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, both declined invitations to participate in the town hall-style meeting. "

626,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • They almost met. The U.S. State Department revealed how close Vice President Mike Pence came to sitting down with the high-level delegation of North Koreans at the Winter Olympics. The North Koreans canceled at the last minute, adding a new level of meaning to the photographs of Mr. Pence and Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the North Korean leader, ignoring one another in the stands. Elsewhere in Asia, a U.S. congressional delegation from the Senate and House Committee on Armed Services is visiting Taiwan, meeting there with President Tsai Ing-wen and her senior ministers, a dialogue likely to irritate Beijing officials. _____ • “This shooting is different.” That was Daniel Bishop, 16, one of the survivors of the Florida school shooting who went to the state capital to demand gun control measures, above. The Republicans who dominate the state’s government are facing pressure unlike any they have experienced before. But even so, the students made little headway. And we spoke to a former assistant principal who held a school shooter at gunpoint — and who believes the national effort now underway to arm and train school staff members is misguided. _____ • At the Games, the loudest local fans are out in force for the Garlic Girls, as the Korean press has nicknamed the South Korean women’s curling team. (“I lost my voice from cheering so hard,” said one.) Here’s our full coverage, plus the medals table, results and schedule. And we went back to the 1930s for this: Maribel Vinson was The Times’s first female sportswriter and an Olympic figure skater — at the same time. _____ • The Rev. Billy Graham died at the age of 99.

In the 1950s and ’60s, as people started buying more cars, two-wheelers were beginning to be pushed off the road. Literally. Bicycle deaths, like traffic deaths as a whole, increased. In 1971, about 3,300 people died in traffic accidents, including 400 children. Activist groups sprang up. Stop de Kindermoord (Stop the Child Murder) was among the most prominent. The number of traffic deaths has dropped since that period. In 2016, the Netherlands saw 629 traffic casualties, about a third of which were bike deaths. Only 12 were children.

629,"WASHINGTON — The parents of the first lady, Melania Trump, have obtained lawful permanent residency in the United States, a lawyer for the couple confirmed Wednesday, but it remains unclear how or when the couple received their green cards. The lack of clarity about when and how Viktor and Amalija Knavs obtained their legal residencies raises questions about whether the couple secured their residency through family-based immigration, which President Trump calls chain migration and has said he wants to restrict. Immigration experts said it would have been the most direct, and most likely, way for Mrs. Trump’s parents, formerly of Slovenia, to get their green cards. Their immigration lawyer, Michael J. Wildes, declined to offer any details. “It’s a privilege to help this family, but I have to respect their privacy as well,” Mr. Wildes said in a brief interview. “Immigration is in our DNA,” he added. “We have to take great pride, no matter where somebody hails from, in that legacy.” Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, wrote in an email that she would not comment on Mrs. Trump’s parents because “they are not part of this administration, and deserve their privacy.” The Washington Post first reported the Knavses’ immigration status.

630,"Perhaps you read this week that Donald Trump has replaced James Buchanan as the worst president in the history of the United States.

Trump came in last, with a score of 12 out of 100. Choose the best way to look at this: A) Why are you reminding me about that man? Why can’t we talk about “Black Panther”? B) Never thought I’d reminisce about the good old days with Richard Nixon. C) Hey, at least it’s a story — nobody’s ever going to ask you what it was like living under Gerald Ford. D) God, I’m so tired of talking about Donald Trump. I hope this is going to lead to a discussion of James Buchanan. Good news! We are going to talk about James Buchanan right now. Perhaps you’re wondering how his fans are taking his promotion to second worst. "
631,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Natasha Singer, a technology reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech she’s using. You report on digital privacy, health and education technology. What are your most important tools for doing your job? We’re living in a surveillance economy where sites and apps can track and categorize our every online move. In that ecosystem, encrypted communication services have become some of my most important reporting tools. For people who would rather not reach me through my corporate Gmail account at The Times, I use ProtonMail, an encrypted email service. I also use Signal, an encrypted text messaging and calling service. And I do some online research through Tor, a browser that masks your online address so sites can’t track your physical location. I also use DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn’t store your search history. My wariness of tracking developed when I was a cub reporter in Moscow. On one of my first stories there, I invited a Russian legislator, who was a democracy advocate, to lunch at a restaurant near the Kremlin. She arrived and immediately started combing through a vase of flowers on the table, checking for government listening devices. After that, I often interviewed Russian democracy activists during walks in local parks and forests. It made an impression on me that even the mere idea of being surveilled can chill people’s behavior. "

633,"Having failed in its effort to have Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration has been relentlessly trying to destroy the health care law on its own. The latest move in that demolition derby came this week, when officials proposed giving insurance companies more leeway to sell junk health plans. The Department of Health and Human Services wants to let companies sell temporary health insurance policies that last up to 364 days, up from 90 days now. Officials say that would benefit people who are struggling with rising health insurance costs, because the plans tend to be cheaper than those on the insurance exchanges created by the A.C.A., or Obamacare. Not mentioned in the department’s talking points is the fact that these policies often do not cover things like mental health services, substance abuse treatment, cancer drugs and maternity care. As a result, people who buy such skimpy plans could end up being hit with exorbitant bills if they actually need medical care. The Obama administration limited these short-term plans to three months because they are meant to be a stopgap for people between jobs or in other temporary situations. The Trump administration would effectively encourage younger and healthier people to stop buying comprehensive policies on the Obamacare exchanges. As a result, insurers selling A.C.A. plans would be left covering an older and sicker population, forcing them to increase premiums. This would not be devastating to most of the people who use exchanges, because they receive federal subsidies that limit how much they have to pay. But it could really hurt middle-class families who earn too much to qualify for government assistance (about $82,000 for a family of three) and are already facing big premium increases. People in this group would have the terrible predicament of spending a lot of money buying health insurance or taking a chance by buying a skimpy temporary plan, hoping that nobody in the family gets sick or injured.

635,"It was a day of tense exchanges, emotion-packed speeches and confrontation as lawmakers, students and parents sparred on Wednesday over what to do about shootings in American schools. From the nation’s capital to Florida’s State House, people affected by gun violence delivered pain-laced addresses to crowds of passionate supporters, and President Trump listened to a group he had summoned to discuss the problem. There was also some poignant symbolism. Here are some of the most remarkable moments: At an intense town hall-style meeting Wednesday night, Diane Wolk Rogers, a history teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., confronted a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association over the Second Amendment. How did allowing the 19-year-old shooter in last week’s massacre to own an assault rifle represent “a well-regulated militia” as is written in the amendment, she asked. “Using supporting detail,” Ms. Wolk Rogers said to thunderous applause at CNN’s “Stand Up” town hall, “explain to me how an 18-year-old with a military rifle is well regulated.” Dana Loesch, the national spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said the phrase in the Second Amendment was meant to protect the rights of anyone who “could operate and service their firearm.” Her answer was roundly booed. "
636,"Representative Claudia Tenney, a first-term Republican from Central New York, said in a radio interview on Wednesday that “so many” mass murderers “end up being Democrats.” Democrats immediately condemned her remarks, which came a week after 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla., and called on her to apologize for politicizing gun tragedies. One of Ms. Tenney’s colleagues in the House, Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat of Virginia, wrote on Twitter that she “owes America a sincere and abject apology.” And her expected Democratic challenger this year, State Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, said in his own Twitter post that her “toxic rhetoric” was “a new low” and that “inserting politics into a national tragedy is beyond the pale & disgusting.” It is not clear that any group keeps a list of the political affiliation of mass killers. The Southern Poverty Law Center released a report this month that counted 100 people killed or injured by “alleged perpetrators influenced by the so-called ‘alt-right’” between 2014 and 2018. Some individual shootings have appeared politically motivated, at least in part. James Hodgkinson, who opened fire last year on Republicans during their practice for an annual bipartisan congressional baseball game, had written anti-Trump and anti-Republican remarks on social media ahead of the attack. He wounded several people, including Representative Steve Scalise, a top Republican lawmaker, though only the gunman died in that shooting. Ms. Tenney made her sweeping claim on the “Focus on the State Capitol” radio program hosted by Fred Dicker. Ms. Tenney said she feared lawful gun owners “are going to be targeted now” even though “in their demographic they have the least amount of crimes of virtually any other demographic.” Mr. Dicker jumped in: “But they tend to be Republican. They tend to be white. Most gun crimes are occurring in what’s euphemistically called the inner cities involving minorities and they’re the ones the Democrats generally are going to bend over backwards to protect.” Ms. Tenney eventually continued, “Obviously there’s a lot of politics in it. And it’s interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats. But the media doesn’t talk about that either.” In a statement on Wednesday night, Ms. Tenney elaborated but didn’t provide information about her claim: “I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy. While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists.” Ms. Tenney, a former state legislator, was elected to Congress in 2016, and her district is expected to be among the most hotly contested in New York this fall.

A dramatic moment at the White House: A father who lost his daughter in the Parkland, Fla., massacre made an impassioned plea to President Trump to ensure school safety. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot?” asked Andrew Pollack, above. The president is facing mounting pressure to take action against gun violence. Mr. Trump said his administration would be “very strong on background checks” of those wishing to purchase guns, and put “a very strong emphasis on the mental health of somebody.” ____ 2. There were also tense moments at the Statehouse in Tallahassee, Fla., where students from Parkland demanded a ban on military-style firearms, like the one used to kill 17 people at their school. "
638,"The State of Mississippi on Wednesday awarded a tax break worth up to $6 million for a hotel project involving the Trump family business, a public subsidy that could indirectly benefit President Trump. The board of the Mississippi Development Authority approved the so-called tourism tax rebate, which had been requested by the development’s local owners, Dinesh and Suresh Chawla. The Trump Organization will brand and manage the hotel and collect fees from the Chawlas for doing so. The subsidy, to be paid out over a period of many years, is expected to offset nearly a third of the Chawlas’ projected $20 million in costs for building the hotel, which is scheduled to open this fall in Cleveland, Miss. The property, called Scion West End, is to be the first in a new line of four-star Scion hotels that the Trump Organization announced late in the 2016 presidential campaign. The state’s approval of the tax rebate is the culmination of more than two years of efforts by the Chawlas that predate their partnership with the Trumps, according to emails obtained by The New York Times through a public records request. After the Chawlas announced plans last June to team up with the Trumps, Suresh Chawla alerted an array of personal contacts and state and local officials, including an aide to Mississippi’s governor, Phil Bryant, in emails with the subject line “Trump Hotels Coming to the Mississippi Delta.” In December, the Chawlas formally applied for the tax rebate from the state development agency, which is led by Glenn McCullough Jr., an appointee of Mr. Bryant, both of whom are supportive of President Trump. In an email on Wednesday, Dinesh Chawla said he and his brother were pleased by the approval, though they said the development agency had not notified them of it. The development agency declined to comment. The decision to approve the request was not unusual for the agency, which evaluates applications for the tourism rebate program based on set criteria and has granted similar subsidies to other hotels. The award renews legal questions about a Trump-affiliated property receiving benefits from a state or local government. Ethics watchdogs and the president’s critics say the Mississippi tax break would benefit the president, albeit indirectly, because he continues to own the Trump Organization through a trust. Such benefits, they say, could violate the Constitution’s emoluments clauses, which essentially prohibit the president from accepting certain gifts from foreign or domestic governments. Other legal experts, however, contend that domestic emoluments are allowable so long as Mr. Trump does not earn them from his service as president. Dinesh Chawla said in an email to The Times earlier this month that the Trump Organization had played no role in the rebate application and that the Trumps and the Chawlas had agreed that any rebate would not figure into fees paid to the Trumps. Mr. Chawla said he and his brother had sought the rebate to “improve our cash flow.” A spokesman for the Mississippi development agency said the Trump name was not mentioned anywhere in the Chawlas’ application. The development agency’s tourism rebate program is part of an effort to draw tourists to Mississippi and help the local economy. According to the development agency, the program allows a developer to recoup some of the sales taxes collected on a property to “reimburse the applicant for eligible costs incurred during the project’s construction.” The agency said earlier this month that 23 other tourism rebate applications had been approved under the program, including 10 for hotels. The partnership between the Chawlas and the Trumps materialized after Mr. Bryant, a Republican, introduced members of the two families during the 2016 presidential campaign. The governor and the Chawlas have known each other for years. Clay Chandler, a spokesman for Mr. Bryant, said earlier this month that the Chawlas had followed the same procedure as other applicants for the tax rebate. “State law guides the application process, and state law alone will determine if any application is approved,” he said. In his earlier email to The Times, Dinesh Chawla said that “no contact with Governor Bryant or his executive staff has been made regarding the project, other than our general discussion about what the project contains.” Still, the Chawlas contacted state officials for more than two years, seeking to get the project on their radar, according to the emails obtained through a public records request. “I would really appreciate your efforts in advocating this idea with the Governor’s office, MDA executive director Glenn McCullough, and MDA staff and others,” Suresh Chawla wrote in a July 2015 email to Robert Morgan, an aide to Mr. Bryant, using the acronym for the development agency. “We did not ask for any favors, other than an honest referral,” Dinesh Chawla said in his email to The Times on Wednesday. “We wanted to introduce it to the state hierarchy, because in our state, a $20 million project is of significant note.” Last summer, Suresh Chawla alerted Mr. Morgan to the partnership with the Trumps within minutes of its being announced, sending him and other officials a news release about the deal. When Mr. Morgan received the message, he shared the news release with three other members of Mr. Bryant’s administration, including his chief of staff, along with an official at the development agency. Dinesh Chawla said that he and his brother had emailed more than 1,000 people with the news of the deal. “It had nothing to do with the people in high offices,” he said. "

640,"WASHINGTON — An anguished father mourning his 18-year-old daughter vented his anger and pleaded for safer schools. A fear-stricken student who watched classmates die last week wept openly as he called for banning assault weapons. A mother who lost her 6-year-old son in a school shooting just over five years ago warned that more parents would lose their children if President Trump did not act, adding, “Don’t let that happen on your watch.” One by one at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, survivors of school shootings and family members of victims shared their stories and their calls to action. The extraordinary public exchange with the president gave voice to an intensely emotional debate over how to respond to the latest gun massacre in an American school. A week after a gunman opened fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and prompting a rash of student-driven lobbying for new gun restrictions, Mr. Trump met for more than an hour with grieving people in search of solutions. News cameras captured the unusual listening session, revealing an emotional give-and-take between a president and private citizens that is typically shielded from public view. Mr. Trump used the event to pitch his own ideas about how to prevent such debacles in the future, polling the group about whether they supported allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed weapons, an idea he said could have halted the carnage in Parkland. “That coach was very brave, saved a lot of lives, I suspect,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to Aaron Feis, a coach at Stoneman Douglas who reportedly died using his body as a shield to protect students. “But if he had a firearm, he wouldn’t have had to run, he would have shot and that would have been the end of it.” Mr. Trump said he would press to strengthen background checks for people buying guns and press for enhanced mental health measures. “We’re going to go very strongly into age — age of purchase,” he added, appearing to refer to a proposal to set an age threshold for buying certain weapons, including the AR-15. But in a session that began as a subdued conversation and sometimes descended into tears and shouting, policy proposals were overshadowed by raw expressions of fear, anger and sorrow. “We’re here because my daughter has no voice — she was murdered last week, and she was taken from us, shot nine times,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was one of the 17 killed in Parkland. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here, with this administration and me, because I’m not going to sleep until it’s fixed.” Most of the students and parents invited from the Florida school appeared to support Mr. Trump, many of them prefacing their comments with praise for his leadership. But even fans of the president vented anger and desperation, laying the challenge of responding to the tragedy at his feet. “It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it — and I’m pissed,” said Mr. Pollack, the only parent of a child killed in Parkland who was at the session, raising his voice as he looked at Mr. Trump. “Because my daughter, I’m not going to see again.” Samuel Zeif, 18, told of texting his parents and brothers from the second floor of Stoneman Douglas, believing that he would be killed, and he dissolved into tears as he begged the president, “Let’s never let this happen again — please, please.” “I don’t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war, an A-R,” Mr. Zeif said, referring to the AR-15 rifle. “How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon? How do we not stop this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening.” Mr. Trump, who has often struggled to express empathy in the face of tragedy, appeared moved by the personal stories, even as he asked repeatedly whether anyone in the ornate room at the White House knew how such horrors could be prevented. “I know you’ve been through a lot — most of you have been through a lot more than you ever thought possible,” Mr. Trump said, seated in a circle with students and parents. “All I can say is that we’re fighting hard for you, and we will not stop.” “I grieve for you,” Mr. Trump added. “To me, there could be nothing worse than what you’ve gone through.” During the session, Mr. Trump held a card that appeared to remind him of the basics of compassion when dealing with grieving survivors. “What would you most want me to know about your experience?” read one handwritten note on the card, captured in photographs of the event. “I hear you,” read another. Mr. Pollack said he did not favor adopting new gun restrictions, but pleaded for Democrats and Republicans to come together to create new school safety measures. “It’s not about gun laws right now — that’s another fight, another battle,” he said. “We need our children safe.” Yet the subtext of the discussion was a contentious debate over gun restrictions and an all-too-familiar cycle of outrage, activism and promises of action, and then the inevitable inertia of Washington because of the opposition by the National Rifle Association and its allies. Mr. Trump, a strident defender of gun rights who ran for office with the strong backing of the N.R.A., has come under immense pressure to endorse new gun limits after the Parkland massacre. The mass shooting has prompted a wave of youth activism that has reverberated from South Florida to Washington, where hundreds of students gathered outside the White House gates on Wednesday before the listening session, chanting, “Enough is enough!” and, “Hands up! — Don’t shoot!” Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, said it was futile to believe Congress would act on new policies. “We tried this legislative approach,” said Mr. Barden, a founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit advocacy group created after the massacre. “I’ve been in this building before many times, wringing our hands, pleading with legislators — ‘What can we do?’ — until we finally said we have to go home and do this ourselves.” He and Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan at Sandy Hook, pressed Mr. Trump to consider prevention programs that train schools and educators to identify students in crisis and intervene before they attempt to harm themselves or others. “Rather than arm them with a firearm,” Ms. Hockley said of teachers, “I would rather arm them with the knowledge of how to prevent these acts from happening in the first place.” One of Mr. Pollack’s sons, Hunter, said he would prefer that educators carried weapons, arguing that more firearms on campus would lead to safer schools. Yet it was the emotional appeals that appeared to have more influence on Mr. Trump. Mr. Barden pulled out a photograph of his son showing a gaptoothed grin. Mr. Pollack spoke movingly of “my beautiful daughter I’m never going to see again.” Ms. Hockley implored the president not to allow another massacre of children on his watch, saying: “Consider your own children. You don’t want to be me — no parent does.” As he ended the session, Mr. Trump promised their stories would not go unheard or unaddressed. “Thank you for pouring out your hearts,” he said. “Because the world is watching, and we’re going to come up with a solution.” "

642,"LONDON — A court in Bahrain sentenced a prominent democracy advocate on Wednesday to five years in prison for tweets about abuses in prisons and the Saudi-led war in Yemen, continuing the crackdown that crushed the Arab Spring uprising there seven years ago. The sentencing of the advocate, Nabeel Rajab, is the latest step in a long crackdown on dissent in Bahrain, a tiny island kingdom that is home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet. Backed by rulers in neighboring Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain’s Sunni Muslim royal family has used tanks, riot police officers, sweeping arrests and tight censorship to thwart demands for democracy among the Shiite Muslim majority, and the resulting conflict has inflamed sectarian tensions around the region. The repression has presented Washington with one of the most awkward conflicts between its professions of support for human rights and its military commitments in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Rajab, 53, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, is a leader of the pro-democracy movement that came to life in 2011, during the Arab Spring uprisings across the region. He was sentenced to three years in jail the next year, on charges of inciting protests against the government, and he has spent much of the intervening time in and out of prison on a series of charges related to his criticism of the monarchy. He is already serving a two-year sentence handed down in July for comments he made in television interviews, and faces more charges related to an Op-Ed published in The New York Times in 2016, “Letter From a Bahraini Jail.” In it, Mr. Rajab recounted a recent meeting with John Kerry, then the secretary of state “I would like to ask Mr. Kerry now: Is this the kind of ally America wants?” he wrote. “The kind that punishes its people for thinking, that prevents its citizens from exercising their basic rights?” Mr. Rajab was sentenced on Wednesday for statements he posted on Twitter in 2015. He was charged with “insulting national institutions” for accusing the authorities of torture at Jaw Prison, and sharing a report by Human Rights Watch that detailed conditions at the prison. He was charged with “insulting a neighboring country” for criticizing Saudi Arabia’s war against an Iranian-allied faction in Yemen, and he was accused of spreading false or malicious news during wartime because he faulted Bahrain for its participation in the Saudi-led coalition bombing Yemen. As those charges were pending, Mr. Rajab reiterated his criticisms last May in another opinion column in The New York Times appealing to President Trump on the eve of his trip to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. “It fills me with shame that my country, Bahrain, is bombing Yemen, with United States support,” Mr. Rajab wrote, adding, “What I have endured is a small fraction of what the people of Yemen have suffered, largely because of the military intervention of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and their allies.” "
643,"Few people expected that the Pennsylvania congressional map, which the state Supreme Court ordered redrawn to undo Republican gerrymandering, would prove to be as favorable to Democrats as the one adopted by the court on Monday. Perhaps the easiest way to convey the cause for surprise: The new map is better for Democrats — by nearly every measure — than the maps that Democrats themselves proposed. How could that be? It is hard to explain.  Perhaps all four Democratic map proposals reflected an earnest effort to reach a compromise with Republicans. The more likely explanation is that Democrats did not believe it was realistic to demand such a favorable map, since it would require a series of Democratic-leaning choices. And the court order did not specify that the maps should aim for partisan balance, which might have justified a more Democratic map. Apparently, a more favorable map was quite realistic; after all, it is now a reality, one that gives a significant boost to Democratic hopes of retaking the House. It’s a reality because the newly adopted map consistently makes subtle choices that nudge districts in the direction of Democrats. Many of those choices are easy to spot on a map. Every potentially competitive Republican-held district juts out to add Democratic areas, like adding York to the 10th District, Lansdale to the First District, Reading to the Sixth District, Stroudsburg to the Seventh District, South Philadelphia to the Fifth District, or Mount Lebanon and Penn Hills to the 17th.

On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah expressed disgust with commentators on Fox News who suggested that gun control measures would not prevent school shootings. Noah mocked them for suggesting more creative — and, he thought, harebrained — solutions. On Tuesday’s “Late Show,” Colbert also took a moment to highlight the most recent allegations of infidelity that have emerged against President Trump. The New Yorker recently published a report that the onetime Playboy model Karen McDougal had engaged in an affair with Trump in 2006, the same year he allegedly started an affair with the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Colbert was particularly amused that The National Enquirer reportedly paid $150,000 for the story, but decided not to run it. "
646,"In January, you became the first woman nominated for an Oscar for best cinematography, for your work on “Mudbound.” Did you know that it was going to be a male-dominated profession when you first started out? I don’t know that I was entirely conscious of it, because I started in photography, which is closer to 50-50. There’s this idea that there are more female cinematographers now because cameras are lighter, which is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. Cinematography speaks to everything that women do inherently well: It’s multitasking, it’s empathy and it’s channeling visuals into human emotion. Little by little, I realized that I was an anomaly, but I tried not to focus on it, or to, at least, see it as a way to stand out in the crowd and bring something to the table that most people don’t. What movies did you first see that made you think about cinematography? I gravitate much more toward realism realism in the work that I do, but magical realism got me hooked on film. I think it was my first time realizing that there was something besides popcorn movies. I caught the Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro bug: “Delicatessen,” “The City of Lost Children.” Wong Kar-wai’s “Chungking Express,” “Happy Together” and “Fallen Angels.” Emir Kusturica’s “Time of the Gypsies” and “Black Cat, White Cat.” It was a reflection of the literature I liked: Gabriel García Márquez and Salman Rushdie. “Mudbound” feels like a very timely movie, with its focus on racism and rural poverty. When I read the script, Obama was president. We didn’t ever think in a million years Trump would get elected. I thought it was timeless, but I didn’t realize it would be as timely as it ultimately proved to be. What were your inspirations for shooting it? The Farm Security Administration photographers were a huge part of my inspiration for “Mudbound.” I was always very much interested in photojournalistic work — people like Robert Capa, James Nachtwey, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks. It was always about capturing human emotion in a very real, authentic way. "

648,"Two of the most important facts about the global economy over the last decade are these: A giant financial crisis led to mass unemployment in many countries and years of disappointing growth. And despite a seeming barrage of technological innovation, productivity growth has been the weakest in decades. Maybe it’s not a coincidence. That is the provocative conclusion of new research from the McKinsey Global Institute, the in-house think tank of the consulting giant, that suggests we should change how we think about the advancements that make society richer over time. It implies that as the economy returns to full employment, an outburst of faster growth in productivity — and hence economic growth — is a real possibility.            This idea should excite both conservatives and liberals. It suggests that the Trump administration’s ambitions for faster growth driven by rising productivity aren’t as outlandish as warier forecasters have argued. And it tends to back arguments by liberal-leaning commentators that the Federal Reserve ought to move cautiously in raising interest rates, in hope that the economy will more fully repair itself from damage caused by the 2008 recession and its aftermath. For years, McKinsey researchers have tried to understand what drives productivity growth from the ground up. They’ve studied how innovations that enable a company to make more goods and services per hour of labor spread across the economy. The latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy — what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it — but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don’t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials,  forces them to think creatively about how to do so.

650,"SYDNEY, Australia — President Trump’s infamous first phone call with Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was classic Trump: demanding, transactional and eager to reject established agreements. But when the two leaders meet in Washington on Friday, that call will be treated as dead and gone. Officials and experts argue that Mr. Trump and Mr. Turnbull have become closer over the past year — especially as the United States seeks to play a larger role in the region, countering China and North Korea. “Strategically, we’re very aligned,” said Amy Searight, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The alliance is becoming more and more important as an anchor for regional stability.” Even as Mr. Trump’s provocative approach to foreign affairs has rattled some of America’s traditional alliances, Australia has adapted and found points of connection. Here’s a look at the three most important issues that are reshaping relations between Australia and the United States — and the challenges that both countries face in trying to work through them. Both Australia and the United States published security assessments in the past few months that identified China as a long-term challenge to the world’s established order. No issue has moved as quickly to the top of both countries’ priority lists. China is the linchpin for dealing with North Korea; its Belt and Road initiative aims to reshape infrastructure in much of the world; and in both Australia and the United States, concerns about China’s efforts to infiltrate and manipulate democratic institutions, including universities, have intensified. Officials from both countries are already talking about how to meet the challenge. Australia’s new espionage bill, for example, was drafted with input from American security agencies. China is expected to become even more of a focal point now that Mr. Trump has named the next American ambassador to Australia: Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the head of the United States Pacific Command and a well-known critic of China’s expansion efforts in the South China Sea. “He’s the first serious, heavy-hitting U.S. ambassadorial appointment here since Marshall Green came in 1973,” said James Curran, a history professor at the University of Sydney. “That’s a sign of how seriously Washington regards Australia and its broader Asia strategy.” That’s the question Australia, the United States and much of the world are trying to figure out. And it’s not at all clear that Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Trump agree on the answer. “Where we diverge is on how severe the threat is and how comprehensive our response needs to be,” said Ashley Townshend, a foreign policy expert at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney. In Australia’s rankings of threats to its interests, terrorism still lands higher than China. In the United States, the latest national security plan puts terrorism below countering the Chinese and Russian militaries. “The China hawks have the upper hand in Washington at the moment,” Professor Curran said. What both Canberra and Washington are wondering is: Will Australia, which counts China as its largest trading partner, fall in line? When Mr. Turnbull last met with Mr. Trump, in May in New York, the visit included a big economic boost to the Trump agenda: An Australian businessman, Anthony Pratt, pledged to invest $2 billion in America, primarily in Midwestern manufacturing. Mr. Trump was thrilled enough to give Mr. Pratt a standing ovation. It’s not clear if Mr. Turnbull has anything quite as juicy in tow this time, but he is bringing a large business delegation with him and will meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Experts say the economic focus reflects reality — the U.S.-Australia investment relationship is worth more than $1 trillion — and a recognition of, well, personal politics. “Trump is motivated by obvious transactional wins,” said Mr. Townshend at the United States Studies Center. At the same time, he added, because Mr. Trump is unpopular in Australia, “it plays well for the prime minister to focus on the positive economic and trade aspects of the bilateral relationship, not just on the military.” The big ask, from Australia, Japan and other American allies in the region, involves the trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Trump pulled out of the multinational agreement soon after taking office, dismissing it as a bad deal for Americans, but countries in the region have been moving on anyway and are close to final approval. Australia has been arguing for the United States to rejoin, and some experts expect Mr. Turnbull to ask Mr. Trump, flat-out: What would it take? What concessions would get the United States back on board? Not many experts are expecting an answer. Separate from the Pacific trade deal, Australia, the United States, India and Japan are in the very early phases of talking about a joint regional infrastructure scheme that could become an alternative to China’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative. One big question that will probably be asked on this trip: Would Mr. Trump embrace a building spree to compete with China — or would he see it as not sufficiently “America First”? The issue that set off Mr. Trump in that first phone call — a deal brokered by President Barack Obama to bring refugees from Australia’s offshore detention camps to the United States, in exchange for asylum seekers from Central America who would move to Australia — is on its way to being resolved. More than 200 refugees held by the Australian authorities have since gone to the United States after repeated vetting, without controversy. Central Americans have been appearing in Australia as well, without much fanfare. The original deal promised that the United States would consider taking up to 1,200 refugees from Australian detention centers. Far fewer than that have actually gone, leading to frustration in the detention camps and prompting some human rights advocates to speculate that American and Australian officials are trying to keep the migration flow to a trickle, to avoid a backlash from Mr. Trump. It’s all yet another sign of how, a year after that phone call, the relationship has evolved to account for his volatility. “Australia has learned to deal with Trump one step at a time,” Professor Curran said. “It’s the only way to take a president who remains a work in progress on foreign policy, and who continues to be so erratic and impulsive.” "

652,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • An outcry echoed across the U.S. on Tuesday, as lawmakers were pressed again to take action after a deadly mass shooting. President Trump called for a ban on so-called bump stocks, devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to be fired more quickly, although they weren’t involved in the attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last week. (Watch how bump stocks work.) The president has also signaled that he’s open to legislation to strengthen the national system for background checks, a measure the National Rifle Association also supports. • Nevertheless, gun control activists said they were bracing for another disappointing battle with lawmakers. "
653,"President Trump’s tough talk on trade and the tariffs he recently imposed on imported washing machines and solar panels, as well as the ones he threatened on foreign steel and aluminum, would seem straight out of the populist playbook. But in terms of targeting the real grievances of his popular base, they largely miss the mark. The early history of American populism, culminating in the New Deal, suggests a more productive and less damaging kind of populism. When populism succeeds, it does so not by cosmetic gimmicks but by going after the roots of economic injustice directly. At the 1896 Democratic National Convention, the 36-year-old former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan delivered what became one of the most famous lines of American political oratory: “You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” Bryan’s immediate target was the gold standard, an emblem of the globalization of his day, which he blamed for the economic difficulties of what he called the “toiling masses.” Bryan ran for president that year as the joint candidate of the Democratic Party and of the People’s Party, also known as the Populist Party. The populists of the late 19th century had many grievances, but the flames of their discontent were fanned by opposition to economic globalization. Under the gold standard, markets for money, goods, capital and labor had become intertwined among nations as never before. As John Maynard Keynes would later rue, a well-to-do inhabitant in a major capital city like London “could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.” Global competition also drove American agricultural prices down. And the rules of the gold standard enforced tight money and credit conditions — what we would today call austerity policies. The consequent economic distress among farmers in the South and the West fueled the populist movement. The populists viewed the railroads as well as the financial and commercial interests of the Northeast, the defenders of the gold standard, as their main opponents. Throwing off the shackles of the gold standard and reclaiming national monetary sovereignty became their rallying cry. Populism in the 21st century is as much a reaction to globalization as its late-19th-century version. While the backlash in the United States and Europe differs in specific details, the broad outlines are similar. Large segments of the workers in these advanced economies — older, less-skilled manufacturing employees and the communities they live in — have seen their earnings decline or stagnate and their relative social status take a big hit. These groups see governments as increasingly in the pocket of financial and business elites, the big winners of globalization. The discontent in turn fuels populist leaders who promise to wrest control from faceless global market forces and re-empower the nation-state. "

655,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What it takes to be a whistle-blower. • Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid. • Untangling the productivity mystery. • How Skadden got involved in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up.  Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower. A provision in the Dodd-Frank Act defines a “whistle-blower” as someone who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.” That seems simple enough, but the Securities and Exchange Commission made something of a hash out of the requirement by taking an expansive view in a rule aimed at protecting an employee from retaliation even if the person only reports information internally. In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.’s rule. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition—tell the S.E.C.—Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers. One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don’t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.’s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation. — Peter J. Henning The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139 points in the half-hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. and was up more than 300 points on the day. Then the index sank 455 points in the final 90 minutes to close down 0.67 percent for the day. Why? There didn’t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish. Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday’s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on. While we’re on the Fed minutes, it appears that the central bank’s policymakers did not spend much time discussing an indicator that is flashing a warning sign. The data point in question is the saving rate, which recently sank to a 12-year low. With the rate at 2.4 percent of disposable income, a big drop in the stock market, like the one that occurred earlier this month, could prompt consumers to cut their spending. The Fed’s policymakers did not appear overly worried about the saving rate at their last meeting, which was held before the market’s plunge. The minutes state: — Peter Eavis Qualcomm defied Broadcom’s demand not to raise its takeover bid for NXP on Tuesday by increasing that offer by about 16 percent, to $127.50 a share from $110. Now Broadcom has retaliated. Broadcom shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, to $79. Broadcom’s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm’s shareholders. From the news release: Let’s take a look at the math • Broadcom argues that Qualcomm gave up $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom’s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer. (Of course, other elements of Broadcom’s last bid — the $8 billion breakup fee for antitrust reasons, the ticking fee if a deal takes more than 12 months to close — still stand.) • Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price. • Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn’t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year. The bet on the shareholder meeting Broadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm’s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees. A Qualcomm representative didn’t have an immediate comment. How the shares moved today: Qualcomm’s were down 1.5 percent, while Broadcom’s were up slightly. Shares in NXP — the real winner in this deal saga so far — were essentially unchanged. — Michael de la Merced The deals flyaround • Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason pressed Xerox to pursue alternatives to its complicated deal with Fujifilm. (Reuters) • HNA has borrowed from the private equity firm Pacific Alliance Group, a sign that it may be struggling to raise capital from more traditional sources. (FT) An economy is doing well when companies each year manage to become more productive, or in other words, get more output from their employees and equipment. But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes – and the latest big work on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot’s Neil Irwin does a great job of explaining McKinsey’s main finding: Little in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey’s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond. 1) In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity. In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence. 2) If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries? First, the numbers: From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain’s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow. — Peter Eavis New research posted by France’s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production. This dominance, the paper asserts, could allow the companies to enjoy “monopoly rents,” the term economists use to describe the subsidies companies enjoy if their business is protected in ways that are not available to other firms. David Wessel, writing for Harvard Business Review, also recently took a look at whether dominant companies are holding the economy back. — Peter Eavis The largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place. The new headquarters has yet to be designed, but it is expected, according to Bloomberg, to be between 70 and 75 stories and house 15,000 employees. The current headquarters was designed in the late 1950s for about 3,500 employees, JPMorgan said. During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter. The tower would be the first major project under New York City’s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area. The job recruiting site said Wednesday that it has hired Jim Cox as its C.F.O., as part of a series of high-level executive appointments. Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software. Here’s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor’s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: “We are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.” Glassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications. — Michael de la Merced The giant law firm’s work for the former Trump campaign manager — who has been charged with several criminal acts by Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian election interference — has come into question after a former Skadden associate entered a guilty plea in the investigation.

So kudos to Perry Bacon Jr. for his new FiveThirtyEight piece, “How the media bungled the John Kelly story.” Bacon includes himself — and many others — among those who misjudged the goals of President Trump’s chief of staff, and Bacon tries to understand why. His honesty makes his argument more persuasive. Tax politics. The Republican playbook on taxes looks like this: Package a huge tax cut for the rich with a small tax cut for everyone else, and then criticize Democrats for being against middle-class tax cuts. It’s been a mostly successful strategy, too. In 2008, President Barack Obama finally came up with a successful response. He proposed larger middle-class tax cuts than John McCain, his opponent, and kept bragging about those cuts. By the final weeks of the race, Americans saw Obama as more of a tax cutter than McCain was. Today’s Democrats are at risk of being dragged back into the old politics of tax cuts. Since President Trump’s tax bill passed, Republicans keep talking about the middle-class benefits in the law, and the poll numbers for both Trump and congressional Republicans have risen. Recent television ads in Indiana and Missouri — taken out by the Koch brothers’ advocacy group — are typical. They’re meant to damage those states’ Democratic senators, who are both running for re-election. “Senator Claire McCaskill said she’d support tax cuts for hard-working Missourians,” the narrator in one ad says, “but when she had the chance, she said no, voting against tax cuts for you, standing with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, instead of us.” "
657,"Hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — young adult immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children — could face possible deportation unless Congress can find a solution in the coming weeks. In September, President Trump announced he would not renew the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, that provides these young people with certain temporary protections. The program is set to expire on March 5. What should Congress do? What should Americans who care about this issue do? In this lesson, students learn more about the immigrants affected by this political standoff; evaluate the policy proposals being debated; and explore ways to have their voices heard on one of the most contentious issues in American politics. _________ Warm Up Barometer or Paired Activity: Share the four statements below with students and ask them to decide whether they agree or disagree with each. You may choose to have them spend a few minutes writing why they agree or disagree as well. Agree or Disagree Statements: • Throughout American history, immigrants have helped make the United States a better, stronger nation.
• New immigrants continue to make the United States a better, stronger nation.
• Undocumented immigrants living in the United States should be allowed to live, work and raise families here, and should only be deported if they commit serious crimes.
• Immigrants who enter or stay in the United States without the appropriate legal documents are breaking the rules. They are not vetted like other immigrants, and they are not waiting in line the way the system requires. If you do this as a barometer activity, post the terms “Strongly Agree” and “Strongly Disagree” at opposite ends of the classroom. Ask students to stand up and move to a spot in the classroom that most aligns with their beliefs about each statement. After you have read a statement and students have taken a stand on the continuum, ask a few volunteers to explain why they decided to stand where they did. If you choose to do this in pairs, have students talk together about their reactions. In both cases, you may want to first set ground rules about the language students should use to ensure that discussion of these issues is respectful. Video: Then, have students watch this brief video featuring immigrants currently protected by DACA. Ask students to write down their reactions and any questions they have. Have the class share. _______ Article and Questions To get a better understanding of the politics surrounding DACA, have students read “What Is DACA? Who Are the Dreamers? Here Are Some Answers,” also available in this PDF (slightly abridged). Here is an excerpt: Ask students to answer the following questions as they read: 1. When was DACA introduced, and what benefits does it provide its participants? 2. Who are the Dreamers? What requirements must they meet to be eligible for DACA? 3. Why did President Trump announce in September he was ending DACA? 4. What concessions do the White House and many Republican lawmakers want in exchange for providing a path to citizenship for DACA beneficiaries? 5. Why are many progressives, immigrant advocates and DACA recipients hoping for a “clean” Dream Act, and what would that law offer the Dreamers? 6. What will happen if Congress cannot come up with a solution and the injunction against the DACA phaseout is lifted by the courts? _________ Activity Quote Sort: In this activity, students work in small groups to sort eight quotes about DACA, included in this PDF, into three piles: Pile 1: Quotes we primarily agree or sympathize with
Pile 2: Quotes we primarily disagree or do not sympathize with
Pile 3: Quotes we cannot agree on Students can take turns reading quotes aloud. After each quote is read, the group discusses which pile the quote belongs in. Here are two examples of quotes included in the PDF: After students sort the quotes, groups can report back to the class about which quotes they tended to agree or disagree with — or which quotes ended up in Pile 3 because they could not reach a consensus. Closing Activity or Exit Ticket: Each student should choose one quote from the previous activity that he or she disagrees with and write a thoughtful response capturing what they think about the DACA program and what Congress should do. You may want to have students write their response as a letter addressed to that individual. _________ The Learning Network will announce its Fifth Annual Student Editorial Contest on Feb. 28, and submissions will be accepted from then until April 5. Students can write editorials about anything, but one topic that certainly seems relevant right now is the issue of DACA and what will happen with the Dreamers. You can consult our 2017 rules to learn more about the contest while waiting for this year’s official announcement. Before they get started, students can do additional research.

658,"The Rev. Billy Graham, a North Carolina farmer’s son who preached to millions in stadium events he called crusades, becoming a pastor to presidents and the nation’s best-known Christian evangelist for more than 60 years, died on Wednesday at his home in Montreat, N.C. He was 99. His death was confirmed by Jeremy Blume, a spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Mr. Graham had dealt with a number of illnesses in his last years, including prostate cancer, hydrocephalus (a buildup of fluid in the brain) and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Graham spread his influence across the country and around the world through a combination of religious conviction, commanding stage presence and shrewd use of radio, television and advanced communication technologies. A central achievement was his encouraging evangelical Protestants to regain the social influence they had once wielded, reversing a retreat from public life that had begun when their efforts to challenge evolution theory were defeated in the Scopes trial in 1925. But in his later years, Mr. Graham kept his distance from the evangelical political movement he had helped engender, refusing to endorse candidates and avoiding the volatile issues dear to religious conservatives. “If I get on these other subjects, it divides the audience on an issue that is not the issue I’m promoting,” he said in an interview at his home in North Carolina in 2005 while preparing for his last American crusade, in New York City. “I’m just promoting the Gospel.” "
659,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It is usually jazz that plays in the background at Eso Won Books, a cherished independent bookseller in Los Angeles that for almost three decades has catered to African-American readers, but sometimes it is David Bowie, Nirvana or just really loud rock music. James Fugate came to Los Angeles from Detroit in the late 1980s, and after a short time running the bookstore at Compton College, he and his partners opened their own store in South Los Angeles. The bookstore has been open nearly every day since — only once or twice, in Mr. Fugate’s memory, has it closed. Once, he said, was in 2006, when Barack Obama, then a senator, came to town for a book signing and the crowds were too large for his shop to accommodate. February is Black History Month, and there are still events to catch all over the city — at the Los Angeles Public Library, which is hosting art exhibitions, dance performances and a genealogy workshop; at the California African-American Museum; and the Aquarium of the Pacific, which is hosting a festival this weekend. (For listings of events, click here and here.) And at Eso Won Books, whose space has long been a gathering place for black intellectual life in the Leimert Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles, every month is Black History Month. Two presidents have visited — Mr. Obama and Bill Clinton — and Ta-Nehisi Coates has called Eso Won his favorite bookstore in the world. These days the store’s best-selling book is “When They Call You a Terrorist,” by Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter. “Fire and Fury,” the inside look at the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, has also been a big seller. Yet even as black heritage is being celebrated, there are persistent anxieties over demographic shifts that in recent decades has seen South Los Angeles — although not Leimert Park itself — tilt from a predominantly black area to one dominated by Latinos. “Anyone that walks through our doors, we are going to help them,” said Mr. Fugate, who owns the store with his partner, Tom Hamilton. “If they are Hispanic, and they need something, a book we don’t carry, yeah we’ll be happy to order it for them.” The same goes, he said, for the white woman who visits with a list of mystery books.

661,"There are two Russian scandals connected to the 2016 campaign. One deserves the attention that it’s getting. The other is closer to — what’s the term I’m looking for? — fake news. The real scandal involves the Russian hacking operation against the Democratic National Committee. This was a genuine crime, a meaningful theft, which led to a series of leaks that were touted by the Republican nominee for president often enough that we can assume that Donald Trump, at least, thought they contributed something to his victory. The fact that members of his family and inner circle were willing and eager to meet with Russians promising hacked emails, the pattern of lies and obfuscation from the president and his team thereafter, and the general miasma of Russian corruption hanging around Trump campaign staff — all of this more than justifies Robert Mueller’s investigation, and depending on what his team ultimately reports it might even justify impeachment. But alongside and around this real scandal you have the other Russian efforts to influence the election and its aftermath, the outlines of which have been apparent for some time, but which have earned a new wave of agitated attention thanks to Mueller’s battery of indictments against a Russian troll farm and the various goblins, kobolds and boggarts it employed. Their efforts added up to a lot of social media activity and a few events in meatspace, in which the Russians had the clever idea to organize demonstrators on both sides of our great American divide. Memes were distributed, millions of dollars spent, fake accounts employed — all to encourage not just the specific political goal of elevating Trump (and Bernie Sanders) and discrediting both party establishments, but the broader ambition of widening our internal fissures, inflaming our debates, making our imperium more ungovernable at home and thus weaker on the global stage. Such conduct is certainly worthy of indictment, legal and rhetorical. What it is not worth is paranoia and hysteria, analogies to Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11 attacks, and an “America under attack”/“hacking our democracy” panic that give the Russian trolls far too much credit for cleverness and influence and practical success. Because on the evidence we have, nothing they did particularly mattered. The D.N.C. hack was genuinely important because it involved a real theft and introduced a variable into the campaign that would not otherwise have been present. But the rest of the Russian effort did not introduce anything to the American system that isn’t already present; it just reproduced, often in lousy or ludicrous counterfeits, the arguments and images and rhetorical tropes that we already hurl at one another every day.

In this edition: Pyeongchang’s environmental legacy, an interview with a Trump adviser who resigned last week and a look at climate education in the United States. Last month, we told you about how climate change may limit the available sites for future Winter Olympics. The organizers of the Pyeongchang Games say they want to do their part to limit their impact on global warming. That raises a question: How sustainable are the Olympics? The Pyeongchang organizing committee estimates the Games will generate 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, of which roughly a third will come from transporting athletes and spectators to South Korea and housing them. The emissions total is a bit more than Barbados produces in a year. The organizers are raising funds to buy carbon offsets, but how much they secure won’t be finalized until the end of the month. "
663,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday enthusiastically embraced a National Rifle Association position to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools against mass shootings like the one last week. Mr. Trump, who said the armed teachers should receive extra pay as an incentive, promoted his idea as demands for stronger gun control intensified across the country. “You give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free, you have now made the school into a hardened target,” Mr. Trump said. The president estimated that 10 percent to 40 percent of school employees would be qualified to handle a weapon — he offered no data for the claim — and said he would devote federal money to training them. Mr. Trump has cycled through a number of proposals — including some gun limits deemed unacceptable by the N.R.A. — in the days since the rampage killed 14 students and three adults last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. On Thursday, he returned to an idea championed by the gun rights group. “I don’t want teachers to have guns, I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns — if they really have that aptitude,” Mr. Trump said during his second White House meeting in two days to discuss how to respond to the latest school shooting in the United States. He promoted the idea even as a sheriff’s deputy who had been the only armed guard at the high school resigned on Thursday after surveillance video showed that he never tried to enter the school to confront the shooter. Tim Burton, a Coral Springs police officer assigned to a nearby elementary school who responded to the shooting, said in an interview on Wednesday that he had seen the deputy, Scot Peterson, in a school parking lot, “seeking cover behind a concrete column leading to a stairwell.” "
664,"President Trump’s nominee to lead the Indian Health Service has withdrawn his name from consideration for the position, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Humans Services said Wednesday. The withdrawal of the nominee, Robert Weaver, follows Wall Street Journal reports that said he had inaccurately represented his qualifications to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs after his nomination in October. Mr. Weaver joins a growing list of Trump nominees who have withdrawn from consideration after questions arose about their fitness for their assigned posts. Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico and the vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, said in a statement that the move seemed “appropriate given the serious questions recently raised about his suitability to lead a vitally important health agency.” Mr. Udall has not yet received a formal notice of the withdrawal. The Indian Health Service could not immediately be reached for comment. Neither could Mr. Weaver. According to The Journal, Mr. Weaver, a member of the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma, claimed that he had previously held a supervisory position at St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Joplin, Mo. But former hospital officials said that they did not recognize his name, The Journal said, and that they believed Mr. Weaver’s role had involved entry-level duties, such as registering patients. The Journal later reported that Mr. Weaver, who had asserted his financial management skills to the Senate committee, had failed to perform important financial duties in a recent position. The Indian Health Service, a branch of the Department for Health and Human Services, provides care for 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in 36 states. The agency, tasked with providing health services to some of the nation’s most rural regions, has long been plagued by financial and leadership troubles. A 2016 inspection by the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that staffing shortages at some Indian Health Service hospitals “sometimes force the hospital to turn patients away” and affect the ability of the hospitals to “ensure a sanitary environment.” In a statement Wednesday night, Mr. Udall urged the Trump administration to conduct a more comprehensive review of its next nominee to lead the agency. “Now the Trump administration must honor its trust responsibilities to American Indians and Alaska Natives and nominate — and fully vet — a director with the strongest possible combination of leadership and fiduciary skills as well as experience running a large public health system,” Mr. Udall’s statement said. “I urge the administration to work to prioritize upholding the government-to-government relationship by seeking tribal input as it begins the process of selecting a replacement nominee,” it continued. “Indian Country deserves better.” The Indian Health Service has not had a permanent leader since 2015.

667,"CHESTER, Ill. — Randy Clover is something of an anomaly — the president of a union local here that represents Illinois state employees, and a Republican precinct leader who voted for President Trump. But he has no doubt about what will be at stake next week at the Supreme Court: the financial and political clout of one of organized labor’s last strongholds. The court will hear arguments on Monday about whether the government employees represented by Mr. Clover’s union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, must pay the union a fee for representing them in collective bargaining. Conservative groups, supported by the Trump administration, say the First Amendment bars forcing government workers from having to pay anything, and the court has sent strong signals that it agrees with that argument. If it does, unions like Mr. Clover’s stand to lose fees not only from workers who object to the positions they take in negotiations but also from anyone who chooses not to join a union but benefits from its efforts. To hear Mr. Clover tell it, the case is the culmination of a decades-long assault against the labor movement. “The case was started by the governor to destroy unions,” Mr. Clover said, referring to Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who has been at war with Illinois’s public-sector unions. “It’s trying to diminish the protections that unions have for their members.” A ruling against public unions is unlikely to have a direct impact on unionized employees of private businesses, because the First Amendment restricts government action and not private conduct. But unions now represent only 6.5 percent of private sector employees, down from the upper teens in the early 1980s, and most of the labor movement’s strength these days is in the public sector. Groups financed by conservative donors have worked hard to weaken public unions, and denying them the ability to impose mandatory fees on workers has been a long-sought goal. The argument almost succeeded in 2016, when the Supreme Court seemed poised to rule that the fees were unconstitutional. But Justice Antonin Scalia died not long after the earlier case was argued, and it ended in a 4-to-4 deadlock. The new case, which had been filed in 2015, was waiting in the wings and soon reached the Supreme Court. By the time the justices agreed to hear it, Mr. Rauner’s claims had been dismissed, and the case is now being pursued by Mark Janus, a child support specialist for the State of Illinois. The Supreme Court is back to full strength with Mr. Trump’s appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, and most observers believe the new justice will join the court’s other conservatives to deliver a decision that will hurt public unions. Mr. Janus’s lawyers said the case is about freedom of speech and association. The activities of public unions are akin to lobbying, they said, and so are by their nature political. Forcing unwilling workers to pay for such activities violates the First Amendment, they added, by compelling them to support messages with which they disagree. “We argue that you shouldn’t have to check your First Amendment rights at the door when you take a government job,” said Jacob H. Huebert, a lawyer with Liberty Justice Center, a conservative litigation group. Mr. Clover and Mr. Janus are both represented by Council 31 of the union. But Mr. Janus, who works at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services in Springfield, objects to paying what the union calls “fair share fees” and others call “agency fees.” “I was forced to pay these fees,” Mr. Janus said. “Nobody asked me.” He added that he disagrees with stances taken by the union. “They use that money in these agency fees to support their different causes and views,” he said. Two of the biggest employers here in Chester are run by the state, and together they employ about 1,400 union workers. Mr. Clover, a blunt and burly 54-year-old who works at a state mental health facility, represents more than 400 of them. Another thousand or so work at a state prison. If the Supreme Court rules against his union, Mr. Clover said, its finances would suffer and its influence would drop. In time, he said, his members’ incomes would fall, and local businesses would suffer. “It probably would devastate this place right here,” he said, gesturing toward the buffet line at Reids’ Harvest House, a homey restaurant that serves filling meals. More than 20 states let public unions charge nonmembers fees for work on their behalf. But unions can survive without the fees, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote in a brief for the Trump administration. “Despite the absence of agency fees, nearly a million federal employees — more than 27 percent of the federal work force — are union members,” Mr. Francisco wrote. Mr. Clover, a Republican precinct committeeman in nearby Kinkaid Township, voted for Mr. Trump and said he was puzzled by the administration’s position in the case, which he believes is aimed at undermining his union’s effectiveness. “The union’s leadership tries to better the workplace for men and women trying to do their jobs,” he said. “But, unfortunately, I’ve seen the attack of the richer people trying to control everything.” To decide against the union, the Supreme Court will have to overrule a 40-year-old precedent, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. The decision drew a distinction between forced payments for a union’s purely political activities, which it held were forbidden by the First Amendment, and ones for more conventional union work, like bargaining, contract administration and representation of workers in grievance proceedings. “To compel employees financially to support their collective-bargaining representative has an impact upon their First Amendment interests,” Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority. But, he wrote, “such interference as exists is constitutionally justified” to ensure “labor peace” and to thwart “free riders.” In more recent decisions, the Supreme Court has twice suggested that the line drawn in the Abood decision is flawed and that the First Amendment bars the compelled payments for any activity by public unions. “Because a public-sector union takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority in 2012 in one of the cases, “the compulsory fees constitute a form of compelled speech and association that imposes a significant impingement on First Amendment rights.” Lawyers for the union have urged the Supreme Court to reaffirm the Abood decision and to bar “free riders.” But Mr. Janus’s lawyers said that phrase had things backward. “An accurate term,” they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, “would be ‘forced riders,’ as nonmembers are being forced by the government to travel with a mandatory union advocate to policy destinations they may not wish to reach.” Mr. Clover said his union had done invaluable work, notably in ensuring workers’ safety. He gave an example from his workplace, a maximum-security facility that houses mentally ill people caught up in the criminal justice system. “The only thing we have is our hands to protect ourselves,” he said, “and we have handcuffs we can put on an individual if they are so out of control you cannot control them without somebody facing injury.” When the state tried to ban the use of handcuffs to transport patients, Mr. Clover said, “the union went to battle for us.” The handcuffs stayed. Mr. Janus’s lawyers said that those kinds of negotiations amount to lobbying on questions of public policy and that unwilling workers should not be made to subsidize it. “Mark Janus and at least five million people in 22 states like him are forced to pay union fees out of every paycheck as a condition of their employment,” Mr. Huebert said. “That’s a violation of their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association.” "
668,"When a gunman slaughtered 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in 2016, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, described it as a moment of revelation — a tragedy so grave that it helped prompt his decision to seek a second term. A year and a half later, with no gun violence legislation having been enacted in the interim, Mr. Rubio is again at the center of a churning national debate about public safety and gun control. In a state now stricken by a second catastrophic shooting, Mr. Rubio is under intense scrutiny. So far, he has struck an unsteady balance between firmly supporting gun rights and appearing proactive in response to atrocities at home, with decidedly mixed results. In a televised town hall-style meeting on CNN Wednesday night, Mr. Rubio gamely strained to convince grieving parents and students from Parkland, Fla., that they should view him as an ally. He suggested he might back specific new regulations on weaponry, perhaps including a ban on high-capacity magazines, which allow a gunman to fire a huge number of rounds without reloading. But in a lengthy and emotional colloquy with Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Mr. Rubio politely refused to endorse a ban on assault weapons, drawing jeers from the audience and visibly frustrating Mr. Guttenberg. Mr. Rubio leaned further into a different idea on Thursday, saying in an interview that he might file legislation to ban certain large magazines, though he acknowledged that he had yet to settle on a specific proposal or discuss the idea with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. “I hope that we can put together a package that I intend to be in the lead on, together with others,” Mr. Rubio said. "
669,"NEW DELHI — Donald Trump Jr., who has spent the week in India pitching new luxury high-rises that bear his family’s name, took the stage before a crowd of about 200 on Thursday. “Building a Better Mumbai,” the banner behind him proclaimed. “We’re actually delivering true luxury,” Mr. Trump told the guests, who were greeted by a red carpet, lit candles and a jazz band. “We’re actually delivering buildings in the Indian marketplace that you can take out of that marketplace, put in any cosmopolitan of the world and say, ‘This is on par with some of the best.’” The Trump Organization is reaping the windfall from India’s admiration for President Trump. He may have low approval ratings at home, but he appears well liked in a country with one of the fastest-growing populations of millionaires in the world. The Trump brand “spells glamour more than luxury,” said Kalyani Chawla, a brand consultant and former executive at Christian Dior in India who attended the event. “I think it’s all about Donald Trump, honestly,” she said, “any idea of Donald Trump in general, regardless of the fact that even he’s surprised he’s the president of the United States.” But even before the president’s son arrived in India to press the flesh and do the deals, his trip was creating controversy over its potential for blurring the lines between the Trump White House and the Trump Organization. As Mr. Trump hopped from city to city, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, sought assurances from the United States Embassy in Delhi that it was not helping Mr. Trump. And ethics experts seemed unable to overstate the incongruity of a sitting president’s son drumming up business overseas. "
670,"WASHINGTON — Even as he was managing Donald J. Trump’s campaign for president, Paul Manafort lied to banks to secure millions of dollars in cash loans as part of a decade-long money laundering scheme, according to charges unsealed by the special counsel on Thursday. Mr. Manafort exaggerated his income by millions of dollars to take out mortgages on homes in SoHo and the Hamptons that he had purchased years earlier in part with income illegally funneled through offshore bank accounts, according to the indictment. The laundered money — which totaled $30 million — came from Mr. Manafort’s work as a lobbyist and political consultant to Viktor F. Yanukovych, the Russia-aligned former Ukrainian president. But after Mr. Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 and fled to Russia, Mr. Manafort’s income quickly dwindled. The 32-count indictment describes a complex plot that Mr. Manafort then undertook to leverage money from his real estate with the help of his longtime business partner and campaign deputy, Rick Gates. The charges do not involve Mr. Trump or his campaign and are not significantly different from ones filed against the men in October. But they outline new criminal behavior and appear to be the latest attempt by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to pressure Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to cooperate with his inquiry to avoid a lengthy prison sentence. The men have said they have nothing to offer Mr. Mueller on the central question of the investigation: whether any associates of Mr. Trump coordinated with Russia’s attempts to disrupt the 2016 election. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates have pleaded not guilty, and a spokesman for Mr. Manafort denied wrongdoing. “Paul Manafort is innocent of the allegations set out in the newly filed indictments, and he is confident that he will be acquitted of all charges,” the spokesman, Jason Maloni, said in a statement. “The new allegations against Mr. Manafort, once again, have nothing to do with Russia and 2016 election interference/collusion.” "
671,"To the Editor: In the 1950s and ’60s, when the Southern states remained committed to racial segregation, many of us marched and spoke out against this blight on our democracy. But marching wasn’t enough to end this abuse of African-Americans. Nor were court orders sufficient to overcome this national embarrassment. As the Kennedys and Lyndon B. Johnson understood, substantial change would come only with congressional action — not simply through marches and sermons, however essential they may have been, but by changing the laws of the land. The young people who are protesting today are the advanced wave of what must come next: gun control legislation that takes weapons meant for battlefields out of our schools, off the streets and away from disturbed individuals with no respect for human lives. And the way to achieve these legislative advances is through the ballot box. Every reasonable voter in this country should make a candidate’s position on gun control a test of his or her ballot. ROBERT DALLEK, WASHINGTON The writer is the historian and author of presidential biographies. To the Editor: Re “In Halls of Power, Gun Survivors Urge Action” (front page, Feb. 22): President Trump advocates arming some teachers with guns. When the SWAT teams enter the building, how will they know whom to shoot? I foresee a lot of innocent teachers losing their lives simply because they have a gun in their hands. But this is what bothers me even more: Will future teacher hirings be based on whether or not a person is willing to carry a firearm instead of on teaching ability? "
672,"LOS ANGELES — In Hollywood, the run-up to the 90th Academy Awards, which will be held on March 4, has been dominated by the discussion about sexual misconduct and abuse of power. The Golden Globe Awards became a de facto rally for the Time’s Up movement, with actresses wearing black to protest sexual harassment and Oprah Winfrey delivering a scorching speech. The Screen Actors Guild Awards, which had a female-only lineup of presenters, were focused on gender inequality and other social ills. At the Baftas, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, domestic violence activists, inspired by the Time’s Up campaign, swarmed the red carpet. But in this #MeToo era the people behind the Oscar telecast have a message: Our show will be focused on films, not the cultural moment around them. “We want to make it as entertaining as possible — reverential and respectful but also fun and emotional,” said Jennifer Todd, one of the lead producers of the Academy Awards, which will be hosted for the second year in a row by Jimmy Kimmel. “The Oscars should be a spectacle. Fun and funny and great performances.” “It should also be a giant commercial for the movie business, which we all need to keep going,” Ms. Todd said, noting that the show would emphasize the 90th anniversary milestone. Channing Dungey, president of entertainment at ABC, which will broadcast the ceremony live, echoed Ms. Todd in a separate interview. “We certainly want to honor and respect Time’s Up and allow that message to be heard,” Ms. Dungey said. “But we’re trying to make it more planned than spur of the moment — it has its moment and then doesn’t feel like it overshadows the artists and films being honored.” "
673,"What makes teenagers amazing — or infuriating, if you’re in an argument with one — is they don’t know what they’re not supposed to be able to do. They haven’t learned that being smart means being cynical about what you can accomplish. They haven’t been hard-wired with platitudes and euphemisms. They haven’t internalized a list of questions that are too naïve or impolite to ask. At CNN’s town hall on gun violence Wednesday, “Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action,” this resulted in something you rarely see on TV: accountability. A week after 17 people died in a mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., a group of angry, grieving constituents was questioning public officials as if they worked for the public. It’s not unusual for news programming after a tragedy to be cathartic or argumentative — cable news can’t resist emotion and conflict. But this was both at once, and that made it something remarkable. The town hall, moderated by Jake Tapper, was part debate, part memorial (it ended with “Shine,” a song written and sung by students), part public trial for the political and educational system. "

675,"Russian meddling in the politics of the United States and most every other Western country demands a tough response, but it should not come as a surprise. President Vladimir Putin has long believed that such interference is an effective way to assert the Kremlin’s might. And President Trump’s characteristically egocentric reaction, focusing exclusively on how it affects him, is likewise, sadly, in character. What may be most disconcerting in the entire affair is what it says about the state of democracy in the country that is supposed to be the model for the world. Whether the Russian web brigades actually affected the outcome of the presidential election, or any other, is impossible to tell. The fake news, false identities, cyberattacks and other tactics outlined in the Justice Department indictment last week seemed aimed at people who probably already got that sort of ranting from plenty of zany, homegrown sources. But therein lies the true danger: that the polarization in American politics, society and life has become so yawning that people on the far right, and to some degree on the left, are prepared to accept the most appalling and transparent lies to bolster their beliefs. As Amanda Taub and Max Fisher wrote in “The Interpreter” column in The Times on Sunday, “The false information and political advertisements that the Russians are accused of spreading could ring true only to those already predisposed to suspect the worst.” Not so many years ago, fake quotes like one in which Hillary Clinton praises Shariah law, or reports suggesting that Black Lives Matter activists are killing police officers, would have been dismissed as the rants of sick extremists. That they evidently find credence in at least a part of the population says far more about the state of public discourse than about Russia. We have become almost accustomed to Mr. Trump’s outrageous references to “Crooked Hillary” and all the other innumerable ways he constantly stokes partisan flames. Whether he knowingly colluded with the Russian web campaign is almost beside the point, since he is directly colluding with Russia’s efforts to discredit democracy when he treats the Kremlin’s brazen cybermeddling as a partisan issue and absurdly pins the blame on Barack Obama or Mrs. Clinton. It’s getting worse. Freedom House, an independent democracy watchdog, concluded in its annual report that “democracy faced its most serious crisis in decades in 2017 as its basic tenets — including guarantees of free and fair elections, the rights of minorities, freedom of the press and the rule of law — came under attack around the world.” The United States, it added, “retreated from its traditional role as both a champion and an exemplar of democracy amid an accelerating decline in American political rights and civil liberties.” Mr. Putin and his operatives no doubt take credit for this. Fear and suspicion of liberal democracy runs deep in Russia and in other countries slouching toward authoritarianism. They have a vested interest in making Western democracies appear as flawed, ugly and messy as possible. The Kremlin is not likely to abandon what looks to it like a winning strategy. But blaming Russia for America’s polarization makes as little sense as blaming Latin America for America’s opioid epidemic. We have created the market and the mess, and the Russian troll factory, however mendacious, should be seen not as a cause, but as a loud warning that democracy as we know it, as we have celebrated it for so long, is in peril. "
676,"On Wednesday, after listening to the heart-rending stories of those who lost children and friends in the Parkland school shooting — while holding a cue card with empathetic-sounding phrases — Donald Trump proposed his answer: arming schoolteachers. It says something about the state of our national discourse that this wasn’t even among the vilest, stupidest reactions to the atrocity. No, those honors go to the assertions by many conservative figures that bereaved students were being manipulated by sinister forces, or even that they were paid actors. Still, Trump’s horrible idea, taken straight from the N.R.A. playbook, was deeply revealing — and the revelation goes beyond issues of gun control. What’s going on in America right now isn’t just a culture war. It is, on the part of much of today’s right, a war on the very concept of community, of a society that uses the institution we call government to offer certain basic protections to all its members. Before I get there, let me remind you of the obvious: We know very well how to limit gun violence, and arming civilians isn’t part of the answer. No other advanced nation experiences frequent massacres the way we do. Why? Because they impose background checks for prospective gun owners, limit the prevalence of guns in general and ban assault weapons that allow a killer to shoot dozens of people before he (it’s always a he) can be taken down. And yes, these regulations work. Take the case of Australia, which used to experience occasional American-style gun massacres. After a particularly horrific example in 1996, the government banned assault weapons and bought such weapons back from those who already had them. There have been no massacres since. "
677,"President Trump called again on Thursday for the opening of more mental hospitals to help prevent mass murders like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Yet ramping up institutional care, experts say, likely would not have prevented most of the spree killings regularly making headlines in this country. “We’re going to be talking about mental institutions. And when you have some person like this, you can bring them into a mental institution, and they can see what they can do. But we’ve got to get them out of our communities,” the president said during a meeting at the White House with state and local officials. In the 1960s, states across the country began to close or shrink mental hospitals after a series of court decisions that limited the powers of state and local officials to commit people. The decline continued for decades, in part because of cuts in both state and federal budgets for mental health care. Those institutions housed people with severe mental disorders, like schizophrenia, who were deemed unable to care for themselves. And while spree killers may be angry and emotionally disordered, few have had the sorts of illnesses that would have landed them in hospital custody. The latest school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, 19, was clearly troubled and making threats, and he was stockpiling weapons. But he had no mental diagnosis. He has been described as angry, possibly depressed, perhaps isolated — not so different from millions of other teenagers. "
678,"OXON HILL, Md. — It did not seem like a coincidence that the very first panel of this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference took direct aim at the state of journalism in the United States. The opening session on Thursday, “An Affair to Remember: How the Far Left and the Mainstream Media Got in Bed Together,” began with a YouTube-style mash-up of the year’s biggest media blunders. The audience jeered Joy Behar of “The View” and Jim Acosta of CNN; it whooped at a clip of President Trump thundering at Mr. Acosta, “You are fake news.” This annual gathering is usually a moment to hammer out what divides the fractious conservative movement. What it has revealed so far is what unites it: contempt for “#fakenews” and the journalists that the former Breitbart News writer Ben Shapiro memorably described as “advocates of leftism, masquerading as objective truth-tellers.” Mr. Shapiro, 34, a provocateur with a growing following among millennial conservatives, brought the crowd to its feet when he declared, “The media are lying about you, they are lying about me.” Some attendees turned toward the reporters gathered in the back of a hotel ballroom here and gave them a taunting thumbs down. But Mr. Shapiro was far from the most prominent speaker whose fiery media criticism delighted the conservative faithful. Vice President Mike Pence accused journalists of “fawning” over the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Her sphinx-like appearance beside Mr. Pence at the Winter Olympics in South Korea this month drew wide attention. Some commentators had criticized Mr. Pence for remaining seated when the unified Korean Olympic team marched in the opening ceremony, a snub that they called disrespectful to American allies in South Korea. “For all those in the media who think I should have stood and cheered with the North Koreans, I say the United States of America doesn’t stand with murderous dictatorships; we stand up to murderous dictatorships,” Mr. Pence said, his words nearly drowned out by applause and cheers. Perhaps the most fervent anti-media broadsides came from Dana Loesch, the spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, who used her remarks to accuse news organizations of rooting for gun massacres. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” Ms. Loesch said, eliciting nods and approving shouts. Addressing the reporters in the room, she said:“You guys love it. I’m not saying that you love the tragedy, but I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” The incendiary dig was not much of a surprise at a conference that attracts a wide spectrum of right-wing groups and news outlets, many of which have honed the provocation of liberals into a fine, and sometimes profitable, art. Still, some of Ms. Loesch’s other remarks — reiterating the N.R.A.’s arguments for defending the Second Amendment and calling for more guns in schools — drew a more tepid reaction from the audience, perhaps a sign of how the national outcry after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., has become a backdrop for this week’s gathering. It was her media attacks that played best, like when she said that she needed a security detail to leave the televised CNN town hall with gun violence survivors where she spoke on Wednesday night. “There were people rushing the stage and screaming, ‘Burn her,’” Ms. Loesch said. A CNN spokesman said on Thursday that the network’s security personnel accompanied all the town hall speakers, including Ms. Loesch, from the stage, and that Ms. Loesch also had her own private security. The spokesman did not say whether she had been threatened. After Ms. Loesch’s remarks on Thursday, some journalists chafed at the idea that they were exploiting the deaths of children. “The point of all of this is to say that people in the media aren’t real human beings with souls and families and feelings, which is disgusting,” Elise Foley, a reporter at HuffPost, wrote on Twitter. The scorn toward journalists here reflected genuine concern from some attendees that mainstream news outlets willfully misunderstand conservatives. Several speakers expressed a sense of victimhood, that their beliefs were portrayed by reporters as intolerant or tantamount to bigotry. And there were reminders that the media-as-punching-bag trope among conservatives is a tactic that shows few signs of going away. “They think it’s just because President Trump is being mean to the media and we’re all following Trump,” Mr. Shapiro said from the stage, referring to his followers’ disdain toward the press. “No,” he added, pausing before the punch line. “We didn’t like you guys before.” "
679,"WASHINGTON — The Rev. Billy Graham, the evangelist and presidential pastor who died this week, will become the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, lawmakers announced Thursday. “It’s not his style to have that kind of attention paid to him,” Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for the family, said of Mr. Graham. “But the family and those of us who knew him are very honored by it, particularly given how rare it is for a private citizen to be afforded this honor.” The gesture, which is reserved for the country’s “most eminent citizens,” is authorized by a congressional resolution or approved by congressional leadership once permission is given by the person’s family, according to the Architect of the Capitol. It is generally reserved for presidents, lawmakers and soldiers, who lie in state. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wrote a letter to Mr. Graham’s son, the Rev. Franklin Graham, on Thursday asking that “Americans have this opportunity to pay their respects to Rev. Graham” for his “long and distinguished service to the nation.” Franklin Graham posted on Twitter, saying, “My father would be honored.” Mr. Graham will lie in honor for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Ryan said in a news release. His pine plywood coffin with a wooden cross was made by inmates at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell will hold a bicameral service after the arrival of the coffin. Votes in the House were canceled for the two days Mr. Graham’s body will be in the rotunda, with final votes for the week being held Tuesday, the office of the House majority leader said. "
680,"The White House’s senior adviser on energy and climate change stepped down last week after being denied a full security clearance for smoking marijuana about five years ago. Now he is speaking his mind about the Paris climate agreement that President Trump has disavowed. “I’m going to say something controversial,” the former adviser, George David Banks, said in an interview. “The Paris agreement is a good Republican agreement. It’s everything the Bush administration wanted.” Mr. Banks stood by Mr. Trump’s decision last summer to withdraw the United States from the global accord, despite having urged him behind the scenes to remain in. Since then, a large part of his work as the White House adviser on international energy issues has been to quietly seek ways that the United States might rejoin the deal. That came to an abrupt end last week when Mr. Banks resigned after being told he would not be granted a full security clearance. In a wide-ranging interview days after leaving his position, Mr. Banks spoke about the surprise of being told that the three or four times he had smoked marijuana between 2009 and 2013, which he had self-reported to the F.B.I. in April 2017, were the reason for the security rejection. He also spoke about his efforts to persuade Mr. Trump to remain open-minded about the Paris agreement, and the likelihood of the United States formally rejoining the accord during Mr. Trump’s presidency. “A lot can happen between now and 2020,” Mr. Banks said, referring to the date when countries can formally leave the Paris agreement. He pointed to the president’s recent comment, which he made during a news conference with Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, that “we could conceivably go back in” to the deal. "

The head of the N.R.A., Wayne LaPierre, above, offered a fierce defense of the Second Amendment in his first public remarks since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. He warned against a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms” at a Conservative Political Action Conference gathering in Maryland. President Trump endorsed arming teachers to protect students from school shootings. He said that teachers who were qualified to handle a weapon would get a bonus, and that he would devote federal money to training them. And footage showed that an armed guard at Stoneman Douglas remained outside the building for “upwards of four minutes” during last week’s shooting. We discussed the gun control debate on “The Daily.” ____ "
682,"For nine months in Kandahar, Afghanistan, I went through the same routine every day. I put on my uniform and tied my boots. I put a magazine in my 9-millimeter handgun and locked it in my hip holster. I put a 30-round magazine in my M4 and slung it over my shoulder. If the day included a patrol, I put on my body armor. I usually carried a knife and at least one tourniquet. Every day, our team discussed base security to identify where we were most prone to attack. That was my standard procedure while serving with the United States Army in a combat zone. When I left active duty in 2014, I never expected that those skills would be applicable to my next job, as a high school teacher in San Jose, Calif. But the reality is that much of what I learned in the Army is horrifyingly relevant in the classroom. My school conducted drills similar to those that took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., even before a gunman opened fire last week and killed 17 people. Our first drill, during which staff practiced sheltering students and barricading doors, exposed countless weaknesses, making it obvious to me that we were woefully unprepared to protect our charges. My classroom would be one of the first an attacker coming through the front entrance would see. So I set out to make it a “hard target” — a place that would appear difficult to attack — to deter an intruder. The classroom was big, with doors on opposite ends. I wrestled with the idea of enlisting the help of my maturest students in securing such a large space, ultimately deciding that I would take only volunteers from my upper-class classroom aides. I pondered how to construct impromptu blockades to delay or confuse an attacker. My helpers and I moved the cart of class iPads to where it could be easily pushed in front of the door — an ideal barricade. Still, the large windows extending the length of the room, once a pleasing feature, now looked only like a gaping vulnerability. We covered the windows in butcher block paper to obstruct the view from outside. "
683,"The Learning Network runs challenges for teenagers all year long, but when we announce a new one, it’s always with trepidation. Will it be too hard? Have we been clear enough about what we’re looking for? Will anyone out there actually take the time to do it? Well, in the case of the challenge we announced in December — to connect something you’re studying in school with the world today — we needn’t have worried. Over 1,200 students suggested interesting thematic links between recent Times articles and literary, historical and scientific texts and topics like “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” “Walden,” the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Chandrasekhar Limit and the California gold rush. Some texts came up so often that, if you’re a teacher currently working with any of them, you could do worse than to search this post to find the many and varied ways students see their resonance. “Brave New World,” “Fahrenheit 451,” “The Prince,” “1984,” ""Othello” and “Macbeth” are in that category. Certain issues in the news also appeared in all kinds of contexts. The #MeToo movement reminded students of literature like “Jane Eyre” and “The Handmaid’s Tale,” but one student also thought Newton’s first two laws of motion applied, while another saw an analogy to the rock cycle in geology. Participants discovered that fake news is old news, with clear parallels in the plots of “The Crucible” and “The Great Gatsby.” President Trump was compared to literary characters including Macbeth and Grendel, and his policies were invoked in examining topics as varied as “The Scarlet Letter” and the Indian Removal Act. Below, in alphabetical order, is a list of winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, including full essays by our top eight winners. All told, the list represents the work of 50 students, more than we usually call out in our contests. But not only were there simply that many ideas we wanted to honor, we also think the variety and originality of the choices speak for themselves: Any future student who wonders what school-assigned reading has to do with “the real world” only has to look at this list to see how easy it is to answer that question.

684,"WASHINGTON — Margaret Brennan, the senior foreign affairs correspondent for CBS News, will be the next moderator of “Face the Nation,” the network’s prestige Sunday morning public affairs show and one of the most influential venues in American politics. Her new role, announced by CBS on Thursday, makes Ms. Brennan, 37, the only woman currently serving as a solo anchor of a major Sunday political affairs show. She succeeds John Dickerson, who left “Face the Nation” in January after less than three years to replace Charlie Rose on “CBS This Morning.” Along with mainstays like NBC’s “Meet the Press” and ABC’s “This Week,” “Face the Nation” features interviews with prominent lawmakers and White House officials that often make news, and can forge Washington’s political agenda for the week ahead. For decades, the hosts of these shows have primarily been men. “Meet the Press,” which began in 1947, has had only one female moderator, Martha Rountree, its founding host. Lesley Stahl, now of “60 Minutes,” moderated “Face the Nation” from 1983 to 1991. Christiane Amanpour, now of CNN, moderated ABC’s “This Week” from 2010 to 2011. Martha Raddatz of ABC News was named a co-anchor of “This Week” in 2016, although the program’s branding remains focused on the lead host, George Stephanopoulos. Ms. Brennan, whose debut is set for Sunday, joined CBS News in 2012 after a decade in financial journalism, working as an anchor and correspondent at Bloomberg Television and CNBC. She said in an interview on Thursday that she hoped “Face the Nation” would offer a dose of civility in a highly charged political moment. "
685,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Thursday that a high-ranking official, who many in the South believe orchestrated a deadly attack in 2010, would lead a delegation to Sunday’s Winter Olympics closing ceremony in the South, another sign the two Koreas are trying to work out a road map toward improving ties. The North’s delegation will be led by Kim Yong-chol, a vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee. The eight-member delegation will start a three-day trip on Sunday that will include attending the closing ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korean officials said. Mr. Kim’s trip follows another recent visit to the South by senior North Korean officials. Earlier this month, Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, attended the Games’ opening ceremony and met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. In that meeting she invited Mr. Moon to a summit meeting in the North on behalf of her brother. Also scheduled to attend Sunday’s closing ceremony is President Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who will lead the American delegation. United States officials said Ms. Trump had no plans to meet anyone representing the North. When visiting South Korea earlier this month to attend the Games’ opening ceremony, Vice President Mike Pence had planned to sit down with Kim Yo-jong in a meeting arranged by South Korea, but the North Koreans backed out at the last minute, according to American officials. The North Koreans’ presence at the closing ceremony raises the possibility of a chance encounter between the North’s delegation and Ms. Trump. Mr. Pence and Ms. Kim sat just feet apart in a V.I.P. box at the opening ceremony but they did not acknowledge one another, their frosty attitudes symbolic of the hostile relations between their countries.

Wendy Holdener of the winning team picked up her third medal of the Games and Ramon Zenhausern his second. Norway won the bronze. A United States team without any of its Alpine stars was eliminated by Britain in the round of 16. The old rivals Norway and Sweden headed into the final shooting segment of the men’s biathlon relay locked in a battle for first.  Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden missed just once. But Emil Svendsen of Norway, whose poor shooting at the end dropped Norway from first to fourth four years ago, missed three times. As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth. "

691,"WASHINGTON — As the nation faced another crisis, polls clearly reflected what a significant majority of the public thought should be done. A bipartisan move to draft a legislative response finally gained steam after years of stasis. A stunning breakthrough looked to be at hand. The issue was put to the test in a series of votes on the Senate floor. Backers of the bipartisan compromise showed they could get tantalizingly close to the magic threshold of 60 votes, but still came up short at 54 and the entire effort collapsed in failure. That situation aptly describes what occurred last week when the Senate took on immigration. But it also depicts — down to the 54 votes for a leading bipartisan proposal — what happened the last time the Senate voted on major gun control legislation, in 2013, after the  school shooting in Newtown, Conn. It is also a predictable result if significant gun control legislation emerges in Congress in the aftermath of the school massacre in Parkland, Fla. That prospect underscores the parallels between the two politically divisive issues and the difficulties of enacting meaningful legislation even when a majority in Congress and the public agree. The inability to push legislation over the finish line has lawmakers fed up while feeding public discontent with Washington. “I think people in this country today are very frustrated with gridlock on issues that they believe should be resolvable,” said Senator Susan Collins, a leading Republican centrist from Maine. “We are not talking about dealing with North Korea, which is a really tough issue. We are talking about issues that have reasonable, readily available solutions.” So how is it that proposals with such strong support and seeming momentum can be so quickly derailed? "
692,"SAN JOSE, Calif. — The Census Bureau, charged with counting every person living in the United States in the coming decennial, may never find whoever is living here in this converted garage on the east side of town. The property owner has replaced the garage door with siding, painted it the same beige as the rest of the house, and added a small window and front door. The makeshift remodeling is well camouflaged, but there’s another tell — the sidewalk out front slopes down to the street where there was clearly once a driveway. “There are certain cues we’re looking for,” said Nicholas Almeida, San Jose’s chief service officer. The city knows that thousands of people are living in units like this, technically illegal, with no recognized address. Their hidden households have extra satellite dishes outside, curtains over basement windows, mail slots in garage doors. Setting aside questions of housing code enforcement, San Jose needs the census to find these residents, too, if the city is going to get its full share of the political power and federal resources tied to the national head count. Two years out from the census, cities are scrambling to avert an undercount they fear could be unusually large for reasons both political and practical. Across California, the housing crisis means that even more households are doubling up in existing homes and occupying illegal ones. In Houston, many families remain displaced by Hurricane Harvey. In New York, the city has permitted so much new construction that the Census Bureau — compiling address lists now — may miss thousands of units to be completed between now and 2020. Cities must find all these households before they even get to the second challenge: persuading the people who live in them, many of them immigrants, to participate in the census. "
693,"Six weeks after Deborah Zwaschka-Blansfield had the lower half of her left leg amputated, she received some news from the nursing home where she was recovering: Her insurance would no longer pay, and it was time to move on. The home wanted to release her to a homeless shelter or pay for a week in a motel. “That is not safe for me,” said Ms. Zwaschka-Blansfield, 59, who cannot walk and had hoped to stay in the home, north of Sacramento, until she could do more things for herself — like getting up if she fell. Her experience is becoming increasingly common among the 1.4 million nursing home residents across the country. Discharges and evictions have been the top-ranking category of grievances brought to state long-term care ombudsman programs, the ombudsman agencies say. While nursing homes can discharge residents for a limited set of reasons, legal advocates say that home operators sometimes interpret those reasons in unjustified ways. Often, it’s because the residents’ more lucrative Medicare coverage is ending, which is what Ms. Zwaschka-Blansfield said happened in her case. Many of the residents, unaware of their rights, leave without a challenge. “The nursing homes, they know the system and they really game it to where they maximize their advantage,” said Tony Chicotel, a lawyer at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, a nonprofit group. Complaints about evictions have caught the attention of federal regulators, who are now seeking ways to step up enforcement of the federal laws that protect residents of the nation’s 15,000 nursing homes.

694,"This is the text of a lecture delivered at the University of Michigan on Tuesday. The speech was sponsored by Wallace House. I’d like to express my appreciation for Lynette Clemetson and her team at Knight-Wallace for hosting me in Ann Arbor today. It’s a great honor. I think of Knight-Wallace as a citadel of American journalism. And, Lord knows, we need a few citadels, because journalism today is a profession under several sieges. To name a few: There is the economic siege, particularly the collapse of traditional revenue streams, which has undermined the ability of scores of news organizations to remain financially healthy and invest in the kind of in-depth investigative, enterprise, local and foreign reporting this country so desperately needs. There is a cultural siege, as exemplified by the fact that a growing number of Americans seem to think that if something is reported in the so-called mainstream media, it is ipso facto untrue. There’s a technological siege, which not only has changed the way we work, and distribute our work, but has also created a new ecosystem in which it is increasingly difficult to distinguish fact from opinion, clickbait from substance, and real news from fake. Then — need I even mention it? — there is the president of the United States. We are all familiar with the ways in which Donald Trump’s demagogic assault on the press has already normalized presidential mendacity, mainstreamed “alternative facts,” and desensitized millions of Americans to both. I’ll get to him in a moment. "

Background reading: • The father of a student killed last week at a Florida high school pressed President Trump to act, asking, “How many children have to get shot?” It was one of many dramatic exchanges on Wednesday about gun violence. • The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School lobbied state lawmakers to strengthen gun control, and met resistance. • Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly heckled during a nationally televised forum after they refused to back new gun control measures.

697,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First: What does Mueller know? You should have low expectations for how much new information Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation will still uncover, writes Politico’s Blake Hounshell. No, you should have high expectations, writes Vox’s Matthew Yglesias. A form of flattery. Why are some conservative media figures criticizing survivors of last week’s mass shooting in Florida? Because the students’ activism is powerful and effective, Ana Navarro argues. The students are “not political hacks. Not paid shills. Not indoctrinated. Not character actors,” Navarro writes. “They are young people of character compelled into action by a horrible crime that cost 17 lives.” Medicare for all. A new single-payer health care proposal has just come out, and I think it has a better chance of eventually becoming law — in whole or in part — than Bernie Sanders’s plan. It comes from the Center for American Progress, the influential liberal research group (often known as CAP). The proposal would create a program called Medicare Extra through which any American, regardless of age, could buy health insurance. Before getting into the details, I want to emphasize one political point. A big reason that Democrats have become so focused on single payer — even Democrats who are to the right of Sanders — is the Republican Party’s scorched-earth response to Obamacare. That response has undermined the private-sector expansion of health insurance that was central to Obamacare, as Abby Goodnough just detailed in The Times. "
698,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has decided that it needs no new legal authority from Congress to indefinitely keep American military forces deployed in Syria and Iraq, even in territory that has been cleared of Islamic State fighters, according to Pentagon and State Department officials. In a pair of letters, the officials illuminated the Trump administration’s planning for an open-ended mission of forces in Syria beyond the Islamic State fight. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson foreshadowed the plan in a speech last month, saying that troops will stay in Syria to curb Iran and prevent the Syrian government from reconquering rebel-held areas. Though Mr. Tillerson also cited a need to mop up the remnants of the Islamic State and keep from leaving a vacuum in which the group could regenerate, other administration officials put far greater emphasis on the extremists. In the letters, they said that the continued potential threat from the Islamic State provided a legal rationale for the Trump administration to keep American troops deployed there indefinitely. “Just as when we previously removed U.S. forces prematurely, the group will look to exploit any abatement in pressure to regenerate capabilities and reestablish local control of territory,” wrote David Trachtenberg, the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy. About 2,000 American troops are in Syria, where nearly all the territory once held by the Islamic State has now been liberated. Mr. Tillerson deemed the group “substantially, but not completely defeated,” warning that the insurgents remained a threat. Mr. Trachtenberg wrote the letter to Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who had asked the Trump administration to explain its understanding of its authority to stay on in Syria. The State Department sent him a similar letter, which also argued that international law provided a basis for American forces to remain in Syria — despite the lack of consent from the Syrian government — to protect Iraq and the United States from terrorists. And both letters said American troops may strike at Syrian government or Iranian forces deemed to threaten Americans or Syrian rebel groups that are assisting the United States in fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. “The United States does not seek to fight the government of Syria or Iran or Iranian-supported groups in Iraq or Syria,” wrote Mary K. Waters, the assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs. “However, the United States will not hesitate to use necessary and proportionate force to defend U.S., coalition, or partner forces engaged in operations to defeat ISIS and degrade Al Qaeda.” American troops carried out strikes against forces loyal to President Bashar Assad of Syria several times in 2017 in the name of defending American-supported rebel groups. Especially as a matter of international law, the administration’s theory for why the United States will have authority to keep carrying out such operations indefinitely amounts to “a tenuous legal justification atop of another tenuous legal justification,” said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former Justice Department lawyer in the Bush administration. And in a statement addressing domestic law, Mr. Kaine said the executive branch was stretching its interpretation of its war authority too far. He called on the administration to seek new authorization for any continued, long-term mission in Syria and Iraq — especially “to strike pro-Assad forces in areas devoid of ISIS to protect our Syrian partners who seek Assad’s overthrow.” He also criticized the basis on which the administration ordered strikes on a Syrian government air base last April as punishment for using chemical weapons. At the time, President Trump claimed powers as commander-in-chief to issue the strikes rather than on any theory of congressional authorization. The senator accused Mr. Trump of “acting like a king by unilaterally starting a war.” The executive branch’s core legal theory that it is authorized by Congress to fight the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria was first put forward by the Obama administration in 2014, when ISIS swept out of Syria and began rapidly conquering portions of Iraq. The United States started bombing Islamic State forces to curb their advances. Under both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, the executive branch has argued that the war against the Islamic State is covered by a 2001 law authorizing the use of military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and a 2002 law authorizing the invasion of Iraq. That theory is disputed. While ISIS grew out of an offshoot of Al Qaeda, the two groups by 2014 had split and became warring rivals. Before the rise of ISIS, the Obama administration had deemed the Iraq war over and largely withdrawn American troops. Still, Congress has continued to appropriate funds for the operations, even as it has failed to enact any new or updated war authorization that specifically addresses ISIS. No court has addressed the question of whether the executive branch has legitimate authority from Congress to battle the Islamic State. "
699,"WASHINGTON — For years, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been overlooked in Washington. Overshadowed by more politically powerful law enforcement agencies like the F.B.I., the A.T.F. garnered headlines mostly for notorious episodes, including the deadly 1993 siege in Waco, Tex., and the “Fast and Furious” gunwalking scandal more than a decade later. Now, the A.T.F. is on the verge of a crisis. The agency, which has not grown significantly since its founding in 1973, is about to confront a staffing shortage and is set to lose its tobacco and alcohol enforcement authorities. President Trump has yet to nominate a director to oversee the agency, which has been without permanent leadership for eight of the past 12 years. Amid the dearth of leadership and resources, the White House is pushing the A.T.F. to the forefront of its fight against violent crime. In response to the mass shooting at a Florida high school last week, Mr. Trump, who promised to fight violent criminal gangs and illegal guns — two of the A.T.F.’s key missions — announced that he would be relying on the bureau to regulate so-called bump stock accessories. But it is all but politically impossible for Mr. Trump, who counts the powerful gun lobby among his most ardent supporters, to strengthen the A.T.F. The National Rifle Association has long sought to hobble the agency in an effort to curb its ability to regulate guns, which the gun lobby has traditionally opposed. “Most people in law enforcement know why A.T.F. can’t get a director,” said Michael Bouchard, a former agent and the president of the A.T.F. Association, an independent group that supports current and former bureau officials. “It’s not because of the people. It’s because of the politics.” For decades, the N.R.A. has used its sway in Washington to preserve the A.T.F. in its limited capacity. It has aggressively lobbied against nominated directors and pushed Congress to enact restrictions on how the bureau spends money to curtail its ability to regulate firearms and track gun crimes. One funding provision, for example, forbids the A.T.F. from using electronic databases to trace guns to owners. Instead, the agency relies on a warehouse full of paper records. "
700,"OXON HILL, Md. — The head of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, leveled a searing indictment on Thursday against liberal Democrats, the news media and political opportunists he said were joined together in a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms.” Mr. LaPierre’s remarks, his first since a gunman took the lives of 17 people at a Florida high school last week, seemed aimed at blunting the rising public pressure for stricter gun control. Conservatives, he said, needed to push back even as liberals tried to smear them. “The shameful politicization of tragedy — it’s a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous movement,” he said to a friendly but largely restrained crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “They hate the N.R.A. They hate the Second Amendment. They hate individual freedom.” The solution Mr. LaPierre offered was not to pass new laws but to better enforce the existing background check system and, he said, “harden our schools” with more armed guards. “Evil walks among us,” he added, making a passing reference to “another terrible tragedy” in the Parkland, Fla., school massacre. Mr. LaPierre’s pugnacious appearance appeared to signal a tactical shift for the N.R.A., which had officially remained mostly quiet in the week after the Florida shooting, even as a movement of young people, including survivors of the massacre, made emotional pleas for gun control. The organization typically uses the first few days after an episode of mass gun violence to lie low before it comes out hard in opposition to any new gun control measures. "
701,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Those were the words of the father of a student killed last week at a Florida high school as he pressed President Trump to act. “It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it,” he added during a White House visit on Wednesday. Mr. Trump said that arming educators could be a solution to gun violence. Here are 11 dramatic exchanges about gun control on Wednesday. In Florida, Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly booed during a nationally televised forum at which they refused to back new gun control measures. And student protesters at the Florida Capitol confronted lawmakers, who responded that gun-related legislation could be introduced by Friday. • Polls show strong  support for action on gun control and immigration. That sentiment is not, however, shared by the Republicans who control the government, our chief Washington correspondent says. "
702,"WASHINGTON — A comedian has agreed to tell jokes at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Now the question is whether President Trump will show up to hear the punch lines. Michelle Wolf, a stand-up comic and frequent contributor to “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” will be the featured entertainer at the annual gathering on April 28, the association announced on Thursday, taking on one of the most prominent — and perilous — gigs in comedy. Long a high point of the Washington social calendar, the correspondents’ dinner typically offers journalists and presidents a chance to roast one another on live television in a celebrity-packed ballroom. But Mr. Trump, not one to encourage comity with the White House press corps, skipped last year’s proceedings, the first president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1981. (Mr. Reagan, who had recently survived an assassination attempt, called in from his hospital bed.) And the White House said this week that Mr. Trump had not yet made a decision about this year. Either way, Ms. Wolf, 32, has her work cut out for her. Washington journalists are a notoriously tough crowd; witness the stony silence that met Stephen Colbert after his blistering 2006 monologue about George W. Bush. The comedian Larry Wilmore, who appeared in 2016, prompted controversy when he used a racial slur in his remarks about Barack Obama. The coziness of the event — where reporters hobnob with the politicians they cover — can be awkward, too, leading some journalists to stifle their laughter, lest they be caught on camera appearing too gleeful at the president’s expense. "
703,"As I watched President Trump blathering to a group of governors on Monday about throwing people who have not committed a crime into mental hospitals to prevent mass shootings at schools, I recalled a country where I once lived in which the government had that power — the Soviet Union. From the mid-1960s until the fall of Soviet Communism, the Kremlin employed the notion of “sluggish schizophrenia” — dreamed up by the Mengele-like psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky — to imprison people on the ground that they were on their way to becoming insane. Rejected by most civilized nations as a transparent fraud, sluggish schizophrenia was used against dissidents and other citizens who simply dared to seek exit visas. When I worked in Moscow as a reporter in the mid-1980s, I knew an Estonian man who was committed twice for refusing to enter the Red Army during the war in Afghanistan, an act of sanity. It was a literal Catch-22. Now comes Trump, urging the nation’s governors to return to a time when he said the states could “nab” people and throw them in a padded room because “something was off.” In fact, the law has required court-ratified findings of actual mental illness for involuntary commitment since around 1881, said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor at Columbia University’s medical school. “It was never the case that people could be involuntary committed for being a little odd, or even for that matter thought to be dangerous to other people unless they had evidence of mental illness,” he said. I’m not bringing this up to suggest that Trump is a disciple of Snezhnevsky, despite his bizarre affinity for Kremlin autocracy, or merely to point out that the president was once again making things up. Rather, it is an example of the incoherent, insincere and inadequate ways in which the president and others on the right are suddenly claiming to be dedicated to addressing the nation’s epidemic of gun violence. "
704,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is throwing its weight behind plaintiffs in a sprawling, high-stakes prescription opioids lawsuit in Ohio, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday. Mr. Sessions said that the Justice Department plans to file a so-called statement of interest in the lawsuit, a technique that past administrations have typically reserved for cases that directly affect the federal government’s interests, like diplomacy and national security. The Obama administration had used statements of interest to expand the boundaries of civil rights laws. At a news conference, Mr. Sessions said the lawsuit targeted “opioid manufacturers and distributors for allegedly using false, deceptive and unfair marketing of opioid drugs.” He also announced the creation of a task force to pursue the makers and distributors of prescription opioids and said it will “examine existing state and local government lawsuits against opioid manufacturers to determine if we can be of assistance.” “We will use criminal penalties,” Mr. Sessions said. “We will use civil penalties. We will use whatever tools we have to hold people accountable for breaking our laws.” "

706,"WASHINGTON — A few weeks after Stephen K. Bannon left the White House in August, he was invited to a dinner at the Council on Foreign Relations to discuss American policy toward China. With his unbridled China bashing and dark talk of a looming conflict in the Pacific, Mr. Bannon expected to be roughed up by the group, which included China scholars, writers and veterans from past Republican and Democratic administrations. Mr. Bannon’s hosts were hard on him, but not in the way he expected. Rather than faulting him or his former boss, President Trump, for their hostile approach, they pressed him on why Mr. Trump had not followed through with his tough talk about trade and North Korea. “I walked out of there thinking, ‘Something has changed with the elite,’” he recalled. China’s relentless rise and its more recent embrace of repressive tactics that recall the Mao era — a process accelerated by President Xi Jinping’s bid to stay in power indefinitely — have fractured a deeply rooted consensus in Washington about the long-term direction of its relationship with Beijing. Gone is a widespread agreement among diplomats, scholars and businesspeople that China is gradually converging with the United States and, therefore, that Americans should work to manage any flare-ups between the two countries. With China now unabashedly charting its own course — one that diverges rather than converges with the liberal democracies and market economies of the West — conflict, many say, is inevitable. “Even those who are the most optimistic, hopeful and in some ways romantic about the U.S.-China relationship have been forced to confront a new China,” said Kurt M. Campbell, who, as an assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, was an architect of the Obama administration’s policy of pivoting toward the East. Mr. Xi’s power grab has thrown this new China into stark relief, “exacerbating the fault line that already exists between China and the liberal democracies of the world,” said Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. "

708,"For the American premiere of “The Low Road,” a satire of unbounded self-interest and pitiless capitalism, the playwright Bruce Norris realized he needed to change the last name of his scurrilous 18th-century protagonist, Jim Trumpett. What would sound like a heavy-handed jab at the businessman-turned-president from a leftist playwright actually wasn’t. Mr. Norris wrote his sprawling comic fable half a dozen years earlier, before few predicted that Donald J. Trump would one day occupy the White House. “It’s not a play about him in any way,” Mr. Norris said. Indeed, to describe Trumpett’s contemporary descendant, the bumptious head of TrumpettBank Global, the 2013 stage directions said: “think Mitt Romney,” the moderate Republican and former presidential nominee who is now running for an open Senate seat in Utah. “I don’t think I would be writing it now,” Mr. Norris said of “The Low Road,” which is scheduled to officially open March 7 at the Public Theater in New York. “It’s really hard to respond to this moment dramatically because it’s so melodramatic.” The national dialogue is too fraught, he said, and his own fears of the Trump presidency too overwhelming. “It’s not a mistake it was written in the Obama administration, which for those of us on the Left, was a period of relative calm,” he said. It’s not that “The Low Road” is divorced from contemporary events. The 2007 global financial crisis was the inspiration. But the specifics are only fleetingly referenced by the play’s 48 characters (played by 17 actors) who skip across time. And Mr. Norris, a Texas-born, Pulitzer Prize winner who was originally commissioned by the Royal Court Theater in London, wrote the script in the recession’s chastened aftermath. By the time it opened, financial regulation and consumer protections were expanding, and a second-term progressive president was labeling income inequality the “defining challenge of our time.” "
709,"Little by little, the Trump administration is dismantling elements of the Affordable Care Act and creating a health care system that looks more like the one that preceded it. But some states don’t want to go back and are working to build it back up. Congress and the Trump administration have reduced Obamacare outreach, weakened benefit requirements, repealed the unpopular individual insurance mandate and broadened opportunities for insurers to offer inexpensive but skimpy plans to more customers. Last week, the administration released its latest proposal along these lines, by changing the definition of so-called short-term plans. These plans don’t need to follow any of the Obamacare requirements, including popular rules that plans include a standard set of benefits, or cover people with pre-existing conditions. If the rule becomes final, these plans could go from short term to lasting nearly a year or longer.   Taken together, experts say, the administration’s actions will tend to increase the price of health insurance that follows all the Affordable Care Act’s rules and increase the popularity of health plans that cover fewer services. The result could be divided markets, where healthier people buy lightly regulated plans that don’t cover much health care, lower earners get highly subsidized Obamacare — and sicker middle-class people  face escalating costs for insurance with comprehensive benefits.    But not everywhere. Several states are considering whether to adopt their own versions of the individual mandate, Obamacare’s rule that people who can afford insurance should pay a fine if they don’t obtain it. A few are looking to tighten rules for short-term health plans. Some states are investing heavily on Obamacare outreach and marketing, even as the federal government cuts back. The result is likely to be big differences in health insurance options and coverage, depending on where you live. States that lean into the changes might have more health insurance offerings with small price tags, but ones that are inaccessible to people with health problems and don’t cover major health services, like prescription drugs. States pushing back may see more robust Obamacare markets of highly regulated plans, but the price of those plans is likely to remain higher.     "
710,"To the Editor: Re “Don’t Count Bibi Out — Not Yet” (column, Feb. 24): Bret Stephens predicts that despite recommendations by Israel’s police that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be charged on multiple counts of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, he is likely to endure in power. But should he? When Mr. Stephens writes about the American president, he has been eloquent about why he’s a “NeverTrumper.” “Character does count, and virtue does matter, and Trump’s shortcomings prove it daily,” Mr. Stephens wrote in a Dec. 29 column. Mr. Netanyahu displays daily many of the characteristics that Mr. Stephens finds objectionable in President Trump. Mr. Stephens courageously attacks fellow conservatives who pretend Mr. Trump’s personality doesn’t matter. He should do the same for those, including himself, who play down Bibi’s flaws.

NEWTON, MASS. "
711,"Amid the dizzying details of internet trolls, almost a million dollars’ worth of antique rugs and fake bank accounts, the indictments brought by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, in his investigation of Russian tampering in the 2016 election have one thing in common. Both the indictment of 13 Russians associated with a troll farm called Internet Research Agency and the indictment of President Trump’s onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort accuse the defendants of pretending to engage in American politics in good faith but secretly serving someone else’s interest. In both cases, the charge, “conspiracy to defraud the United States,” is an assertion that they were really serving the interests of Russia or of a Russian-backed Ukrainian politician, and that by hiding their true intent, the defendants prevented the United States government from protecting our politics from undisclosed outside influence. That precedent, and the guilty plea to the same charge by Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort’s deputy, may pose a real danger to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. According to reports, Mr. Mueller appears to be assessing whether Mr. Kushner, in the guise of pursuing foreign policy on behalf of the United States, was actually serving the interests of his family and foreign governments. On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that “officials in at least four countries” — United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico — “have privately discussed ways they can manipulate” Mr. Kushner by taking advantage of his “complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience.” The president gave his son-in-law an expansive foreign policy role, including an effort to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The implication in the article is that the United States government has intercepted communications of foreign leaders talking about ways they could take advantage of Mr. Kushner, whose family real estate empire is facing substantial debt woes. The biggest concern in the Post report — and surely one reason such intelligence led to Mr. Kushner’s being stripped of his interim top-secret security clearance last week — is that foreign countries would offer him personal financial benefits in the same conversations in which he purports to represent America’s best interests. There has already been ample reporting suggesting that Mr. Kushner may have done just that. During a period when Mr. Kushner was negotiating President Trump’s first visit to China, his family business was trying to sell a debt-ridden property in New York to an insurance company with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Public scrutiny of the deal scuttled it. Last May, The New York Times described how, immediately after the Trump administration extended a visa program for wealthy investors, Mr. Kushner’s sister invoked Mr. Kushner in a presentation seeking Chinese investment in one of the family’s New Jersey real estate developments. "
712,"The Department of Homeland Security may soon formalize the abhorrent practice of detaining the children of asylum-seekers separately from their parents. Immigrant families apprehended at the southwest border already endure a deeply flawed system in which they can be detained indefinitely. In this immigration system, detainees too often lack adequate access to counsel. But to unnecessarily tear apart families who cross the border to start a better life is immoral. Sadly, such separations are already happening. The Florence Project in Arizona documented 155 such cases by October and other immigrant advocacy organizations report that children are being taken away from their parents. If the secretary orders this practice to be made standard procedure, thousands of families could face unnecessary separation. The Trump administration’s goal is to strong-arm families into accepting deportation to get their children back. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, admitted this when she told the Senate on Jan. 16 that separating families may “discourage parents” from seeking refuge in America. But the increasing informal use of family separation has not proved to be a deterrent. Last year, the number of family apprehensions at the southwestern border skyrocketed from 1,118 families in April to 8,120 in December. Parents will continue to flee violence to protect their children and themselves. It is reprehensible to punish them for that basic human impulse. It is also despicable that the government would use children as bargaining chips. This policy is tantamount to state-sponsored traumatization. Those of us who have seen the sites where families are detained and work directly with children and families who have gone through the system know what’s at stake. "
713,"Hope Hicks, President Trump’s communications director and one of his longest-serving advisers, said Wednesday that she planned to leave the White House in the next few weeks. Ms. Hicks, 29, a former model who joined Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign without any experience in politics, became known as one of the few aides who understood Mr. Trump’s personality and style and could challenge the president to change his views. Her title belied the extent of her power within the West Wing — after John F. Kelly was appointed White House chief of staff, she had more access to the Oval Office than almost any other staff member. Her own office, which she inherited after the departure of another Trump confidant, Keith Schiller, was just next door. Most significantly, Mr. Trump felt a more personal comfort with Ms. Hicks than he has established with almost any of his other, newer advisers since coming to Washington. And for a politician who relies so heavily on what is familiar to him, her absence could be jarring. Ms. Hicks said that she had “no words” to express her gratitude to the president, who responded with his own statement. “Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years,” Mr. Trump said. “She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. I will miss having her by my side, but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future.” Her resignation came a day after she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee, telling the panel that in her job, she had occasionally been required to tell white lies but had never lied about anything connected to the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Ms. Hicks’s first association with the Trump family was working with Mr. Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka, on her personal apparel and licensing brand about six years ago. When Mr. Trump was planning his campaign in spring 2015, he told Ms. Hicks he was pulling her from Ms. Trump’s team to put her on his small political staff despite her lack of experience. But the Trump family trusted her, and that was a crucial factor in her emergence as a key aide to the president, who also valued her loyalty. Yet as the person who spent the most time with Mr. Trump, Ms. Hicks became enmeshed in a number of controversies over the past year, including key aspects of the investigations by Congress and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into possible collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, as well as the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. In recent weeks, her personal life drew unwanted attention when it was reported that she had dated Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who resigned under pressure over allegations that he had abused his two former wives. Multiple White House aides said Ms. Hicks’s decision to leave was unrelated to her appearance before the House committee. They said she had told a small group of people in the days before the session that she had planned to resign, partly because she never liked Washington and chose not to try to pretend to. Ms. Hicks’s departure will coincide with those of other people who have been close to the Trump family members in the White House. Reed Cordish, a policy adviser and friend of Jared Kushner and Ms. Trump, is leaving his role; Josh Raffel, a press aide whose initial portfolio was primarily focused on Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, is also leaving; and Dina Powell, who had been a deputy national security adviser who was close to Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, left weeks ago. Their absence will deprive Mr. Trump and his daughter and son-in-law of many of the aides who served as crucial buffers and sounding boards as a turbulent and politically uncertain year begins. Among the things Ms. Hicks had advised Mr. Trump, according to multiple White House officials, was to tone down some of his Twitter posts or stop sending them altogether, an effort that had mixed results. She also had the ability to stop Mr. Trump from focusing on an issue he was angry about, and sometimes shield other members of the staff from Mr. Trump’s anger. While Ms. Hicks and Mr. Kelly developed a functional, respectful relationship, he considered her access to the president to be a challenge to the command-and-control system he tried to enforce, according to several White House aides. But on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly echoed the president’s praise. “I quickly realized what so many have learned about Hope: She is strategic, poised and wise beyond her years,” Mr. Kelly said. “She became a trusted adviser and counselor, and did a tremendous job overseeing the communications for the president’s agenda including the passage of historic tax reform.” Several staff members described Ms. Hicks as a protector against some of the more difficult aspects of working in the Trump White House, and expressed concern about what her absence would mean for the team. As communications director, Ms. Hicks worked to stabilize, to some extent, a fractious press department of about 40 people who were often at odds with one another. She maintained one of the lowest public profiles of anyone to ever hold the job, declining to sit for interviews or appear on the podium in the White House briefing room. Even those in the West Wing who did not like her approach feared her power, and worried about crossing her. But some former Trump advisers sounded hopeful that a new staff configuration might create a more consistent approach to governing, in contrast to the way the White House has functioned for the past year, when people close to the president could easily influence him. Other advisers said they were more concerned that Mr. Trump, who has found the White House isolating, would struggle with no close campaign aides nearby. Dan Scavino Jr., the White House digital director, is the only member of the president’s original campaign team still working directly for Mr. Trump. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, was an early campaign press aide, and the president is fond of her, raising the possibility she could play a role with the West Wing press office. It was not immediately clear who will fill Ms. Hicks’s role, although several White House officials and external advisers said they expect that Mercedes Schlapp — who Mr. Kelly brought in and who was seen by some as a ballast against Ms. Hicks’s influence when he took over the job — will be elevated in some way. Ms. Hicks had been considering leaving the White House for several months. She told colleagues that she had accomplished what she felt she could with a job that made her one of the most powerful people in Washington, and that there would never be a perfect moment to leave, according to White House aides.

714,"WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned Republicans on live television Wednesday by embracing gun control and urging a group of lawmakers at the White House to resurrect gun safety legislation that has been opposed for years by the powerful National Rifle Association and the vast majority of his party. In a remarkable meeting, the president veered wildly from the N.R.A. playbook in front of giddy Democrats and stone-faced Republicans. He called for comprehensive gun control legislation that would expand background checks to weapons purchased at gun shows and on the internet, keep guns from mentally ill people, secure schools and restrict gun sales for some young adults. He even suggested a conversation on an assault weapons ban. At one point, Mr. Trump suggested that law enforcement authorities should have the power to seize guns from mentally ill people or others who could present a danger without first going to court. “I like taking the guns early,” he said, adding, “Take the guns first, go through due process second.” The declarations prompted a frantic series of calls from N.R.A. lobbyists to their allies on Capitol Hill and a statement from the group calling the ideas that Mr. Trump expressed “bad policy.” Republican lawmakers suggested to reporters that they remained opposed to gun control measures. “We’re not ditching any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn’t like them,” Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said in a statement. Democrats, too, said they were skeptical that Mr. Trump would follow through. “The White House can now launch a lobbying campaign to get universal background checks passed, as the president promised in this meeting, or they can sit and do nothing,” said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. "
715,"Alberto M. Carvalho, who rose from undocumented immigrant and day laborer to superintendent of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, has found a bigger stage: He will become the next New York City schools chancellor, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office announced on Wednesday. Mr. Carvalho will oversee the nation’s largest system, one made up of 1.1 million children, many of whom face similar challenges to those he has overcome. Over 70 percent of New York City students come from families that are on some form of public assistance, and one in every 10 students was homeless at some point in the 2016-17 school year. Mr. Carvalho, 53, has led Miami-Dade, the nation’s fourth-largest district, for nearly a decade and has a remarkably successful record. The high school graduation rate has increased to 80.7 percent in 2016-17 from 60.5 percent in 2007-8. In 2014, Mr. Carvalho was named the National Superintendent of the Year. In 2012, the district won the Broad Prize for Urban Education, which recognizes districts that have shown major gains in student achievement. “Alberto Carvalho is a world-class educator with an unmatched track record of success,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement on Wednesday evening. “I am very confident that our extensive, national search has found New York City the best person to lead the nation’s largest school system into the future.” Mr. Carvalho’s national profile is higher than that of Mr. de Blasio’s current schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, when she was appointed four years ago, and he is seen as politically savvy and ambitious. People aligned with the education reform movement and other critics have faulted Ms. Fariña’s approach for lacking vision. The mayor may hope that Mr. Carvalho, who last year considered running for Congress, will be a more effective salesman for his education policies than Ms. Fariña was. Mr. Carvalho has pushed a different agenda than Ms. Fariña’s, expanding the number of charter, magnet and other choice schools and programs, and promoting the use of technology in the classroom. He started a school called iPreparatory Academy where students work at their own pace, partly led by teachers and partly using online curriculum. Mr. de Blasio is a critic of charter schools; Ms. Fariña has not pursued opening new schools or programs, and technology has not played a large part in her plans. "

717,"A teacher at a high school in Dalton, Ga., was arrested on Wednesday after he barricaded himself in his classroom and fired at least one gunshot through a window, the police said. Bruce Frazier, the spokesman for the Dalton Police Department, said that no students were hit and that he was aware of only one injury: A student hurt her ankle while running through the halls. The police identified the teacher as Jesse Randall Davidson, 53. They said that he appeared to have locked the door to his classroom at Dalton High School and was alone there when students tried to enter shortly before noon. The principal, Steve Bartoo, was called to the classroom and said he used a key to open the door. “I attempted to enter the classroom and he slammed the door,” Mr. Bartoo said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, adding that Mr. Davidson told him to go away. “He had some nonsensical noises that were made as well.” After that, Mr. Frazier said: “Mr. Davidson apparently fired a shot from a handgun through an exterior window of the classroom. It did not appear that it was aimed at anybody. Obviously it broke out the window, and at that point the school went into lockdown.” A junior at the high school, Wesley Caceres, 16, said in a phone interview that he heard about the “code red” lockdown over the intercom. On his way to take shelter in a classroom, Wesley filmed a video of students running frantically through the hallways. "
718,"ALBANY — It was, especially in a restrictive state like New York, a seemingly modest set of gun-control proposals. Prospective gun buyers would undergo longer background checks; an institute would be formed to study gun violence; courts would be allowed to seize or prohibit the sale of guns to potentially violent individuals; and a ban would be enacted on the possession of bump stocks, which can make a semiautomatic rifle shoot nearly as fast as a fully automatic version. And yet, the legislative proposals have not been embraced by the Republican-controlled State Senate. On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers tried a different parliamentary gambit: They attached the gun-control proposals to an existing bill, a move known as a hostile amendment, trying to force the Republican leadership to formally vote them down in an election year. Across the nation, the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida has seemingly pushed the needle on gun control; even President Trump, a guns-rights advocate, now says he wants to ban bump stocks and favors tighter background checks. But in New York, the needle was unmoved. Each Republican senator, along with a single rogue Democrat, refused to take it up on Wednesday. "
719,"LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. — Debbie Dooley’s conservative profile seems impeccable. The gun-owning daughter of a Baptist preacher, she was an early organizer for the Tea Party movement. She voted for President Trump and still supports him. But when it comes to energy, her independent streak sends her down a different path: She takes issue with some of Mr. Trump’s signature positions, goes up against some of the nation’s biggest utility companies and often crosses conventional partisan lines. Ms. Dooley opposes the tariff the president imposed on solar-panel imports in January. As for coal, which Mr. Trump has championed, it will never “be the king it once was,” she said. She accepts that human activity is causing climate change — and worries that it will threaten the health of the next generation, including her 9-year-old grandson, who has asthma. To her, those beliefs are consistent with the rest of her worldview. “We should be focusing on the technologies of the future, not the dinosaur technology of the past,” Ms. Dooley said. “Our energy grid is vulnerable to attack. Rooftop solar keeps us safe. People like solar.” What’s more, she contends that embracing clean energy affirms the populist beliefs the Tea Party espouses. The monopoly control of utilities over energy supplies stands in contrast to the free market, she said, while solar and wind power represent energy freedom. Over the last five years, she has unabashedly linked arms with environmental groups championed by the left, like the Sierra Club. And on Thursday, she is set to appear at an event in San Francisco with a member of the Democratic National Committee’s executive committee — Christine Pelosi, daughter of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader vilified by the right.

720,"Well, the votes are in, people, and the winner of our latest competition for Worst Member of the Trump Administration is … Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency! It was a landslide. To be fair, if we had included Donald Trump himself in the balloting, I’m sure the big guy would have swept the field — actually winning the popular vote for the first time in his presidential career. But pitted against his peers, Pruitt walloped the competition. The winner of our last Worst survey, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, hardly got a mention. She even came in behind Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a person whose only actual power is to be irritating while claiming the president was just joking/isn’t really going to do that/was totally misunderstood. It’s pretty clear that DeVos’s slide was due to a growing public realization that she’s too inept to destroy the public school system, no matter how fervent the desire. Several of the other big names in the cabinet got a similar pass. “Guess we can’t nominate Ben Carson because we don’t know what he does,” complained one reader. (This was before we learned that Carson’s signature achievement has been buying a $31,000 dining room set for his office.) Attorney General Jeff Sessions also fell off the charts, presumably because of his negative clout in the administration. Just the other day, Trump twittered a demand that the public “Ask Jeff Session!” why the Obama administration hadn’t stopped Russian meddling in the elections. If your boss doesn’t remember how to spell your name, no way we’re going to give you an award. As usual, a lot of voters complicated our count by demanding to pick All of the Above. One reader suggested that if the swamp got really drained, “only the White House chef and maintenance crew will remain.” "

722,"WASHINGTON — The British government wants the Trump administration to provide assurances that American prosecutors will not seek the death penalty against two British Islamic State suspects who were recently captured in Syria — and is threatening to withhold important evidence about them as leverage, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. The British are also insisting that the United States promise to prosecute the two men in a civilian court, rather than taking them to the Guantánamo Bay wartime prison, the officials said. The two men, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, are believed to be half of a cell of four British jihadists called the Beatles, who played a central role in torturing and killing Western hostages, including several Americans. Mr. Kotey and Mr. Elsheikh were the last members of the group still at large until their recent capture in Syria by a Kurdish militia, which is holding them. Recently, the British defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, said his government did not want to take back the two men, who have been stripped of British citizenship, so the United States is expected to eventually take custody of them. But the Trump administration is holding off on doing so until it figures out how it will handle them, according to several American officials. While the American military has interrogated Mr. Kotey and Mr. Elsheikh for intelligence purposes, it has not yet read them Miranda warnings and re-interviewed them in hopes of eliciting confessions that could be used as courtroom evidence. Because the captors wore masks around hostages, some of whom survived, some courtroom evidence may consist of witnesses identifying at least one of the men by his voice, according to a former hostage and other people familiar with the F.B.I.’s long-running investigation. The British government has other information about the men’s backgrounds, associations, radicalization, movements and activities that could significantly strengthen that case. "
723,"Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, said Wednesday evening that it would stop selling guns and ammunition to anyone under 21 years of age and remove from its stores all toys and airsoft rifles that resemble assault-style weapons. “Our heritage as a company has always been in serving sportsmen and hunters, and we will continue to do so in a responsible way,” the company said in a statement. Walmart, which said it started a review of its firearms policy “in light of recent events,” became the second major retailer on Wednesday to raise the age to buy firearms in its stores to 21 from 18. Dick’s Sporting Goods said it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles, which Walmart stopped selling in 2015, and would also no longer sell high-capacity magazines. Walmart said it would put the changes in place in its stores and online as soon as possible. (Read our story about Dick’s changing its firearm policy.) The moves by the two companies came two weeks after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., when a gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle shot up the school. Edward Stack, the chief executive of Dick’s, said company leaders were “disturbed and upset” about what happened at the school and wanted to act. “We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘Enough is enough,’” Mr. Stack said in an interview earlier on Wednesday. “It got to us.” The decisions by Dick’s and Walmart drew immediate — and passionate — reaction on social media, attracting both praise and outrage. Their changes were both symbolic and meaningful, thrusting the two major retailers into a contentious national debate on guns. They also came on the same day that President Trump appeared to buck his own party and embrace gun control, urging lawmakers to resurrect gun safety legislation that the Republican Party and the powerful gun lobby have long opposed. Since the Florida school shooting, a number of major companies, including Delta Air Lines, announced they had ended their discount arrangements with the National Rifle Association. Other companies, including FedEx, said they would continue to offer discounts to members of the N.R.A. The new policy by Walmart is the second change in recent years regarding the type of firearms and guns accessories sold in its stores. In 2015, Walmart said it would no longer sell high-powered rifles in the United States, but cited lower customer demand for the military-style rifles and not politics. Walmart also does not sell handguns, except in Alaska, and has not sold high-capacity magazines or “bump stocks,” an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster, which was used by the gunman in Las Vegas in October. Another major retailer, Cabela’s, which is owned by Bass Pro Shops, did not immediately respond to emails earlier on Wednesday seeking comment about Dick’s new policy. "
724,"WASHINGTON — A classified military exercise last week examined how American troops would mobilize and strike if ordered into a potential war on the Korean Peninsula, even as diplomatic overtures between the North and the Trump administration continue. The war planning, known as a “tabletop exercise,” was held over several days in Hawaii. It included Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Army’s chief of staff, and Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of Special Operations Command. They looked at a number of pitfalls that could hamper an American assault on North Korea’s well-entrenched military. Among them was the Pentagon’s limited ability to evacuate injured troops from the Korean Peninsula daily — a problem more acute if the North retaliated with chemical weapons, according to more than a half-dozen military and Defense Department officials familiar with the exercise. Large numbers of surveillance aircraft would have to be moved from the Middle East and Africa to the Pacific to support ground troops. Planners also looked at how American forces stationed in South Korea and Japan would be involved. Pentagon officials cautioned that the planning does not mean that a decision has been made to go to war over President Trump’s demands that North Korea rein in its nuclear ambitions. A war with North Korea, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said, would be “catastrophic.” He and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have argued forcefully for using diplomacy to address Pyongyang’s nuclear program. "

726,"As 280-character brain-squirts from America’s thumbiest commander in chief go, the one President Trump emitted late Tuesday night appeared harmless enough. Earlier in the day, a Federal District Court judge in San Diego handed Mr. Trump a victory in his efforts to build a wall along the nation’s southern border. In a detailed 101-page opinion, the judge rejected a challenge by the State of California and several environmental groups to the administration’s waiver of environmental laws that could have held up the wall’s construction. “Big legal win today,” Mr. Trump tweeted around 11:30. “U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!” So far so good. Mr. Trump is entitled, no less than other presidents, to celebrate his administration’s victories in court — even if he does so in a bathrobe. What he failed to mention, though, was the name of the judge who issued the ruling: Gonzalo Curiel, of the Southern District of California. Judge Curiel, you may recall, was on Mr. Trump’s radar in May 2016, soon after Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for president. At the time, Judge Curiel was presiding over a long-running class-action lawsuit against Trump University, which had been accused of defrauding customers who spent $1,500 for three-day seminars that promised to reveal Mr. Trump’s real estate secrets. Mr. Trump, who refuses to be held to account for anything he has ever said or done, was irked that a federal judge would dare to entertain litigation against him. At a rally in San Diego, Mr. Trump called Judge Curiel “very hostile,” “a very bad judge” and a “hater of Donald Trump,” and said he “should be ashamed of himself. I think it’s a disgrace that he’s doing this.” He added that Judge Curiel “happens to be, we believe, Mexican.” Not true: Judge Curiel was born and raised in Indiana. But the implication, of course, was that Mr. Trump, who had begun his own candidacy with derogatory comments about Mexicans and had been pushing a border wall with Mexico throughout the campaign, could not get a fair trial from a “Mexican” judge. Less than two years later, in a case involving the border wall itself, that same judge ruled in Mr. Trump’s favor. He is no longer a “very bad judge,” apparently. It’s possible that Mr. Trump simply forgot who Judge Curiel is. More likely, he knows full well and doesn’t care. What he cares about is protecting his delicate ego, and repairing any damage to it inflicted by people who don’t show a sufficient degree of respect or self-abasement. This all-consuming self-interest leads him to change his opinion of people and institutions, depending on how he thinks they are treating him at that moment. Laws and norms, ethics and principles? Meaningless concepts. In Mr. Trump’s world, nothing is sacred and everything is transactional. This is a man who is so much more interested in winning than in governing that he filed for re-election the same day he was inaugurated. It’s the core of who he is, as almost anyone who has had even a glancing dealing with him over the years — especially in real estate, where nothing matters but the sale — will attest. If you help him or say nice things about him, you’re the best. If you get in his way or criticize him, you’re unfair, dishonest, terrible. Failing, even. Ask “Liddle” Bob Corker, the Tennessee senator who earned Mr. Trump’s outrage by criticizing the Republican tax bill, then seemed to get back on the president’s good side with a few empathetic words. Or Senator John McCain, who is dealing with terminal brain cancer even as Mr. Trump keeps mocking him for his vote last year against repealing Obamacare. Or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was Mr. Trump’s first and most ardent supporter in the Senate, but who has secured a spot in the president’s doghouse after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump fired yet another broadside at Mr. Sessions, complaining that his failure to investigate alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is “disgraceful” — in all caps, naturally. None of this is remotely surprising anymore, but even so, Mr. Trump’s tweet about Judge Curiel’s border-wall decision revealed once again the depths of the president’s own self-interest and his utter lack of principles. When this is the driving force of the commander in chief, and it is aimed at our governmental and social institutions, it is profoundly destructive. Shortly after the 2016 rally where he disparaged the competence, integrity and ethnicity of Judge Curiel, Mr. Trump was asked why he did not just settle the Trump University case and be done with it. After predicting that he would win outright, he said: “I could settle that case. … I don’t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I’m a man of principle.” (In November 2016, days after he won the election, Mr. Trump settled, eventually paying $25 million.) Fortunately, as this tale reveals, there are in fact still people of principle in public service, and they’re doing important work every day to preserve our institutions and counteract this president’s worst impulses. Judge Curiel, for one, has continued to do his job, carefully applying the law to the cases that come before him, no matter how obnoxious the litigants might be. In his ruling on Tuesday, the judge acknowledged the “heated political debate” surrounding the border wall, and quoted a passage on the role of courts by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. — who, he slyly noted, is a “fellow Indiana native”: “Courts are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our nation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.” That is what being a public servant in America sounds like, and it requires a level of selflessness and devotion to democratic ideals that is alien to Mr. Trump. "
727,"Early last year, a private equity billionaire started paying regular visits to the White House. Joshua Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration officials on infrastructure policy. During that period, he met on multiple occasions with Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, said three people familiar with the meetings. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris. The job never materialized, but in November, Apollo lent $184 million to Mr. Kushner’s family real estate firm, Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper. Even by the standards of Apollo, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, the previously unreported transaction with the Kushners was a big deal: It was triple the size of the average property loan made by Apollo’s real estate lending arm, securities filings show. It was one of the largest loans Kushner Companies received last year. An even larger loan came from Citigroup, which lent the firm and one of its partners $325 million to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn. That loan was made in the spring of 2017, shortly after Mr. Kushner met in the White House with Citigroup’s chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, according to people briefed on the meeting. The two men talked about financial and trade policy and did not discuss Mr. Kushner’s family business, one person said. There is little precedent for a top White House official meeting with executives of companies as they contemplate sizable loans to his business, say government ethics experts. "
728,"WASHINGTON — China’s top economic adviser arrived in Washington this week in an attempt to defuse rapidly escalating tensions with the United States as the prospect of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies looms. But Liu He, the American-educated technocrat who is now President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, may face an insurmountable task. The Trump administration appears less predisposed to engage with China than perhaps any other White House in decades — a dramatic turn given the United States’ long campaign to persuade China to open its markets to American products and investment. President Trump and his top trade advisers share a widespread view that China cannot be trusted to negotiate in good faith and believe that past administrations spent fruitless years pushing the Chinese to make minor changes to their economy that arrived too late, and were too often reversed. News that Mr. Xi has moved to abolish term limits for himself and his vice president has only increased suspicion in recent weeks that China has no intention of shifting toward a more market-oriented economic model and plans to have a state-dominated economy. The lack of engagement is a worrying sign for relations, given that the Trump administration is now poised to deliver what could be the harshest economic sanctions on China in decades. In the coming weeks, the administration will decide whether to impose stiff tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum and restrict investments to penalize China for its alleged theft of American intellectual property. Economists fear trade sanctions could prompt retaliation from China, and even tip the world’s two largest economies into a trade war that would harm businesses and consumers in the United States and abroad.

730,"HAMBURG, Germany — After “kindergarten” and “schadenfreude,” it’s time for another German word to enter the Anglosphere: “Heimat.” German-to-English dictionaries will translate Heimat (pronounced HI-mat) as home, native land or homeland, but none of those words capture the true meaning of the term. Heimat describes not just a geographical place, but a state of belonging. It’s the opposite of feeling alien; for most Germans, it is mixed with the smell of Christmas cookies from Mama’s kitchen. Heimat is about the landscape that left its mark on you, the culture that informed you and the people that inspired you when you were growing up. To many, it is the mildest form of patriotism, and it long preoccupied German romantic writers like Novalis, Hölderlin and Eichendorff. Later, the Nazis co-opted the love for Heimat into a murderous hatred of those they decided did not belong. After World War II, Heimat was repurposed as an amnesia-inducing blanket that covered the horrors and guilt with kitschy, romantic Alpine movies. Now Heimat is back in a new guise, at the core of a major conflict that shapes the post-Communist world: identity versus diversity. Pundits and politicians debate its importance; one party of Berlin’s (still to be confirmed) grand coalition has decided Germany even needs a Heimat ministry. Horst Seehofer, the prime minister of Bavaria — a state that, with its dirndls and mountain retreats, is the home of Heimat, if you will — has been put in charge of a new “superministry” covering the interior, infrastructure and Heimat. The move was ridiculed immediately by members of the young, urban Twitterati. Will we all be forced to wear lederhosen, they sniped, and have our weekly portion of sauerkraut? This was a poor, reflexive reaction to what may prove to be an enriching idea. If interpreted in a prudent and modern way, a little dose of Heimat could help Germany avoid going down the same road to political degeneration that the United States and Britain have followed. Yet the rediscovery of Heimat will bear fruit only if the term is once again redefined. "

732,"OSLO — The protocol for nominating and choosing recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize is one of the world’s most scrutinized and secretive. A total of 329 candidates — 217 individuals and 112 organizations — are being considered for this year’s prize, which will be announced in October. The identities of the candidates are kept secret, and indeed, the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prizes, is forbidden from divulging any information about its deliberations for 50 years, and even then, only for scholarship purposes and at its discretion. But a wrinkle in this time-honored process — the peace prize was first awarded in 1901 — emerged on Tuesday, when the committee announced that it had uncovered what appeared to be a forged nomination of President Trump for the prize. The matter has been referred to the Oslo police for investigation. Moreover, the forgery appears to have occurred twice: Olav Njolstad, the secretary of the five-member committee, said it appeared that a forged nomination of Mr. Trump for the prize was also submitted last year — and was also referred to the police. (The earlier forgery was not disclosed to the public at the time.) Inspector Rune Skjold, the head of the economic crimes section of the Oslo police, said that investigators had been in touch with the F.B.I. since last fall, which suggests that the forged nominations originated in the United States. He said the police believed that the same perpetrator was behind both forgeries. Mr. Skjold said the earlier letter was subjected to a thorough and lengthy forensic examination, which the new letter is also likely to undergo. "

734,"KABUL, Afghanistan — President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan renewed a call on Wednesday for the Taliban to join peace talks, offering to treat the insurgent group as a legitimate political party, though it has repeatedly rejected similar proposals. In the latest overture, Mr. Ghani said his government would provide the Taliban with an office in the capital, Kabul; passports for their members; help resettling militants’ families; and assistance in scrubbing the names of top commanders from international terrorist blacklists. “We believe in providing a peaceful and respectful life for all Afghans, including those Taliban who leave violence behind,” Mr. Ghani said. He spoke at a peace conference, called the Kabul Process, attended by more than 20 nations but not the Taliban. There appears little chance of any breakthrough, but the Afghan government made the offer to show an international audience that it is willing to negotiate, and to encourage those participating in the conference to pressure the Taliban to accept. The government is under pressure to offer incentives as the United States increases military pressure. The Taliban’s main faction has insisted on direct negotiations with the United States and dismisses the American-backed government in Kabul as a puppet. The Taliban have yet to respond to Mr. Ghani’s proposal. But in a statement on Monday, they said they had asked American officials to talk directly to their political office, and not through the Afghan government. The statement also said that “military strategies which have repeatedly been tested in Afghanistan over the past 17 years will only intensify and prolong the war.” "

Starting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings.

Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,” Mr. Clasper said. “It seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.” As the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had “a deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.” In this series — titled “The Spaces We Inherit” — he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence. “I took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,” he said.  “We’ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happens has to happen somewhere.” Given the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation. “It’s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,” he said.  “I think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.” Interviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity. On April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was not done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond’s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. “They shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,” she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally. “I remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn’t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn’t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I’m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don’t think there’s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can’t understand how that could happen. They simply can’t relate to that kind of criminal activity.” In what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle’s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn’s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found not guilty by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till’s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son’s broken and swollen body because she “wanted the world to see what they did to my baby.” “I didn’t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I’ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I’ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don’t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We’ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren’t given enough credit for the changes we’ve made. I respect everyone’s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I’ve met some of his family members. They’re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we’re part of a historical site.” On Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as “the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.” When the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site. “I came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I’m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn’t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was — that African-Americans weren’t treated as equals — but I didn’t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn’t know. It’s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it’s important. The African-American students especially don’t talk about it because it’s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don’t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.” Mary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank’s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan’s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank’s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986. After Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was “unable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.” “Tracing one’s roots and one’s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn’t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn’t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to ‘go back home.’ Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we’re constantly suffering from PTSD. It’s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we’ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.” Michael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald’s murder was a “not guilty” verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald’s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected. On the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw’s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers’ affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their “civic duty” by killing Seraw. “When I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn’t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I’ve since had covered up. It’s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn’t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn’t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I’d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he’s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It’s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I’ve done and I realize that I’ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that’s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I’m a marked man, and maybe I’ll die doing this, but at least I’ll die knowing I did the right thing.” On March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.

738,"WASHINGTON — The new Republican tax cut is providing a powerful weapon for the law’s supporters and detractors, as well as investors and analysts, who are mining data on how companies are spending their windfalls in a battle to sway the behavior of voters and executives alike. In the two months since President Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax bill into law, a vast arsenal of spreadsheets has begun to capture, in real time, the effect of the tax cut as it works its way through corporate balance sheets. Traders are compiling data to find value in a volatile stock market. Advocates of corporate responsibility are hoping to shame companies into passing more of their savings on to employees or charities. Partisans are using it to sway public opinion. None of the data, as of yet, yield anywhere close to a full picture of how the tax cuts are flowing through corporate boardrooms and into the American economy. But that has not stopped politicians and organizations from using it to advance their goals. After Congress approved the final version of the tax cut bill, John Kartch, of the conservative-leaning Americans for Tax Reform, started a list that began with AT&T, Comcast and five other companies that had announced wage increases or worker bonuses and credited the moves to the tax cuts. It has since grown to more than 400 companies and emerged as Republicans’ favorite talking point for their new law. Democrats have been building their own list, of companies announcing stock buybacks, and have showcased that as evidence the bill is benefiting the rich rather than trickling down to workers. Wall Street analysts have since released even more detailed estimates of how companies are responding to the law, which lowered taxes for corporations and so-called pass-through businesses. On Wednesday, the nonprofit research group Just Capital will release one of the most detailed accountings to date: a ranking of companies on how much of their tax windfalls are going to workers, customers, communities and shareholders. Advocates are hoping that the more information they can bring to the surface, the more they can bend companies’ or voters’ behavior with it. "
739,"THE RUB OF TIME
Bellow, Nabokov, Hitchens, Travolta, Trump: Essays and Reportage, 1994-2017
By Martin Amis
416 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95. Martin Amis, for those who need an introduction, is a writer living in Brooklyn. He was also, for a period beginning in the mid-1980s and lasting well into the span covered by “The Rub of Time,” his new collection of nonfiction, a famous British novelist. That phrase, which may strike some young American ears as an archaism if not an oxymoron, is worth unpacking, and Amis provides readers with a pocket account of the historical preconditions of his extravagant fame. In the Thatcher years, he writes, “the newspapers had been getting fatter and fatter (first the Sundays, then the Saturdays, then all the days in between) and what filled these extra pages was not additional news but additional features. And the featurists were running out of people to write about — running out of alcoholic actors, ne’er-do-well royals, depressive comedians, jailed rock stars, defecting ballet dancers, reclusive film directors, hysterical fashion models, indigent marquises, adulterous golfers, wife-beating footballers and rapist boxers. The dragnet went on widening until journalists, often to their patent dismay, were writing about writers: literary writers.” In other words, the gossip-hungry public of the 1990s was treated to news about Martin Amis’s dental work, his divorce and his preferences in agents and real estate because tabloid science had not yet discovered the Kardashians. I’m not sure I buy the theory, or that it’s meant to be bought, but it is certain that Amis, who also happens to be the son of a famous British novelist (and thus “the only hereditary novelist in the Anglophone literary corpus”), has been subjected to the kind of attention that his fellow Brooklyn scribblers, hunched over their laptops and cortados from Bushwick to Red Hook, can hardly imagine. As any thrifty novelist would, he has sometimes turned that scrutiny into fuel for his work, fictional and otherwise. Some of the essays, reviews and reported articles collected in “The Rub of Time” — including two miniature anthologies of questions posed in The Independent by fans, gawkers and haters — take Amis’s household-name status as an occasion or a theme. But the deep subject of this book, what holds its disparate bits together and makes it worth your time even if you have only the vaguest idea of who its author is supposed to be, is not celebrity at all. It’s professionalism. Each of the 44 pieces is tagged with the name of the publication, including this one, that first commissioned and paid for it. The range of topics — literary and sporting, personal and political — provides a map of what various editors over the years thought Amis might be interested in. Or (not quite the same thing) what they thought their readers might be interested in Amis on. I’m not snarking, I’m admiring. We can quibble about whether the ability to turn out a predetermined quantity of lucid, witty, sometimes moving, rarely boring prose on assignment and on deadline should be classified as a talent or a skill — I’m here to tell you it isn’t easy — or about whether thinky journalism is an art or a craft. What seems to me beyond argument is that Amis is good at it. He is especially good at literary criticism. The best parts of “The Rub of Time” are devoted to his two favorite novelists, Vladimir Nabokov and Saul Bellow (whom he calls his “Twin Peaks”). Amis’s affection for them is hardly news, and there is some repetition among the essays, but they serve as vaccines against cynicism, as reminders that affection is a powerful engine of critical inquiry. Bellow he adores without qualification: “I hereby trumpet the prediction that Bellow will emerge as the supreme American novelist.” Nabokov, arguably a more pervasive influence, is a more complicated case. Amis has never been able to finish “Ada,” and he notes with measured distaste that Nabokov’s imagination, in his later years, “insufficiently honored the innocence … of 12-year-old girls,” adding, “This leaves a faint but visible scar on the leviathan of his corpus.” "
740,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Out on the hardwood, toward a far corner of the gym, crouches a 70-year-old man, thin and bespectacled, with a crook in his back, a hitch in his step and braces on his wrists to protect them from bullet passes. He is drilling a quartet of Golden State Warriors, each young enough to be his grandson. At 5 feet 11 inches, Ron Adams is in a land of giants. Methodically, he orders centers and forwards, most of them nearly a foot taller, through defensive maneuvers and a shooting workout. His boss, Steve Kerr, eyes him intently, then smiles like a gambler admiring someone who is beating the odds. “I could watch him run drills all day,” Kerr says. “Seventy years old and still at it!” Adams was in his mid-60s when Kerr, the Warriors’ head coach, hired him away from the Boston Celtics, where he was the lead assistant coach. What Kerr wanted was a venerable wise man, someone who had coached for decades but had no real desire to be promoted. Someone who would thus be free to speak his mind — like Tex Winter, who was Phil Jackson’s assistant in the 1990s when Kerr starred on the Chicago Bulls’ championship-winning teams. In the summer of 2014, Kerr took Adams to dinner at A16, a trendy, red-brick restaurant in Oakland. Adams, who reads literature and poetry and likes fine wine, ordered a bottle of pinot noir for the table. The waiter poured a bit for him to try. He swirled it in his glass and took a sip. “That tastes nothing like a pinot,” he said, insisting the waiter bring another bottle. “He sent the wine back!” Kerr recalls. He chuckles at the memory. “Ron is the first and only guy I have ever seen who sent the wine back!” “I’m thinking,” he adds, with an expletive for emphasis, “‘Who is this guy?’ “I wanted a truth-teller, somebody to tell me, ‘You gotta do this, and you gotta do that,’ completely unfiltered,” Kerr says. “Somebody whose experience and wisdom made everyone stand up and listen. I knew right then that we were talking to the right guy, and I’m just thankful we have him because he’s been instrumental in all that we’ve done. "

Stephen Colbert is outraged that the Trump administration has not authorized the National Security Agency to fully investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Mike Rogers, the head of the N.S.A., said he was still waiting for the president to give him the authority to look into Russian interference more deeply. Colbert took Trump to task, making a reference to his tweetstorm earlier that day, in which the president called the continuing Russia investigation a “witch hunt.” Jimmy Fallon responded sarcastically to the news that Trump is already planning for 2020. Seth Meyers took a critical look at how the Trump administration is handling the opioid epidemic. Bruce Willis crashed an installment of Freestylin’ With the Roots.

745,"Steven Pinker doesn’t just want you to be happy; he wants you to be grateful too. His new book, “Enlightenment Now,” is a spirited and exasperated rebuke to anyone who refuses to concede that the world is becoming a better place. “None of us are as happy as we ought to be, given how amazing our world has become,” he writes. “People seem to bitch, moan, whine, carp and kvetch as much as ever.” In the United States, this spectacular ingratitude is lamentably bipartisan, he says, shared by anti-establishmentarians on both sides who refuse to see the light: “Left-wing and right-wing political ideologies have themselves become secular religions, providing people with a community of like-minded brethren, a catechism of sacred beliefs, a well-populated demonology and a beatific confidence in the righteousness of their cause.” Of course, Pinker’s confidence in the righteousness of his own cause may come across as similarly beatific (he’s an atheist who’s confident enough to use the word “blessed” without a hint of irony), but as he repeatedly tells us, the evidence is on his side. Scientific discovery and technological developments have ensured that “everything is amazing.” He’s merely expounding the obvious. Not so obvious, though, that he didn’t need to write a 550-page book to make his case. Pinker is a scientist — a psychologist, to be exact — and he prides himself on being thorough, valiantly fighting “progressophobia” with his voluble sentences and a fusillade of data. When he published “The Better Angels of Our Nature” in 2011, he believed he unequivocally showed that modernity and liberal Enlightenment values had made people less violent, and so he was taken aback by skeptical reviews that had the temerity to question his research methods or his conclusions. “I had thought that a parade of graphs with time on the horizontal axis, body counts or other measures of violence on the vertical, and a line that meandered from the top left to the bottom right would cure audiences” of their delusions and “persuade them that at least in this sphere of well-being the world has made progress,” he recalls near the beginning of “Enlightenment Now.” But Pinker’s inability to “cure audiences” and “persuade them” doesn’t mean he has reconsidered his rhetorical approach; 300 pages after bemoaning those poor souls who read “Better Angels” and weren’t bowled over by his panoply of statistics, Pinker doubles down with still more data. “We have seen six dozen graphs that have vindicated the hope for progress by charting the ways in which the world has been getting better,” he writes. To that end, Pinker offers numbers to show that the world has, on the whole, become safer, healthier and wealthier. These benefits are more pronounced in the West, but even in developing countries conditions have improved through impressive public health advances, including better maternal care and vaccination programs. Whereas many people used to die from something so basic as lack of access to food, today rates of chronic undernourishment and catastrophic famines are on the decline. His optimism is resilient. Pinker expresses mild alarm about climate change, but he has faith in carbon pricing, nuclear energy and other proposals that “have been bruited about.” He also shows a modicum of concern about inequality, though he says we mistakenly conflate “inequality with unfairness,” when disparate outcomes should be “seen as a harbinger of opportunity, a sign that education and other routes to upward mobility might pay off.” "
746,"WASHINGTON — The United States-led campaign to hunt down the last pockets of Islamic State militants in Syria has lost its most effective battleground partner in what American military officials fear will stall a critical phase of the offensive and leave open the door for hundreds of foreign fighters to escape. Thousands of Kurdish fighters and commanders who make up the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces in recent weeks have diverted to defend Afrin, in Syria’s northwest, where other Kurdish militia are facing sharp attacks from Turkish troops. The Kurdish-led S.D.F. was the driving force last fall in routing the Islamic State from its self-proclaimed headquarters in Raqqa and chasing insurgents fleeing south along the Euphrates River Valley to the Iraqi border. That fight now is largely reliant on Syrian Arab fighters who make up a majority of the S.D.F. but lack the Kurds’ military organization and logistical prowess. In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of United States Central Command, described the S.D.F. as “the most effective force on the ground in Syria against ISIS.” “And we need them to finish this — to finish this fight,” General Votel told the House Armed Services Committee. "
747,"Here are two stories about corporate America’s current role in our politics and common life. In one, the country’s biggest companies are growing a conscience, prodded along by shifts in public opinion and Donald Trump’s depredations and their own idealistic young employees, and becoming a vanguard force for social change — with the recent disassociations from the N.R.A. by major airlines and rental car companies just the latest example in a trend that also includes recent high-profile corporate interventions on immigration and gay and transgender rights. In the other story, corporate America just performed another bait and switch at the common good’s expense — making a show of paying bonuses and raising wages after the passage of the corporate-friendly Republican tax bill, but actually reserving most of the tax savings for big stock buybacks, enriching shareholders rather than employees in an economy where wage growth still disappoints. These are not two stories, though; they’re different aspects of the same one. Corporate activism on social issues isn’t in tension with corporate self-interest on tax policy and corporate stinginess in paychecks. Rather, the activism increasingly exists to protect the self-interest and the stinginess — to justify the ways of C.E.O.s to cultural power brokers, so that those same power brokers will leave them alone (and forgive their support for Trump’s economic agenda) in realms that matter more to the corporate bottom line. In every era and every political dispensation, businessmen ask themselves: What am I required to do to make money unmolested by the government? Between the Depression and the 1950s, threatened by Communism and facing powerful unions and a New Deal-era majority willing and able to regulate and redistribute, corporate America reconciled itself to a family wage for its male-breadwinner workers and a certain modesty in how its upper echelons were paid and how conspicuously they consumed. There was a sincere patriotism woven in to this model, but also a lot of self-interest. The system defined by the so-called Treaty of Detroit, the labor-management agreements struck between Walter Reuther and the Big Three automakers, was well-intentioned but also self-interested, a necessary-seeming concession to political trends that might have threatened corporate independence and profits even more. Over time, though, free trade and globalization and deindustrialization made that postwar system less economically viable; the decline of labor and the collapse of the New Deal coalition made it less politically necessary; and the cultural revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s made its implicit moral values (heteronormativity for workers, a kind of penny-pinching puritanism for bosses) seem less congenial and more oppressive. And so we entered a period of corporate hegemony in both political parties, with fewer political compromises required for doing business. "

749,"Two of the nation’s leading gun sellers, Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, took steps on Wednesday to limit their sales of firearms, thrusting themselves into the middle of the polarizing national debate over gun control. Walmart, the biggest gun seller, announced late in the afternoon that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age. It also said it would no longer sell items resembling assault-style rifles, including toys and air guns. Early in the day, Dick’s said it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would also require any gun buyer to be at least 21, regardless of local laws. Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms. The dual announcements, made two weeks after 17 students and staff members were killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., were among the most significant actions taken on guns by corporate America. Both retailers said their decision were a response to the shooting. Earlier, President Trump met at the White House with a bipartisan group of lawmakers and called for a series of gun control measures, some of which the National Rifle Association has vigorously opposed.

They think of themselves as empiricists, Ross wrote, but they’re actually close-minded about several powerful forces for good, starting with religion. “When people and societies are genuinely curious,” he continued, “they are very reasonably curious about everything, including things happening in their bodies and their consciousness and more speculative realms.” The column reminded me of a pattern that, as a secular liberal myself, I’ve long found inconvenient: Religion is correlated with a lot of healthy behaviors and positive outcomes. All else equal, religious people have higher educational attainment, earn more money, use drugs and alcohol less and commit fewer crimes, according to a long line of social-science studies (that have frequently been done by secular liberals). The question about these findings is the old correlation-causation question: Does religious faith lead to these healthy behaviors? Or is something else, independent of faith, causing them? A clever new study tries to offer some answers. It’s not anywhere near the last word on the matter, obviously, but it is intriguing. The three economists who conducted the study sound like something out of a bad bar joke, as one of them, Dean Karlan, remarked to me: “an atheist, an evangelical Christian and an agnostic Jew.” To do the research, they partnered with an evangelical anti-poverty group, International Care Ministries, in the Philippines. The group taught 15 weeks of classes to more than 6,000 very poor Filipinos. Some of the students received a version that combined religious teachings with advice on health and employment. Others received only the nonreligious parts. By comparing the different batches of students, the economists hoped to isolate the effect of religion. The results: Six months later, those who received the religious education indeed reported feeling more guided by religion. They were also earning more money, largely by shifting from agricultural work to higher-paying jobs, such as fishing or self-employment. And even small pay increases can be a big deal for people living in extreme poverty. The results did come with some contradictions. Several other measures of well-being, like food consumption, didn’t change. A few measures, like the frequency of arguments with relatives, looked worse for the religious group. But crosscurrents like these are normal in academic work. Overall, the findings are “cautiously positive” for the power of religion, said Karlan, a professor at Northwestern (and the self-identified agnostic Jew). No study is definitive. But I do find the overall evidence of religion’s ancillary benefits to be strong. That evidence hasn’t made me personally religious. I’m still quite comfortable with my secularism. But the evidence has made me more humble and open-minded about how the world can go about solving some of its problems. You can read more about the study at the Innovations for Poverty Action website. In addition to Karlan, the researchers are James Choi of Yale and Gharad Bryan of the London School of Economics. The researchers are continuing to follow the people in the study. Speaking of correlation and causation, Paul Krugman has a short bonus column (known in the old days as a blog post) on “the very bad, no good job much of the media initially did” covering the effects of the Trump tax cut.

752,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It’s not only housing prices that are sky high in San Francisco. The city’s public defender, Jeff Adachi, is leading a campaign to highlight what one study found were among the highest bail levels in the state. “The judges here set bails like they are announcing the next jackpot in the lottery,” Mr. Adachi said. “It’s typical to see $50,000 or a $100,000 bail.” In January, Mr. Adachi was emboldened by a California Court of Appeal decision that cast doubt on the practice of setting bail above what defendants can pay. The ruling says a “defendant may not be imprisoned solely due to poverty.” The case that prompted the landmark ruling involved Kenneth Humphrey, 64, who was accused of following a 79-year-old disabled man into his apartment in San Francisco, threatening to put a pillow case over his head and demanding money. Mr. Humphrey, who has a history of substance abuse and multiple prior felony convictions, stole $5 and a bottle of cologne from the man. Bail was set at $600,000 and then reduced to $350,000, neither of which Mr. Humphrey could pay. The appeals court ordered that Mr. Humphrey be given a new bail hearing where the court “determines his ability to pay” and “considers non-monetary alternatives.” The repercussions of the case are being felt in bail hearings throughout California, where lawyers are citing the Humphrey precedent. "
753,"WASHINGTON — The long-simmering friction between President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions erupted into an extraordinary public face-off on Wednesday as the investigation into Russia’s election interference roiled the administration and raised new questions about the independence of law enforcement agencies. Mr. Trump excoriated Mr. Sessions for not ordering his own investigation into the handling of the Russia inquiry during its early months, calling his attorney general “DISGRACEFUL” in a lacerating Twitter post. Mr. Sessions, who has absorbed blows from the White House since last year mostly in silence, responded with a rare statement defending his “integrity and honor.” The back-and-forth, unthinkable in previous administrations, came during a week of unrest at the White House. As the president railed about the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, was stripped of his top-secret security clearance. One of Mr. Trump’s closest aides, Hope Hicks, announced that she will step down as communications director. And Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman was back in court pleading not guilty to new charges. The schism between Mr. Trump and his attorney general has become a persistent subplot of his administration, an almost Shakespearean rift between a president and one of his earliest and strongest supporters. Mr. Sessions was the first senator to back Mr. Trump’s candidacy but has fallen out of favor because the president wanted an attorney general who would protect him and investigate his political enemies. The two rarely speak except in formal meetings, and both sides describe the relationship as broken. In between the president’s tweet and Mr. Sessions’s response on Wednesday, the two stood awkwardly yards apart at a Capitol memorial service honoring the Rev. Billy Graham. Mr. Trump later fumed in the Oval Office about Mr. Sessions’s statement, according to advisers, once again leaving the attorney general’s fate in question. But the president’s options are constrained, advisers said, because he recognizes that he would have a difficult time winning Senate confirmation for a replacement. Mr. Sessions served there for 20 years, and his former colleagues have bristled at Mr. Trump’s attacks. Any dismissal of Mr. Sessions would be taken by Democrats and even some Republicans as an effort to seize control of the Russia investigation and could trigger a bipartisan backlash. "
754,"WASHINGTON — The line of mourners snaked through the Capitol: little children resting on their parents’ shoulders, retirees from North Carolina, the manager of a recreational vehicle dealership who flew in from Houston, the leader of a Muslim Boy Scout troop in Virginia. They filed past the plain pine plywood coffin in the grand Capitol Rotunda, some weeping, most in quiet contemplation. “I feel like he’s the Martin Luther King of our day,’’ said Sam Bass, 36, the recreational vehicle salesman, gazing at the simple coffin. “He was like Jesus for us,’’ said Diane Busby, 57, who came with a group of friends from Edmond, Oklahoma. “He” was the Rev. Billy Graham, who died last week at the age of 99 and on Wednesday became only the fourth private citizen in American history to lie in honor at the United States Capitol, as politicians including President Trump, along with hundreds if not thousands of ordinary Americans, came to pay their respects. “Today in the center of this great chamber lies legendary Billy Graham, an ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God’s grace,” Mr. Trump said in brief remarks during a morning memorial service, before laying a wreath at the coffin of Mr. Graham. Mr. Graham’s global ministry included close relationships with presidents since Harry Truman. His legacy includes an outsize influence on the life of America by encouraging millions of evangelical Christians to be engaged in social and political activism. "
755,"SAN FRANCISCO — A top federal official likened Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland to a “gang lookout” on Wednesday, saying her warning of an impending, large-scale arrest operation had given immigrants in the United States illegally the opportunity to flee. Ms. Schaaf had announced on Saturday that she had learned through “unofficial channels” that the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, was planning arrests in the area. “I know that Oakland is a city of law-abiding immigrants and families who deserve to live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportation,” she said in a statement that circulated widely on social media over the weekend. “I believe it is my duty and moral obligation as mayor to give those families fair warning when that threat appears imminent.” The mayor’s warnings proved correct. Since Sunday night, ICE officers have arrested more than 150 people in Northern California in an operation ICE said was targeting “public safety threats.” But ICE officials said the mayor’s warning jeopardized officers’ safety, and said that hundreds more undocumented immigrants they had planned to arrest may have eluded the agents after the tip-off. In a statement, the agency’s acting director, Thomas D. Homan, called Ms. Schaaf’s announcement a “reckless decision” made for political purposes. Speaking on Wednesday morning on Fox News, Mr. Homan said Ms. Schaaf’s warning was “no better than a gang lookout yelling ‘Police!’ when a police cruiser comes in the neighborhood, except she did it to an entire community.” The fight between ICE officials and Ms. Schaaf added a fresh layer of acrimony to a battle between the Trump administration, which has stepped up efforts to detain and deport unauthorized immigrants, and California officials determined to resist the president’s agenda. State laws passed in the last year limit the ability of local police to cooperate with federal immigration officials, and require employers to warn their workers whenever ICE makes a request for employee paperwork, which could give any undocumented employee the chance to leave before federal agents detect their presence. President Trump, meanwhile, has singled out California for attacks and derision, saying its policies were letting dangerous immigrants live freely in the United States. Mr. Homan, the ICE chief, had promised to increase enforcement in California, saying in January that the state had “better hold on tight.” James Schwab, a spokesman for ICE in San Francisco, said agents were targeting around 1,000 people in the area, which appeared to be one of the largest operations since Mr. Trump took office. Mr. Homan blamed the mayor’s warning for agents not being able to detain 800 people they had targeted in recent days. One official briefed on the plans for the operation at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, said that ICE agents typically find only about 30 percent of their targets during any large sweep. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the operation, declined to be identified. The 30 percent rate would suggest that while some immigrants may have benefited from the tip-off, it is unlikely that 800 of them did, as Mr. Homan suggested. Immigration advocates have occasionally sought to warn of rumors of impending ICE arrests, but Ms. Schaaf’s decision was striking because it came from the mayor of one of California’s largest cities. Ms. Schaaf, the mayor since January 2015, has been a strong promoter of Oakland’s diversity, including its large population of immigrants, who make up around a third of the city’s 420,000 residents. In an interview on Wednesday, the mayor said she did not regret her decision to issue advance warning. “I still contend that what I did was both legal and moral,” she said, batting away a suggestion made during Mr. Homan’s appearance on Fox News that she could have obstructed justice. “I did not provide any specific detail that could have endangered law enforcement.” A Bay Area liberal standard-bearer in a decidedly liberal city, Ms. Schaaf has been an unshrinking critic of Mr. Trump, whom she has called the “bully in chief.” She said she interpreted the raids as both racist and politically motivated, targeting liberal California. “The Trump administration and ICE officials have been very transparent that they are retaliating against California for its political position,” she said. The president, she said, “is trying to equate immigrants with dangerous criminals.” Although Ms. Schaaf said she had information that ICE had been targeting people in Oakland, she had not heard of any arrests taking place in the city. Immigrant advocates reported arrests by ICE in Merced, Contra Costa, Sacramento, Monterey and Napa Counties — an area much broader than just the San Francisco Bay Area. On Wednesday, several dozen protesters gathered outside the ICE office in San Francisco, chanting support for undocumented immigrants and writing “KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER” across an intersection. While the Obama administration focused arrest efforts on undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes in the United States, Mr. Trump has made clear that anyone in the country without permission can be arrested. Last year, immigration arrests nationwide rose by more than a third from the previous year, in large part because officers have more freedom to detain unauthorized immigrants with no criminal record. Still, the administration has made a point of highlighting the criminal pasts of undocumented immigrants. Around half of those arrested in Northern California in recent days had previous criminal convictions in addition to immigration violations, said Mr. Schwab, the ICE spokesman. An ICE statement said some had lengthy criminal records, including one, Armando Nuñez-Salgado, whom the agency called a “documented Sureño gang member” who had been deported four times and who over the past 18 years had accumulated convictions — it listed burglary and hit-and-run causing injury — resulting in more than 15 years in prison. Mr. Schwab would not say on Wednesday whether the arrest operation was continuing, but he said the agency would issue a statement once it was completed. "

757,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Dick’s Sporting Goods, one of the largest chains of its kind in the U.S., said today that it was ending sales of all assault-style rifles, and that it would not sell any gun to those under 21, regardless of local laws. The announcement, two weeks after the school shooting in Florida that killed 17 people, is one of the strongest stances taken by corporate America in the national gun debate. Delta Air Lines is among more than a dozen companies that have severed ties with the National Rifle Association since the massacre. Just as quickly, gun rights supporters have criticized the companies for their stance. • The Florida school shooting has also thrust gun control into the spotlight for the midterm elections, although the prospects for change in Congress remain dim, our chief Washington correspondent writes. "
758,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • After a morning of tension and chaos at the White House, President Trump announced stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Dow dropped hundreds of points. The measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the measures next week. The announcement came on the same day that senior officials are to meet with China’s top economic adviser, Liu He, who has been tasked with trying to pre-empt a trade war. _____ • Some of the news distracting President Trump: Our reporters found that a private equity group and a bank had meetings with Jared Kushner in the White House before making large loans to his family’s real estate business. "
759,"When Hope Hicks walked into President Trump’s private study on Wednesday to inform him that she planned to leave the White House — concluding a can’t-make-it-up run in which Ms. Hicks, a woman with zero political experience three years ago, became the closest aide to the most powerful man in the world — the president responded like a father whose daughter had outgrown the nest. According to a person with knowledge of their conversation, Mr. Trump expressed an understanding of Ms. Hicks’s desire to pursue a new phase of her life. But, the person added, he also acknowledged something else: that Ms. Hicks’s happiness in her role had begun to wane lately, after a trying few weeks in the public glare. The departure of Ms. Hicks, arguably the least experienced person to ever hold the job of White House communications director, capped an astounding rise for a political neophyte whose seemingly implausible career hinged on a deep understanding of, and bottomless patience for, her mercurial charge. But as someone with a pull toward discretion — Ms. Hicks, 29, who grew up in the buttoned-up suburb of Greenwich, Conn., the daughter and granddaughter of prominent public relations men — seeing her name splashed across international tabloids had taken a toll. In explaining her decision to friends, Ms. Hicks, a communications director who rarely spoke publicly, made clear that she had no interest in being at the center of the public conversation. That aversion to the spotlight had become increasingly difficult to maintain. Ms. Hicks’s role in helping write a statement by Donald J. Trump Jr. about a 2016 meeting with Russian officials has drawn attention from federal investigators. On Tuesday, she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee and made headlines for admitting that she had sometimes told fibs as part of her job. "
760,"SIDNEY, Ohio — The 8-by-11-inch box sits atop a bookshelf in the district headquarters, as much a part of the office furniture as the manila folders, yearbooks and Webster’s dictionaries. Inside is a semiautomatic Glock handgun with extra magazines, equipment that education leaders here say will prevent this district from suffering the next schoolhouse tragedy. Dispersed throughout the seven school buildings in this rural Ohio district outside of Dayton are dozens of biometric safes, tucked away discreetly in closets and classrooms, only accessible to a designated staff member whose fingerprint can open the box. A bulletproof vest is nearby, in an undisclosed location, fortified to protect against any bullet except one fired from an assault rifle. “We can’t stop an active shooter, but we can minimize the carnage,” said John Scheu, the superintendent of Sidney City Schools. After the latest mass shooting, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last month, President Trump amplified calls to train and arm educators, roiling the teaching profession and infuriating gun control advocates who see yet another inappropriate — and potentially disastrous — duty being heaped on teachers. For all the outcry, though, hundreds of school districts across the country, most of them small and rural, already have. Officials like those here in Sidney do not see the weaponry scattered through their schools as a political statement, but as a practical response to a potent threat. "
761,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Intelligence Committee has concluded that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee were behind the leak of private text messages between the Senate panel’s top Democrat and a Russian-connected lawyer, according to two congressional officials briefed on the matter. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the committee’s Republican chairman, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat, were so perturbed by the leak that they demanded a rare meeting with Speaker Paul D. Ryan last month to inform him of their findings. They used the meeting with Mr. Ryan to raise broader concerns about the direction of the House Intelligence Committee under its chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, the officials said. To the senators, who are overseeing what is effectively the last bipartisan investigation on Capitol Hill into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, the leak was a serious breach of protocol and a partisan attack by one intelligence committee against the other. The messages between Mr. Warner and Adam Waldman, a Washington lawyer, show that the senator tried for weeks to arrange a meeting with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who assembled a dossier of salacious claims about connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. The Senate committee has had difficulty making contact with Mr. Steele, whom it views as a key witness. And Mr. Waldman, who knew Mr. Steele, presented himself as a willing partner. The texts were leaked just days after the same House Republicans had taken the extraordinary step of publicly releasing, over the objections of the F.B.I., a widely disputed memorandum based on sensitive government secrets. Taken together, the actions suggested a pattern of partisanship and unilateral action by the once-bipartisan House panel. Fox News published the texts, which were sent via a secure messaging application, in early February. President Trump and other Republicans loyal to him quickly jumped on the report to try to discredit Mr. Warner, suggesting that the senator was acting surreptitiously to try to talk to Mr. Steele. "
762,"Throughout his presidential campaign Donald J. Trump extolled his business acumen and management skills, and just before his inauguration he insisted the transition to his administration was going “very, very smoothly.” Yet so chaotic was his first year in office that in January, after publication of the Michael Wolff tell-all, “Fire and Fury,” the president had to publicly defend himself as a “stable genius.” The White House suffered a staff turnover rate of 34 percent during Mr. Trump’s first year, a rate that would be unfathomable at nearly any for-profit enterprise. Even by political standards, it’s off the charts — triple that of the Obama administration, and twice that of Ronald Reagan, the previous record-holder — according to a study by the Brookings Institution. And that was before the recent messy departure of Rob Porter as staff secretary in the wake of spousal abuse allegations, or the announcement on Wednesday by the White House communications director Hope Hicks — the fourth person to hold the job — that she, too, was leaving. Now at least one White House faction wants Gary Cohn, the chief economic adviser and National Economic Council director — and a relative island of calm and stability — to replace John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, who was widely criticized for bungling the Porter affair. If so, he would become the president’s third chief of staff in just 14 months. But in this chaotic environment, for every rumor that Mr. Cohn is about to be promoted, there is one that he is about to resign. With over a full year under Mr. Trump’s belt, and his unorthodox management style fully in evidence, I asked several experts to assess the president’s abilities as a manager. “It’s much worse than I expected,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and the author of “Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don’t.” “The most important thing you need as a chief executive is the ability to hire and retain talent,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Trump said he’d get all these great people to work for him. But the rate of departures is unprecedented. Either he hired badly, or he hired well but couldn’t retain them. Either way, this reflects badly on his leadership.” As Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School, told me last year, the time-tested approach is “to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand.” “Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a high-quality solution,” Mr. Polzer said. He added that it “requires an openness to being challenged, and some self-awareness and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do.” Mr. Trump does appear to solicit and consider the opinions of others, but they are as likely to be random guests at Mar-a-Lago, or television pundits, as they are experts in the field, or even his own appointees. “The lack of attention to data drives me nuts,” Mr. Pfeffer said. Mr. Trump, he said, “seems to have no interest in science, social science or data,” citing White House initiatives to repeal Obamacare and to rescue the coal industry as glaring examples. Others pointed to his threats to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with little understanding of the consequences for American businesses and farmers, and his decision to abandon the Paris climate accord despite scant familiarity with the science of climate change. “Nothing about the chaos and turnover in the White House surprises me,” said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “He hasn’t changed in 30 years,” Mr. Elson added. “He isn’t bound by any traditional norms of management.” Yet despite the well-documented disarray prevailing in the West Wing, Mr. Trump’s first year has yielded some major accomplishments: business-friendly tax legislation, the appointment of a reliably conservative Supreme Court justice in Neil Gorsuch, the selection of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the dismantling of a regulatory regime viewed as overly burdensome by the business community. “You have to hand it to him: He has pulled some rabbits out of his hat,” Mr. Elson said. “Hardly anyone thought he could pull off tax legislation after so many other people had tried and failed.” But Mr. Pfeffer said those achievements had occurred despite the chaos, not because of it. For every success, Mr. Trump has had notable failures, starting with overhauling immigration policy and repealing Obamacare. “I’ve long felt that if Trump didn’t do well, it would be because of organizational issues,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Even with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, he hasn’t been able to pass much. That speaks to chaos in the policy sphere.” Mr. Elson said Mr. Trump acted more like the typical entrepreneur than an experienced manager. “A problem with entrepreneurs is that people get tired of it and they move on,” he said. “People just get worn out. At some point you need a real manager. A lot of entrepreneurs sell their businesses when they reach a certain size and they realize they can’t manage them.” Would naming Mr. Cohn as chief of staff ameliorate the problem? Despite disenchantment with Mr. Kelly and his handling of the Porter situation, no one I interviewed thinks Mr. Cohn could fundamentally change the dynamic in the Trump White House any more than Mr. Kelly has. Mr. Cohn is now basking in the afterglow of the tax legislation, which seems to be growing in popularity with the public. His supporters point to the first-rate team he assembled at the National Economic Council as evidence that he — perhaps alone among top White House officials — could attract and retain talent. He enjoys good relations with Congress. But if Mr. Cohn became Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, he would have to sublimate his own beliefs to the president’s agenda. As one former White House official told me, “He can’t pull another Charlottesville,” referring to Mr. Cohn’s efforts last summer to publicly distance himself from the president’s racially charged comments while still working for him. Thanks to that incident, Mr. Cohn has already fallen from favor once, and his current rehabilitation may not last. People like Mr. Trump “have friends for a day,” Mr. Elson said. “That’s another quality of the entrepreneur. Like it or not, it’s part of what makes them successful.” While Mr. Cohn has influential supporters at the White House, talk of his possible elevation has prompted plenty of opposition, too, especially from representatives of Mr. Trump’s populist base. Mr. Cohn is, after all, a longtime Manhattan Democrat. A White House spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Mr. Cohn. In any event, Mr. Trump may be oblivious to the staff turnover and widespread vacancies in the executive branch, and indifferent to calls to replace Mr. Kelly. “I don’t think Trump thinks much about management philosophy,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “He ran for president as a lark, and look at him now. For him it’s all upside.” "

After Visits to the White House” (front page, March 1): I can imagine some of President Trump’s supporters saying: “What is the big deal with foreign leaders trying to influence Jared Kushner? So he has a successful business. So what? It is a win-win for everyone.” It is a measure of the degree that common sense has been eroded that a deep concern about foreign influence in the Oval Office is not more intense and bipartisan. It is as though there is no understanding of the genuinely catastrophic results that can flow from foreign influence in the White House. It raises the question as to what is the difference between the nature and extent of Mr. Kushner’s dealings and the business dealings of his father-in-law. JOE GROSSMAN, BOULDER, COLO. "
765,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea told President Trump on Thursday that he planned to send a special envoy to North Korea as part of his effort to broker talks between the United States and the North on ending its nuclear weapons program. President Moon’s office said he talked with Mr. Trump on the phone on Thursday to discuss joint strategies, based upon the discussions Mr. Moon and his aides have held with senior North Korean officials who visited the South last month to attend the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics in Pyeongchang. “The two heads of state agreed to keep the momentum in South-North Korean dialogue and continue efforts to use it to lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Moon’s office said in a statement. “To that end, President Moon notified President Trump that his government will soon send a special envoy to the North to confirm the discussions it has held with the high-level North Korean delegates.” By sending a special envoy to North Korea, Mr. Moon was also reciprocating the visit to the South by Kim Yo-jong, the sister and trusted aide of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, it said. Mr. Kim sent his sister to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympics last month and to deliver his invitation to Mr. Moon to visit the North for an inter-Korean summit meeting. Mr. Kim sent another high-level delegation, led by his former spy chief, Kim Yong-chol, to attend the closing ceremony on Sunday. The delegates told Mr. Moon that North Korea was willing to start talks with Washington, although it remained unclear whether it was ready to discuss denuclearization, as Washington has demanded. Mr. Moon is eager to use the diplomatic opening created by the Olympics and the visits of the North Korean envoys to help arrange for the United States and North Korea to sit down for talks, as well as to improve inter-Korean relations. "
766,"WASHINGTON — Settling into a red chintz high-backed chair a week ago at Off the Record, the subterranean bar in the Hay-Adams hotel across from the White House that teems with so many of the capital’s mandarins, the British politician Nigel Farage surveyed the room over a Tanqueray gin and tonic. “I feel very, very at home here,” he declared in his gravelly voice. “I might come out of J.F.K. and someone will say something a little bit nasty to me and I might get a comment walking down the street that’s a bit juicy, but there’s no more than that.” The political class here is more live-and-let-live, Mr. Farage believes, than in England, where he has been pelted with eggs, received death threats and had his children bullied following his effective advocacy of Brexit. “You go into a bar like this at night and they’re out drinking, meeting people,” said Mr. Farage, who is 53 and confirmed a separation from his wife last year. “In Britain they’d be going, ‘Oh my God, we’ll be on the front page of the Sunday papers!”’ It wasn’t nighttime, but 4:30 in the afternoon — well into happy hour by English standards. Drinking at the next table were Arron Banks, the businessman who was a major financier of the Brexit campaign, and Andy Wigmore, a spokesman for the movement to leave the European Union, as well as Mr. Farage’s press agent and his radio producer. The self-proclaimed “Bad Boys of Brexit” were in town for the Conservative Political Action Conference, where Mr. Farage was to be a keynote speaker the next day, just a few hours after President Trump spoke. Since touching down at Dulles airport 24 hours earlier, he had had dinners, speeches, very little sleep, some “Fox & Friends” banter in the morning and lots of afternoon CPAC selfies with hordes of young conservatives who idolize him. This was Mr. Farage’s third time attending the conference. This year, he said, “there’s a lot of energy. More energy and optimism on the whole than there would have been three weeks ago. I think Trump’s had a relatively good two or three weeks.” Even with high-school students staging protests against gun laws in front of the White House? “O.K., look, there is an enormous cultural divide between England and America on guns,” Mr. Farage admitted. “I think, you know, the concept of bump stocks, just bizarre. Just bizarre that that should be allowed. And I’m a little surprised it’s taken so long since Vegas for some of these things to get said. And should there be scrutiny on people that go in the shops and want to buy high-velocity rifles? Of course there should.” He wondered if all schools in America will soon become “like Heathrow Airport,” with metal detectors and armed security. But characteristically, he praised Mr. Trump. “At least that conversation is happening. I think that’s what he’s doing.” Mr. Farage is perhaps the president’s closest ally in England. When he was in town this time last year, he dined with the president, the first lady, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, at Trump Hotel. (Mr. Farage gets some precious face time and a photo-op with the president this week, too, backstage at CPAC.) Curiously, this special relationship has not endeared him to the British establishment in D.C.; when the embassy had a party for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Farage was not among the hundreds who received an invitation, despite the fact that he is in town half a dozen times a year, by his own assessment. And the same month Mr. Trump won the election, he tweeted that Mr. Farage should be named ambassador to the United States, sending the British government into an uproar. “I’m persona non grata,” Mr. Farage said, with some pride. “The embassy here basically regrets Brexit and Trump. They won’t say so, but they do. It’s obvious. So the idea that the British embassy would not talk to me given my relationship with the president and with the people around him is, I do not necessarily think, in our national interest. But others can make their own minds up about that.” He agreed that foreign relations between the White House and 10 Downing Street, the headquarters of British government, have only grown frostier in recent months. But not because of Mr. Trump, he insisted. “He has reached out, he’s offered the hand of friendship, and frankly we’ve spurned him,” Mr. Farage said. In November President Trump was criticized by the British prime minister, Theresa May, after sharing violent anti-Muslim videos from a fringe British ultranationalist group on Twitter. He reacted defensively. Mr. Farage dismissed this episode as “a hysterical load of rubbish,” pointing out that Mr. Trump was simply sharing something he discovered through the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, one of only 45 people Mr. Trump follows on Twitter. The anti-Trump sentiment is “not representative of the entire U.K.,” Mr. Farage said. It’s certainly widespread, though: During Mr. Trump’s first month in office, a petition to block him from making his first official state visit to England was signed more than a million times, at one point by more than a thousand people per minute. If it were up to Mr. Farage, he would circumvent the British government entirely, rent out Wembley Stadium, invite Mr. Trump to speak, charge 20 pounds a ticket and donate the proceeds to charity. “Knockout,” he said gleefully. “Are people going to protest against raising money for charity? They can if they want to!” Back home, the political party that Mr. Farage headed for years and used to orchestrate Brexit, UKIP, voted last week to oust its leader, Henry Bolton, after it was revealed that his girlfriend had made racist remarks about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s bride-to-be. “I don’t get it,” Mr. Farage said, shaking his head angrily. “I think Meghan Markle adds glamour and sparkle to the royal family.” He thinks the royal wedding, and the fact that Ms. Markle is American, will be good for the country. “Harry is regarded as Mr. Cool, and it further strengthens the Anglo-American relationship, so it gets ticks from me all the way around.” Mr. Farage’s staunchest supporters have called for him to again lead UKIP, once referred to by David Cameron, the former British prime minister, as the party of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists.” (Mr. Farage considers this his very own “basket of deplorables” moment.) Would he consider running the party again? “No,” he said, flatly, claiming he has aged out of party politics. Still, Mr. Farage retained enough vim to travel in September to Alabama to join an old friend, Steve Bannon, and campaign for Roy Moore in the special Senate election. The accompanying Breitbart headline read: “Brexit Hero Farage in Alabama: Judge Roy Moore ‘Not Going to Be Sucked Into the Swamp.’” After Mr. Bannon was quoted accusing Donald Trump Jr. of treason in the book “Fire and Fury,” he was defenestrated from the tallest tower of castle Breitbart and denounced on the The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page by the right-wing megadonor Rebekah Mercer, whose father, Robert, reportedly has ties to Mr. Farage. (He refuses to elaborate on this relationship.) Mr. Farage still speaks positively about Mr. Bannon but says that he has not talked to him since his ouster from Trumpworld. “Things have gone rather wrong in the last few months,” he said. Still, Mr. Farage says he doesn’t regret throwing his support behind Mr. Moore and grows testy when pressed on this. “All my staff know I’ve got what I call the ‘seven out of 10 rule.’ As long as I’m right seven times out of 10 in politics, it will be O.K. You can’t get everything right.” Mr. Farage may soon have another reason to stick around the United States, particularly California. There has been talk of “Brexit: The Movie” and Mr. Farage says he has taken several Hollywood meetings. “It is quite a good little story,” he said. “It’s a real David versus Goliath story, isn’t it? And don’t forget how long this took. I used to joke that I was the Billy Graham of Euroskeptic politics, just touring the country speaking.” He looks up and notes: “And I see he’s died in the last 24 hours. What an amazing man. I love him. Just fantastic.” Kevin Spacey was among the actors mentioned as a possibility to play Mr. Farage. “That may well have changed,” he said with a devilish grin. Besides, “the only person who could possibly do it is me.” "
767,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was taunted with hisses, heckles and profanity during a lecture and moderated discussion at U.C.L.A. this week. Protesters were carried out by armed police officers. A sixth grader in the audience questioned him about the fairness of passing permanent tax cuts for companies and expiring cuts for individuals. But the official video footage of the university’s Arnold C. Harberger Lecture, hosted by the Burkle Center for International Relations, is nowhere to be found. That is because Mr. Mnuchin took the unusual step of revoking his consent for it to be released given the contentiousness of the event. “The Burkle Center and Treasury Department officials had an agreement to post the video of Secretary Mnuchin’s lecture at U.C.L.A. to the center’s website following the event,” said Peggy McInerny, a university spokeswoman. “Treasury Department officials subsequently withdrew their consent to post the video.” Although Mr. Mnuchin did not want to give additional publicity to those who disrupted him, the shielding of the video has drawn more attention to the series of tense exchanges. Snippets of the scene that were captured on cellphones have ricocheted around social media in the days since the event. American Public Media’s “Marketplace,” whose host, Kai Ryssdal, moderated the discussion, published the complete audio. Mr. Mnuchin was clearly agitated by such vocal dissent. At one point, as the hissing grew more audible, he shot back and said, “I’m dealing with students, I forgot,” and remarked of the protesters, “I think they’re going to get more tired than I am.” He also took issue with the line of questioning from Mr. Ryssdal, who at one point suggested that the Treasury Department engineered the economic growth estimates in the analysis of its tax plan. “Well, you must seem to have a bias because you’re using the words ‘engineered,’” Mr. Mnuchin said. The protests were organized by Lara Stemple, a U.C.L.A. law professor, and students and faculty members participated. Outside the event, demonstrators dressed as Louis XVI of France and Marie Antoinette, and cut cake. The incident shows the difficulty that Trump administration officials can face when traveling to progressive enclaves like Los Angeles. Late last year, a box of horse feces was left for Mr. Mnuchin, a former Hollywood film investor, near the residence he maintains in the city. The Treasury Department pushed back against criticism that Mr. Mnuchin was not being transparent by barring the release of the university’s copy of the video. “The event was open to the media and a transcript was published,” a Treasury spokeswoman said. “He believes healthy debate is critical to ensuring the right policies that do the most good are advanced.” "
768,      
769,"President Trump announced today that his administration would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, on the grounds that other countries’ trade practices endanger American national security by undermining domestic production. Here’s what you need to know. It is simply a tax placed on some particular class of imported goods. If the Trump administration follows through on the president’s comments Thursday, a company bringing $100,000 of steel made in Canada into the United States would have to pay $25,000 to the government, effectively increasing its price. Tariffs are typically a governmental tool to protect domestic industries and raise revenue. The president made the announcement at an event that was pulled together hastily, and while his preferences were broadly known, some congressional Republicans and business lobbyists were still taken by surprise. By Thursday afternoon, many allies of the president were imploring him to change his mind (the new tariffs are set to go into effect next week). Although President Trump’s criticisms of trading practices by China and other countries have been a hallmark of his years in public life, it appears the details of this policy have not been fully worked through. The White House offered no real implementation details. American steel and aluminum companies have long complained of unfair practices by overseas competitors, especially Chinese state subsidies that encourage production. This can flood the global marketplace with metals, depress prices and make American production less economical than it otherwise would be. American trade officials have sought redress in various ways, including a decision by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 to impose steel tariffs of up to 30 percent. But that was a more narrowly targeted law aimed at safeguarding domestic industries harmed by imports (the Trump administration has used that provision to impose tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines). "
770,"Criticism of the former Broward County sheriff’s deputy Scot Peterson has been intense since last week, when Sheriff Scott Israel revealed that Mr. Peterson remained outside taking cover while the shooting rampage unfolded inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17. Mr. Peterson was the only armed sheriff’s deputy at the school when the shooting erupted. President Trump called Mr. Peterson a “coward” last week and on Monday said he himself would have rushed into the school to save the students “even if I didn’t have a weapon.” Mr. Peterson defended himself, saying in a statement released by his lawyer that he thought the gunfire originated from outside and reacted accordingly by waiting for the suspect there. Because school resource officers have a unique vantage point and unique statutory responsibilities to protect students, The New York Times believes they are an important voice in the debate over school gun violence. We want to better understand their jobs and points of view. If you are a school resource officer, we want to hear from you. "
771,"Fresh off a $69 million Picasso sale, Sotheby’s announced strong fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, with a net income of $76.7 million for the period. The numbers, announced on a conference call by Tad Smith, the president of Sotheby’s, mark an improvement from the $65.5 million earned in the same quarter last year. The adjusted net income for the full year increased to $121.7 million, up from $99.6 million in 2016. “There’s more optimism,” David Schick, the director of research and lead luxury analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said. “This is an old brand that’s bringing a lot of new business practices. Some of those initiatives are starting to bear fruit.” While the art world entered 2017 with constricting markets and anxiety about how the Trump administration would affect American and international sales, markets have largely recovered and are once again bullish. Sotheby’s saw success this year in its efforts to diversify its ventures, including into private sales, financial services, and watches and jewelry. Private sales, in particular, were strong this year, growing by 28 percent to $744.6 million. “Sotheby’s has been a business model focused on auctions,” Mr. Schick said. “But growing private sales allows you to be open every day.” The auction house benefited slightly from President Trump’s tax overhaul — which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent — as well as holding cash abroad. “We will be bringing in the range of $325 million of cash back from our overseas operations at a significantly lower tax rate than we had previously planned,” Mike Goss, Sotheby’s chief financial officer, said in a statement. Throughout the year, Sotheby’s auctions with big names resulted in huge sales: A Basquiat set a record by selling for $110.5 million in May, while a Chagall sold for $28.5 million in November. “We intend to stay the course and continue what we’re doing both strategically and financially,” Mr. Goss said.

774,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. After a morning of tension and chaos at the White House, President Trump announced plans for stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. At a White House meeting, Mr. Trump told a group of executives that he did not want any nation to be exempted from the order. Stocks dropped as the announcement rattled markets. Above, a steel furnace in Germany. ____ 2. How did Fox News get hold of private texts between Senator Mark Warner, above left, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a lawyer linked to Russia? The committee has concluded that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee leaked them. Mr. Warner and his Republican counterpart, Senator Richard Burr, above right, were so perturbed by the leak that they went to House Speaker Paul Ryan and expressed concerns about the direction of the committee under Representative Devin Nunes. The messages show that Mr. Warner sought to meet with Christopher Steele, the former British spy behind a dossier of salacious claims about President Trump’s connections to Russia. ____ 3. The school massacre in Parkland, Fla., reignited calls to train and arm teachers, roiling the profession and infuriating gun control advocates. For all the outcry, though, hundreds of school districts across the country — mostly in smaller, rural towns — are already armed. We went to one such place: Sidney, Ohio, above. Highly trained staff members at local schools there have access to handguns locked in biometric safes. Separately, Georgia lawmakers punished Delta for distancing itself from the N.R.A. by passing a bill without a proposed tax break that would have benefited the airline, one of the state’s biggest employers. On “The Daily,” we talk to our White House reporters about President Trump’s change of heart on gun control and the resignation of his communications director, Hope Hicks. ____ 4. Alberto Carvalho, above, who rose from day laborer to superintendent of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, accepted an offer to become the next New York City schools chancellor. And the next day, he changed his mind, in a dramatic spectacle broadcast live on TV. The sudden turnabout led to cheers in a packed meeting room of the Miami school board — and fury and confusion in New York. ____ 5. The Trump administration is targeting MS-13, the brutal street gang started by Salvadorans in Los Angeles in the ’80s. The authorities say the gang now has 30,000 members, about 10,000 of whom are in the U.S. Above, gang members in a jail in San Salvador. Few dispute the menace that MS-13 presents; its members are known for wielding machetes and killing with abandon. But American police and prosecutors in areas where MS-13 is most active said the heightened focus on the gang has come at the expense of fighting more widespread threats, particularly opioids and human trafficking. ____ 6. President Vladimir Putin of Russia used his annual state of the nation speech to threaten Western nations with a new generation of nuclear weapons, including an “invincible” intercontinental cruise missile. It remains unclear whether that actually exists. ____ 7. China’s National People’s Congress is set to convene. Communist Party censors are scouring the internet to suppress criticism of a proposal, expected to pass, allowing President Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely. Among the unlikely targets: the letter N and images of Winnie-the-Pooh (a frequently used Xi avatar). Above, Mr. Xi and Mao seen on trinkets in a souvenir shop. ____ 8. Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, tried to cancel a $31,000 order for a custom dining room set for his office. The walkback came a day after the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee announced an investigation into his interior decorating. (His agency is facing $6.8 billion in budget cuts requested by the White House.) Mr. Carson claimed no knowledge of the order. ____ 9. The critically acclaimed FX show “Atlanta” begins its second season on Thursday. Our reporter talked to its stars and “brain trust” about fame, race and the Trump presidency. Darkly retitled “Atlanta Robbin’ Season,” the show “builds on an idiosyncratic foundation,” he writes, “without becoming too predictable in its unpredictability.” And yes, our critic really wrote this: “Robbin’ Season” is so good, it’s almost criminal.” ____ 10. Finally, some news from the film world. Our critic called “Red Sparrow,” in which Jennifer Lawrence plays a Russian ballerina turned murderous spy, “preposterously entertaining.” “It helps that Ms. Lawrence, like all great stars, can slip into a role as if sliding into another skin, unburdened by hesitation or self-doubt,” Manohla Dargis writes. “She was born to screen stardom, and it’s a blast to see where it’s taking her.” On Thursday’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Chadwick Boseman, star of “Black Panther,” chats with Trevor Noah.

775,"So you go out for dinner with a wealthy acquaintance. “I’ll take care of everything,” he says, and orders you a hamburger. Then he orders himself an expensive steak and a bottle of wine, which he doesn’t share. And when the waiter comes with the check, he points at you and says, “Charge it to his credit card.” Now you understand the essence of the Trump tax cut, signed into law a little over two months ago. The key thing you need to know is that right now the U.S. government has no business cutting taxes. We need more revenue, not less. Why? The federal government, as an old line says, is a giant insurance company with an army. Most of its costs come from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — and all three programs are becoming more expensive as ever more baby boomers reach retirement age. This means that unless we cut back sharply on benefits that middle-class Americans count on, we will need to raise more revenue than in the past. Yet even before the tax cut, federal tax receipts were looking weak for an economy with low unemployment and a rising stock market — for example, far lower as a percentage of G.D.P. than the tax take during the Clinton boom of the 1990s, and even a bit lower than they were at the end of the Bush-era expansion. The tax cut will push them lower still. Something will have to give. And we already know what will give, if Republicans get their way: programs that benefit working Americans. In fact, the usual suspects like Paul Ryan were talking about the need for “entitlement reform” — meaning cuts in Medicare and Medicaid — to reduce deficits even as they were passing a huge tax cut that will make those deficits much worse. Hence my analogy about the guy who “gives” you a hamburger, then bills it to your credit card. Ryan celebrated the tax cut with a tweet about a teacher saving $1.50 a week on her taxes; that’s like saying you should feel grateful for a “gift” that’s actually being charged to your own credit card. How’s that $75-a-year saving going to look when the teacher finds out that, partly because of that tax cut, her mother’s Medicare plan has been converted into an inadequate voucher system and Medicaid won’t pay for her father’s nursing home care? "
776,"I wonder if I’m wrong on the subject of guns. I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use. The blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines. The people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women’s March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization. The early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states. The losing streak continues. Yet I have to admit that something bigger is going on. It could be that progressives understood something I didn’t. It could be that you can win more important victories through an aggressive cultural crusade than you can through legislation. Progressives could be on the verge of delegitimizing their foes, on guns but also much else, rendering them untouchable for anybody who wants to stay in polite society. That would produce social changes far vaster than limiting assault rifles. Two things have fundamentally changed the landscape. First, over the past two years conservatives have self-marginalized. In supporting Donald Trump they have tied themselves to a man whose racial prejudices, sexual behavior and personal morality put him beyond the pale of decent society. "
777,"President Trump’s vow to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum next week rattled financial markets Thursday. Stocks, which had already been down for the day, slipped further after the White House announced the planned tariffs. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent to 2,682 Thursday afternoon, after falling roughly 2 percent earlier in the day. Shares of automakers such as Ford and General Motors, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply, as the tariffs would raise the cost of raw materials. “Historically, the automakers have to absorb these costs,” said Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS who covers automakers. “Consumers don’t adjust their price expectations based on higher steel prices.” Shares of industrial companies also dropped, led by exporters such as Boeing and United Technologies. On the other hand, some companies that sell industrial metals saw their stock prices rise, with shares of AK Steel up roughly 8 percent and U.S. Steel jumping more than 6 percent. The prospect of a protectionist policy push forced investors Thursday to rethink whether that could derail a global economy that has been growing across the board over the last year. In fact, until Mr. Trump’s comments on Thursday, the prevailing worry for investors seemed to be that economic growth — both in the United States and around the world — was so robust that the Federal Reserve might move quickly to raise interest rates in order to fend off inflation. Those concerns led to a sharp sell-off in the stock market in early February, with the S.&P. at one point down more than 10 percent from its January peak. Mr. Trump’s comments seemed to overshadow those concerns, at least for the moment. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note — which moves in the opposite direction of its price — dropped sharply Thursday as investors scurried to the safety of American government bonds. After flirting with 3 percent in recent weeks, the yield was hovering near 2.80 percent Thursday afternoon. "
778,"PRISTINA, Kosovo — The Grand Hotel in the Kosovar capital of Pristina is regularly reviled in internet reviews. Here’s a sample: “disgusting,” “a ruin” and “an absolute horror. Probably the worst I have ever been at.” But the managers seem unfazed by the online abuse. They do not take web bookings and barely offer access to the internet; their hotel has no email account. A byword for modern opulence when this part of the Balkans was still part of the now defunct Yugoslavia, the state-owned Grand has gone into such a steep decline that even Kosovo’s president, Hashim Thaci, usually an eager booster of everything his country has to offer, struggles to find anything nice to say about it. “I don’t think it is the worst hotel in the world, but that is because the world is very big,” the president said, expressing disbelief when told that I was staying there. When I checked into the 500-room property recently, I was the only guest. With 13 stories and three adjoining concrete blocks in a prime location, the hotel accommodates flocks of pigeons on the upper floors and has rented out its basement, once used as a prison by Serbian paramilitary thugs, to a health club. But it is otherwise deserted, a maze of dimly lit corridors that are littered with pigeon feathers, strung with cobwebs, lined with doors of dark wood and haunted by even darker memories of Kosovo’s past. Two floors have been reduced to rubble, the remnants of a remodeling program that ran out of money. The establishment’s color scheme — lots of mossy green — and dilapidated creepiness would make it an excellent set for a remake of the Coen brothers’ 1991 film “Barton Fink,” which features a similarly deserted hotel in Hollywood. The Grand’s general manager, Rrahim Fazliu, conceded that the place perhaps no longer deserved the five-star rating it has claimed since it was built in 1978. But, he insisted, “with a bit of makeup” it can become a “symbol of success” for a country still struggling to find its stride nearly 20 years after a NATO bombing campaign broke Serbia’s grip on the unruly region. The hotel, Mr. Fazliu added, was a “mirror of Kosovo,” and the image reflected there these days is decidedly less alluring than what had been hoped for when it achieved freedom in 1999. Service is minimal to nonexistent, the marble lobby stinks of cigarette smoke and the green carpeting that covers most of the floors is stained and scarred. And then there are the cockroaches. But to be fair, the Grand deserves better reviews than it gets online. On the two floors kept ready for guests, rooms are kept relatively clean and offer occasional hot water. The few staff that remain try to be helpful, and they are clearly embarrassed by the shabby state of their once respectable establishment. Shurije Abazi, a 58-year-old maid who started working at the hotel a month after it opened four decades ago, still makes sure there are soap and shampoo for guests who no longer exist but who, in a triumph of hope over reality, she thinks will soon return. Along with other ethnic Albanian staff she lost her job in the 1990s, when Serbia’s former dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, began a program of ethnic cleansing. She has no nostalgia for those times but still mourns the hotel’s decay. The president, who has only bad memories of the hotel in the past and despairs at its current condition, harbors big plans for its future. “Perhaps we could build a Trump Tower there,” Mr. Thaci suggested. Before Yugoslavia collapsed in a spasm of bloodletting in the 1990s, he recalled, the Grand was a favorite haunt for communist officials and, after they left, for armed goons bent on keeping Kosovo part of Serbia. Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslavia’s longtime dictator, had a suite on the fourth floor. After Tito died in 1980 and his multiethnic country began to unravel, the Grand soldiered on and even prospered for a time, its occupancy rate lifted by the arrival of foreign journalists and Serb paramilitary gangs that wanted to purge Kosovo of ethnic Albanians, who made up a large majority of the population. Zeljko Raznatovic, a Serbian career criminal and bloodthirsty nationalist fanatic better known as Arkan, commandeered Tito’s old suite while his gunmen put up a sign on the front door barring entry to ethnic Albanians and dogs. On my first day at the hotel on my recent visit, a group of revelers from a grimy nightclub on the top floor took rooms in the middle of the night and boosted the number of guests to five — an occupancy rate of 1 percent, which is about as good as business gets at the Grand these days. “We are ready every day to operate at full capacity but there are no people,” said Mr. Fazliu, the general manager. He works out of a huge office on the second floor equipped with a long wooden conference table, multiple telephones and other relics of better and busier days. Stuck in limbo since the end of the Kosovo war, which brought Mr. Thaci and his comrades in the Kosovo Liberation Army to power, the hotel stands as a bleak monument not only to Kosovo’s painful past but also to its blurry future. Free of Serbian control for nearly 20 years and now celebrating its 10th anniversary as an independent country, Kosovo is itself stuck in limbo, recognized by the United States and most European countries but still denied a seat at the United Nations and routinely harassed by Russia and Serbia. It only recently got its own telephone country code — 383 — while still mostly using codes 377 and 386 borrowed from Monaco and Slovenia. Meanwhile, iPhones do not offer weather reports for Pristina. However, many of the problems plaguing Kosovo — in particular, endemic corruption and shady dealings by former commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army — are of the country’s own making. I had last visited the Grand Hotel on June 12, 1999, the day NATO ground troops first entered Pristina after a 78-day bombing campaign. A jittery receptionist told me then that all the rooms were booked and would be for a long time. The city was then swarming with foreigners looking for a place to stay — Western journalists, military officers, aid workers and European officials. We had all rushed to Pristina to witness the end of Serb hegemony and the birth of what the United States and its European allies hoped would be a prosperous new country firmly anchored in the West and its ways. A critical part of this plan was a crash program to privatize former Yugoslav state assets like the Grand Hotel. Put up for sale in 2006, it was bought by a murky local company that paid just 8 million euros (a little under $10 million at current rates) but promised, as part of the deal, to invest a further 20 million euros. The promised investment never happened, and in 2012 the Kosovo Privatization Agency canceled the sale — and kept the money it had received. Plans to find another buyer then got snarled in a lengthy legal battle after Behgjet I. Pacolli, a Swiss millionaire originally from Kosovo who is now the country’s foreign minister, announced that a company he owned was suing the government over the original sale. The hotel is now in liquidation and its assets, which include a valuable collection of modern art, will be sold or put in a museum so that a new owner can be found and the hotel can be refurbished from scratch. The hotel has more than 500 employees left on the books from the time when Kosovo was controlled by Serbia. The Serbian staff all fled after NATO’s arrival. Around 80 staff, all ethnic Albanians, now show up for work. Mr. Pacolli estimates that it will cost at least $50 million to make the Grand grand again. It is, he added, perhaps not the world’s worst hotel but ranks near the bottom. “It is really terrible,” he said. “How can you stay there? How can anyone stay there?” "
779,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia threatened the West with a new generation of nuclear weapons Thursday, including what he described as an “invincible” intercontinental cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo that could outsmart all American defenses. The presentation by Mr. Putin, which included animation videos depicting multiple warheads aimed at Florida, where President Trump often stays at his Mar-a-Lago resort, sharply escalated the military invective in the tense relationship between the United States and Russia, which has led to predictions of a costly new nuclear arms race. While Mr. Putin may have been bluffing about these weapons, as some experts suggested, he cleverly focused on a vulnerability of American-designed defenses: They are based on the assumption that enemy nuclear missiles fly high and can be destroyed well before they reach their targets. The new class of Russian weapons, he said, travel low, stealthily, far and fast — too fast for defenders to react. Mr. Putin’s announcement, in his annual state of the nation address, seemed intended chiefly to stir the patriotic passions of Russians at a moment when he is heading into a re-election campaign, even though his victory is assured in what amounts to a one-candidate race. He also used the speech to reassure Russians that the military buildup was taking place even as the government was spending big sums to improve the quality of their lives. "
780,"MEXICO CITY — The United States ambassador to Mexico plans to resign from her post in May, according to a memo circulated on Thursday to embassy staff, the latest in a string of senior diplomatic departures from the region — and more broadly from the State Department. The ambassador, Roberta S. Jacobson, 57, served just under two years in the post, after her arrival was delayed by a prolonged confirmation process. Analysts say her departure will be deeply felt by both American and Mexican officials — she was one of the most experienced Latin America experts in the State Department, having spent most of her 31 years there focusing on the region. “I have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,” Mrs. Jacobson wrote in her letter. “This decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.” The Trump administration has selected a nominee to fill Mrs. Jacobson’s vacancy, but has not yet released the name, according to an American official with knowledge of the decision who was not authorized to comment publicly and who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity. Mrs. Jacobson leaves at a tense moment in relations between Mexico and the United States, with President Trump vowing to have Mexico pay to build a wall between the countries, pledging to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement and promising to deport millions of Mexicans who crossed the border illegally. There was also a testy phone call between Mr. Trump and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico that derailed tentative plans for the two leaders to meet after Mr. Trump refused to drop his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall. For Mrs. Jacobson, the ambassadorial post was the culmination of a career largely centered in Washington, where she was most recently the assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs. As a member of the State Department’s Civil Service — as opposed to the foreign service, which typically fills the ranks of diplomats — it was highly unusual for Mrs. Jacobson to have ascended to the top slot in Mexico. But Mrs. Jacobson’s supporters say her extensive experience and connections in the country were crucial assets for Washington at a time of strain between the two neighbors, which have closely intertwined economies. Former President Barack Obama named Mrs. Jacobson to the post in 2015, but a bitter partisan dispute in Congress meant nearly 11 months elapsed before she was confirmed. After she arrived in Mexico City, the honeymoon period did not last long. Mr. Trump’s election abruptly changed the generally warm relations that the United States had developed with Mexico over the last 25 years — ones that Mrs. Jacobson had helped foster through much of her career. Mrs. Jacobson was left working with her Mexican counterparts to assuage growing concern — and anger — at the new president’s tough talk. At the same time, diplomacy on Mexico was being routed through the White House, via the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, which left Mrs. Jacobson with less authority. Officials in Mexico, as well as former colleagues, lamented her departure, calling is the latest blow to strained Mexican-American relations. “No career official has more consummately understood U.S.-Mexico relations,” said Carlos Pascual, a former American ambassador to Mexico and Ukraine. “She grounded American policy in the belief that, as neighbors, the U.S. and Mexico will gain most from using the vast resources of both countries to confront shared problems together.” Mrs. Jacobson will be leaving a State Department that has seen an exodus of foreign service officers. Among those leaving are several high-ranking officials with deep experience in Latin America, including Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the third-highest ranking official in the State Department. Mr. Shannon, the under secretary of state for political affairs who previously served as an ambassador to Brazil, Guatemala and Venezuela, announced his retirement last month. While Mr. Shannon said his decision had been made for personal reasons, the departure of another official, John Feeley, the ambassador to Panama, was more politically tinged. In his resignation letter this year, Mr. Feeley said he was leaving a long career in the government service because he felt he could no longer serve Mr. Trump. In her letter to staff, Mrs. Jacobson focused mostly on the work she and her team had done during her tenure, and did not take any shots at the president. “You have respected everyone you came in contact with — Mexican, American, or from anywhere else, reflecting the better angels of our nature,” she wrote. “You know how great our two countries are. And that we are stronger together.” Mrs. Jacobson began her career at the State Department as a presidential management intern in 1986, during the Reagan administration, after graduating from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Three years later she was transferred to the Western Hemisphere sector, where she remained for practically the rest of her career. Her interest in the area stemmed from the embrace of democracy that spread through the region in the 1980s, just as she was leaving college. She served in numerous roles in Washington, including as deputy secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs for five years before she moved to Mexico, where she was a key broker in the agreement to re-establish relations between Cuba and the United States during the Obama administration.

That is not to say that they aren’t every bit as tantalizing as the wayward adventures of hard-partying tequila drinkers and snow princesses learning to “let it go.” Among this more provocative group are a portrait of immigrant women in New York, a South African protest play, a searing study of infertility and star-stuffed new incarnations of two towering modern American classics, “Angels in America” and “Three Tall Women.” The playwright Martyna Majok has a gift for crawling under the skins of characters who feel marginalized in Donald J. Trump’s America. But as was demonstrated last year by her acclaimed “Cost of Living,” a cleareyed portrait of two prickly souls with severe physical disabilities, Ms. Majok doesn’t host pity parties. In “queens,” a Lincoln Center/LCT3 production, she applies her distinctively poetic brand of empathy to the shifting values and aspirations of two generations of immigrant women, who clash and commune in a basement apartment in the New York borough of the title.

785,"Amy Chua is an uncomfortable presence in American intellectual life. In both her important scholarly works and her candid personal writing, Chua approaches the no-go areas around which others usually tiptoe. The warning alarms burst into “WAH-OH, WAH-OH” — and Chua greets the custodians with a mild, “Oh sorry, was that a taboo?” “Political Tribes,” the newest book from this unconventional writer, is haunted by the events of 2016. Chua’s message: Ethnocultural rivalry powerfully shapes both international relations and domestic policy. Ethnocultural rivalry will not be reasoned away. Its divisions are hard-wired into the human brain. The American reluctance to recognize this truth, Chua continues, derives from the country’s own unique inheritance, which optimistically insists that the nation’s internal divisions can and must be melted down into a shared ideology of Americanism. That inheritance, she argues, blinds Americans to the world around them — and even more ominously, deceives them about the most important trends within their own society. “For 200 years,” Chua writes, “whites in America represented an undisputed politically, economically and culturally dominant majority. When a political tribe is so overwhelmingly dominant, it can persecute with impunity, but it can also be more generous. It can afford to be more universalist, more enlightened, more inclusive, like the WASP elites of the 1960s who opened up the Ivy League colleges to more Jews, blacks and other minorities — in part because it seemed like the right thing to do. “Today, no group in America feels comfortably dominant. Every group feels attacked, pitted against other groups not just for jobs and spoils but for the right to define the nation’s identity. In these conditions, democracy devolves into zero-sum group competition — pure political tribalism.” Chua professes no concern that America will be swept by outright white nationalism. But she does perceive that “a kind of ‘ethnonationalism lite’ is widespread among white Americans today. It does not dream of an all-white America; it opposes racism and celebrates tolerance and exults in the image of America as a ‘nation of immigrants.’ But it is nostalgic for a time when minorities were not so loud, so demanding, so numerous — a time when minorities were more grateful.” Chua sees this, does not like it and hopes something can be done about it. She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship. "
786,"LOS ANGELES — They sold their homes and possessions, quit their jobs, and left their country — they thought for good. The Iranians, mainly members of their nation’s Christian minorities, were bound for a new life in America after what should have been a brief sojourn in Austria for visa processing. But more than a year later, some 100 of them remain stranded in Vienna, their savings drained, their lives in limbo and the promise of America dead. Even as the Trump administration continued to pledge help to religious minorities in the Middle East, many of whom face persecution, the United States denied their applications for refugee status in recent weeks. “It’s unexplainable,” said H. Avakian, 35, an ethnic Armenian Christian who arrived in Austria from Iran 15 months ago and asked that his first name be withheld out of fear for his safety. “Suddenly they said, ‘Now you can’t come.’ We don’t know why.” Mr. Avakian, who hoped to join his brother, Andre, in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview that he and other refugees were running out of money and descending into depression. “Most of us cannot go back to Iran; we’re in complete despair,” he said. Returning to Iran after an attempt to move to the United States would endanger their lives, he and other applicants said, because the government would regard them as enemies of the state. "
787,"WASHINGTON — Early in his term, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed his top investigative deputies to target the transnational gang MS-13 as a priority. A year later, drug task forces have new powers to fight MS-13, more federal prosecutors are pursuing charges against the street gang with ties to El Salvador and foreign allies have been enlisted to capture its members. Few dispute the violent menace that MS-13 is to pockets across the United States. Its members wield machetes, kill with abandon and terrorize — for the most part in immigrant communities. But law enforcement officials at local, state and federal levels describe the Trump administration’s hard-charging campaign against MS-13 as out of proportion with the threat. President Trump has seized on the gang’s brutality and violence to symbolize the risks of illegal immigration. Not all members of MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, are illegal immigrants. Nor does the gang survive on the global trafficking of drugs, guns or people. "
788,"T
here’s a page in a book in a stack on the floor at the house of Leopoldo López that I think about sometimes. It’s a page that López revisits often; one to which he has returned so many times these past few years, scribbling new ideas in the margin and underlining words and phrases in three different colors of ink and pencil, that studying it today can give you the impression of counting the tree rings in his political life. The book is not set out in a way to invite this kind of attention. Almost nobody is allowed to enter the López house, for one thing, being surrounded all day and night by the Venezuelan secret police; but also, for all his flaws and shortcomings, López just isn’t the sort to dress up his library for show. Pretty much every book in the house is piled up in a stack like this one — row upon row of stacked-up books rising six to eight feet from the dark wood floors, these gangly towers of dog-eared tomes, some of them teetering so precariously that when you see one of the López children run past, you might involuntarily flinch. The particular book I have in mind is a collection of political essays and speeches. It was compiled by the Mexican politician Liébano Sáenz, with entries on the Mayan prince Nakuk Pech and the French activist Olympe de Gouges. The chapter that means the most to López begins on Page 211, under the header “Carta a los Clérigos de Alabama.” This is a mixed-up version of the title you know as “Letter From Birmingham Jail,” which was written by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963. King was in Birmingham to lead nonviolent protests of the sort that everybody praises now, but it’s helpful to remember that in 1963, he was catching hell from every quarter. It wasn’t just the slithering goons of the F.B.I. wiretapping his home and office or the ascendant black-nationalist movement rolling its eyes at his peaceful piety, but a caucus of his own would-be allies who were happy to talk about civil rights just as long as it didn’t cause any ruckus. A handful of clergymen in Birmingham had recently issued a statement disparaging King as an outside agitator whose marches and civil disobedience were “technically peaceful” but still broke the law and were likely “to incite to hatred and violence.” On the page in the book at the López house, King fires back. Writing from a cramped cell without a mattress or electric light, he scrawled a response on scraps of paper for his cellmate to smuggle out. Near the top of the page, López has underlined a passage in pencil where King condemns the complacency of “the white moderate” and the suggestion that peaceful protesters are responsible for the violent response of others. “We who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension,” he writes in a passage López marked with green: “We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive.” King then compares civil disobedience to the lancing of a boil, before culminating in a passage that López has flagged at least half a dozen times — with some words underlined in red, others highlighted pink, a handful of phrases boxed in green and three large arrows drawn into the margin beside the words: “Injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates.” At a certain level, it’s unremarkable when a politician studies King, and among the people López tries to emulate, I wouldn’t put King at the top. He is more directly influenced by the former Venezuelan president Rómulo Betancourt or, for that matter, by his own grandfather Eduardo Mendoza, who was Betancourt’s adviser. But when you consider the path that López has followed these past few years in prison, the choices he’s made, the compromises and blunders, the price he has paid to speak his mind and the price now of his silence, if you want to understand the impact of four years in captivity and nine months in solitary confinement, the message from King in Birmingham is a very good place to start. López was arrested in February 2014 after leading a public protest that turned violent. Prosecutors acknowledged in court that López was technically peaceful, but they accused him of inciting others to hatred and violence. Before his arrest, he was among the most prominent and popular opposition leaders in Venezuela. Polling suggested that he could defeat President Nicolás Maduro, the unpopular successor to Hugo Chávez, in a free election. At trial, he was sentenced to 13 years and nine months in prison. Since then, he has become the most prominent political prisoner in Latin America, if not the world. His case has been championed by just about every human rights organization on earth, and he is represented by the attorney Jared Genser, who is known as “the extractor” for his work with political prisoners like Liu Xiaobo, Mohamed Nasheed and Aung San Suu Kyi. The list of world leaders who have called on the Venezuelan government to release López includes Angela Merkel of Germany, Emmanuel Macron of France, Theresa May of Britain and Justin Trudeau of Canada; it is that rarest of political causes on which Barack Obama and Donald Trump are in agreement. In Venezuela, López has become a kind of symbol. His name and face are emblazoned on billboards, T-shirts and banners — but there’s widespread disagreement on precisely what he represents. The Venezuelan government routinely disparages him as a right-wing reactionary from the ruling class who wants to reverse the social progress of chavismo and restore the landed aristocracy; the Venezuelan right, meanwhile, considers López a neo-Marxist, whose proposal to distribute the country’s oil wealth among the people would only deepen the chavista agenda. For three and a half years in prison, López refused to let anyone speak for him. Though he was prohibited from granting interviews or issuing public statements and was often denied access to books, paper, pens and pencils, he managed to scribble messages on scraps of paper for his family to smuggle out, and he recorded a handful of covert audio and video messages denouncing the Maduro government. From time to time, he could even be heard screaming political slogans through the bars of the concrete tower in the military prison where he was kept in isolation. López was released to house arrest last July on the condition that he fall silent. He promptly climbed the fence behind his house to rally a gathering crowd, then issued a video message asking his followers to resist the government. Three weeks later, he was back in prison; after four days, he was released again. Ever since, to the great bewilderment of his supporters, he has vanished from public view. While the country descends into an unprecedented crisis — with the world’s highest rate of inflation, extreme shortages of food and medicine, constant electrical blackouts, thousands of children dying of malnutrition, rampant crime in every province, looting and rioting in the streets — López has said nothing. Today his critics include not just the hard-line left and right but much of the Venezuelan majority that once saw him as a future president. They don’t understand what López is doing inside that house, tucked away on that leafy street in the wealthy suburbs of Caracas, but they suspect that he has grown comfortable there, reunited with his wife and children; that his family’s wealth insulates him from the economic crisis; that the secret police who surround his home protect him from rising crime; and they can’t help wondering if Leopoldo López has finally given up. They know, as he knows, that if he issued a public statement or released another video message, if he climbed the fence behind his house to address his followers again, the secret police would swoop in to haul him back to prison. But López never let the risk of prison stop him before. He would have at least one chance to speak, and they wonder why he hasn’t. There’s a flicker onscreen whenever López connects, then a blur of pixelated color as his face comes into view. On different days, at different times, he can look very different. There are mornings when he turns up in an old sweatshirt with unkempt hair and a weary smile, and others when he appears in a pressed oxford shirt with parted hair and black-rimmed glasses that do nothing whatsoever to obscure the haunted air of a sleepless night. I think of a Saturday in October. It was a few minutes after noon. I was out for a walk with my kids when a message from López popped on my phone. “The situation is very delicate,” he wrote. “I may be on the borderline of going back to prison.” Scrambling home, I opened my laptop and after a minute, he appeared onscreen. López is 46, 5-foot-10 and fit. He was sitting at the desk in his living room with his hair poking off at angles, and the cast of his expression was an admixture of fear, fatigue and fury. When the audio clicked on, I asked what was happening. López took a deep breath. He propped an elbow on the desk and rested his head in his hand. “Last night around 7:30, they came to my house — more than 30 officers of the political police,” he said. “They had more than 10 cars. They closed the entire street. And then they came into my house.” For more than a decade, López has employed a private security detail, as political opponents stormed his events with masks and guns, sprayed his car with bullets and murdered one of his bodyguards. Under house arrest, he is allowed to maintain a small guard outside. During the raid, López said, the police took his chief of security into custody, and no one had heard from him since. “There was absolutely no reason, legally, they could take him, and they have not allowed any lawyers to go in to see him,” López said. He looked down at his desk and shook his head. “So that’s the situation,” he said quietly. “And I wanted to tell you that I’m willing to go forward with this, what we’re doing.” At that point, we had a very different sense of what we might be doing. We had been in contact for only a few weeks. I first reached out to López through an intermediary in August, not long after his return to house arrest, and by September we were talking a couple of times a week, usually for a couple of hours at a time. This was a clear violation of his release. An order from the Venezuelan Supreme Court specifically forbid him to speak with the news media, and we didn’t expect to get away with it. At a minimum, it was safe to assume that his house was bugged for sound, but there were probably hidden cameras as well, and his computer was surely hacked and his internet activity monitored. The world is full of byzantine methods to communicate through encrypted channels, but most of them are obviated for a person who is trapped in a digital glass house and surrounded by the state security of an authoritarian regime. We did what little we could to be discreet, knowing it wasn’t much. Rather than connect on Skype or FaceTime, we used an obscure video service, which seemed at least marginally less likely to be a platform the police had practice hacking. Whenever we spoke, López wore a pair of headphones, so a conventional audio bug would only pick up his side of the conversation, and we adopted the general posture of old friends catching up. This was not as much of a stretch as it may seem. López is three years older than I am and a graduate of Kenyon College, where we briefly overlapped but never met. From time to time, one of us would mention the school or someone we both knew there, and our kids would periodically wander onscreen to wave hello. All of this seemed hopelessly primitive in the face of state surveillance, but then again, it seemed as if it might be working. Once in a while a big white van would appear in front of his house and the connection would go dark, but within an hour or two, the van would leave and we’d get back online. Neither of us could explain why, if government agents were listening, they hadn’t shut us down or come inside to arrest him. There was every reason to believe that they would. In our conversation that day in October, López mentioned that the agents raiding his home had given just one reason: They believed he was talking to a reporter and recording a video message. This led to a curious moment in our conversation, as the recording system on my end of the interview captured his denial. “It’s not true,” he said to anyone listening. “I’ve had no contact with any journalist!” I don’t mean to make light of the situation, but the truth is, we often did. Venezuela was coming off a summer that promised change. In July, the opposition movement sponsored a nonbinding referendum on the government’s plan to rewrite the Constitution. With more than seven million ballots cast, 98 percent of voters opposed the government. Soon after that, emissaries from the government approached opposition leaders to begin a formal negotiation, with a primary focus on the release of political prisoners. Even as we spoke that day in October, the country was preparing for regional elections in which opposition candidates were expected to win by a landslide. There were contradictory signals, of course, but the trajectory was toward transition. This was a time when headlines everywhere predicted a “turning point” for Venezuela, and I think on some unspoken level, López was counting on it. It was a gamble to speak publicly, but it wasn’t crazy to imagine that by the time this article appeared, the political landscape could be transformed — that the opposition, which already held a supermajority in Congress, could win a similar proportion of governorships; that a regional victory would carry into the municipal campaign in December; that they would enter this year’s presidential race with momentum against a deeply unpopular president, polling at 25 percent; that the negotiation for political prisoners might even allow López to challenge Maduro himself. Polls at one point suggested he could win the presidency by a margin of 30 percent. This was the conversation that I think we expected to have last summer: a look at the next chapter for Venezuela and the role he might play. Instead, with each passing day, the possibilities grew more slender. When voting began on the morning after that October call, nothing went as expected. The polling places for more than 700,000 citizens had mysteriously moved, in some cases so far that it would take hours for them to travel on crowded buses. Even so, by evening, officials were reporting overwhelming turnout and a breathtaking upset: Candidates from the ruling party had swept all but five of the governor’s races. Amid a global outcry of fraud, several opposition parties withdrew from the municipal elections — and the government responded by invalidating those parties. The scheduled negotiation with opposition leaders began in November. In January, the talks collapsed. In February, officials dissolved the whole coalition of opposition parties. Political leaders of every stripe were being detained by the secret police. The second-ranking member of Congress went into hiding at the Chilean Embassy, and about a dozen mayors fled the country. The state, the economy and the social fabric were unraveling all at once. Everywhere, people were leaving Venezuela any way they could. They piled into ramshackle boats and died at sea. They walked the highway toward Brazil, collapsing in heat and sun. They poured into Colombia, tens of thousands each day, a refugee crisis comparable in number to the flight of the Rohingya to Bangladesh. It seemed that every time I spoke with López, another friend had taken sanctuary in an embassy, gone to prison or fled. I asked him one day recently how he was managing the pressure. The secret police had just returned to his house with another order to arrest him, and he was saying goodbye to his wife, Lilian, who was eight months pregnant, when one of the agents received a phone call to suspend the arrest. It wasn’t clear when they might return. “How are you feeling?” I asked. “It’s tough,” he said. “It’s tough after what happened. Every day I think is the last day I have to be with my kids.” I asked if he ever thought about trying to escape. “Most people tell me that I should,” he said. “But I believe a commitment to the cause means that I need to take the risk.” As he spoke, I realized that what we had actually been talking about all these months, what he had been trying to communicate through this portal from his silence, was never really about the future of Venezuela or the role he hoped to play, and it wasn’t about political ambition or the next chapter in history. It was something fundamental that kept coming up in offhand remarks. It was something that he learned in prison about the history we’re always in. The line of people waiting to leave Venezuela begins to form an hour before dawn. Migrants drift through unlit streets in the border town of San Antonio to gather at the foot of the Simon Bolívar Bridge, where they wait beneath a huge red banner that reads, “Don’t speak ill of Chávez.” When the checkpoint opens at 6 a.m., they push forward, moving shoulder to shoulder down the two-lane highway into Colombia. There will be no tapering off through the day; there is no end to the people coming. Some have traveled more than a week to get here. It only takes a glance to see what sort of people they are: every sort, of every age, from every profession and social stratum — young families and older couples and clusters of itinerant boys and solitary young women looking several weeks overdue. If you stop for a moment on your way across the bridge, you can almost feel the deflating wind of the Venezuelan exodus at your back. Historians have come up with all sorts of arguments about the arc of Venezuelan history and how things went so wrong. A couple of points strike me as indispensable to any case: Venezuela is the birthplace of Latin American independence and sits on the largest proven reserves of oil in the world. How you interpret the role of these factors in any given historic event is a matter of personal politics and granular debate, but you can’t have a serious discussion about Venezuela without taking both into account. For most of the past century, the country has whipsawed between political movements that court and reflect and sometimes renounce the legacy of anti-imperialism and the towering glut of riches. Like most of its neighbors, Venezuela endured a succession of caudillo strongmen in the early 20th century and responded with a radical leftist movement in the 1950s and ’60s. Unlike its counterparts in neighboring countries, the Venezuelan left didn’t get very far. Some of them took up arms in the mountains and limped through a series of gunfights, but by the end of the ’60s, most had returned to a marginal place in conventional politics. One of the few who stayed in the fight was a guerrilla named Douglas Bravo, who called his nationalist political ideology “Bolívarianism.” Bravo finally settled in Caracas in the 1980s, where he developed inroads with disaffected citizens and soldiers in the Venezuelan Army. Two of the acolytes he courted were the brothers Adán and Hugo Chávez, who welcomed the idea of leading a Bolívarian coup. It took about a decade of recruitment and planning, during which time the Venezuelan establishment seemed to be doing everything possible to help them. For decades, the two major parties essentially passed the presidency back and forth in a power-sharing agreement that gave little heed to the country’s swollen underclass. Venezuela’s economic fault lines had become so fraught that in 1989 a rise in bus fares helped trigger deadly riots. By the time the Chávez brothers were ready to attempt their coup in 1992, a lot of Venezuelans were just happy to see the establishment take a hit. Although the coup failed and Chávez spent two years in prison, he emerged as a minor celebrity. By 1998, he was running for president. It’s easy now, with the country in turmoil, to dismiss the whole project of chavismo. But the election of Chávez in 1998 coincided with a groundswell of social and political movements for whom Chávez, with his energy and outrage, pledging to crack down on corruption and raise the minimum wage, seemed a natural ally. Whatever else Chávez became, he delivered on many of his promises. During his tenure, unemployment fell by half, the gross domestic product more than doubled, infant mortality dropped by almost a third and the poverty rate was nearly halved. You can chalk this up to other factors, like a tenfold increase in the price of oil that showered his administration with revenue, and you can argue that Chávez failed miserably to anticipate the next downturn in oil prices, but you can’t really accuse him of making promises to the poor and then delivering to the rich, or keeping all the money for himself. Under his watch, income inequality dropped to one of the lowest levels in the Western Hemisphere. Chávez didn’t have to steal elections. He was wildly popular among the poor and put his proposals up for election almost every year. He introduced touch-screen voting, with thumbprint recognition and a printed receipt, an electoral system that Jimmy Carter described as being, among all the countries he had monitored, “the best in the world.” Chávez also possessed an autocratic impulse that was jarring from the start. Over the course of 14 years in office, he dismantled the country’s democratic institutions one by one. There’s an interesting debate among political theorists about what to call a leader who destroys a democracy with democratic support. It’s possible to think of Chávez as a totalitarian or a tyrant for suppressing his opponents while rejecting the term “dictator” to describe a popular president. Chávez made no secret of his contempt for the country’s extant political system; he couldn’t even get through his first inauguration without ad-libbing, in the middle of the swearing-in ceremony, a promise to rewrite the Constitution — which he promptly did, consolidating power over the Legislature and the courts. Any limit that Chávez might have been willing to accept on his power vanished in April 2002, when a junta of military officers and right-wing leaders tried to oust him in a coup. For about 36 hours, they installed as president a man named Pedro Carmona, who was the director of Venezuela’s primary business consortium. Carmona’s government proceeded to undermine institutions at a clip that would make even Chávez blush. In the single day of his presidency, he dissolved the Legislature, the Supreme Court and the Constitution and began to cleanse the Venezuelan military of anyone loyal to Chávez. This was too much even for critics of chavismo. The streets of Caracas exploded in protest, and crowds descended on the presidential palace. Soon Chávez was back in office, consolidating power more quickly than ever. He persecuted rivals and stacked the courts and levied so many restrictions on industry that the private sector essentially disappeared. You can think of the decade between the coup and his death in 2013 as a gradual process of bleeding out public resources for public consumption. At a basic level, Chávez just wasn’t very good at managing an economy. His budget spent the revenue from skyrocketing oil prices, and his control of the state oil company proved disastrous. Chávez believed that because oil reserves are a finite resource, it made sense to limit production and drive up the price of every barrel. This way of thinking is widely disputed, if not debunked. Producers are constantly developing new ways to find and access oil; between the American shale revolution and rising competition from alternative energy, most oil companies today want to pump as much oil as quickly as they can. When Chávez took power in Venezuela, the state oil company was producing about 3.4 million barrels per day. Its leadership planned to almost double the volume. Instead, through a combination of Chávez’s misguided theories and a general failure to invest in the company and installing his personal henchmen to run it, production of Venezuelan oil has fallen by nearly half. Oil prices have also dropped considerably over the past few years, but the country has little else to sell. According to the most recent data, oil accounts for about 95 percent of Venezuelan export earnings. Much of that oil is being shipped to Russia and China in exchange for help with the national debt, giving both countries expansive claims on Venezuelan production. The more desperate the Maduro regime becomes, the more these countries stand to gain. What you’ve got then is a domino cascade: less and less oil, at lower and lower prices, with nothing else to sell, and a dependence on foreign money at the expense of future income. The final chip in the cascade has been Venezuela’s currency. As national revenue plunged, leaving a gap in the annual budget, Chávez and Maduro turned to the central bank to print more money. The number of Venezuelan bolívars has grown exponentially in recent years. When Maduro took power in 2013, the country’s monetary base was about 250 billion bolívars. Today, it’s more than 60 trillion. For a sense of scale, imagine if you had $5,000 yesterday, and today it was $1.2 million. I don’t mean to suggest any meaningful comparison between your savings account and a national economy, but it’s not difficult to imagine how a huge increase in money distorts the way people spend it. Most countries around the world produce official inflation reports. The Venezuelan government has essentially stopped. One of the world’s leading experts on hyperinflation is a professor at Johns Hopkins University named Steve Hanke, who has advised governments around the world on runaway inflation, including Venezuela in 1995 and ’96. Hanke has been tracking the Venezuelan economy closely for the past five years, producing a daily estimate of the country’s annual inflation. As I write this, his most recent estimate was 5,220 percent. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that inflation in Venezuela will reach 13,000 percent this year. This is what you see in the faces of the people on the bridge leaving Venezuela. You see people trying to escape a country where basic supplies are nearly impossible to find and prohibitively expensive, where the price you paid for a car a few years ago won’t buy a loaf of bread today. You see families with roll-aboard luggage and no plans to go back, and children who are crossing just for the day with nothing but a bunch of bananas. They will sell the bananas for a pittance in Colombian pesos, then return home to convert the cash into a small fortune of Venezuelan currency — at least for a few days, when their money will be worthless again. López was born to privilege in the wealthy enclaves of northeastern Caracas. His father, Leopoldo López Gil, was the head of an international scholarship program who sat on the editorial board of a center-left newspaper. His mother, Antonieta Mendoza, was a distant relative of the first president of Venezuela, Cristóbal Mendoza, and of Simon Bolívar. Each side of the family had long traditions of political activism and dissent. López grew up hearing about his great-grandfather’s 17 years in prison and his grandfather’s role in the underground resistance. “We always heard those stories,” his sister Diana told me. “I think it was always in Leo’s memory.” López said he relished the history in part because it felt so alien, snapshots of a country that he couldn’t quite imagine. “I saw it as a faraway past of black-and-white pictures,” he told me. “I never thought that in the 21st century, my own reality could be similar.” The Venezuela that López inhabited was the wealthiest country in Latin America. It welcomed tens of thousands of immigrants every year and had been a democracy since 1958. Skateboarding, swimming, crazy for girls, López at 13 was largely removed from the country’s systemic inequities. He was on a school trip to the rural state of Zulia, passing through the region’s oil fields, when he found himself unexpectedly moved by the destitution around him. “I was shocked by the poverty level,” he recalled, “and the fact that below these very humble barrios and dramatic poverty, we had huge potential.” Diana told me that López began making trips into western Caracas “to try to understand the dynamics of the city.” At school, he immersed himself in student leadership, becoming vice president of the student government and captain of the swimming team. After college, López briefly enrolled at Harvard Divinity School but left after one semester to enroll in the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He completed a master’s thesis on the legal and economic framework of oil production in Venezuela and traveled through Nicaragua and Bolivia to study the impact of microloans. In 1996, he returned home for a job in the strategic planning office of the state oil company. Watching the ascent of Chávez in 1998, López was unimpressed. “Ever since the establishment of the Venezuelan republic in 1830, for the most part we’ve had military in the government,” he told me. “And that has created a militaristic way of governing.” I asked López if there was ever a point when he reconsidered his opinion of Chávez. “For one day,” he said with a laugh. “When he spoke about microcredits to the poor.” As Chávez took office and began making plans to rewrite the Constitution, López campaigned for a seat in the constitutional convention. He lost that election but rallied with two other failed candidates to create a new political party, then he entered the 2000 campaign for mayor of the city’s most affluent borough. He won with 51 percent of the vote. Over the next eight years, López gained international attention as mayor of Chacao. He began by raising business taxes while offering incentives for companies to move into the district. With revenue up, he commenced a series of public works, building health clinics and schools, a theater, a public market and a recreation center. Still unmarried and in his early 30s, he was comically hands on, forever rolling up his sleeves at groundbreaking ceremonies and appearing, in Cory Booker fashion, at predawn crime scenes to consult with detectives in the blinking red light. In a city notorious for crime, he implemented policing measures that were popular in the United States — think “zero tolerance” and “broken windows” and “compstat” multivariate analysis. His platform, then, was a heterodox mash-up of initiatives that span the political spectrum, from lefty measures like raising corporate taxes to conservative models of policing. Residents loved it. In 2004, he was re-elected with 81 percent of the vote, and during his second term he met and married a prominent television personality named Lilian Tintori. In 2008, López left office with 92 percent approval and a ranking from the City Mayors Foundation as the third-best mayor in the world. Skimming this résumé, you can see why people often regard López in a gauzy half-light, but even as he thrived as mayor of Chacao, he was becoming a polarizing figure. By the end of his second term, he was one of the most promising young politicians in Venezuela and one of the least capable of getting along with others. Within the opposition movement, López represented a radical wing. The word “radical” is often used about López in a misleading way. He favors a mixed economic model of expansive social services in health care, education and housing, offset by a large private sector of manufacturing and industry. On the spectrum of American politics, he would probably land in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Where you can describe López as a radical is the way he approaches political activity. He believes that a relentless campaign of street demonstrations and civil disobedience is essential to challenge an authoritarian government. On any given day in 2002, a person walking through Caracas had a good chance of spotting the mayor of Chacao standing on a bench in some public park, bellowing at a crowd through a megaphone. How useful this was to the project of building a mature political party with governing potential was a matter of opinion, but López believed that the movement would get nowhere by relying on decorous party mechanics. One way to measure the success of a strategy is to study its response. López became a frequent target of physical and administrative attacks. From 2002 to 2006, there were three major attempts on his life, one of which left him cradling a bodyguard dying of a gunshot meant for López. During his tenure as mayor, he was accused by the comptroller’s office of paying municipal expenses from the wrong part of his budget and barred from seeking public office until 2014. López appealed the decision and prepared to run for mayor of Caracas. He was leading with 65 percent of the vote when the Supreme Court upheld the comptroller’s decision. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled the ban illegal and ordered Venezuela to let López run, but the government ignored the order and López has been forbidden to hold public office ever since. By 2008, he was also clashing with other opposition leaders. He left the party he helped found, joined another and soon had issues with its leadership as well. In August, that party expelled him, and he began making plans to create yet another. American diplomats in Caracas weren’t sure what to make of López. A classified cable to Washington described his “much-publicized rebelliousness,” noting that López “will not hesitate to break with his opposition colleagues to get his way.” Another referred to him as “a divisive figure” who was “often described as arrogant, vindictive and power-hungry.” In 2012, still barred from running for office, López threw his support behind an opposition candidate in the presidential election. Chávez beat that candidate by a 10-point margin but died soon after, opening the door for a repeat campaign against Maduro. When the electoral board announced that Maduro had won by a single percentage point, López suspected fraud. He pushed for the opposition movement to stage a public demonstration. Most of the other opposition leaders dismissed the idea, but in January 2014, López called for his supporters to take the streets. By February, protests were springing up in every province. On Feb. 12, López rallied thousands of students at the edge of a park in Caracas. After his speech, they marched to the office of the attorney general a mile away. Some of the protesters began throwing rocks at the building. Security officers emerged, and two protesters were shot. Though López was gone before the violence began, officials accused him of being the “intellectual author” of the skirmish, and the attorney general issued a warrant for his arrest. López and Tintori took refuge that night in a friend’s apartment. They recorded a video message for the public. “I want to say to all Venezuelans that I do not repent,” López said. He spent a few days in hiding, then recorded another video asking his supporters to gather at a downtown plaza on Feb. 18, dressed in white as a sign of peace, to bear witness as he turned himself in. That morning, he climbed on a motorcycle and rode into the city. A large crowd was gathering, and the police had set up checkpoints to intercept him. López tried to find a way around the checkpoints but couldn’t. He finally rode up to a cluster of police officers from the Chacao district and removed his helmet. The officers recognized him, saluted and waved him through. López saw the crowd extending in every direction. Thousands upon thousands of people had come dressed in white. He waded through them to a statue of the Cuban independence hero José Martí and climbed the pedestal to look over the sea of faces. Someone handed him a megaphone, and he raised it. “If my imprisonment helps to awaken a people,” he called out, “then it will be worth the infamous imprisonment imposed on me.” After a short speech, he climbed down from the pedestal, where soldiers were waiting to arrest him. They pulled him inside an armored vehicle, but the crowd pressed in, rocking it. Minutes passed, then half an hour. The truck was trapped by the crowd. Someone gave López a handset connected to the vehicle’s outside speakers. He called to the crowd that he was safe and that they should clear a way for the truck to get through. Slowly, almost grudgingly, they parted the path for López to prison. Officials placed López in a concrete tower on a military base outside the city, charging him with terrorism, arson and homicide. Amnesty International condemned his prosecution as “an affront to justice” and “a politically motivated attempt to silence dissent.” For his initial arraignment, he was taken from his cell in the middle of the night and marched outside to face a judge on a bus. The rest of the proceedings took place at the Palace of Justice in Caracas, a five-story edifice that sprawls across 1.5 million square feet downtown. Over the next 19 months, he traveled there nearly 100 times, in a motorcade of armored S.U.V.s, wearing a bulletproof vest, with his hands shackled together, wedged between two guards armed with machine guns and two more behind him. Each time López appeared in court, the Palace of Justice shut down. The trial hinged on speech. No one accused López of being violent himself. Prosecutors scaled back the charges, arguing that he inspired violence in others. They brought in a linguistic expert to examine transcripts of his speeches and claimed that his message of peaceful protest disguised a “subliminal” call to violence. They introduced more than 100 witnesses, some of whom testified that they had received the subliminal messages. López tried to introduce his own witnesses, but the judge wouldn’t allow it. A few words about the judge who signed his arrest warrant and a lead prosecutor and attorney general: They all repent. The judge who signed the warrant later admitted that she had been forced to do so. The lead prosecutor, after fleeing the country, denounced the case against López as “a farce,” saying “100 percent of the investigation was invented.” The attorney general, Luisa Ortega, escaped to Colombia last summer and says that the vice president of Maduro’s party instructed her to pursue López. I tracked Ortega down a few weeks ago, and we met for coffee in Bogotá. When I asked her about the criminal charges against López, she shook her head in dismay. “Without a doubt,” she said, “Leopoldo López is a political prisoner.” Ortega told me it had been illegal to hold a civilian like López in a military prison. Over the course of three years, his conditions grew progressively worse. In the early stage, he was allowed to read and write, and a local university devised a program of study. He read Venezuelan poets, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the diary of Ho Chi Minh and a biography of Nguyen Van Thuan. He was consuming several volumes a week, until officials began to restrict what he could read. Eventually, they prohibited everything except the Bible. He read it from Genesis to Revelation. Then they took the Bible, too. He was moved to a new cell, then another. He spent months in solitary confinement in a room that was six feet by 10 feet. He would sit in silence trying to pray or meditate and summon any possible reason for gratitude: that he could feel himself breathing; that his wife and children were safe; that through the window he could hear the commotion of the outside world — a passing truck, a twisting wind, some emphatic bird. Without his books, he reflected on those he had read. He remembered biographies of nonviolent leaders and the Birmingham letter from King, and he began to wonder if what they had in common wasn’t just a commitment to resistance but some deeper observation about the character of history. This came through most clearly in King. His goal was never just to provoke or confront. It was to locate the elusive fulcrum between conflict and mediation — to produce an onslaught of pressure that forced officials to react while preserving an almost irrational faith in their capacity for good will. “I had an illumination moment,” López recalled. “One night, I couldn’t sleep, and I was tossing from one side of the bed to the other, thinking about the son-of-a-bitch director of the prison. I was very, very angry, and I woke up the next morning, and I said: ‘What am I doing? This guy is taking away my tranquillity, my sleep.’ ” He realized that the buildup of anger threatened to distort his thinking. He began trying to separate his outrage from his fury. He continued to defy the arbitrary rules of prison — composing and smuggling a stream of subversive messages to the outside — but when the guards would charge into his cell to look for contraband, shouting and tearing through his things, he searched for calm. He would stand back, lifting his hands in a posture of self-defense and say in the most measured tone he could muster that he would protect himself if necessary. In the hours between, the interminable stretches of solitude, he tried to be honest with himself about what anger had cost him. It wasn’t just a threat to his state of mind but to his politics, his movement and the way he conceived the future. “In the past, I was in confrontation with different views,” he told me. “Now I understand that everybody is needed in order to reach a way out of this disaster.” He thought of books he had read on postwar Europe and the South African emergence from apartheid, and he realized that Venezuela would never find stability if it were cleaved into disparate sectors. It would be necessary to forge, like Mandela with F.W. de Klerk or King with Lyndon Johnson, some tentative confianza between the opposition and supporters of chavismo. “A lot of people in the opposition have resentment, and I understand that,” he told me. “But I think our responsibility is to move beyond the personal resentment. Four years in prison have given me the possibility of seeing things a different way, of putting rage in its perspective.” A few nights ago, I was speaking with López a little before midnight. His family was asleep, and in the quiet hours he was bracing for the possibility that appearing in these pages could trigger his return to prison. This was something we had talked about many times. His eldest daughter was a toddler when he first went to prison and is now a little girl. His son had been less than a year old and was just now getting to know his father. At the end of January, López and Tintori had a second daughter, and it troubled him to think that years could pass before he saw any of his children again. “It’s not easy,” he said quietly. “It’s not easy, but I have the responsibility to speak my mind. I’ve been in prison four years now because of speaking my mind, and if I self-censor, I’m beaten by the dictatorship.” López said he still believed that with the right leadership, Venezuela could rebound. He thought of postwar Japan and South Korea and Europe. He knew that stabilizing the bolívar could be accomplished by attaching its value to a foreign currency, and that under a new government, the private sector would return. He believed the country’s oil production would recover under good management, and he had been working for nearly a decade on a plan to convert the national oil company into a kind of Social Security trust, with investment shares assigned to the public for retirement, education and emergencies. The challenge was to reach a point where any of that work could begin. As the crisis in Venezuela deepened, the path to a transition seemed more obscure than ever. Politicians, historians, think-tank pontificators — everyone had some sort of proposal, but the problem, if you studied each of them, was that none had very much chance of happening, or of working. Start with the Trump administration, which has lately suggested a military coup. Speaking in February, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson mused that in a situation like Venezuela’s, “it’s the military that handles that,” to which Senator Marco Rubio later added on Twitter that the Venezuelan military should “restore democracy by removing a dictator.” Apart from the obvious fact that removing a dictator is no guarantee of democracy, there aren’t many people in Venezuela who consider a coup likely. A few weeks ago, I met up with the leader installed by the last military coup, Pedro Carmona, who told me the military has been purged of dissent, with senior officers monitored for ideological purity by the Cuban intelligence service. “The G2 has a facility in Caracas, spying on the Venezuelan military,” he said. “So on the military side, the best I could hope would be for them not to repress the people.” Pressure from outside Venezuela has also been slow to coalesce. Critics accuse the members of the Organization of American States of failing to constrain the Maduro government, which showers oil bounty on several member nations. A smaller coalition of Latin American countries has joined with Canada to create the Lima Group, whose vociferous condemnation of the political repression has not converted to much concrete action. American sanctions have been steadily tightening in recent years. After a protracted debate between the National Security Council and the State Department, the Obama administration imposed limited sanctions in 2015, primarily targeting the financial assets of individual Venezuelan leaders. Mark Feierstein, who assumed responsibility for N.S.C. policy in the Western Hemisphere later that year, told me the administration had missed a critical opportunity to influence a 2016 negotiation between the Maduro government and the opposition. “The N.S.C., or at least I, was inclined to move more quickly,” he said, “and I think the negotiations largely failed because pressure was taken off.” The Trump administration has expanded the sanctions program, but how far to deepen sanctions, or expand them, or restrict the import of Venezuelan oil, is a brutal calculation about how much of the burden would be carried by the Venezuelan people, and whether adding to their misery is more likely to inspire an uprising or simply worsen the humanitarian disaster. In recent months, there has also been rumbling about war. Trump has made oblique suggestions of a “military option” in Caracas, and even relatively moderate voices have begun to fantasize about cavalry. In January, the Harvard scholar Ricardo Hausmann, who served as Venezuela’s minister of planning from 1992 to 1993, published a proposal suggesting that the Legislature invite a multilateral invasion force to help support a new government, making a comparison to the liberation of Europe. I spoke with several opposition leaders who welcome this idea, but this might say more about the country’s desperation than the wisdom of the proposal. It’s difficult to imagine Russia and China, after years of propping up the Venezuelan economy in exchange for oil, allowing a foreign invasion to threaten their investment. An even greater concern is internal: Maduro is polling at about 30 percent approval in a devastated economy, but nothing would rally former chavistas to his side like an occupying army. Venezuela is a heavily armed society and increasingly violent. To invite a military intervention is to welcome civil war. A few months ago, it was possible to imagine an electoral path to change, but today nearly all the opposition parties have been disqualified from running. On the evening of Feb. 15, Maduro took this a step further, interrupting television and radio broadcasts to announce that the party López founded in 2009 is not a political organization but a “violent fascist group” operating “outside the law.” When I spoke with López the next morning, he said that 87 party leaders were already in prison. Those who remained were preparing to convert the party into a “clandestine organization.” Soon, he said, they could be reduced to secret meetings and tossing pamphlets on street corners from unmarked vans. But even as conditions spiraled down, I watched López try to incorporate what he learned in prison to daily life. Unable to speak publicly, he developed a network of private channels — reconnecting with leaders of the political parties from which he’d split, making inroads with members of the Maduro government and with foreign ministers and heads of state. During the recent negotiation between opposition leaders and the government, López was in contact with all sides; even after his party withdrew from the dialogue, he continued to consult with leaders who remained at the table. When disputes spilled over among them, he provided a back channel, an invisible hub to which it seemed as if all spokes connected. López was also flexible in his thinking about transition. Through most of our conversations, he strongly opposed the idea of military action, but when we spoke late the other night, he said he was beginning to think differently. An unwelcome mechanism can bring welcome change. “In 1958, there was a military coup that began the transition to democracy,” he said. “And in other Latin American countries, there have been coups that called elections. So I don’t want to rule anything out, because the electoral window has been closed. We need to go forward on many different levels. One is street demonstrations; a second is coordination with the international community. But this is how I’m thinking now: We need to increase all forms of pressure. Anything, anything that needs to happen to produce a free and fair election.” If it was jarring to hear this from López, it was matched by another development. For several months, the secret police had been coming to his front door about four times a day to photograph him with a copy of the day’s newspaper. Lately, López had begun to invite the agents in. He had recently spoken with one for more than two hours, offering him a slice of cake from his daughter’s birthday and talking about the inflation crisis and the recent massacre of a small rebel group. “We’ve developed — I wouldn’t say a good relationship, but a relationship,” he said. Thinking about these developments together, it seemed to me that López was trying to strike an increasingly difficult balance. He was willing to entertain proposals that he found abhorrent six months ago, but he was also making a greater effort to open the door for dialogue. The struggle he faced was a heightened version of the tension in all history. It was to locate the elusive fulcrum between his rage and faith. "
789,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Wednesday was an extraordinarily busy day, particularly in Washington. Tensions between President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions flared publicly when the president criticized Mr. Sessions for not opening his own investigation into Republican charges of misconduct in the Russia investigation. Mr. Sessions had suggested that the Justice Department’s inspector general, an Obama administration appointee, would look into them instead. In a tweet, the president called Mr. Sessions “DISGRACEFUL.” Mr. Sessions responded with a rare statement defending his “integrity and honor.” • Separately, Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and one of Mr. Trump’s longest-serving advisers, plans to leave in the next few weeks. White House aides said her resignation wasn’t related to her testimony the day before that she had occasionally told white lies in the job. "
790,"Hope Hicks’s resignation, Jared Kushner’s security-clearance downgrade and the gun-control debate appear to have very little in common. But they are in fact connected to a larger problem: President Trump’s lack of control over the White House and, consequently, his weakness as a president. Presidents have a high-profile role in lawmaking and foreign policy, but a third function, executive administration, is arguably the most important. The job of carrying out the law provides the executive branch with incredible amounts of discretion. But the executive branch is not subject to the president’s dictatorial control. Presidents compete with numerous actors — Congress, the courts, interest groups, political appointees in the departments and agencies, and career civil servants — for influence. Effective management of the White House is a precondition for presidential power and influence in the executive branch. Weak presidents routinely get rolled by the priorities and goals of competing actors. Mr. Trump has experienced this regularly. Military leaders publicly ignored his policy pronouncements. Business “allies” didn’t think twice about abandoning him after he made controversial comments. His cabinet secretaries contradict him on administration policy and may have developed secret pacts of authority. None of this means significant policy change isn’t happening in the executive branch; indeed, there is ample evidence of a strong conservative shift in many agencies. There’s just little reason to believe Mr. Trump is anything but a bystander. Richard Neustadt, author of the seminal 1960 book “Presidential Power,” described it as “the power to persuade.” The president must rely on his informal ability to convince other political actors it is in their interest to go along with him, or at least not stand in his way. "
791,       
792,"Hostility to the opposition party and its candidates has now reached a level where loathing motivates voters more than loyalty. The building strength of partisan antipathy — “negative partisanship” — has radically altered politics. Anger has become the primary tool for motivating voters. Ticket splitting is dying out. But perhaps the most important consequence of the current power of political anger is that there has been a marked decline in the accountability of public officials to the electorate. How bad is this problem? In “The Strengthening of Partisan Affect,” Shanto Iyengar and Masha Krupenkin, political scientists at Stanford, note that Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that Along parallel lines, Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster, political scientists at Emory University, argue that In “All Politics is National: The Rise of Negative Partisanship and the Nationalization of U.S. House and Senate Elections in the 21st Century,” Abramowitz and Webster make the case that The practice of voting against rather than for has grown steadily since the 2000 election, but it reached new heights in 2016, when both major party nominees were viewed substantially more negatively than positively. On Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election, 58.5 percent of voters had an unfavorable view of Donald Trump and 54.4 percent felt the same way about Hillary Clinton, according to RealClearPolitics. Favorable views were 37.5 for Trump and 41.8 percent for Clinton. Abramowitz and Webster compiled data from the 2012 and 2016 elections to show how much the level of anger among both Democratic and Republican voters increased over four years. In 2012, 33 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans described themselves as angry at the opposing party’s presidential candidate “most of the time” or “just about always.” In 2016, the percentage of Democratic voters who said they were this angry at Trump rose to 73 percent, and the percentage of Republicans with that level of hostility toward Hillary Clinton rose to 66 percent.

Bush slapped high tariffs on steel imports 16 years ago, the stock market slipped a bit but recovered in the following days. Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum. In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States. And there is a good chance that President Trump’s tariffs won’t cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursday’s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush’s tariffs, President Trump’s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they’ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. "
795,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Gov. Jerry Brown is entering his final year in public life riding high in opinion polls and generally praised by government officials. But as the spotlight shifts to a new generation, there has been an increasing focus on the blight of poverty and homelessness under Mr. Brown’s watch — by his fellow Democrats. Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles was the latest to weigh in, discussing what he said was the absence of state assistance in helping cities deal with the homeless. Mr. Garcetti has come under fire for a major homelessness problem in Los Angeles, the subject of a series of scathing editorials in The Los Angeles Times. “I love this governor — I think he’s done a tremendous job,” Mr. Garcetti said Wednesday at a luncheon sponsored by the Los Angeles Current Affairs Forum in downtown Los Angeles. “But in his last State of the State address, there wasn’t one mention of homelessness. We need the state to step up.” Over the weekend in San Diego, at a debate of Democratic candidates looking to succeed Mr. Brown as governor, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, spoke of California as a state plagued with high poverty, noting that this has happened as government has been controlled by Democrats. “The issue of poverty is the issue of our time,” he said. “As Democrats, we have a unique responsibility to address this issue head on. With all due respect, this happened on our watch. We own this.” Evan Westrup, the governor’s communications director, said the absence of a discussion of homelessness in Mr. Brown’s speech did not suggest any lack of concern or action by the administration. He noted that Mr. Brown signed a package of bills last year to encourage the construction of affordable housing. “The governor doesn’t restate every single priority of the administration or issue facing California in his State of the State speech — and it would be a mistake to conflate commitment with a speech’s word count,” Mr. Westrup said in an email. “The word ‘homelessness’ wasn’t in last year’s remarks either, yet California took unprecedented action to increase the state’s housing supply and affordability (the mayor should certainly remember, he was in San Francisco for the bill signing).” "
796,"NEW DELHI — During the debate last week over a United States-sponsored measure to throw Pakistan onto a global terrorism-financing watchlist, it appeared that Saudi Arabia and China were going to quickly shut it all down. The Pakistani foreign minister sounded a triumphant note. “Grateful to friends who helped,” Foreign Minister Khawaja M. Asif posted on Twitter. Just two days later, on Friday, Pakistan’s relief turned to alarm at the news that those two close allies had withdrawn their support, making it inevitable that Pakistan would be added in June to the “gray list” of the Financial Action Task Force, a global body created to fight terrorism financing and money laundering. The country will have a year to show that it is acting against extremist groups, shutting down their financing streams and prosecuting their leaders, or it could face having its banks cut off like those of Iran and North Korea were. Already, the gray-listing will make it harder for Pakistan to access international markets, and it has $3 billion in debts coming due this summer. Pakistan has been on that gray list before, for a three-year stretch that ended in 2015, and this week Pakistani officials publicly expressed doubt that anything worse would happen. But by all accounts, the new international action was an embarrassing public slap that has again focused discussion on the Pakistani military’s benign eye toward militant groups working against American aims in Afghanistan and Indian interests in Kashmir. Further, the shock over Saudi Arabia’s and China’s eventual refusal to block action against Pakistan has made this listing sting in a way the last one never did. "

The biggest raises went to low-income workers. And the pay gap between men and women shrank. An annual report card on American pay has just come out this morning, and it is dominated by good news. Real wages (that is, after adjusting for inflation) not only grew last year, they tended to grow for demographic groups that are paid less. Does President Trump deserve credit? Largely not. Last year’s trends started in 2015, before he took office. The job market has finally become strong enough in the last few years that companies have had to raise pay to attract and keep workers, up and down the wage spectrum. Another important cause in 2017 were minimum-wage increases, thanks to new laws in 14 states. In another seven, the minimum wage rose because it was indexed to inflation. Ultimately, I hope all states move to an indexed minimum; it is the only way to prevent the minimum wage from effectively declining every year. As encouraging as the new report is, its author — Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute — told me that people should not be confused by the big picture. The recent pay raises for the poor and middle class don’t come close to erasing the inequality in pay increases of the 21st century. High-income workers have still done much better since 2000 than middle- or low-income workers. And the Trump tax law will worsen the situation. But a year of good news is still worth celebrating. A couple of other details from the report: Women’s median hourly wage rose to 84 percent of men’s median wage, up from 78.3 percent in 2000. “The gap has essentially been cut in half since the 1970s,” Gould said. A big reason is that women have become more educated than men, and more educated workers earn a large premium. African-American workers were the one big group that didn’t narrow its disadvantage in 2017. It’s a deeply disturbing trend: The median African-American hourly wage was 74.6 percent of the median white wage, down from 79.2 percent in 2000.

Dick’s Sporting Goods won’t sell assault-style weapons anymore, and Richard Thaler — the most recent Nobel laureate in economics — says you should support the move by buying your sporting goods at Dick’s. “Reward them by shopping. A reverse boycott,” Thaler wrote. Crawford Kilian, a retired writing teacher, praised the clarity of the prose in the Dick’s news release: “Clearly and concisely expressed. A+.” Ariel Edwards-Levy, a polling expert at HuffPost, notes that substantially more Americans favor companies distancing themselves from the N.R.A. than the reverse. “And here’s why you just saw a lot of businesses dumping the NRA,” she tweeted, alongside a screenshot of the poll numbers. What should we make of Trump’s apparent embrace of gun control yesterday? It’s another sign that the student activists have shifted the gun debate.

798,"Our Reader Ideas are generally written by educators and describe creative methods of teaching with The New York Times. But in this edition, we feature a high school student, Matthew Tikhonovsky, who learns with The Times — on his own. Mr. Tikhonovsky is the son of Ukrainian immigrants, and his Times habit has not only raised his English test scores, but has also helped him better understand American culture — which, he says, has then helped him to better appreciate his family’s own history and background. In this piece, Mr. Tikhonovsky takes us through the ways he navigates Times content , like regularly reading the Opinion section, responding to Learning Network writing prompts, conducting research for school assignments and using articles as conversation starters with his parents. How have you learned with The Times? Browse all our Reader Ideas or contribute one of your own. ________ Idea: A high school student, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, describes how he has used The Times to improve his English and learn about American culture. Student: Matthew Tikhonovsky, 17 School: The Classical School in Atlanta Why We Chose It: Any teenager could adapt Mr. Tikhonovsky’s ideas for how to use The Times to supplement their classroom learning and connect more deeply with issues they care about. As he says, “The resources in The New York Times are almost limitless, and can equip more and more children of immigrants to succeed in school.” ________ What Mr. Tikhonovsky Did and Why, in His Own Words I am the child of Ukrainian immigrants and the grandchild of refugees who were displaced to Kazakhstan. Like many children of immigrants who are raised by nonnative English speakers, I’ve always struggled with the English language, unable to twist my tongue around complex words and ace grammar tests. Despite my subpar performance in English classes, I’ve always been an avid reader. Though my parents, whose first language is Russian, were unable to help me with my English, they encouraged me to read as much as possible, driving my siblings and me to the local library every week and allowing us to read whatever piqued our interest. Once in the library, I became consumed by children’s books, full of magical fairy tales and adventures. But one day I ventured out to the newspaper aisle. And that’s how I literally stumbled upon The Times. At first, I was fascinated by the crossword puzzles, which put my knowledge of history and current events to the test. But I soon began to delve deeper into the newspaper and actually start to read the articles. I flipped throughout the pages of the latest issues and read whatever caught my eye; for a middle school student, this largely consisted of the articles that had the catchiest titles or flashiest pictures. But this was my first exposure to high-quality writing full of thought-provoking ideas — and over time my appreciation for elaborate syntax and logical arguments began to increase. For somebody who was raised hearing a foreign language every day, English has never come easily to me. But sitting for hours on end in the library and reading both children’s books and The Times helped my English improve tremendously. Gradually, I even began to take the writing techniques and styles I learned from reading The Times and apply them to my own writing. Now, I turn to The Times on a daily basis, and continue to learn more about writing, journalism, and American culture every time I read an article. Just as The Times exposed me to the many complicated facets of American culture, so I am inspired to use my writing to share with others about my culture and heritage. _________ What I Read and How I Find It When I first started reading The Times, I immediately gravitated toward the Opinion section, reading every piece I could get my hands on and soon marveling at the authors’ eloquent sentences, melodious prose, and thought-provoking ideas. Regardless of your interests or passions, I would strongly encourage you to read the daily Opinion pieces. They always offer insightful perspectives on myriad issues, ranging from race relations to free speech on college campuses, and have helped me understand more about the diverse range of differing opinions in America. When I want to share my own opinion about something, I turn to the Learning Network’s Writing Prompts to post comments for other teenagers to see and often engage in thoughtful conversations. Although at times it can be challenging to discuss certain aspects of American culture or events in politics with my parents, who lived in Ukraine for over 20 years before immigrating, I’ve been able to freely debate a range of topics within the comment section, including girls in Boy Scouts, cases before the Supreme Court, and even the best type of pizza. A lot of the time, I turn to The Times when I have school assignments that deal with a current event or social movement. I search throughout the archives for keywords and always end up with an excess of valuable information at my fingertips, like the article about the underlying meaning of Beyoncé’s music I used for a research paper. Or the time I relied on an article about the holy wars for a history presentation. Regardless of your topic, The Times is bound to have an abundance of information on it. Aside from researching for school, I also peruse the various sections of The Times for nothing more than enjoyment. When I do this, I am always exposed to a new dimension of American culture, a dimension that my Ukrainian heritage has largely shielded me from. From a young age, for example, I had been mostly exposed to Ukrainian art, which incorporates ornate mosaics and realistic themes, and thus never understood all the hype about modern American art, which is marked by spherical objects and minimalistic themes. So I turned to The Times and searched for articles on Picasso’s style and the art showcased in the MoMA — and soon after I began to appreciate the complex intricacies and beauty of American art. No matter what article or section you read, The Times is limitless and you are bound to find something new — and interesting — in every article. _________ See Your Own Culture Through The New York Times The Times has also allowed me to appreciate my parents’ foreign culture and use their culture to increase my understanding of the world and current events. When I read an article in The Times that relates to my parents’ heritage, I often supplement that article with my parents’ own experiences and knowledge. When I became fascinated by the immigration debate, which took center stage during the 2016 election, I soon found myself reading every article on immigration I could find, like one on Trump’s immigration policy. Although I read numerous articles on immigration, the best source was right in my house; I turned to my parents and got their invaluable insights on the entire immigration process and the vetting measures in place. Or when stories of the refugee plight began to flood the headlines in 2014, I turned to my grandmother, who, as a little girl, was driven out of her home by Nazi forces and sent to Kazakhstan. Her refugee experience mirrored stories featured in The Times, like one about refugees welcomed in Canada or another about refugees fleeing to Turkey in boats. If your parents are immigrants, they are more than likely to have a unique perspective on a range of topics, a perspective that comes only from experience. Ask them about a story or opinion you read in The Times, and see what you might just learn. _________ Keep Reading I know firsthand how difficult it can be having parents who speak a different language and have a different culture, but The Times has allowed me to learn more about American culture and also grow to appreciate my parents’ foreign culture. So, I would encourage all children of immigrants who read The Times to do just that — continue reading. That is the best thing you can do, and you are bound to learn more about high-quality writing and American culture. What’s allowed me to double my reading is the NYTimes app, which has brought the latest stories and opinions to my fingertips.

799,"A Saudi prince finally sold what some might call his Manhattan palace — a sprawling triplex at the Heritage at Trump Place on the Upper West Side, complete with bulletproof “safe rooms,” a sushi bar, and an entire floor dedicated to recreation and relaxation. The sale came more than five years after the apartment was first listed, and for less than half its original $75 million asking price. But at $30 million, the closing of No. 6A-T at 240 Riverside Boulevard, between 71st and 72nd Streets, was still the city’s most expensive transaction in February, according to property records. The sale included three storage units, and separately, two staff quarters also sold: Nos. 6 D-T for $2.5 million and 6 E-T for $3.5 million. The three apartments were owned by a corporation affiliated with Prince Nawaf bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia and acquired by an anonymous buyer using limited liability companies. In other boldface transactions in February, the rocker Jon Bon Jovi and the comedian Seth Meyers each sold condominium units in the West Village. The singer and pianist Michael J. Feinstein sold his Upper East Side townhouse, while the estate of Miles Cahn, a founder of the leather goods purveyor Coach, sold his Central Park West co-op. Also, a TriBeCa apartment owned by the real estate developer Andrew Silverman closed. "
800,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Thursday that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, making good on a key campaign promise and rattling stock markets as the prospect of a global trade fight appeared imminent. (You can read more about Friday’s developments here.) In a hastily arranged meeting with industry executives that stunned many inside the West Wing, Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The action, which came against the wishes of Mr. Trump’s pro-trade advisers, would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, effectively placing a tax on every foreign shipment of those metals into the United States. The president told more than a dozen executives that he wanted the tariffs to apply to all countries, one executive in attendance said. Mr. Trump argued that if one country was exempt, all other countries would line up to ask for similar treatment, and that metals could end up being shipped to the United States through exempted countries. Mr. Trump’s authority to impose such sweeping tariffs stems from a Commerce Department investigation that concluded last month that imported metal threatened national security by degrading the American industrial base. The administration has said it wants to combat cheap metals flooding into the United States, particularly from China, but a broad set of tariffs would fall most heavily on allies, especially Canada, which supplies steel and aluminum to American companies as well as the military. “People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “They’ve destroyed the steel industry, they’ve destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly.” “We’re bringing it all back,” he added. Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that a trade war would be a positive development in the context of the United States’ current position with its trading partners. "
801,"For my money, the best op-ed published in The Times this week was Mona Charen’s Feb. 25 barn-burner, “I’m Glad I Got Booed at CPAC.” Charen is a movement conservative who worked for Nancy and Ronald Reagan and is a longtime contributor to National Review. One of her books is titled “Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help.” A Bernie Sanders progressive she is not. But Charen is also a NeverTrumper who chose to speak her mind during a panel discussion on the #MeToo movement at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference. Asked by the moderator to discuss feminist hypocrisy, Charen reframed the question. “I’m disappointed in people on our side,” she replied. “For being hypocrites about sexual harassers and abusers of women who are in our party. Who are sitting in the White House. Who brag about their extramarital affairs. Who brag about mistreating women. And because he happens to have an ‘R’ after his name, we look the other way, we don’t complain.” She wasn’t done. She slammed the Republican Party for endorsing Roy Moore. She said it was “a disgrace” that CPAC invited the National Front scion Marion Maréchal-Le Pen to speak. She was jeered. She was accused of “virtue signaling.” She had to leave the building under escort. And she showed it was still possible to disdain partisan fashion, look a wretched thing in the eye, and say: Not I. Not this. Not ever. Not for nothing did a fellow panelist approach her after it was all over to say, “That was so brave.” Liberals tend to admire NeverTrumpers, because they see them as conservatives with a moral sense and, perhaps, a brain. By contrast, MAGA Republicans — whether of the fully or merely semi-Trumpified varieties — detest NeverTrumpers with an animus they can scarcely extend to liberals or progressives. Reacting to Charen’s CPAC appearance, one right-wing writer for Red State called her “a new voice in the wilderness of insignificance” — and then devoted 1,000 words to underscoring that insignificance.

802,"Good morning on this dry-to-drippy Thursday. A nationwide art competition for veterans is underway, and several New Yorkers are among the finalists. The annual contest, called the National Veterans Creative Arts Festival and hosted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, draws thousands of veterans to their local V.A. centers to share works including painting, poetry and dance numbers. It can also serve as a form of therapy, contestants said, helping veterans cope with psychological trauma. Finalists from the local competitions will be chosen to attend a national festival in Des Moines in the fall. And this week, Sarahlynn Lewis and Nelijah Cox of Brooklyn were named as two of the gold medalists who may go on to represent our city in Iowa. Ms. Lewis, 70, who grew up in Harlem and served at Fort Lewis in Washington State during the Vietnam era, said she had used art to overcome obstacles in life, beginning in kindergarten. "
803,"From the outset, Gary D. Cohn was an unconventional choice to be President Trump’s top economic adviser. A former Goldman Sachs president and proponent of free trade, Mr. Cohn had a pedigree and economic views that clashed with Mr. Trump’s populist rhetoric and protectionist policies. His methodical approach also contrasted with the president’s freewheeling style. But Mr. Cohn, who said on Tuesday that he would resign as director of the National Economic Council, brought to the Trump administration something that the president himself lacked: the widespread respect of top corporate executives. Now, those business leaders are lamenting the loss of one of their own from what is among the country’s most important economic positions. “Gary brought a strong growth orientation for the economy and a very balanced perspective, particularly on critical topics like trade,” said Rich Lesser, chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group, who served on one of Mr. Trump’s business advisory panels last year and attended policy meetings with Mr. Cohn. “He’ll be missed.” Mr. Cohn was instrumental in putting together the sweeping tax law that was enacted last year, legislation that delivered a windfall to corporations and was the main policy achievement of Mr. Trump’s first year in office. "
804,"One appointee went from “battleground states” director for the Trump presidential campaign to a role at the State Department that sent him to South Africa to meet with health officials. Another traded in her campaign experience as a field director in Virginia for a federal job promoting nuclear energy sales abroad. And another, who spent four months on the campaign in New York after graduating from college, landed a job as an aide to the commerce secretary with a résumé that included work as a receptionist at an animal hospital and a summer job at a country club’s golf shop. The three newly minted federal employees are among the nearly 260 or so former Trump campaign and inauguration workers who have gotten jobs reserved for political appointees in the administration, according to public records compiled by ProPublica and analyzed by The New York Times. In all, more than 2,475 political appointees have joined the federal government since President Trump took office, including at least 187 former lobbyists and also 125 people with ties to conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, the records show. A database of the employees, assembled through hundreds of open records requests, has been posted online by ProPublica. It offers a comprehensive look at how Mr. Trump is influencing the direction of the federal government, beyond high-profile cabinet appointments and other Senate-confirmed posts, and how he has rewarded people who have been loyal to him or share his priorities.

805,"SEOUL, South Korea — He has never traveled abroad as North Korea’s supreme leader. Until this week, his close encounters with foreign guests had been limited to dignitaries from China, Cuba and Syria — and Dennis Rodman. He increasingly resembles his grandfather, a national deity, down to the coifed flattop, gregarious grin and rotund waist. So when a delegation of South Korean officials arrived to visit they did not know what to expect from the leader, Kim Jong-un, a 34-year-old with a nuclear arsenal, who has remained an enigma even as his weapons tests have terrified the world. The envoys, some old enough to be Mr. Kim’s father, were taken aback by his friendliness and “forthcoming and daring” responses during a Monday meeting in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, that exceeded four hours, according to South Korean officials. They had worried that Mr. Kim would threaten a fragile détente if South Korea and the United States resumed joint military exercises next month. Previously, the North has responded to such drills with missile tests and shrill warnings of a nuclear strike on America. “We hope you can make another bold decision so we can overcome this hurdle,” read a bullet point in the handwritten memo carried by the South’s chief delegate, Chung Eui-yong. An image of the memo was captured by the North’s state-run television. Mr. Kim surprised the South Korean diplomats not only by accepting joint South Korean-United States military drills as a reality, but also by expressing a willingness to start negotiations with Washington on ending his nuclear weapons program. He also told them he would suspend all nuclear and ballistic missile tests while such talks were underway. "

807,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Turkish government took the extraordinary step on Wednesday of asking the United States to stop Kurdish commanders from diverting their forces from areas of eastern Syria to the fight in Afrin in the west. The request followed an announcement from the Kurdish forces, which are allied with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State militant group, that they intended to send 1,700 fighters from Deir al-Zour, a strategically important eastern province, to the fight against Turkey in Afrin, a Kurdish enclave. Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, said his country had taken “the necessary steps” through official channels and “expected from the U.S. that it should absolutely step in” to prevent the movement of the Kurdish forces from Manbij to Afrin. “This is our most natural right,” Mr. Kalin added. It was not clear why Mr. Kalin had referred to Manbij, a city at the westernmost point of the Syrian territory held by the Kurds, though it might have been cited as a way station for the troops as they moved toward Afrin. There was no immediate American response to the request by the Turks, an American ally and NATO member that invaded Afrin in January and threatened to drive the Kurds from the entire Syria-Turkey border. But the Turkish assault has since bogged down. The fighting in Afrin is creating problems for the United States. The transfer of personnel from the Kurdish-led, American-backed militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., is a blow to Washington’s effort to stamp out the last vestiges of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. "
808,"BEIJING — When China hosted the last serious talks on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, in the mid-2000s, the setting was a huge, hexagonal table covered in green felt, in a government guesthouse in Beijing. At each side of the table, made specially by the Chinese, were diplomats from one of the six countries involved: North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China itself. Months passed between sessions, sometimes a year. Occasionally, China rearranged the seating, hoping for better chemistry among the delegates as they endured the complex, eye-glazing proceedings. In 2009, North Korea walked out — ending, to China’s dismay, the so-called six-party talks that Beijing had nurtured and prodded along for six years. Nearly a decade later, China is a bystander as President Trump says he’s open to the North’s new offer to talk. Even so, analysts say, Beijing is sure to be pleased by the prospect of a drawn-out diplomatic process that delays the possibility of war on its border — even if the talks ultimately come to nothing. And the new warmth between North and South Korea, which plan to hold a summit meeting next month, is a further boon to China, which would welcome any strains in the South’s alliance with the United States. “China’s priority is for the tension to be defused and for the talks to start,” said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, a research institute in Washington. “The Chinese have acknowledged their inability to make that happen, so they are O.K. with not leading the campaign.” "
809,"With Uber and Lyft cars taking over Manhattan streets, a state task force has proposed a surcharge of $2 to $5 on rides in for-hire vehicles as part of a broader congestion pricing plan to keep traffic moving and raise money to shore up public transit. But now a prominent transportation expert, Bruce Schaller, contends that those fees are simply too low to deter most passengers from calling cars, and in any case, would result in only a temporary reduction in congestion before being offset by the rapidly growing ride-hailing services. In a new report on Wednesday, Mr. Schaller calls instead for charging all for-hire vehicles — including yellow taxis and Uber and Lyft cars — $50 per hour to drive in Midtown Manhattan during weekday business hours, and $20 per hour in Lower Manhattan, the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side. Mr. Schaller, a former city transportation official, said he based the fees on current parking garage prices in Manhattan. “It takes high parking fees to really discourage people from driving into Manhattan,” said Mr. Schaller, who advised to the state task force. “Uber and Lyft and taxi passengers need the same price signals.” The hourly fee would be passed along to passengers. By his calculation, the average fare for a ride that begins and ends in Midtown would more than double to $24 from $10. The average fare for rides from Midtown to other Manhattan neighborhoods, or vice versa, would increase to $28 from $14, he said. It would also apply to vehicles even when they are not carrying passengers to discourage drivers from just circulating around Manhattan streets looking for business. Mr. Schaller said those fees would be billed to ride-hailing companies and taxi owners, who could pass that on to passengers through higher fares. "

811,"The announcement that President Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, plans to resign after apparently losing a battle over raising tariffs ratchets up concern that the White House is turning sharply toward protectionism. The deepest fear is that the planned steel and aluminum tariffs will echo the mistake of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which provoked a global trade war and helped fuel the Great Depression. The alarmists are getting a bit ahead of the story, however. Periods of deglobalization — when nations begin shuttering their borders to flows of trade, money and people — tended to be slow processes, not sudden events. They started with tectonic shifts — global wars and crises — not minor import levies. And they unfolded over decades, not years. The last era of deglobalization actually began when countries turned inward after World War I, more than a decade before Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression. It is important to view Mr. Trump’s latest trade actions in that historical context. The suggested higher tariffs on steel and aluminum are too narrowly targeted to trigger a trade war but represent another chapter in the evolving era of deglobalization. This era began long before Mr. Trump took office, but he is now capitalizing on the popular backlash against globalization. The mood turned decisively after the Great Recession of 2008. Trade collapsed as a share of the world economy, and despite some pickup in the past two years, trade has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. One big reason: the barriers that countries like India and Russia have been raising to block the flow of trade, money and people at their borders. In every year since 2010, the leading economies have instituted more discriminatory trade measures than liberalizing ones, according to data from Global Trade Alert. The difference with Mr. Trump is that he is reviving the old-school and easily detected weapon of the tariff. Many other countries have been using a wide array of non-tariff barriers. Some are stealthy, like hidden subsidies for export industries. Others are blatant, like barring foreign competitors outright. Though the world is now a decade into this age of deglobalization — with flows of money and migrants also running well below the peaks reached before 2008 — it’s an exaggeration to compare Trump’s tariffs to a tipping point like Smoot-Hawley. "
812,"The current president may be completely uninterested in cultivating a number of traditional political skills — among them a sense of discretion and at least the semblance of self-control — but he has an uncanny feel for political symbolism, especially when it comes to the role of manufacturing in the United States. Factory work provides a diminishing share of working-class jobs: There were 43,000 iron and steelworkers last year, compared with almost 2 million hospital and home health aides. But to hear President Trump tell it, the factory workers are the ones who matter most. Just last week, he declared steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, tweeting that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” Joshua B. Freeman’s rich and ambitious “Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World” depicts a world in retreat that still looms large in the national imagination. “Behemoth” is more than an economic history, or a chronicle of architectural feats and labor movements. Freeman, a professor at Queens College and the Graduate Center of CUNY, traces the rise of the factory and how it became entwined with Enlightenment ideas of progress — “the notion that through human effort and rationality the world could be transformed toward greater abundance, well-being and moral order.” Factories weren’t always imbued with such lofty ideals. They were initially devised “to take advantage of mundane commercial opportunities,” Freeman writes. He dates the first factory to 1721: a silk mill, built in Derby, England. In the decade after it opened, Daniel Defoe paid it a visit, declaring it “a Curiosity of a very extraordinary Nature.” The proliferation of these curiosities, culminating in the Industrial Revolution, took some time. Obtaining machinery and technical know-how often entailed some trade espionage, before the British government took an active hand in promoting industrial development. Labor discipline was another matter. In the farming and domestic work that people had been doing for generations, “intense activity alternated with slack times,” whereas factory production was repetitive and continuous, requiring “coordinated activity by dozens or hundreds of workers, who were expected to start and stop work at the same time, day after day.” Now that factory work and stable, blue-collar jobs are such potent sources of nostalgia, it can be hard to recall how truly disruptive the manufacturing age was. Freeman does a superb job of reminding us. For an agrarian society like England, the factory generated a wistfulness for the bucolic agricultural past. The “dark Satanic Mills” bemoaned by William Blake were powered by steam and coal-fired boilers that belched smoke and soot. Seventy-hour work weeks were common. Male workers chafed at the constant supervision on the factory floor, and owners preferred not to employ men, anyway. “Today, in the United States, factories are associated with masculinity,” Freeman writes, “but in their early days they were spaces largely occupied by women and children.” "
813,"To the Editor: Re “Top Economic Adviser to Quit After Tariff Dispute” (front page, March 7): It seems rather odd that Gary Cohn chose not to resign over President Trump’s comments about the Charlottesville march (“very fine people on both sides”), and yet finds that the president’s trade war has crossed some sort of personal line in the sand. Moreover, as a Jew (as am I), he opted not to speak out in the face of anti-Semitic rhetoric sanctioned by his boss. Mr. Cohn’s service in this administration seems to be predicated solely on making sure the tax cut was enacted. Any thought that he is taking a principled stand on the trade issue is disingenuous and self-serving and rings hollow. SHARON RUZUMNA

Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on Facebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding.

Even people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming. “The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,” Mr. Thiel said. “We were far from perfect in doing that.” Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley, ranging from the tech elite’s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel obtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger audience). Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump, whom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a typical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley peers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to talk about both. “It’s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,” Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower. Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr. Trump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare. The investor said he had last spoken to the president “a few months ago.” “We don’t talk that often,” he said, but added, “I can get access anytime I want.” The Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would “end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,” move us past “fake culture wars” and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got. “There are all these ways that things have fallen short,” Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. “It’s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,” he said, referring to the other candidates. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged,” the bible of the movement. A gift, he said. A lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher René Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group about Mr. Girard’s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic, which is to say they copy one another. “It’s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,” Mr. Thiel said. “Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.” It was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook — where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to — when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000. He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook’s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left. Last summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed “catastrophically bad judgment” in supporting Mr. Trump. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings “ideological diversity.” He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did. “Remember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy — ‘How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?’ That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,” he said. “They did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.” Facebook declined to comment. The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance — its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House. “The Trump campaign slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,” he said. “Silicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.” A friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel’s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn’t be a banality, such as “it’s making us more connected,” and it couldn’t be utopian, such as “it’s going to cure all diseases.” “He wasn’t able to come up with an answer, and I couldn’t come up with one, either,” Mr. Thiel said. He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent start-up accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run “for many reasons.” There is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel’s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now. “Having some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,” he said. “But there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.” He added that the companies “are probably in some trouble — maybe it’s a little, maybe it’s a lot.” The prospect of government regulation looms. In 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was campaigning to become Missouri’s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state’s Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, said there was “no connection” between Mr. Thiel’s donation and the investigation. Google declined to comment. The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments. “Network effects are very positive things, but there’s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,” he said. Another of Mr. Thiel’s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to Gawker’s bankruptcy in 2016. A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel’s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here. “Gawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,” he said. “The ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them — these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.” Mr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory. He denied this. “Terry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,” he said. “I don’t want the archives. I don’t think it makes sense to destroy them. Preserve them, study them instead.” "

Here’s what we’re watching: • How foreign is Broadcom? • The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House. • The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs. • Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. As the Trump administration weighs whether to block the chip maker’s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a central issue is how much of a threat the deal is to national security. In an effort to assuage concerns, Broadcom pledged Wednesday to increase research spending on 5G wireless tech and to create a $1.5 billion fund to invest in training engineering talent in the United States to help allay those concerns. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer. Beyond Broadcom’s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let’s take a look at a number of factors. Sales First, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: According to Broadcom’s most recent annual report, roughly 7 percent of its $17.6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States. The single biggest market for the company is China, which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue. “Other” markets made up nearly 38 percent. "
816,"To the Editor: Re “Go Ahead, Millennials, Destroy Us,” by Tim Kreider (Op-Ed, March 3): It shouldn’t be necessary to vilify one generation to support claims for a younger one, but writers often succumb to that rhetorical temptation. While I applaud and fully support the efforts of high school students to bring about meaningful gun control in this violence-addicted country, I also reflect on the fact that — having been born in 1944 — I have witnessed members of my generation energize the civil rights struggle, bring an end to the Vietnam War, create the feminist revolution, make important strides toward nuclear disarmament and environmental protection, and help elect this country’s first black president. Let us all fight the injustices around us instead of creating generational scorecards. JOEL SAVISHINSKY, SEATTLE The writer is professor emeritus in the social sciences at Ithaca (N.Y.) College. To the Editor: How did we baby boomers mess up? Let me count the ways. We did little to prevent the environmental destruction of our planet; we watched as our country plunged headlong into unwinnable wars, despite the lessons of Vietnam; we let this country drift into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with no one held accountable; and oh yeah, we elected Donald Trump. The millennials and Generation Z could hardly do worse. MICHAEL KAUFFMAN
SANTA MONICA, CALIF. "
817,"JERUSALEM — In two months, the United States plans to open a new embassy to fulfill President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. There’s just one problem: The embassy may be in Jerusalem, but it may not be fully in Israel. The diplomatic compound that will serve as the American Embassy until a permanent site is found lies partly in a contested zone known as No Man’s Land. No Man’s Land encompasses the area between the armistice lines drawn at the end of the 1948-49 war and was claimed by Jordan and Israel. Israel won full control of it in the 1967 war, so the United Nations and much of the world consider it occupied territory. The State Department has avoided taking a clear position on the matter but relies on the fact that Israel and Jordan had informally divided the contested enclave. The provisional embassy site, in the Arnona neighborhood, “has been in continuous Israeli use since 1949,” the department said in a statement last week. “It is today a mixed residential-commercial neighborhood.” The Palestinians are less equivocal. “No Man’s Land is occupied territory,” said Ashraf Khatib of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s Negotiations Affairs Department. “Any permanent status for that territory should be part of a final status negotiation.” The dispute could turn the American ambassador, David M. Friedman, an avid supporter of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, into a new kind of diplomatic settler himself. The plan is for the embassy to be housed in what is now the consular services section of the United States Consulate General in Jerusalem while the search is on for a permanent site. The fortresslike compound sits partly in predominantly Jewish West Jerusalem and partly in a section of No Man’s Land between West Jerusalem and predominantly Arab East Jerusalem. The American Embassy move veers from almost seven decades of American policy, and that of much of the rest of the world, which considers the status of Jerusalem subject to negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians, who each claim it as their capital. Critics say the embassy move prejudges the outcome of any future negotiations over the city. But if the American recognition was already vague, leaving the eventual boundaries of sovereignty in Jerusalem up to the Israelis and the Palestinians, this odd quirk of political geography raises even sharper questions about which parts of the city the United States considers as Israel’s capital. That requires some historical unpacking. After the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, Israel signed an armistice agreement with Jordan, which controlled the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The sides demarcated the armistice line on a map in grease pencil. Where they did not agree they drew their own lines staking out their maximalist positions — the Israelis in green, as far as possible to the east, the Jordanians in red, to the west. The disputed enclaves, called the “areas between the lines,” were under neither party’s control and came to be known as No Man’s Land. A senior United Nations official, who was granted anonymity to discuss a particularly sensitive diplomatic issue, said it was impossible to tell from the 1949 map exactly which parts of the Arnona consular compound sit where. The lines were drawn with the thickness of a crayon, and none of the current development in the area existed then. But any part between the lines would be considered occupied territory, he said. After 1949, both Israel and Jordan claimed the territory, holding that its status would be determined in an eventual agreement. When the 1967 war broke out, the Jordanian and Israeli armies fought over it. Raphael Israeli, a professor emeritus at Hebrew University and a former Israeli delegate to the Israel-Jordan Mixed Armistice Commission, says that neither Israel nor Jordan had formal jurisdiction of it. “They simply invaded it,” he said. Today, he said, after 50 years of Israeli possession and no country having had sovereignty over it beforehand, questions about its status are moot. “You can start making hairsplitting arguments,” he said, “but it seems so obsolete now. Things got blended together, and I don’t know any more which is what and what belongs to whom.” After 1949, the Israelis set about fencing and farming land on their side of the territory. A Jordanian road to Bethlehem meandered through. Both sides stationed troops in the zone. There were also instances of cooperation, such as when Jordan agreed to work with Israeli experts to eradicate a moth-borne blight infesting pine trees in the area. But when an Israeli entrepreneur began constructing a hotel on a slope in the zone in 1963, the Jordanians lodged a complaint and the work was stopped. The hotel, named the Diplomat, was opened after the Israeli victory in 1967. Located on the grounds of the consular compound, it is now owned by the United States and leased out as housing for elderly Russian-speaking immigrants. Before moving to Arnona in 2010, the American consular section that served Arabs and Jews was in East Jerusalem. The United States Consulate General that deals with the Palestinian Authority is in West Jerusalem. Eugene Kontorovich, the director of international law at the conservative Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum, contends that by moving the embassy to the Arnona site the United States is recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over areas it captured in the 1967 war. “Much more important than what the State Department says, it is what their actions say,” Mr. Kontorovich said. “You don’t build an embassy in territory that is not sovereign to Israel.” "

822,"Christina Hoff Sommers is a self-identified feminist and registered Democrat with a Ph.D. in philosophy and a wicked sense of humor. She is also a woman who says bad things. Things like: Men and women are equal, but there are differences between them. Or: The gender gap in STEM fields isn’t simply the result of sexism. Or: Contrary to received wisdom, the American school system actually favors girls, not boys. When such a person steps foot on a college campus these days, you know what’s coming. So it was on Monday at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Ore., where Ms. Sommers had been invited by the Federalist Society to give a talk about feminism. In advance of the lecture, nine student groups, among them the Portland National Lawyers Guild, the Minority Law Student Association, the Women’s Law Caucus, the Jewish Law Society and the school’s Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter sent a letter protesting the appearance by this “known fascist.” The letter added that her invitation amounted to an “act of aggression and violence” and went on to offer a curious definition of free speech: “Freedom of speech is certainly an important tenet to a free, healthy society, but that freedom stops when it has a negative and violent impact on other individuals.” Yes, these future lawyers believe that free speech is acceptable only when it doesn’t offend them. Which is to say, they don’t believe in it at all. For the lecture itself, a student wearing a jacket emblazoned with the command “Stay Woke” led protesters in shouting “Microaggressions are real” and “No platform for fascists.” Ms. Sommers handled matters as gracefully as possible, but had delivered only half her lecture before Janet Steverson, a law professor and the school’s dean of diversity and inclusion, asked her to cut her remarks short and take questions from the hardy souls who somehow survived the violence of her words.

824,"What did the actress Helen Mirren drink a shot of on the Oscars red carpet on Sunday? Tequila. What did Sarah Jessica Parker’s character and her tennis-playing friend have on the rocks with extra lime on the recent season finale of “Divorce”? Tequila. What did Kelly LeVeque, a Los Angeles nutritionist, recently advise her famous client Jennifer Garner to try instead of wine? Te-qui-la! Sixty years after the Champs’s song of that name went gold, the blue agave-based drink is having a renaissance as a beverage to sip and savor on its own, rather than disguise with Ecto Cooler colored margarita mix or shoot, eyes closed, nostrils pinched, in the back of a bar. Other famous Jennifers (Aniston, Lawrence) also drink it. Justin Timberlake and P. Diddy (who have their own brands) drink it. And so, apparently, do you. Since 2002, sales of tequila have risen 121 percent, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade organization. (Sales of vodka, which filled Cosmopolitans and appletinis in the early aughts, rose by only 2.4 percent.) In January the liquor conglomerate Bacardi acquired the high-end tequila brand Patron for $5.1 billion, and last year Diageo, another conglomerate, paid $1 billion for Casamigos, the tequila concocted by George Clooney and Rande Gerber. Connoisseurs discuss tequila’s tasting notes and aromas — the citrusy bite of an unaged blanco, the mellow spice of five year old anejo — and more than 600 others that are cataloged in the Mexican Academy of Tequila. Wellness enthusiasts like Gwyneth Paltrow tout its lack of gluten, relatively few calories (around 65 per shot) and agavins, said to lower triglycerides. “Not a lot of people think, what was the alcohol first? Was it a potato, a grape, an agave plant?” Ms. LeVeque said. “Because it’s hard alcohol and you’re sipping it slow, you’re getting that buzz effect but you’re not getting the elevated blood sugar that can come with drinking.” "
825,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Talk of a trade war, old-school news and an icon’s rebuke. Here’s what you need to know. • A gathering storm. Countries around the world are readying retaliation if President Trump signs off on stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He is expected to do so as soon as today. The European Union has announced its counterattack, including taxing U.S. goods like Harley-Davidsons and filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization. South Korea worries that tariffs will derail its efforts to denuclearize the North, and Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans warned of their impact on key trading partners. Here’s a look at what Australia has to lose. _____ • The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum revoked a prestigious human rights award it had given to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who is now Myanmar’s civilian leader. The museum faulted Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi for failing “to condemn or stop the military’s brutal campaign” against the country’s minority Rohingya population. The decision is perhaps the strongest condemnation yet of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been increasingly criticized for the Myanmar military’s campaign of ethnic violence. _____ • Kim Jong-un’s meeting with South Korean envoys this week was an eye-catching diplomatic debut for the enigmatic young dictator. Mr. Kim even surprised the South Koreans with his willingness to start negotiations on nuclear disarmament. Still, the path to talks is riddled with obstacles, including new U.S. sanctions on Mr. Kim’s government for use of a banned nerve agent in the assassination of his half brother in Malaysia last year. A drawn-out diplomatic process will be good for Beijing, delaying the possibility of war on its border. In today’s episode of “The Daily” podcast, our White House correspondent looks at what happened to the threat of nuclear war. _____ • The British authorities confirmed that a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned by a nerve agent in England this week. Suspicion is now rampant that the episode was an assassination — and that Russia may be responsible. Though officials insist that it is far too soon to lay blame, Britain must confront the possibility that once again, an attack on British soil was carried out by the government of President Vladimir Putin. The former spy, Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, remain in critical condition. _____ • In honor of International Women’s Day — an official holiday in many countries, including Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and much of Central Asia — here are two uplifting stories: Sunitha Krishnan works for sex trafficking victims in India. “I don’t deny that I was a victim,” she said. “But my healing was self-determined, and that is why I call myself a survivor.” And Hoda Katebi is the founder of Joojoo Azad, a politically charged fashion blog that challenges stereotypes of hijab-wearing Muslim women. _____ • Our tech columnist skipped digital news for two months, reading only newspapers. His old-school experiment led to some interesting conclusions.

Today is International Women’s Day, a global recognition of women’s achievements. We’re looking back more than 100 years to recognize the place in history of a group of 223 women. In 1917, on the eve of World War I, the U.S. government drafted 2.8 million men into military service. The Army realized that its success would rely on the Allies’ use of a new technology: the telephone. Enter the Hello Girls, a group of bilingual telephone operators selected for working the switchboards in France, connecting the front lines with supply depots and military command. They often handled over 150,000 calls per day. But because they were women, the U.S. government denied them veteran status for more than 60 years after the war. “The unfortunate reality is their service wasn’t officially recognized with veteran status until 1979 when a small fraction of those who served were still alive,” a senior curator at the National World War I Museum and Memorial said. “To achieve that point of hard won recognition took a monumental effort.” Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

826,"TRENTON — David Byrne is his own narrator. In conversation, he frequently interrupts himself to interject his internal monologue, as though he’s both performing a play and announcing the stage directions. Backstage at the CURE Insurance Arena here, where he and his band are rehearsing for a tour, he starred in a brief pas de deux with a malfunctioning electric kettle. “What’s wrong with this thing? C’mon! Be nice!” he said. “I think it might be broken. Or the outlet might not be on.” He laughed. Just as it seemed his laugh had ended, he laughed again. “I’ll come back to that later.” Although he’s often construed as a cheeky urban ironist, much of Mr. Byrne’s music, in the Pop Art tradition of Richard Hamilton or Andy Warhol, arises from an ingenuous fascination with mundane objects. Cynicism and wonder both permeate his new slippery art-pop album, “American Utopia,” which, he said, portrays “the state of the country: who we are, who we hope to be, all this kind of thing.” The album title is neither ironic nor literal. “I’m certainly not describing any utopia,” said Mr. Byrne, 65, as he sliced a ginger root with a serrated chef’s knife. “Some of the verses, especially, are kind of dystopian, or not exactly cheerful. But they’re countered by the choruses, which seem to give a sense of hope.” Mr. Byrne’s forlorn, hilarious portrait of the country is well summarized in “Dog’s Mind,” a wiry electronic ballad. “We are dogs in our own paradise, in a theme park all our own,” he sings placidly. “Doggie dancers doing duty, doggie dreaming all day long.” "
827,"Update: The sponsor of a proposal to name a Utah highway route in honor of the president dropped the bill after this story published. Representative Mike E. Noel said he believed he had enough votes to pass the measure, but had received too many personal attacks after news of the bill spread. Families visiting America’s iconic national parks this summer might be surprised to find a new attraction amid the canyons, cliffs and juniper trees: the Donald J. Trump Utah National Parks Highway. A Utah lawmaker has introduced a bill that would rename the state’s most scenic route in honor of the president, placing 62 Donald Trump signs along a 600-mile stretch that rolls through or near five national parks: Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon and Zion. The bill’s sponsor, State Representative Michael E. Noel, a Republican, is calling the move a show of gratitude to Mr. Trump for the president’s December decision to slash the size of two contentious national monuments in the state, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. An opponent of the bill, State Senator Jim Dabakis, has said he would fight it by adding the name of an adult film star who is reported to have had an affair with the president. “If it gets to the Senate,” Mr. Dabakis threatened on Twitter this week, “I will present an amendment that the frontage road be designated as the Stormy Daniels rampway.” But Mr. Dabakis, a Democrat, could be on the losing side in a state where the Legislature is dominated by Republicans who have supported Mr. Trump for scaling back the monuments. “I think it’s going to happen,” he conceded in a telephone interview from the Senate floor. “If a vote is forced, there is not a lot of Utah politicians that are going to stand up and say they are against anything Trump.” "
828,"BRUSSELS — European Union officials unveiled an array of tariffs on Wednesday that they would place on American-made goods if the United States followed through on President Trump’s plan to impose penalties on imported steel and aluminum, raising the specter of a trade war. The announcement in Brussels was the latest rebuke to Mr. Trump’s proposed tariffs, which have met with consternation domestically and with threats of retaliation abroad. The president’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, said on Tuesday that he was resigning, a move widely believed to be linked to the trade plan, which he had lobbied against. Republican leaders, including Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, have also railed against the tariffs. Internationally, the plan for the new American tariffs — blanket penalties of 25 percent on imported steel and of 10 percent on aluminum — have drawn concern from allies including Britain and Canada, as well as from rivals like China. The European Union had warned of retaliatory charges last week, and outlined those plans on Wednesday. Such a move by the United States would “put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response,” Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union commissioner for trade, said at a news conference in Brussels. European officials have been meeting with their counterparts in Washington, urging them to revisit the plans, she added. If the American tariffs are put in place, Ms. Malmstrom said, Brussels could take three steps: It could take the case to the World Trade Organization, add safeguards to protect the European Union against steel diverted from the United States, and impose tariffs on a series of American-made goods. A provisional list of items being targeted ranges from steel to T-shirts, also including bed linen, chewing tobacco, cranberries and orange juice, among other products. The overall size of the business affected is relatively small, worth about 2.8 billion euros, or $3.5 billion, in imports, paling in comparison with the nearly €250 billion of goods the 28-nation bloc bought from the United States in 2016. European leaders were quick to stress that they did not want to trigger a wider trade dispute, with Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, saying in a tweet that trade wars were “bad and easy to lose,” a reference to an earlier tweet by Mr. Trump in which he claimed they were “good and easy to win.” Officials elsewhere have also tried to cool tensions. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, warned in an interview on French radio that in a trade war, “nobody wins, one generally finds losers on both sides.” But it reflects concern in Europe over the possible impact of new American tariffs, notably on steel. The United States is the world’s largest importer of steel, and while many of Mr. Trump’s arguments have focused on cheap steel from countries like China, the European Union as a whole is the single biggest exporter of steel to the United States. At the same time, the region is concerned that cheap steel that had been destined for the United States could now flood the Continent, putting significant pressure on European producers. While retaliation from Brussels appears limited for now, it could have an impact on American domestic politics. Bourbon, one of the products that European officials have targeted, is made in Kentucky, the home state of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Other items that could face tariffs are motorcycles, and the corporate headquarters of Harley-Davidson are in Wisconsin, Mr. Ryan’s state. “The Europeans have rights, too, to retaliate,” said Peter Chase, a former American diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels focusing on trade. “The E.U. is concerned that behind it all, there are people in the U.S. administration that don’t care that there might be damage to the international system of rule of law that we have created.” The list, which was leaked on Monday and has been referred to by the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is subject to the agreement of the bloc’s 28 member states. It highlights how sharply the outlook on trade between the United States and Europe has shifted. Since 2013, Washington and Brussels have been negotiating a vast trade deal, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. By late 2016, however, those talks appeared to have reached a stalemate, and Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from a similar pact with Pacific Rim countries early in his presidency signaled the death of the European agreement, as well. The strong negative reaction to Mr. Trump’s planned tariffs appears to have had little impact on the president, who insisted this week that he would not back down. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump singled out the European Union, which he said had “not treated us very well, and it’s been a very, very unfair trade situation.” The president warned that the United States would also consider raising its tariffs on cars made within the bloc if the European Union were to retaliate. While he left the door open for compromise with allies, tensions are rising in Europe. “We’ve loaded the guns,” said Charles de Lusignan, a spokesman for the European Steel Association, a lobbying group, “and we’re ready to use them in case the aggression comes.” "
829,"The giant chip maker Broadcom pledged on Wednesday to keep the United States at the forefront of emerging mobile technology if it were to acquire Qualcomm, its latest effort to allay the Trump administration’s national security concerns about its hostile $117 billion takeover bid. In a statement, Broadcom said that, were it to complete what would be the largest technology deal in history, it would not only maintain Qualcomm’s current spending on research and development but it would increase that amount. It added that it would create a $1.5 billion investment fund to train American engineers. “This will ensure America’s lead in future wireless technology,” Broadcom said. The response came after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, ordered a delay of Qualcomm’s shareholder meeting as Broadcom sought to win a majority of the company’s board seats. That proactive move, all but unprecedented in the history of the panel, highlighted both how much the White House values the wireless technology known as 5G as a matter of national security and its fears of falling behind China in the race to develop the standard. The decision put a spotlight on efforts to expand the reach of the panel, known as Cfius, as a way to bolster the White House’s nationalist economic agenda. The Trump administration has already blocked a number of deals involving Chinese buyers, citing national security concerns. But while Broadcom is not Chinese — it is legally headquartered in Singapore, and plans to relocate to the United States as soon as May — it has nonetheless incurred fears that it may erode Qualcomm’s lead in 5G. Some lawmakers, including Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, have urged the Trump administration to intervene. And on Jan. 29, Qualcomm requested that Cfius review the situation. The panel’s intervention put Broadcom’s bid in jeopardy just as the company appeared likely to claim seats on Qualcomm’s board. Qualcomm has argued — and Cfius appears inclined to believe — that Broadcom’s winning a majority of director seats would effectively put Qualcomm under its rival’s control. A letter to both companies from Cfius sent on Sunday said that the government was worried about cost cuts that Broadcom may carry out at Qualcomm. Cfius described Broadcom’s approach to acquisitions as akin to private equity, shorthand for reducing research spending and laying off workers to bolster profitability. But Broadcom sought in its statement on Wednesday to dispel that notion. “Broadcom has a proven track record of managing R&D for maximum impact and investing in core franchises,” the company said. Cfius’s letter also referred vaguely to worries about Broadcom’s relationships with “third party foreign entities.” In its statement, Broadcom argued that it was American in every way but legally, highlighting that businesses it has acquired descended from companies like Hewlett-Packard and AT&T. "
830,"Mexico City — On July 1, we Mexicans will choose our president for the next six years. It will be no ordinary election. During a period when democracy is being globally threatened, what may be in play is not only a change in government but also a change in the very nature of the liberal democracy that Mexico has built since the outset of the century. It would not be the first time that a democratic election puts democracy to the test. Some of the oldest and most established democracies are now facing that predicament. A change in government is desirable. The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., deserves to lose the election for having yet again committed and embraced acts of corruption that we all associate with the party’s usual behavior through the 20th century. We who were part of the struggle for democracy during the final decades of the last century know that history well. In 1928, President Plutarco Elías Calles had declared that the age of revolutionary caudillos was over. Mexico was no longer to be “the country of a single man” but was beginning an “era of institutions.” And the P.R.I. was born. All aspirants to power were to renounce any call to arms in exchange for the possibility of gaining the presidency merely through choice by the departing president. It was an absolute monarchy in republican clothing, with a new king every six years. The term limit was the only limit. This orderly transfer of power prevailed in Mexico for 70 years. There were other parties, but it was the government that organized the elections, counted the votes and dispensed thousands of federal and local appointments. There was no division of power and little freedom of expression. Although, until the late ’60s, some of the economic and social results of the regime were acceptable, corruption was a constant stain: Every presidential term produced a brood of multimillionaire politicians. The final decades of the 20th century were scarred by economic and political crises. Liberalization in both areas could not be postponed. And it occurred. In 2000, the victory of Vicente Fox, candidate of the center-right National Action Party, or P.A.N., put an end to the P.R.I.’s long reign. And the democratic experiment that we are living through at present began. There has been alternation in power. The P.A.N. won again with Felipe Calderón in 2006, and in 2012 the presidential power returned to the P.R.I. with Enrique Peña Nieto. In today’s Mexico, the president is not an absolute monarch nor does he designate his successor. In the Congress, various parties are represented and influential, not only the P.R.I. And the Supreme Court is independent. Key autonomous entities — among them the central bank and the National Electoral Institute — operate professionally. Although it is still somewhat limited, freedom of expression has revealed cases of corruption that would have remained hidden in the 20th century. "
831,"WASHINGTON — Gary D. Cohn was an avatar for big business in the White House. His departure will leave a market-oriented void in President Trump’s inner circle at what could be a pivotal moment for the United States economy. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has been the strongest opponent of economic policies that have rankled Republican allies and business groups, especially Mr. Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on foreign products and scuttle multilateral trade agreements. A blunt and outspoken adviser, Mr. Cohn took on the sometimes lonely task of carrying the banner of free trade and free markets, countering what he and Republican lawmakers viewed as a false narrative peddled by other advisers about the economic implications of protectionist policies. His resignation as head of the National Economic Council leaves a White House steeped with advisers who have encouraged the president’s more protectionist impulses. Few of his top economic policy aides share the traditional Republican views of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. That could reduce the already low odds of Mr. Trump championing traditional Republican and business priorities in the months and years to come, including free trade, immigration, infrastructure and reducing the federal budget deficit. Congressional Republicans and industry leaders, who only recently were celebrating the party’s passage of a sweeping tax cut, are suddenly very worried about Mr. Trump’s next moves on economic policy. A senior Republican aide said on Wednesday that the departure would allow the White House to move ahead with damaging economic policies that could stifle growth. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said on Wednesday he remained concerned that the White House was not aligned with traditional Republican views on free trade. "
832,"SACRAMENTO — California and the Trump administration have locked horns from the very first hours of Donald J. Trump’s presidency. But a visit by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the California capital, Sacramento, on Wednesday produced an unfiltered shouting match that was remarkable even for the long-embattled antagonists, and seemed to be a culmination of fraying relations between the conservative administration and the country’s deepest blue state. Mr. Sessions told a crowd of more than 200 law enforcement officials in a hotel ballroom that he would not stand for the insubordination of California lawmakers and what he called the dangerous obstruction of federal immigration laws. A 10-minute walk away, in a briefing room of the State Capitol, Gov. Jerry Brown unleashed a tirade against Mr. Sessions and the Trump administration. He said that the administration was “full of liars” and that Mr. Sessions was “basically going to war against the state of California.” It was highly unusual for an attorney general “to come out here and engage in a political stunt, make wild accusations, many of which are based on outright lies,” Mr. Brown added, “particularly a fellow coming from Alabama talking to us about secession and protecting human and civil rights.” Warning that California’s liberal politicians were endangering the state’s citizens and obstructing federal law, Mr. Sessions announced on Wednesday that the Trump administration was suing the state over laws devised to make it more difficult for federal immigration agents to operate there. Mr. Sessions described the state’s so-called sanctuary laws as a radical maneuver that would threaten public safety and throw open the nation’s borders to even more illegal immigration. "
833,"WASHINGTON — More than 100 Republican lawmakers implored President Trump to drop plans for stiff and sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs as the White House prepared to formalize the measures on Thursday afternoon. Officials said late Wednesday that the plan would initially exempt Canada and Mexico and could ultimately exclude other allies. Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, said on Wednesday night that the president would hold a signing ceremony on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. He said the tariffs would go into effect in 15 to 30 days. “The proclamation will have a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico,” Mr. Navarro said in an interview on Fox Business Network. A permanent exclusion will hinge on those countries agreeing to a “great” trade deal in the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, he said. “We’re going to open this up for our allies to just see if we can work through this problem,” Mr. Navarro added. Mr. Trump has said the tariffs would apply to countries across the board and that any exemptions could open a Pandora’s box of requests for special treatment. That has prompted stiff blowback from trading partners, Republicans and the financial markets, which sank over fears that across-the-board tariffs would incite retaliatory action that stunts the United States’ economic growth. It also prompted the resignation of Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who had argued against broad tariffs and said on Tuesday he would leave the White House in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, 107 Republican members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the president expressing concern about broad tariffs and calling for him to focus any action on unfair trading partners, like China.

834,"To the Editor: Re “Some Hope From North Korea” (editorial, March 7): President Moon Jae-in of South Korea deserves great credit for bringing North Korea to the table. But the talks hold peril as well as promise. North Korea appears to see its nuclear arsenal as essential to regime survival, keeping it from becoming another Libya, and in return would likely demand full United States withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula. At that point, talks could break down, giving President Trump an excuse to unleash “fire and fury” in a war that could kill hundreds of thousands — or millions if it went nuclear. To have a greater chance of success, talks should start with modest aims, such as a freeze in North Korean testing in return for a freeze in United States-South Korean military exercises. Meanwhile, we must urge Congress to pass legislation, sponsored by Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Ro Khanna, barring the president from attacking North Korea without congressional authorization. The ball is not only in President Trump’s court, but in ours as well, to prevent a disastrous war. DAVID KEPPEL, BLOOMINGTON, IND. To the Editor: The announcement that North Korea is willing to put its nuclear arms program on hold is incredibly important. It looks as if President Trump’s clenched fist and open palm method of negotiating is paying dividends. Although I’ve criticized almost everything he’s done since taking office, let me be among the first to offer Mr. Trump congratulations on what appears to be a major foreign relations breakthrough. This truly is welcome news. DENNY FREIDENRICH
LAGUNA BEACH, CALIF. To the Editor: For more than 60 years the world has tried to find a solution to the Korean situation. All of the conventional approaches have yielded little. Perhaps we need to rethink our approach with a Marshall Plan for North Korea. North Korea is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Its exports include military goods, a situation that frightens everyone. If the North Koreans could evolve their economy as China and the Asian Tigers did, we could see a renaissance. The Asian Tigers and China started out as low-cost manufacturers and evolved up the food chain. In so doing, they stopped being low-cost producers and had to move their manufacturing to lower-cost areas. What a great opportunity to develop North Korea into the next low-cost market. In so doing we would move it toward the world economy. When the Marshall Plan was first proposed in the late 1940s, there was fierce objection. There will be such objection to this plan, too, but we should not let that deter us from making a wise choice. BILL BEECHER, APTOS, CALIF. "
835,"FRANKFURT — Political instability in a heavily indebted eurozone country. The prospect of a trade war with the United States. Stock market turmoil. None of it fazed the European Central Bank, which took another small step back from crisis mode on Thursday. The bank’s policymakers, who set monetary policy for the 19-nation euro area, held interest rates steady, but dropped language from their communiqué in which they had promised to ramp up economic stimulus measures again “if the outlook becomes less favorable.” It was a subtle but important change. By omitting the phrase, which it has repeated since December 2016, the central bank was in effect saying that the eurozone was no longer in imminent danger of going up in flames, and that it was time to begin stowing the fire hoses. The expression of confidence came despite warnings from Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, about trade tensions with the United States. Mr. Draghi, in an obvious reference to President Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, said during a news conference that it was “dangerous” for countries to change the terms of trade unilaterally, rather than through negotiations. "
836,"The prevailing wisdom suggests that there will be a Democratic wave election in 2018. In a manner that suggests that little was learned from the 2016 primary or general elections, pundits and analysts seem so committed to this narrative that they promote it even when the data point in the other direction. The primaries in Texas on Tuesday are a good case in point. Early-voting numbers suggested good news for the Democrats: 465,245 voters took part in early voting for their primary, as compared to 420,329 for the Republicans’. This is a big gain for Democrats over their totals in the previous midterm year, 2014, when their early-voting turnout was 226,730. However, contrary to the scaremongering letter that the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, sent predicting decreased Republican turnout in early voting this year, his party actually had an increase in participation, up 15 percent from 2014. In short, both parties were highly motivated in early voting. This picture was confirmed at the ballot box. Democrats had near-record turnout, with more than one million voters over all taking part in their primaries. Sounds impressive, right? But Republicans had actual record-breaking turnout, exceeding their previous midterm high-water mark, which was set in 2010. All told, with more than 1.5 million votes cast, Republicans had nearly 50 percent more voters take part in their primary than the Democrats in theirs. There does not seem to be an enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans. If the Democrats’ numbers seem impressive in 2018, this is because their previous benchmarks in the state have been relatively low. In fact, despite longstanding expectations of Texas becoming a so-called purple state, Democrats have not won a statewide office there since 1994. This is the longest losing streak for either party in any state. Primary turnout is not dispositive in any case. In 2002, when Democrats set their record for midterm primary turnout, they failed to flip a single congressional seat in the general election. As for the specific seats Democrats hope to capture in November, it appears that Republicans would retain control if the races were decided on the basis of Tuesday’s primary vote. Democrats have a lot of work to do to catch up. But just as important, if not more so, there were marked differences between the parties in terms of the tone of their primaries. On the Democratic side, there was bitter internal strife, dating back to the previous election cycle, between the “establishment” Democrats and the populist “Berniecrats.” Many of the latter are not committed partisans: While they are highly motivated to support populists, many refuse to lend their support to more conventional Democratic candidates. As we saw in 2016, many former Sanders supporters sat out the general election, voted for a third-party candidate or voted for Donald Trump. Democrats should be concerned about their ability to mobilize populists in the races “establishment” figures won. So the party could find itself facing another enthusiasm deficit for many key races, even with Mr. Trump in the White House. On the Republican side, there was clear unity behind the president and his party. The races were mostly about which candidate was most supportive of President Trump. As a result, it seems likely that Republican voters will support whoever is on their ticket in the general election. We can count on Republican primary voters to turn out in November as well. Republicans reliably vote in midterms, and again it is important to note that primary patterns suggest that enthusiasm is particularly high in the Republican base this year, too. Republicans are motivated, in part, to act as a bulwark against any “blue wave” that might be coming their way. Following Mr. Abbott’s lead, candidates like Senator Ted Cruz have been doing their best to reinforce expectations of a possible Democratic surge in order to get his voters fired up: “We know that the left is going to show up,” Mr. Cruz said on Tuesday. “The extreme left, they’re angry. They’re filled with rage. They hate the president.” The Republicans’ record primary turnout suggests this is an effective mobilization strategy. In contrast, for the Democrats, raising expectations of a wave could be dangerous. Democratic constituents are generally disinclined to vote in midterms in the first place. To the extent that they are not particularly excited about the candidate their party fielded and believe that Democrats will most likely make major gains with or without them, it becomes more likely that a significant number will stay home on Election Day. In other words, not only can the blue wave narrative distract us from what is happening on the ground, it can also help drive Republican enthusiasm and undermine Democratic turnout — not quite the double whammy Democratic strategists are looking for.

.C. Grayling, one of Britain’s most prolific public intellectuals, had just finished cradling a baby kangaroo in the green room, George Megalogenis had Australian economic data at the ready and I was drinking my flat white just as fast as I could.

I also noted the declining percentage of people who say “it is essential” to live in a democracy, with the sharpest drop-off among the young. Over all last year, I said, 71 countries suffered declines in political rights and civil liberties while 35 registered gains, according to Freedom House’s annual index. It was 12th year in a row of losses outpacing gains. "
839,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said on Wednesday that American troops in Niger had been authorized to receive imminent-danger pay the day before the commander who oversees military missions in Africa told House lawmakers that the White House had still not approved that request. A Pentagon spokeswoman said that the decision to include Niger in the list of combat zones where troops receive extra pay was made on Monday — and had not been communicated to Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser before his testimony the day after. “I don’t believe the approval was processed quickly enough to make it before Gen. Waldhauser’s hearing,” a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, Maj. Sheryll I. Klinkel, said in an email. On Tuesday, during two hours of testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, General Waldhauser said the request for danger pay for forces deployed to Niger was submitted “a while back.” He said the final decision was waiting for approval from the White House Office of Management and Budget. A lawmaker on the House panel, Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, noted during the hearing that American troops stationed in Algeria, Chad, Egypt and Kenya already received such pay. The issue of pay was one of the few matters that General Waldhauser would discuss when asked about Niger. He declined to answer questions about a monthslong investigation into an Oct. 4 ambush near the Niger-Mali border that killed four American soldiers and five Nigeriens. Though the investigation is complete, it still requires the approval of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and its results will be shared with the families of the killed soldiers. General Waldhauser said that Congress would be briefed on the investigation’s findings once those notifications were complete. Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright and Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson were killed during an hourslong gunfight near the small Nigerien village of Tongo Tongo. The body of the fourth soldier, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, was found by villagers two days later. "
840,"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders, turning away from significant gun control legislation, have shifted instead toward measures that would beef up security at the nation’s schools, hoping the push will quell public uproar over the recent massacre in Parkland, Fla. But as students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School continue their own organizing, the school safety strategy is unlikely to end the debate. Democrats and gun control advocates accused Republicans and the National Rifle Association of using school safety to divert attention from what they see as the real issue: the proliferation of guns that have been used in mass shootings at concerts, in movie theaters, on college campuses, in churches and at workplaces, as well as at public schools. “This time, the gun rights crowd messed with the wrong community, the wrong kids and the wrong dad,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed at the school. He added, “I intend to be a part of breaking this gun lobby.” The Republican-controlled House plans to vote next week on the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence. The bill, drafted by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican and former sheriff from Jacksonville, Fla., is one of a flurry of bipartisan measures introduced in the House and the Senate devoted to school safety — without curbs on guns. In the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof doors. And Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate education committee, introduced his own school safety measure on Wednesday. His bill would allow 100,000 public schools to use federal dollars for school counselors, alarm systems, security cameras and crisis intervention training. "
841,"WASHINGTON — President Trump once said “I alone can fix it.” Looks like he may have to. No one else seems to be sticking around. The record-high turnover at the White House has now reached 43 percent with the pending departure of Gary D. Cohn, the national economic adviser, as the team that arrived with Mr. Trump 13 months ago heads for the doors in increasing numbers and the president increasingly relies on his own judgment for key decisions. The head-spinning pace of departures has contributed to the sense of disarray in the West Wing, but it reflects the way Mr. Trump has operated since he announced that he was running for president. He constantly searches for new voices, but burns through staff as he quickly loses faith in the people around him, leaving him with a dearth of advisers on whom he genuinely depends. In effect, it can feel like a presidency of one. Mr. Trump said this week that this did not lead to chaos but to a healthy refreshing of his team, adding that a reasonable amount of conflict helped him make better decisions. But Washington veterans see a dysfunctional operation in which a president becomes trapped in an insular bubble and too dependent on his own instincts and assessments, however informed they may or may not be. “The truth is that no one has a good gut,” said James K. Glassman, who served as a senior State Department official under President George W. Bush and then founded Mr. Bush’s public policy institute after leaving office. “Everyone needs a foundation of values and beliefs and then good advice to test them against.” Mr. Glassman said Mr. Trump seemed to have concluded that his predecessors made mistakes by listening to bad advice. “Trump looks at Bush and Obama and thinks, ‘Those guys made some lousy decisions — Iraq, Iran, health care — so why should I do it their way? I was right during the election campaign by relying on my instinct. I’ll do the same in office.’” "
842,"As the Trump administration begins to gut federal enforcement of civil rights laws, minority communities that were targets for predatory home loans before the recession have become vulnerable yet again to mortgage discrimination. This time, many banks are simply writing off communities of color and denying them loans at all. An alarming new study by the Center for Investigative Reporting’s online publication Reveal found that African-Americans and Latinos were far more likely to be denied conventional mortgages than whites even when income, loan size and other factors were taken into account. The study examined 31 million mortgage records and found disturbing evidence in 61 metropolitan areas, including Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Antonio. African-Americans faced their worst obstacles in the South — Mobile, Ala.; Greenville, N.C.; and Gainesville, Fla. — and Latinos in Iowa City. Black applicants were disproportionately turned away, as compared to whites, in 48 metropolitan areas, Latinos in 25, Asian-Americans in nine and Native Americans in three areas. In Washington, D.C., the study found that all four groups were far more likely to be denied home loans than were whites. In Philadelphia, whites received 10 times as many conventional mortgage loans as African-Americans during 2015 and 2016, even though the two groups reside in the city in roughly equal numbers. Banks have subverted the purpose of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which was supposed to get them to lend and invest more, and open more branches, in low- and moderate-income areas. This was to correct decades of damage the federal government caused by encouraging lenders to ignore black areas until the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968. The Reveal study found that affordable mortgages issued in historically black neighborhoods to comply with the reinvestment act were going to white newcomers instead of longtime black residents. This has accelerated a pattern of gentrification that forces out black residents. These problems are rampant throughout the United States. Three years ago, for example, a striking study commissioned by the city of Richmond, Va., found that black applicants were less likely to receive home purchase loans or refinance loans regardless of their incomes. Upper-income black people were even more likely to be denied loans, as compared to similarly situated whites, than lower income black people were to their white counterparts. This underscored yet again that African-Americans cannot escape economic discrimination simply by becoming wealthier, especially when financial institutions persist in punishing them for living in majority minority neighborhoods. A destructive bill pending in the Senate would deepen this problem by exempting 85 percent of banks from reporting mortgage data that allows regulators and fair housing groups to ensure that home loans are being issued in a nondiscriminatory way. By denying African-American families mortgage credit, the financial industry also denies them the opportunity to accumulate household wealth — part of the reason that white median family net worth is nearly 10 times that of black families. Beyond that, the decision to withhold credit from minority neighborhoods has turned too many of them into hollowed-out areas with high poverty, failing schools, lower property values and a markedly worse quality of life. Not long ago, fair housing groups that uncovered particularly egregious lending discrimination by banks and mortgage companies could count on federal regulators to curb, at least, the worst forms of predation. But with the federal government rolling back enforcement, state attorneys general will need to band together the way they did to fight off predatory for-profit schools that saddled students with crushing debt for useless degrees. Banks often claim that they deny mortgages in minority communities based on credit scores — but that claim is almost impossible to check, given that the credit scores are not publicly available. Beyond that, the credit scores used in the mortgage process work against minority applicants by not taking into account data on how reliably they pay rent, utility and cellphone bills. A bill pending in the Senate would open the door for the mortgage industry to use an alternative credit-scoring system, which would be one step in the right direction. "
843,"What do you see when you look in the mirror? My grandmother loved to ask me that question. She was, by any measure, an entertaining woman; one of her standard party tricks was asking me, at the height of an evening’s hilarity, if she had “ever told the story of the night your father was conceived.” Which, of course, she had. I would recount the details for you now, in fact, except that even in the age of Trump, there are some stories that cannot be told in print. But she had a serious side as well. I remember her standing me on top of a stool before the bathroom mirror when I was 10 or so, and asking me, “What do you see?” And before I could even reply with the obvious, “Myself,” she’d cut me off with a firm declaration — “That’s not you!” “It’s not?” I asked, and she pointed to herself. “And that’s not me!” Then she pointed to her heart. “The real you is in here!” she said. And then, as if I had somehow missed her meaning, she said, “In your bosom!” I thought about this story a couple of months ago as I was driving back from Rochester after spending a night at the university there, observing my son Sean’s improv troupe. As I pulled over on the Massachusetts Turnpike to take five at a rest stop, I noticed a woman at the Burger King counter wearing a lovely formal dress, her hair meticulously styled; she wore heels and a pair of stockings with seams running up the back. In one hand she carried a long white cane. Because she was blind. As I looked at her, I thought what in retrospect is something I’m ashamed of: If I were blind, I wouldn’t be wearing all that crap. I didn’t even have time to tell myself that what I was thinking was wrongheaded before the woman raised her cellphone and, to complete my astonishment, took a selfie. As I watched her, I wondered about that question again: Who is it we see when we look in the mirror? And when we share selfies — and I post photos of myself all day long, I admit — what version of ourselves is it we are sharing? In the stranger’s case, a selfie represented, more than anything else, a work of the imagination. Two weeks ago I took part in a meditation practice pioneered by a colleague at Barnard, Tara Well, called “mirror meditation,” which is pretty much what it sounds like: You sit before a mirror with your face (and body) at rest, with the deceptively simple goal of “being in the present moment with open awareness and having a kind intention toward yourself.” When I first embarked on this practice I feared it would be too — well, I believe the technical term is “woo-woo.” But it was a revelation. There before me was my 59-year-old face: a vertical line on my forehead, marionette lines around my mouth, small creases lining my lips. At first I thought, ugh: This is not the face of a young person. But then, as the session continued, I thought — well, it’s not a young face, but it’s mine. The lines on my forehead are a result, in part, of contemplation; the ones around my eyes are from laughter; the ones around my mouth from my incessant habit of whistling. All those lines have made me myself, and mostly, as I looked at them, I felt grateful for all the years that have left their marks upon my face. “You’re lucky — that’s not the response most women have,” Dr. Well told me later. “We typically use the mirror to take an observer’s perspective (what psychologists call self-objectification). We focus on how we look and often disregard how we feel.” Her words put me in mind of that blind woman I saw at the rest stop. There she was, in her dark, stylish world, eating her Whopper Jr. Who was it she imagined she had photographed when she raised her camera in the air? My grandmother’s voice haunts me still: “That’s not you! And that’s not me!” I got home after my long drive that night and crawled into bed. I thought about my son Sean and the world that awaits him when he graduates this spring. I thought about the person I had been when I was his age and the person I have since become, these many decades later. What did I see when I turned out the light? I can’t tell you, but I know it’s mine. "

This week is the anniversary of the birth of Gabriel García Márquez, the Nobel Prize-winning Colombian novelist affectionately known in Latin America as Gabo. Born on March 6, 1927, García Márquez was known for the writing genre magical realism, but his escapades in real life were just as noteworthy. He started his career as a journalist, at one point enraging the Colombian dictator Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla so much that García Márquez fled to Europe for two years. He became such close friends with Fidel Castro that he would show the Cuban leader drafts of his unpublished books. At one point, he vowed not to write as long as the Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet remained in power (a promise broken long before Pinochet’s 17-year reign ended). And after long being denied a visa to the U.S., García Márquez traveled there in 1995 at the invitation of President Bill Clinton. Before García Márquez died in 2014, a friend said the title of the author’s memoir summed up his life. “All his motivation is contained in that title, ‘To Live to Tell It’ — it is the pleasure of telling the story,” he said. Anna Schaverien contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning. Browse past briefings here.

845,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued California this week for not doing enough to find and punish unauthorized immigrants, and said on Wednesday he was girding for an epic battle. “California is using every power it has — and some it doesn’t — to frustrate federal law enforcement,” he said in a speech in Sacramento. “So you can be sure I’m going to use every power I have to stop them.” One of the weapons Mr. Sessions is counting on is a 2012 Supreme Court ruling siding with the Obama administration, which had sued Arizona for violating federal immigration laws. But in that case Mr. Obama’s lawyers accused the state of going too far in trying to find and punish unauthorized immigrants. “The state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority. So it may turn out that the principle of federal supremacy over immigration established by the Obama administration will help the Trump Justice Department achieve diametrically different goals. “The tables are turned,” said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University. The California case seems likely to reach the Supreme Court, where it could give rise to a landmark reckoning on the role of states in setting immigration policy. In the process, state and federal officials, along with judges and justices, will face a test of their commitment to consistency. "
846,"WASHINGTON — The day after the Texas primary, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, jumped into his general re-election campaign on Wednesday with a quick strike trying to paint his Democratic opponent, Representative Beto O’Rourke, as a Latino-come-lately. But Mr. O’Rourke, whose family has lived on the Mexican border in El Paso for four generations, hit back with a secret weapon — a picture of him as a preschooler with the name “Beto” stitched onto his sweater. At issue is that most intangible of political assets, authenticity, or perhaps a Shakespearean question, “What’s in a name?” Mr. Cruz, taking a page from President Trump’s playbook of stamping damaging labels on his opponents, seemed to be trying to undermine the authenticity of Mr. O’Rourke, whose birth name is Robert Francis, but who has been known since childhood as “Beto.” A quick radio and online jingle, released on Wednesday, drawled, “Liberal Robert wanted to fit in, so he changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin.” It is the kind of skewer that worked for Mr. Trump, including against the Texas senator, whom he called “Lyin’ Ted.” With a quick photo response that leaned more cute than cutting, Mr. O’Rourke may be able to defuse any lasting effect of Mr. Cruz’s approach. Mr. O’Rourke owned up that he tried to go by Robert as a student at Columbia University, but when his friends found out that he was known as Beto, that name stuck. “I am really happy with whatever anyone calls me,” Mr. O’Rourke said in an interview. He said Texas voters were far more interested in discussing jobs, health care and immigration. “They want us to take on these really urgent priorities,” he said, “not just this smallness and pettiness that dominates the national conversation today.” But as Mr. Trump showed, derisive nicknames can plant doubt, as it did in the case of “Crooked” Hillary Clinton, and “Little Marco” Rubio during the campaign, and with “Low Energy” Jeb Bush, “Liddle Bob Corker” and “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer,” among others, as president. Of course Mr. Cruz comes to this game with his own label liability: He was born Rafael Edward Cruz, but goes by “Ted.” “Cruz lacks Trump’s visceral instincts,” said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist. “Plus, I suspect voters are getting tired of Trump’s schtick from Trump; they’re unlikely to want a pale imitation.” So if Mr. O’Rourke is going for a Latin sound to appeal to one segment of Texas voters, Mr. Cruz could be accused of veering Anglo-Saxon to appeal to another. That Mr. Cruz would move so quickly to try to skewer his opponent is a measure of how seriously he is taking the challenge from Mr. O’Rourke, even though no Democrat has won a statewide office since 1994. “If you’re gonna run in Texas, you can’t run as a liberal man,” his jingle intoned. Mr. Cruz told “New Day” on CNN: “In terms of the jingle, some of it is just having a sense of humor. We had some fun with it.” As for his own use of Ted rather than Rafael, Mr. Cruz said, “You’re absolutely right. My name is Rafael Edward Cruz. I am the son of my father Rafael Cruz, an immigrant from Cuba who came to Texas with nothing.” Mr. O’Rourke has been raising more money than Mr. Cruz in recent quarters and has tried to awaken a dormant Democratic vote in rural parts of Texas by relentlessly holding town hall-style meetings. But Mr. Cruz, known as a skilled tactician and debater, is still the clear favorite in the race. "
847,"President Trump’s lawyer secretly obtained a temporary restraining order last week to prevent a pornographic film star from speaking out about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, according to legal documents and interviews. (Read the restraining order.) The order, issued by an arbitrator in California and reviewed by The New York Times, pertained to the actress Stephanie Clifford, who had been paid $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election in what she calls a “hush agreement.” In recent weeks, she had prepared to speak publicly about Mr. Trump, claiming his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, had broken the agreement. The details of the order emerged on Wednesday after the White House’s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that Mr. Trump’s lawyer had won an arbitration proceeding against Ms. Clifford, who goes by the name of Stormy Daniels. Ms. Sanders’s statement put the White House in the middle of a story that Mr. Trump and his lawyer had been trying to keep quiet for well over a year. The turn of events created the spectacle of a sitting president using legal maneuvers to avoid further scrutiny of salacious accusations of an affair and a payoff involving the porn star. Although Ms. Clifford said their relationship was consensual, the issue is particularly sensitive to Mr. Trump, whose campaign was dogged by allegations of groping and his boast of grabbing women’s crotches. Ms. Clifford filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday asserting that the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment was void because Mr. Trump never signed it. "
848,"WASHINGTON — The special counsel in the Russia investigation has learned of two conversations in recent months in which President Trump asked key witnesses about matters they discussed with investigators, according to three people familiar with the encounters. In one episode, the president told an aide that the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, should issue a statement denying a New York Times article in January. The article said Mr. McGahn told investigators that the president once asked him to fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. McGahn never released a statement and later had to remind the president that he had indeed asked Mr. McGahn to see that Mr. Mueller was dismissed, the people said. In the other episode, Mr. Trump asked his former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, how his interview had gone with the special counsel’s investigators and whether they had been “nice,” according to two people familiar with the discussion. The episodes demonstrate that even as the special counsel investigation appears to be intensifying, the president has ignored his lawyers’ advice to avoid doing anything publicly or privately that could create the appearance of interfering with it. The White House did not respond to several requests for comment. Mr. Priebus and Mr. McGahn declined to comment through their lawyer, William A. Burck. "
849,"The United States has moved to allow hunters to import big-game trophies, including elephant tusks and lion hides, acquired in certain African countries with approvals granted on an individual basis. The decision, reported in a memorandum published last week by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, overturns an Obama-era ban on some trophies and contradicts public statements by President Trump, who had endorsed the restrictions. In November, agency officials moved to lift the ban on elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. The new policy supersedes and broadens that decision, officials said. Traditionally, the agency has considered imports of trophies from certain endangered species on a nation-by-nation basis. The Endangered Species Act stipulates that in order for such trophies to be approved, exporting countries must demonstrate that hunting enhances survival of a particular species in the wild — by reinvesting the money into conservation, for example, and by supporting local communities. In December, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that officials had implemented the Obama-era bans without following regulatory procedures, including a failure to open up the decision to public comment. To accommodate that court decision, officials said the Fish and Wildlife Service will change how it evaluates imports for certain endangered species across Africa — not just elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, the subject of the circuit court ruling. Rather than evaluate lion, elephant and bontebok (a type of antelope) trophies on a nation-by-nation basis, the agency now will consider imports of these animals from six African countries on case-by-case basis, as it already does with the majority of species hunted on the continent. The six countries are Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. The new policy does not mean that all trophies will be automatically permitted, officials said. The applicants will have to meet the same conservation and sustainability requirements as before. The decision was long sought by Safari Club International and the National Rifle Association, which had filed the lawsuit against the agency. “We were surprised as anyone when they came out with that announcement last week, but we think it’s a positive step,” said Richard Parsons, chief executive of Safari Club International. “As much as some people have a distaste for hunting, in southern Africa it actually works and is very positive for wildlife conservation.” Whether safari hunting ultimately helps or harms fragile animal populations is a controversial question. Hunting organizations point out that big-game sportsmen — who may pay $100,000 or more per hunt to shoot a lion or elephant — can provide indispensable funding for conservation. “I’ve been in this business a long time and listened to a lot of animal-rights organizations that talk loudly about how they’re going to save rhinos and elephants, but we’re the ones putting money on the ground to make it happen,” Mr. Parsons said. “We think the Fish and Wildlife Service is on the right track to make solid decisions for elephant conservation.” But conservation groups argue that alternatives should be pursued, especially when the quarry are endangered species. “These are animals that our country has decided we’re going to protect, and we should all get to have a say in their protection,” said Elly Pepper, deputy director of the wildlife trade initiative at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The decision regarding whether someone’s allowed to shoot an endangered species shouldn’t be made behind closed doors.” The agency previously made determinations about trophies publicly available, she said, but under the new system interested parties will have to file a Freedom of Information request to see details of case-by-case trophy hunting permits. Each request can take months to process. Others share Ms. Pepper’s concerns. “These decisions are all going to be made in the dark, and this new case-by-case approach doesn’t give anyone comfort that these animals will be protected in the way the previous system did,” said Kitty Block, acting president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States. “We think this is a one-sided attempt to appease a constituency that favors hunting.” Ms. Block noted that the latest decision marks departure from President Trump’s public comments about big-game trophy hunting. Following the November announcement that the United States would begin accepting elephant trophy imports from Zimbabwe and Zambia, Mr. Trump tweeted that he planned to reverse that decision and that he would be “very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of elephants or any other animal.” “Nothing’s changed since then,” Ms. Block said. “The elephant populations haven’t come back, there hasn’t been a slowdown in poaching or corruption — all these issues remain.” While the agency’s new criteria are effective immediately, the circuit court must now determine whether or not the case-by-case approach is an acceptable solution. This means the decision to allow certain trophy imports “isn’t a done deal,” Ms. Pepper said. “When the ban was first lifted last year, the public expressed a lot of anguish, and it seemed to work for reversing that decision.” Regardless of the final decision, Jan Stander, director of Phundundu Wildlife Park in Zimbabwe, said the lifting of the trophy bans is “too little, too late.” “Zimbabwe’s lost around half a million hectares of wildlife land since the trophy ban in 2014,” he said. “It’s all gone over to cattle and agriculture.” Mr. Stander and his colleagues had relied on fees paid by American hunters to run their anti-poaching units, maintain roads and support communities living around the reserve. But following President Obama’s trophy ban, Mr. Stander had to drop his prices for lion hunts from $130,000 to $25,000. Elephant hunts, which he once marketed for $80,000, “I couldn’t even give away,” he said. In the year following the ban, Mr. Stander said he lost $500,000 and was forced to close the nearly 80,000-acre reserve for lack of business. Populations of elephant, buffalo, lion and leopard have since dwindled as poachers have moved in. “I should have left three years ago, but this is an area that’s close to my heart,” he said. Ecotourists, he added, will not save the day. They disappeared years ago, scared away by the country’s political turmoil. “The only reason there’s still wildlife here in Zimbabwe today is because of hunting and the amount of money it brings in,” he said. “I’m on the conservation side, but I was using the hunters and trophy fees to keep the conservation going.” “Commercially, we’re dead,” he added. "
850,      
851,"MEXICO CITY — Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, met with Mexico’s president on Wednesday, arriving just weeks after a planned meeting between the nations’ leaders fell apart because of a bitter phone dispute over Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall. Mr. Kushner’s meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto was meant to soothe tensions. Plans for the two presidents to meet have been abruptly canceled at least twice since Mr. Trump took office, and the relationship between their countries is suffering its roughest patch in decades. But the encounter between Mexico’s president and Mr. Kushner, a political newcomer whose top-secret security clearance was stripped last month, underscored the profound shift in approach that the Trump administration has taken with Mexico, and with the region more broadly. Officials announced the visit less than a day before it happened, offering no guidance on what would be discussed. Beyond that, Mr. Kushner, who also met with Mexico’s foreign minister, did not invite the American ambassador — Roberta S. Jacobson, a diplomat with more than 30 years of experience in the region — to join him in the meetings, according to a senior American official who was not authorized to speak publicly. “This is not the way foreign policy normally is, or should be, conducted,” said Christopher Sabatini, a lecturer at Columbia University. “The sending of the president’s son-in-law — someone with no experience in Mexican-U.S. relations — is another example of the de-professionalization and personalization of diplomacy that will hurt U.S. interests and leverage in the region.” "
852,"Next week’s special congressional election in southwestern Pennsylvania will test whether, deep in Trump country, union support can help elect a Democrat running on a middle-class economic agenda. A victory would remind Democrats of the electoral power of organized labor. Even though it has relied on unions’ electoral muscle for nearly a century, the party has often failed to shore up labor’s diminishing strength. Our research demonstrates what an enormous electoral mistake that has been. Political analysts have long argued that dwindling union power would be bad for Democrats. The conservative strategist Grover Norquist, for instance, has speculated that the decline of labor in recent years could mean that Republicans (and President Trump) may continue to win big despite Mr. Trump’s unpopularity. But there were not reliable estimates of the size of that effect on elections. We have quantified the electoral effects of one kind of anti-union law, commonly called “right to work” legislation. Those bills allow workers to opt out of paying fees to a union at their workplace — even if those workers benefit from union bargaining and protections. The results are ugly for Democrats and for the working class. We looked at how right-to-work laws shaped elections from 1980 through 2016. We compared pairs of counties, one in a state that passed a right-to-work law and the other just across the border in a state that didn’t. Even if right-to-work and non-right-to-work states are quite different, bordering counties in many states tend to have similar economic, demographic and political trends. Our approach, which isolates the changes that show up only when right-to-work laws are passed, holds up even when we account for other state-level legislation passed at the same time as right-to-work bills, including voter ID laws and other common pieces of conservative legislation. "
853,"What does it mean to be an American? It is a question many people are grappling with, especially in the wake of the 2016 election. And it is one of the reasons the New-York Historical Society’s coming exhibition, “Enduring Ideals: Rockwell, Roosevelt & the Four Freedoms,” is so powerful. “We planned this before Trump got elected, but it’s taken on a different resonance since,” said Margaret K. Hofer, the museum director. The traveling exhibition, organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., hearkens back to Jan. 6, 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt articulated the Four Freedoms — freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from fear and freedom from want — in his annual address. “We had a president who showed leadership by outlining four simple answers to the question of, what does it mean to be an American?” said Louise Mirrer, the historical society’s president and chief executive. “America was a great democracy. It needed to project its democratic principles wherever they were being snuffed out around the world.” The United States declared war on Japan 11 months after Roosevelt’s speech, but the nation did not rally behind the war.

855,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump is set to sign sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports this afternoon, under a legal provision that allows him to take actions to defend national security. More than 100 Republican lawmakers urged the president to drop the plan, which would initially exempt Canada, the largest source of steel and aluminum for the U.S., and Mexico. Washington is linking the exemptions to renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The proposal has raised fears of retaliation. “Choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,” China’s foreign minister said today. (Our senior economics correspondent calls it more of a “skirmish.”) • Gary Cohn, the top economic adviser who just resigned, was a vocal opponent of the protections. The exodus of White House advisers is increasingly leaving the president to follow his instincts, our correspondents write. • Ignoring his lawyers’ advice, President Trump asked key witnesses in the Russia inquiry what they had discussed with investigators, according to people familiar with the encounters. Legal experts said the contacts, with Donald McGahn, the White House counsel, and with Reince Priebus, his former chief of staff, most likely did not amount to witness tampering. The White House didn’t respond to several requests for comment. • Separately, President Trump’s lawyer secretly obtained a temporary restraining order last week to prevent Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film star known as Stormy Daniels, from speaking about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump. • Three weeks after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., most gun safety proposals appear to be going nowhere on Capitol Hill. Republican leaders are shifting instead toward measures to increase security at American schools. Democrats and advocates of gun control accuse Republicans of diverting attention from the proliferation of weapons. • In Florida, however, the House defied the National Rifle Association on Wednesday, passing a $400 million gun control and school safety bill that’s on its way to the governor.

856,"KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. — Each spring and fall in the old days, Chinook salmon swam up the Klamath River, crossing the Cascade Mountains, to Upper Klamath Lake, 4,000 feet above sea level. For millenniums, the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians fished salmon from the lake and the river. The Klamath had agreements with the downriver tribes — the Karuk, Hoopa and Yurok among them — to let fish pass so that some could swim all the way back to their spawning grounds. After dams were built on the river starting in 1912, the salmon were blocked. Today the only “c’iyaals hoches” (salmon runs) are enacted by the Klamath Tribes, whose members carry carved cedar salmon on a 300-mile symbolic journey from the ocean to the traditional spawning grounds to bring home the spirit of the fish. The Klamath River’s dams are scheduled to be demolished by 2020, in what will be one of the largest river restorations in American history. But there’s a threat to the dream of a revitalized river — a project that would put a newly unobstructed Klamath at risk of contamination while simultaneously contributing to climate change, desecrating grave sites and trampling the traditional territory of the Klamath people. If you’ve read anything at all about the protests near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, you might be able to guess what that threat is. It’s a pipeline. The Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline would run 229 miles from Malin to Coos Bay, Ore., crossing underneath the Klamath River near the city of Klamath Falls. It would extend, via interconnections, the Ruby Pipeline, carrying natural gas from Wyoming to a huge planned storage and export terminal for sales to countries in the Pacific Rim. The company behind the pipeline, Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline LP, and the export terminal, Jordan Cove Energy Project LP, are both owned by the Pembina Pipeline Corporation, based in Calgary, Alberta. The companies claim that the pipeline and the terminal will create jobs and produce around $20 million a year in tax revenue in some of the poorest counties in Oregon. And they promise that the 36-inch underground pipe will be barely noticeable — and safe. For the pipeline to proceed, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must decide that it’s in the public interest. The commission has already decided that it isn’t, twice. In March 2016 it denied the project’s application, and in December of that year, it turned down a request for a rehearing. The commission said that the companies had failed to demonstrate that the benefits outweighed the project’s negative impacts. Now the companies are trying again, though the commission said they had failed to show there was market demand for the project. "
857,"Early Tuesday morning, Donald Trump tweeted: “The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!” Lies. Of course the White House is in chaos. It’s just that Trump has lived his whole life in a state of chaos, so it feels perfectly normal to him. The only energy around Trump is a vortex of complicity and incompetence. Furthermore, it should be clear to us all at this point that Trump’s public relations approach to dealing with unfavorable news is simply to rush to the nearest microphone — or log into Twitter — and say that the exact opposite is true, even when his statement is an easily provable lie. Being right is never the point; retaliation is the point. Later in the day, during a news conference with the prime minister of Sweden, Trump continued on this point, saying: “The White House has tremendous energy. It has tremendous spirit. It is a great place to be working. Many, many people want every single job. You know, I read where, oh gee, maybe people don’t want to work for Trump, and believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office. They want a piece of the West Wing. And not only in terms of it looks great on their résumé; it’s just a great place to work. It’s got tremendous energy.” Then Trump lurches into emperor mode, discussing how much he enjoys the gladiator-style blood sport of the administration he has: “It’s tough. I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view, and I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it, I like seeing it and I think it’s the best way to go.” Trump ended by boasting that “I have a choice of anybody.” He continued, “I could take any position in the White House, and I’ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position. Everybody wants to be there.” "
858,"The health insurance giant Cigna said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, in a $52 billion deal that could further reshape the roiling health care landscape. The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidations that is sweeping through the health care industry. Companies are reacting to concerns over rising health care costs and the possibility of powerful new rivals entering the fray. In particular, Amazon’s move into the health care business has forced established companies to rethink how they can compete. Cigna and Express Scripts said the acquisition would benefit consumers by allowing the two companies to bring together patients’ medical and pharmacy histories to improve treatments and lower costs. “This step furthers our strategy to improve the affordability and value to the consumer in a more personalized way,” said Cigna’s chief executive, David Cordani, who will serve as chief executive for the combined company. The completion of the deal would mark the end of Express Scripts as the last major independent pharmacy benefit manager, one that has focused on striking deals with drug companies to lower costs for insurers and employers. The company is responsible for the prescription plans of more than 80 million Americans. “This is the future of the stand-alone” pharmacy benefit manager, said Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, who would serve as president of the Express Scripts business under the deal. The two companies said that they would continue to offer pharmacy services to other insurers and to employers that do not use Cigna. "
859,"SANTIAGO, Chile — A trade pact originally conceived by the United States to counter China’s growing economic might in Asia now has a new target: President Trump’s embrace of protectionism. A group of 11 nations — including major United States allies like Japan, Canada and Australia — signed a broad trade deal on Thursday in Chile’s capital, Santiago, that challenges Mr. Trump’s view of trade as a zero-sum game filled with winners and losers. Covering 500 million people on either side of the Pacific Ocean, the pact represents a new vision for global trade as the United States imposes steel and aluminum tariffs on even some of its closest friends. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from an earlier version of the agreement, then known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a year ago as one of his first acts in office. The resuscitated deal is undeniably weaker without the participation of the world’s biggest economy, but it serves as a powerful sign of how countries that have previously counted on American leadership are now forging ahead without it. “Globally, there has been an increasing level of uncertainty, given the adoption of policies and measures by some key players that question the principles that have contributed to generating prosperity for our peoples,” President Michelle Bachelet of Chile said in a speech shortly before the pact was signed. “We need to stay on the course of globalization, yet learning from our past mistakes.” In its original incarnation as the TPP, the accord was conceived as a counterweight to China, whose vast economy was drawing other Asian countries closer despite its state-driven model and steep trade barriers. Not only does the pact lower trade barriers, it could also prod Beijing to make changes to enjoy the same benefits. When President Obama was advocating the deal, he said that “America should call the shots” instead of China. Now, signatories are opening the door for China to join. Heraldo Muñoz, Chile’s foreign minister, told reporters on Thursday afternoon that Chinese officials had been weighing the possibility of signing on. “This will be open to anyone who accepts its components,” Mr. Muñoz said. “It’s not an agreement against anyone. It’s in favor of open trade.” On Thursday, Mr. Trump went in the opposite direction, announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States. He said that Canada and Mexico were being exempted for now, and that allies like Australia could later be excluded. His order could affect Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Turkey, though he said he would have leeway to add or take countries off the list as he sees fit. The United States has “gone from being a leader to actually being the No. 1 antagonist and No. 1 source of fear” on trade, said Jeffrey Wilson, the head of research at Perth U.S.-Asia Center at the University of Western Australia. “If you’re a trade policy maker in Asia, your No. 1 fear is that Trump is going to take a swing at you.” He added that such fears could prompt countries, however reluctantly, to tether themselves more closely to China. “The U.S. is really delivering the region to China at the moment,” Mr. Wilson said. The new agreement — known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership — drops tariffs drastically and establishes sweeping new trade rules in markets that represent about a seventh of the world’s economy. It opens more markets to free trade in agricultural products and digital services around the region. While American beef faces 38.5 percent tariffs in Japan, for example, beef from Australia, New Zealand and Canada will not. Once it goes into effect, the agreement is expected to generate an additional $147 billion in global income, according to an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Its backers say it also bolsters protections for intellectual property and includes language that could prod members to improve labor conditions. Other members include Mexico, Vietnam, New Zealand, Chile, Malaysia, Peru, Singapore and Brunei. The deal will go into effect as soon as the legislative bodies of at least three signers ratify it. How long that will take is unclear. China, which has discussed forming its own regional trade pact, has been more positive about the new deal since the United States pulled out. It sent a high-level delegation a year ago to Viña del Mar, Chile, where the pact’s members sought to regroup after the United States’ withdrawal. Experts said China could feel the pull if still more countries joined. The pact is also built around fostering trade in sophisticated manufactured goods and high-tech products, and China now produces many of those in abundance. “It’s hard to ignore rules that everyone else is agreeing to, and they will probably look carefully at these rules,” said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and is now managing director of the Washington office of the Asia Society Policy Institute. Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that the government hoped free-trade agreements in the region would play “a constructive role in their respective fields in resisting trade protectionism and building an open world economy.” The new version of the TPP does not pack the same punch as the earlier iteration. With the United States, the agreement would have represented 40 percent of the world’s economy, giving its provisions added heft. Still, the deal could appeal to companies trying to navigate the shifting trade waters. “In a world that is so upside-down, especially for companies, companies will need to seek out growth and stability wherever they can,” said Deborah Elms, founder and executive director of the Asian Trade Center, a consulting firm in Singapore. “And that stability does not appear to be coming from the United States, where policy seems to shift at a moment’s notice.” Japan, which has the largest economy among the remaining trade partners and played a leadership role in keeping the coalition of 11 countries together, is still holding out hopes that the United States might return to the pact, under either Mr. Trump or a subsequent administration. “We think the U.S. should come back, and we’ll say, ‘Please do come back,’ ” said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington. “It may sound a little impertinent, but the U.S. has taken many different positions on the economy or security.” The Trump administration has recently signaled that it is open to re-entering the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In an interview at the World Economic Forum earlier this year, Mr. Trump said, “If we did a substantially better deal, I would be open to TPP.” Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, said he had held discussions about the prospect of rekindling American membership in the pact, though at a congressional hearing in February, he said it was not a priority. Yorizumi Watanabe, a professor of policy management at Keio University in Tokyo, said, “If the U.S. is retreating from this region, either as the pace setter or agenda setter of economic affairs or security affairs, this will be quite detrimental to the stability of this region.” He added: “TPP as such should not be seen as a mere free-trade or economic agreement. This should be seen from a kind of geopolitical point of view.” Heft could come from others. The Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington estimates that if five other places — Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand — joined the partnership, the annual increase to global income would total $449 billion by 2030, almost as much as it would have been if the United States were included. In the deal signed on Thursday, only 22 of more than 600 original provisions have been suspended, relating to intellectual property protection and a grab bag of other issues, several of which had been pushed by the United States. Kazuyoshi Umemoto, Japan’s chief negotiator for the partnership, said that if the United States decided to re-enter the deal, those provisions could be reinstated. “Trump won’t last forever,” said Patricio Navia, a political scientist at New York University. “Countries will return to a path toward globalization and this sends a beacon of hope.” "
860,"“The Leisure Seeker,” the first English-language feature from the Italian director Paolo Virzì, stars Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland as a couple who skip town in a 1975 Winnebago, heading from Wellesley, Mass., to Florida, without giving notice to anyone, including their grown children. Ella (Ms. Mirren) plans to take John (Mr. Sutherland), an expert on Ernest Hemingway, to the Hemingway Home in Key West. John has symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, although that term is never used. And Ella, nursing her pain with a steady stream of whiskey, is clearly dying; the diagnosis will be obvious to viewers long before the film reveals it. “The Leisure Seeker” becomes a defense of their right to live their last days as they see fit — on the road instead of in nursing homes or hospitals. The sentiment is admirable; the execution decidedly is not. Part of the problem is that the screenwriters (four, including Mr. Virzì, share credit, working from a novel by Michael Zadoorian) treat the characters’ symptoms as plot devices — traits they can ignore or play up as each scene demands. (Some other Alzheimer’s films, like “Away From Her,” have done a better job of avoiding this trap.) When it’s time for a twist, John’s mind happens to be in the right year and place to share a secret. Neither ailment interferes with a host of cloying incidents, as when John drives off without Ella, forcing her to take a ride on a motorcycle to catch up. Or when the two experience a flat tire and are held up by a pair of young men. (Ella retrieves the shotgun she’s brought along, scaring them off, and John, who has already scolded one for ending a sentence with a preposition, tells them it’s not too late to take evening classes and turn their lives around.) In a mortifying sprinkling of topicality, the movie — set in summer 2016 — shows John, a lifelong Democratic voter, unwittingly joining in the chants at a rally for Donald Trump. The actors outclass this material by a Massachusetts-to-Florida distance, locating nuances and a sense of tenderness and intimacy. It’s hard to imagine other performers bringing so much to this setup. They give a true impression of two people who have spent their lives together and know how to talk each other. There is a movie to be made about John and Ella; it’s not one that ends with “Me and Bobby McGee” over the credits. "
861,"For American evangelicals, there is a term of praise for President Trump that falls like a question mark on most everyone else: “You are Cyrus.” That’s what the Christian pro-Israel activist Mike Evans promised to tell President Trump after his announcement that the United States would move its embassy to Jerusalem. Mr. Evans, who plastered Jerusalem with billboards praising the embassy decision, isn’t the only one to draw a connection to the ancient Persian king. In a 2016 book called “God’s Chaos Candidate,” the minister Lance Wallnau asked, “Could Trump be God’s Cyrus?” Even some Jews have gotten into the act. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the connection in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee this week, predicting the rise of a new Cyrus. Last week, the Mikdash Educational Center, an Orthodox group, produced a “temple coin” that superimposes an image of Mr. Trump over one of Cyrus. Obscure though it may seem, pro-Israel activists who suggest that Mr. Trump is a counterpart to Cyrus are drawing on a deep well of religious history that nourishes his current evangelical support. For centuries, American Christians have argued that United States foreign policy should follow biblical models. The desire to see America and its leaders as instruments for the fulfillment of divine intentions remains an important cause of their longstanding sympathy for Zionism and the State of Israel. King Cyrus, who is credited with allowing Jews to return to Jerusalem from exile in the Babylonian empire, represents the possibility that a nonbelieving leader and state could be used by God to reunite the chosen people and the promised land. "
862,"Good Thursday.

Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. President Trump has backed trade restrictions for much of his public life, but his tariff orders have some wiggle room. This leeway could come in useful if his administration needs to step back in the face of economic or political pressure. First, the secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs. Second, the order leaves the door open to discussions with allies other than Mexico and Canada, which are currently exempt. It says that a country that has a security relationship with the United States is welcome to discuss ways to allay the United States’ national security concerns. If successful, the president might decide to modify or remove the tariffs. — Peter Eavis The president defied allies both in his own party and overseas Thursday and signed an order imposing sweeping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, reports the NYT’s Peter Baker and Ana Swanson. Still, he sought to soften the impact on some of America’s closest allies. For now, Canada and Mexico are exempt and there is the possibility of later excluding allies such as Australia. But the order could hit South Korea, China, Japan, Germany, Turkey and Brazil. From the NYT: The details • The orders will raise levies on foreign steel by 25 percent and on imported aluminum by 10 percent. • Mr. Trump said the order would give him the authority to raise or lower levies on a country-by-country basis and add or take countries off the list as he deems fit. • The order goes into effect in 15 days. Tariff flyaround • A group of 11 nations — including major United States allies like Japan, Canada and Australia — signed a broad trade deal on Thursday that challenges Mr. Trump’s view of trade as a zero-sum game filled with winners and losers. (NYT) • The chances of a complete breakdown in the global trade system remain remote, if a little less remote than a week ago. (NYT) • The marriage of establishment and populist economic thinking was always an uneasy one. Now President Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs are forcing the Republican party to choose between its core business supporters and populist voters. (WSJ) • The tariffs have caused much concern about President Trump’s trade policy. A probe into Chinese intellectual property policy could prove more devastating. (Breakingviews) When the Federal Reserve and the bond market are at loggerheads, it’s almost as if the economy’s parents are fighting. The kids, stock investors and borrowers in this analogy, just don’t know who to side with. This dynamic appears to explain what happened in early February when inflation fears sent bond prices lower and, in turn, set off panicked selling in the stock market. Now, as the Fed gets ready to raise interest rates several times, differences between the central bank and the bond market could start to matter more. There is no conclusive way to measure the degree of disagreement between the Fed and the bond markets. But that didn’t stop us having a go. One approach is to compare the yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note with Fed policymakers’ forecasts for the central bank’s target rate. Several times a year, the policymakers project where the federal funds target rate will be at different points in the future. In this exercise, we compared the 10-year’s yield with the median forecast made in December for the target rate at the end of the next year. In December of 2014, 2015 and 2016, the 10-year’s yield was around 1 percentage point higher than the forecast. But in December last year, the difference between the two numbers had shrunk markedly. The yield was only 0.26 of a percentage point above the forecast. One interpretation of this narrowing: The bond market was behind in reacting to economic strength. And when it did snap out of its possibly complacent state, it did so sharply. The 10-year yield is now 2.88 percent, up from 2.39 percent before the meeting in Dec. 2017. With that increase, there was a 0.77 percentage point difference between the policymakers forecast and the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Monday. But if the 10-year yield moved up to reestablish a 1-percentage point difference, it would sail past the psychologically important 3 percent mark. The problem, of course, with using Fed policymakers’ forecasts is that the Fed has made them public only for a few years. To get a much longer perspective, we looked back at the actual interest rate that the Fed targets, which is set in the market for the funds that banks must keep on deposit at the Fed. We compared this effective federal funds rate with the 10-year’s yield. On Monday, that spread was 1.46 percentage points. How does that compare? It’s tighter than the median for the past eight years, 1.95 percentage points. The 10-year yield would have moved a lot higher to take the spread back there. But there is a less alarming viewpoint. The current 1.46 percentage point spread is only slightly higher than the median 1.24 percentage points for the 50-plus years we studied. And, perhaps most reassuringly, 1.46 percentage points is very close to the 1.67 percentage point median for June 2003 till the end of 2006, a period in which the Fed raised interest rates repeatedly. — Peter Eavis Cigna finally got a big deal done by buying Express Scripts, one of the U.S.’s largest drug benefits managers, for $69 billion, including debt. The bigger point: as always, health care companies want to get bigger and gain negotiating leverage, while branching out into different businesses. The details: The insurer agreed to pay $48.75 a share in cash and 0.2434 of a newly issued share for each Express Scripts share. That’s about $96.03 as of yesterday’s close, a roughly 30 percent premium to Express Scripts’ closing price. The context: Cigna’s planned sale to Anthem finally collapsed last year, as did Humana’s sale to Aetna, which was then acquired by CVS. Courtesy of our friends at Thomson Reuters: • At $69 billion, Cigna-Express Scripts would be the biggest deal of the year. • It is the 33rd deal valued at more than $5 billion announced this year. That is a record number for any year through March 8. • The value of those 33 transactions is $419 billion, or 53 percent of all acquisitions announced in 2018. • With nearly $800 billion in acquisitions announced globally this year, deal making is off to its best start since 2000. Protesters plan to gather at the payment processor’s headquarters in Foster City, Calif., at 11 a.m. P.T. today to demand that such companies stop doing business with sellers of assault-style rifles.

More from Sapna Maheshwari of the NYT: Critics, including women who work with agencies, say it’s trial by social media. Elsewhere in misconduct: Two directors at Wynn Resorts said they would step down in the wake of the Steve Wynn scandal. And the head of the U.S. Forest Service resigned amid sexual harassment accusations. His day job is head of Vista Equity Partners, one of the top-performing private equity firms. But Mr. Smith is also the wealthiest African-American around, with an extensive record of philanthropy, a topic that he spoke about to Forbes for its annual billionaires issue. From a statement he had prepared for his signing of the Giving Pledge: The top 5 billionaires in this year’s list and their estimated net worth: • Jeff Bezos, $112 billion • Bill Gates, $90 billion • Warren Buffett, $84 billion • Bernard Arnault, $72 billion • Mark Zuckerberg, $71 billion Watch the billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones sing backup on his daughter Caroline’s song “The Difference.” (He really hits the “ooh-wee.”) • The E.C.B. was expected to take a step away from crisis mode, but then Italy had an election.

864,"WASHINGTON — Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said Thursday that doctors and hospitals should tell patients how much their care would cost before patients received treatment. And if they do not do so voluntarily, he said, the government may use its leverage to force them to disclose the information. Mr. Azar, speaking to a conference of health insurance executives, said that such information would give patients more control over their health care. And that, he said, would advance one of the Trump administration’s top priorities: “the value-based transformation of our entire health care system.” “You ought to have the right to know what a health care service will cost — and what it will really cost — before you get that service,” Mr. Azar said. His speech — and similar remarks this week by other federal health officials — amounts to an experiment in jawboning by an administration viscerally opposed to new regulations. It is unclear what President Trump will do if the exhortations fail to produce the desired results. Mr. Azar hinted, at a news briefing on Thursday, that the administration’s policy preferences could be included in Medicare regulations and perhaps, if necessary, in legislative proposals. He told a personal story to illustrate what he called the powerlessness of many consumers. Several years ago, he said, when he was living in Indiana, his doctor ordered a routine echocardiographic stress test, which is meant to show how well the heart works during physical activity. Instead of receiving “a simple test in the room next door,” he said, he was sent to a hospital clinic, and as a result, “the sticker price on the test just jumped dramatically.” "

867,"There’s near-universal consensus among both economists and business leaders that Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum are a bad idea, and that the wider trade war those tariffs could trigger would be very destructive. But the chances of heading off this policy disaster are small, because this is a quintessential example of Trump being Trump. In fact, the tariffs are arguably the Trumpiest thing Trump has done so far. After all, trade (like racism) is an issue on which Trump has been utterly consistent over the years. He has spent decades railing at other countries that, he claims, hurt America by taking advantage of our relatively open markets. And if his views are based on zero understanding of the issues or even of basic facts, well, Trumpism is all about belligerent ignorance, across the board. But wait, there’s more. There’s a reason we have international trade agreements, and it’s not to protect us from unfair practices by other countries. The real goal, instead, is to protect us from ourselves: to limit the special-interest politics and outright corruption that used to reign in trade policy. Trumpocrats, however, don’t see corruption and rule by special interests as problems. You could say that the world trading system is, in large part, specifically designed to prevent people like Trump from having too much influence. Of course he wants to wreck it. Some background: Contrary to what some seem to believe, textbook economics doesn’t say that free trade is win-win for everyone. Instead, trade policy involves very real conflicts of interest. But these conflicts of interest are overwhelmingly between groups within each country, rather than between countries. For example, a trade war against the European Union would make America as a whole poorer, even if the E.U. didn’t retaliate (which it would). It would, however, benefit some industries that happen to face stiff European competition. And here’s the thing: The small groups that benefit from protectionism often have more political influence than the much larger groups that are hurt. That’s why Congress used to routinely pass destructive trade bills, culminating in the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930: Enough members of Congress were bought off, one way or another, to enact legislation that almost everyone knew was bad for the nation as a whole.

870,"WASHINGTON — The United States military has carried out twice as many airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Libya since President Trump took office as it has publicly acknowledged, raising questions about whether the Pentagon has sought to obscure operations in the strife-torn North African nation. The total number of strikes — eight since January 2017 — is relatively small. But the uptick points to the threat that the Trump administration believes Libya still poses, despite the president’s focus on the American-led campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq that he has trumpeted as one of his administration’s signature national security accomplishments. Counterterrorism specialists warn that the Islamic State and Al Qaeda also still pose formidable threats in places like Somalia, Yemen and West Africa. On Tuesday, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of the Africa Command, said in congressional testimony that “we are heavily involved in the counterterrorism piece” in Libya. On its website and in news releases, the Africa Command has acknowledged only four airstrikes in Libya in the last 14 months against the Islamic State, also called ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. All of the attacks have been carried out since September. But on Thursday, a spokesman for the command, Maj. Karl J. Wiest, said four other previously undisclosed airstrikes had been carried out against Islamic State militants, most recently in January. Commanders decided to reveal those strikes only if a reporter specifically asked about them, a practice the Pentagon calls “responses to questions,” Major Wiest said via telephone and email from the Africa Command’s headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. He said journalists, usually tipped off by local reporting in Libya, have called about some but not all of the four strikes. "
871,"When President Trump signed proclamations to place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Thursday, he portrayed it as an effort to throw around America’s economic weight in hope of reaching better deals from major international partners. But Mr. Trump, who had set off warnings by trade experts that this could become the first attack in a global trade war,  also sent a different signal. There would be exceptions in the nations that the tariffs are applied to, he said. The result is that the new tariffs look more like a negotiating tactic — less the beginning of a war, more the beginning of a new round of haggling. After announcing last week that the tariffs would apply to imports from all countries, the Trump administration said that they would not apply to Canada or Mexico, pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. These exceptions suggest the administration is looking to use the threat of steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to get a better deal out of those two close allies — which are also major exporters of metals to the United States — in mostly unrelated negotiations to revamp the 25-year-old agreement. “I have a feeling we’re going to make a deal on Nafta,” Mr. Trump said as he announced the tariffs. “If we do, there won’t be any tariffs on Canada and there won’t be any on Mexico.” "
872,"WASHINGTON — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has invited President Trump to meet for negotiations over its nuclear program, an audacious diplomatic overture that would bring together two strong-willed, idiosyncratic leaders who have traded threats of war. The White House said that Mr. Trump had accepted the invitation, and Chung Eui-yong, a South Korean official who conveyed it, told reporters that the president would meet with Mr. Kim within two months. “He expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,” Mr. Chung said at the White House on Thursday evening after meeting the president. Mr. Trump, he said, agreed to “meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearization.” The president expressed his optimism about the meeting in a post on Twitter, saying that Mr. Kim had “talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze.” “Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time,” Mr. Trump added. “Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!” Mr. Chung, whose talks with Mr. Kim on Monday in Pyongyang resulted in the invitation, noted that the North Korean leader said he understood that joint military exercises with the United States and South Korea would go ahead as scheduled after the end of the Paralympic Games this month. "
873,"Students across the country continue to attack and shut down speakers at a steady pace, from Christina Hoff Sommers to Jordan Peterson. I confess that I find their behavior awful. My gut reaction is that these student mobbists manage to combine snowflake fragility and lynch mob irrationalism into one perfectly poisonous cocktail. But empathy is the essential character trait for our moment. So I thought it might be a good discipline to try to see things from the students’ perspective — to not just condemn or psychoanalyze them but to try to understand where they are coming from. So here goes. I would begin my stab at understanding by acknowledging that I grew up in one era and they grew up in another. I came of age in the 1980s. In that time, there was an assumption that though the roots of human society were deep in tribalism, over the past 3,000 years we have developed a system of liberal democracy that gloriously transcended it, that put reason, compassion and compromise atop violence and brute force. There was also an assumption that while we might disagree on the means, we all wanted basically the same things. For example, though America was plagued by economic divides we all wanted a society in which social mobility and equal opportunity were the rule. Though America is plagued by racism, we all wanted more integration and less bigotry, a place where talent and character mattered more than skin color and prejudice. Given those assumptions, sophisticated people in those days wanted to be seen, to use Scott Alexander’s term, as mistake theorists. Mistake theorists believe that the world is complicated and most of our troubles are caused by error and incompetence, not by malice or evil intent. Mistake theorists also believe that most social problems are hard and that obvious perfect solutions are scarce. Debate is essential. You bring different perspectives and expertise to the table. You reduce passion and increase learning. Basically, we’re all physicians standing over a patient with a very complex condition and we’re trying to collectively figure out what to do. This remains my basic understanding of how citizenship is supposed to work. But two things have happened since my worldview was formed. The first is that the conversation about race has changed. The idea for decades was that racial justice would come when we reduced individual bigotry — the goal was colorblind individualism. As Nils Gilman argues in The American Interest, that ideal reached its apogee with the election of Barack Obama. But Obama’s election also revealed the limits of that ideal. Now the crucial barriers to racial justice are seen not just as individual, but as structural economic structures, the incarceration crisis, the breakdown of family structure. Today’s students grew up in this different racial conversation. Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend. The second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today’s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism — what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever. These students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view! If reason and deliberation are central to democracy, how on earth did Donald Trump get elected? If you were born after 1990, it’s not totally shocking that you would see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe. It’s not surprising that you would become, in Scott Alexander’s terminology, a conflict theorist, not a mistake theorist. In the conflict theorist worldview, most public problems are caused not by errors or complexity, but by malice and oppression. The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression. Some people I admire see today’s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I’d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit. If I could talk to the students I’d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn’t persuade them. So I’d just ask them to take two courses. The first would be in revolutions — the French, Russian, Chinese and all the other ones that unleashed the passion of the mob in an effort to overthrow oppression — and the way they ALL wound up waist deep in blood. The second would be in constitutionalism. We dump on lawyers, but the law is beautiful, living proof that we can rise above tribalism and force — proof that the edifice of civilizations is a great gift, which our ancestors gave their lives for. "
874,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration rejected on Thursday Idaho’s plan to allow the sale of stripped-down, low-cost health insurance that violates the Affordable Care Act. The 2010 statute “remains the law, and we have a duty to enforce and uphold the law,” Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a letter to the governor of Idaho, C. L. Otter. While rejecting Idaho’s plan in its current form, Ms. Verma encouraged the state to keep trying, and she suggested that, “with certain modifications,” its proposal might be acceptable. President Trump has repeatedly criticized and undermined the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, saying it drove up insurance costs for millions of Americans. But Ms. Verma said that Idaho’s plan to circumvent the law was unacceptable. If the state does not enforce the coverage requirements of the federal law, she said, the federal government will. The director of the Idaho Insurance Department, Dean L. Cameron, gave a green light to noncompliant “state-based health benefit plans” in a bulletin issued Jan. 24. "
875,"Early in his presidency, Donald Trump knew exactly whom to blame for the chemical weapons used in Syria, and what to do about it. The “heinous” sarin gas attacks by President Bashar al-Assad on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last April happened because President Barack Obama “did nothing” to enforce his red line against the banned arms after an attack near Damascus in August 2013, Mr. Trump said. So Mr. Trump ordered the launch of 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian airfield where the April chemical attack originated. Invoking the horror of “innocent babies” choked by poison gas, he said military action would “deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.” Only it didn’t. In the 11 months since then, there have been many such attacks, including at least six this year, which American officials and human rights groups blamed on Mr. Assad. Rather than the more lethal sarin agent used in April, recent attacks reportedly have involved chlorine. The use of poison gas, a war crime under international law, has been integral to Mr. Assad’s scorched-earth drive to regain control of the last rebel-held areas near Damascus. By bombing civilians and depriving them of food and medical care, he has killed more than 700 people in the past several weeks, on top of nearly 500,000 killed since the civil war began in 2011. Mr. Trump seems less sure-footed about responding to atrocities in a war that has become even more complex with the Islamic State degraded. Unlike in April, Mr. Trump has said nothing about possible military retaliation. While The Washington Post reported that he has discussed the matter with top national security officials, the Pentagon denies it. Military action is never a panacea, though, and often the wrong choice. Mr. Trump’s attack, not authorized by Congress or the United Nations, wasn’t part of a larger strategy. It raised questions about whether he acted impulsively, was consumed with being the anti-Obama or wanted to fulfill his own vision of “toughness.” The one-off military strikes achieved little, as studies have shown is usually the case, and exponentially more Syrians have been killed with conventional weapons than with chemical weapons. "
876,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday began the next leg of a listening tour he promised after last month’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., eliciting heated opinions at the White House from critics of violent video games and from game makers who reject any connection to mass shootings, but offering no concrete views of his own. In broaching the subject after a mass school shooting, Mr. Trump was traveling a path well worn by his predecessors going back for decades. But his approach was all his own. As he has done with recent round-table discussions on gun restrictions and immigration, Mr. Trump on Thursday seemed most interested in drawing impassioned opinions out of the people around him, according to people who attended. But he stopped short of offering solutions. Melissa Henson, the director of programs for the Parents Television Council, a censorship advocacy group, said the president tried to “draw people out” for a “lively” discussion. “I don’t think he came to the meeting with his mind made up,” Ms. Henson said. “I think there’s more fact-finding to be done before anything is acted on.” As with his thoughts on gun restrictions, it remains unclear exactly what Mr. Trump thinks can be done on this issue, or what he truly believes. But he has a parent’s insight on how young people encounter violent media. In a February round table he hosted with lawmakers on gun restrictions, the president said some content viewed by his 11-year-old son, Barron, had surprised him. “The video games, the movies, the internet stuff is so violent. It’s so incredible. I see it,” Mr. Trump said. “I look at some of the things he’s watching, and I say, ‘How is that possible?’ And this is what kids are watching. And I think you maybe have to take a look at it.” The administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama had tried to understand the issue with wide-ranging initiatives and recommendations after massacres at Columbine High School in 1999 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Mr. Clinton ordered an investigation into advertising practices used to sell violent entertainment. And in 2013, Mr. Obama asked Congress to provide $10 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study the relationship between violence and video games. The funds were never allocated. People involved in listening tours during past administrations doubted that Mr. Trump’s meeting would lead to productive policy. Mark DeLoura, who worked as a digital media adviser in the Obama White House, said that a similar meeting after Sandy Hook had been “well rounded,” and that the recommendations that came out of that wide-ranging listening tour were concrete. “There are no researchers, no scientists,” Mr. DeLoura said of Mr. Trump’s meeting. “It doesn’t look like people reached out to the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the West Wing.” (The meeting was hastily arranged by the White House communications staff, according to one person with direct knowledge of how it came together.) On Thursday, White House officials kept the aims of the meeting vague, and declined to say why they had revoked journalists’ planned access to it. “As we continue to work towards creating school safety programs that protect all children, the president will be meeting with video game industry leaders and members of Congress to discuss violent video-game exposure and the correlation to aggression and desensitization in children,” Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. “This meeting will be the first of many with industry leaders to discuss this important issue.” Conservatives have often turned to the idea of video game censorship after mass shootings to steer the discussion away from gun restrictions. In 2007, one month after an armed student killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, Mitt Romney, running for president, said that “pornography and violence” in music, movies, TV and video games were to blame. And after Sandy Hook, Wayne LaPierre, who leads the National Rifle Association, put the blame on the entertainment media. He called the video game industry a “corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people” — naming games like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse. The response by video game makers has been to return the volley, blaming guns rights activists for deflection. They also refer to a 2011 Supreme Court decision that ruled that even the most violent video games were protected under the First Amendment. Those on opposing sides of the issue tend to rely on different data sets to understand the problem. Some point to a 2015 study by the American Psychological Association on violent video games and aggression that determined that “no single risk factor consistently leads a person to act aggressively or violently.” Others, including Dave Grossman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and a censorship advocate who attended the White House meeting, have cited research to back up the view that video games are essentially, as he wrote in 2013, “murder simulators.” Bruce Reed, the former chief of staff for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a former domestic policy adviser to Mr. Clinton, said a productive outcome for Mr. Trump’s meeting could include a discussion on funding more research into the problem. “It’s a worthwhile public health question,” he said, “quite apart from mass shootings and gun violence. But I suspect today’s meeting will demonstrate once again that politicians like to point fingers at other possible causes to deflect the pressure to act on the most obvious one.” Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri was one of three lawmakers, all Republican, who attended the meeting. In a statement, Ms. Hartzler said she admired the president’s approach of “leaving no stone unturned” but called for a broader examination of other industries, including film. “I believe the solution to curtailing violence lies in an all-encompassing approach, focused on several different factors that may contribute to school shootings,” Ms. Hartzler said. Other attendees included Brent Bozell, a longtime advocate for media censorship, and Strauss Zelnick, the chairman of Take-Two Interactive, the video game maker behind Grand Theft Auto. Robert A. Altman, the chairman of ZeniMax Media, also attended. The president’s younger brother, Robert, sits on the board of that company. Mr. Trump, who met privately with N.R.A. leaders after appearing to side with Democrats on sweeping gun restrictions in February, has become known for shifting his stances in the hours after his frequent round-table sessions. On Thursday, meeting attendees were unable to divine how he felt. “I think it would be fair to say that he feels strongly, clearly that the violence in the video games is excessive,” said Ms. Henson, the censorship advocate who attended the meeting. “But I don’t think he went into the meeting with the purpose of condemning an entire industry.” Ms. Henson added that she had not heard any solutions proposed on Thursday that she had not heard before.

878,"There are still 243 days until the midterm elections. There’s plenty of time for events to reshape the race for control of Congress. But despite plenty of developments over the previous 243 days — with seemingly endless mobile news alerts and presidential tweets — it is hard to say that the national political environment has changed. President Trump’s approval rating has been very stable. The generic congressional ballot, which asks voters which party they’ll support for Congress, has been more volatile over short periods, but the big shifts have proved ephemeral. It was only a month ago that Republicans seemed to post substantial gains on the generic congressional ballot. They had pulled five percentage points behind Democrats by some measures after a Monmouth poll showed Democrats up by just two. That led to a wave of articles declaring that the Republican tax plan and strong economic growth had revitalized the party’s fortunes. In February, it was hard to know whether the Republican surge would last. A little over a month  later, Democrats have recovered. The most recent Monmouth poll, published on Wednesday, gave Democrats a nine-point lead. Over all, Democrats lead the most recent generic ballot polls by around nine points, about the same as their standing before the tax debate began. "
879,"President Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum have elicited strong reactions from leaders in government, business and other organizations around the world. Most of them oppose the tariffs, with many leaders saying they fear that the tariffs could escalate a trade war. Below are several notable reactions. "

881,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. ‘A failed state.’ Until recently, Kansas offered the clearest cautionary tale about deep tax cuts. The state’s then-governor, Sam Brownback, promised that the tax cuts he signed in 2012 and 2013 would lead to an economic boom. They didn’t, and Kansas instead had to cut popular programs like education. Now Kansas seems to have a rival for the title of the state that’s caused the most self-inflicted damage through tax cuts: Louisiana. “No two ways about it: Louisiana is a failed state,” Robert Mann, a Louisiana State University professor and New Orleans Times-Picayune columnist, wrote recently. A special session of the State Legislature, called specifically to deal with a budget crisis caused by a lack of tax revenue, failed to do so, and legislators adjourned on Monday. No one is sure what will happen next. If legislators can’t agree on tax increases, cuts to education and medical care will likely follow. The targets would include “health care programs that cover medically fragile children and the developmentally disabled, as well as the popular Taylor Opportunity Program for Students that provides tuition-covering grants for thousands of college students,” as Elizabeth Crisp of The Advocate, the Baton Rouge newspaper, explained.

882,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Silicon Valley is over. Many people have come to that conclusion over the years — some hopefully, some sadly — and they have always been wrong. San Francisco and the peninsula to the south are still the global hub of tech finance and innovation. Peter Thiel, one of the most successful tech entrepreneurs and investors, is the latest to proclaim the end of the valley. He is giving up his San Francisco rental and moving to a house in Hollywood he bought some time ago. His personal investment firm will be making the journey as well. In 2005, Mr. Thiel explained, he was on a panel at Stanford. The question up for discussion was: Where will we find the next Google? “It was a search problem you couldn’t solve by typing into the Google search engine,” he says. “The answer I gave was there was 50 percent chance you would find it within a five-mile radius of the room we were in.” It turned out the next Google — at least in terms of the wealth it generated — was Facebook, in which Mr. Thiel was an investor. It was less than two miles away. “If I had to give that talk again, I’d say there was far less than a 50 percent chance that it’s in a 50-mile radius,” he said. Perhaps the next great company would be in China, he suggested; perhaps elsewhere in the United States. "
883,"Alan Cumming — actor, author, irrepressible provocateur — rarely shies away from expressing his desires, whether in choosing his roles (the pansexual M.C. in “Cabaret,” the fluidly dallying husband in “The Anniversary Party”) or identifying as bisexual (once married to a woman, he is now married to a man). And he hopes his latest character will be just as bold. In the new CBS series “Instinct,” making its debut March 18, Mr. Cumming stars as Dr. Dylan Reinhart, a former C.I.A. operative turned psychology professor who just happens to be gay and married to a man. Then the New York detective Lizzie Needham (Bojana Novakovic) encounters a killer ripped from the pages of “Freaks,” the professor’s best-selling treatise on abnormal behavior, and lures him and his natty tweeds from the ivory tower at the University of Pennsylvania onto the gritty city streets. His recruitment adds some zing to both their lives. “Instinct,” created by Michael Rauch from the crime novel by James Patterson and Howard Roughan, is the first hourlong network drama with a gay lead and a bit of a risk for CBS. “What’s fascinating is that I am taking a story with a gay person at the center and also showing a same-sex relationship to many millions of people who probably have never seen that before,” Mr. Cumming said. “And that to me is a very, very exciting point. It’s a mass way of confronting homophobia.” With the first 13 episodes of “Instinct” wrapped, he was recently back to jet-setting: shooting a secret project in the south of England, joining his mother to celebrate her birthday in his native Scotland and being ogled at London Fashion Week. In a phone interview from the road, Mr. Cumming, 53 — who lives in the East Village with his husband, the artist Grant Shaffer, not far from his bar, Club Cumming — talked about his return to a network series after seven seasons as the political operative Eli Gold on “The Good Wife”; his hopes for his new character (he’d like to flirt with his female co-star) and his cabaret show that sets his frustrations with America to song. "
884,"Women’s progress in America has been inextricably tied to the availability of birth control. Landmark Supreme Court decisions in 1965 and 1972 recognizing a constitutional right to contraception made it more likely that women went to college, entered the work force and found economic stability. That’s all because they were better able to choose when, or whether, to have children. A 2012 study from the University of Michigan found that by the 1990s, women who had early access to the birth control pill had wage gains of up to 30 percent, compared with older women. It’s mind-boggling that anyone would want to thwart that progress, especially since women still have so far to go in attaining full equality in the United States. But the Trump administration has signaled it may do just that, in a recent announcement about funding for a major family planning program, Title X. Since 1970, the federal government has awarded Title X grants to providers of family planning services — including contraception, cervical cancer screenings and treatment for sexually transmitted infections — to help low-income women afford them. It’s a crucial program. Conservatives — often male ones — like to argue that Title X improperly uses tax dollars to subsidize women’s sex lives, and that some forms of birth control can be obtained inexpensively. “Back in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives,” the Republican donor Foster Friess said in 2012. “The gals put it between their knees, and it wasn’t that costly.” Leaving aside that potentially procreative sex requires a man’s participation, those conservatives should note that the safest and most effective form of birth control for women might cost considerably more than a bottle of aspirin. The intrauterine device, or I.U.D. — a long-lasting contraceptive method that has a vanishingly low failure rate and is a favorite among women’s health care providers — can cost more than $1,000 out of pocket. Yet the Trump administration appeared to accept the conservatives’ retrograde thinking with a recent announcement from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Population Affairs outlining its priorities for awarding Title X grants. Alarmingly, unlike previous funding announcements, the document makes zero reference to contraception. In setting its standards for grants, it disposes of nationally recognized clinical standards, developed with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that have long been guideposts for family planning. Instead, the government says it wants to fund “innovative” services and emphasizes “fertility awareness” approaches, which include the so-called rhythm method. These have long been preferred by the religious right, but are notoriously unreliable. The announcement also says the government will look to fund programs that involve parents or guardians in minors’ family planning decisions, and get spouses involved, with no mention of privacy. And the announcement suggests that the government wants to promote abstinence until marriage. This is not a surprise, given who is in charge of the Trump administration’s Title X office — Valerie Huber, a longtime advocate of abstinence-until-marriage education programs, which are generally considered to be less effective than comprehensive efforts. Ms. Huber landed that post in January, after the resignation of Teresa Manning, who vocally opposes abortion and contraception. The new funding announcement is in keeping with the Trump administration’s thwarted attempt last year to roll back the mandate in the Affordable Care Act that employer-sponsored health insurance policies cover contraception. Advocates for women’s health care are angered by this attack on their work. Clare Coleman, the president and chief executive of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, fears that funds will be taken from providers of birth control and given to groups that promote abstinence, come this fall, when the Title X grants are expected to be announced. Ms. Coleman called the move a “direct assault” on family planning providers and “without a doubt the most deliberate attempt to upend contraceptive access for low-income people” she’s seen from any administration. The Trump administration may not be advocating that women stock up on aspirin to avoid pregnancy, but its priorities are nearly as backward and unscientific. And that will harm the health and self-determination of women, particularly the most vulnerable among them. "
885,"LONDON — The leaders of an anti-Muslim extremist group in Britain have been found guilty of hate crimes and sentenced to prison, months after they drew international attention for helping President Trump get entangled in a diplomatic dispute with British leaders. A judge in Folkestone Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday convicted Paul Golding, the leader of the group, Britain First, of one count of religiously aggravated harassment, and Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader, of three counts of the same offense. Mr. Golding was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, and Ms. Fransen to 36 weeks. The two were convicted over posting videos online of their harassment of Muslims in May 2017, at the same time as a trial of three Muslim men and a teenager who were accused and later convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl. Britain First, estimated to have about 1,000 members, was little known outside the country until November, when Mr. Trump tweeted links to anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim videos made by the group, some of which were misleading. Britain First basked in the attention, but Mr. Trump was rebuked by Prime Minister Theresa May and other politicians, in multiple countries and across a broad ideological spectrum, as well as by human rights groups. In January, the president canceled a scheduled trip to Britain, to coincide with the opening of a new United States Embassy in London. It was clear that he would be met with large protests, fueled partly by those tweets, and 1.8 million people signed a petition calling on the government to rescind its invitation for a state visit. Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had called off the trip because he objected to the decision to close the old embassy and build a new one in a less glamorous location south of the Thames, a move that he falsely attributed to former President Barack Obama. Britain First is a Christian nationalist group that opposes immigration and contends that Islam is destroying the country, and it has used inflammatory tactics like publicly confronting Muslims on the street about their religion, and going into mosques. Ms. Fransen, 32, and Mr. Golding, 36, have accused the government of criminalizing their opinions. On Wednesday, the group posted a picture of the two on its Facebook page under the words, “their only crime is loyalty.” During the trial in the rape case, Ms. Fransen and Mr. Golding made video recordings, which they posted on social media, of Ms. Fransen knocking on the doors of places where they believed the defendants were present — though in each case, prosecutors said, they were wrong — and insulting them and daring them to come out and face her. In one instance, prosecutors said, Ms. Fransen yelled into a defendant’s home, when only his pregnant girlfriend and their two small children were inside. In another, she warned against “dirty Muslim” pedophiles “touching our kids.” “These defendants were not merely exercising their right to free speech but were instead aiming religiously aggravated abuse at innocent members of the public,” said the chief crown prosecutor, Jaswant K. Narwal. Ms. Fransen and Mr. Golding have been arrested several times.In one instance, a court fined her, and sentenced him to eight weeks in jail for violating a court order barring him from entering any mosque.

886,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — More than a year into his tenure as the nation’s chief diplomat, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has a set of diplomatic tools that he and aides use at nearly every stop. There’s the tight smile Mr. Tillerson wears when asked about insulting remarks by President Trump that have angered or bewildered entire continents. There’s the shrug or dismissive laugh when he is trolled or overshadowed by Russia or China, rivals the Trump administration has yet to develop a coherent strategy to contain or surmount. And there’s the signature pause that follows when his aides are asked why he has yet again failed to schedule a meeting during his trip with opposition or rival political leaders — the kind of encounters past secretaries of state routinely undertook to emphasize the importance of pluralism, and to hedge against sudden changes in government. Mr. Tillerson and his subordinates drew on that repertory of responses on Thursday as he visited the headquarters of the African Union, a set of soaring buildings constructed by the Chinese — and said to be riddled with Chinese listening devices. In a news conference with Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, the men were asked by a reporter from the China Global Television Network about reports that Mr. Trump described Africa as filled with “shithole countries,” a remark the reporter said “Africa is still digesting.” "
887,"OK, Trump has gone ahead with steel and aluminum tariffs, with an exemption for Canada and Mexico if they renegotiate NAFTA (which seems to make nonsense of the supposed national security rationale, but whatever). This is potentially a very big deal; we could be looking at the unwinding of the whole global trade system built, largely under U.S. leadership, over the past 80 years. And as it happens, this topic is right up my alley. So I’m going to be taking reader questions. You can leave questions in the comment section of this post or at NYT Opinion’s Facebook page. I’ll respond to selected questions early next week. Update: Here are my answers to some of your questions. "
888,"WASHINGTON — President Trump defied opposition from his own party and protests from overseas as he signed orders on Thursday imposing stiff and sweeping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. But he sought to soften the impact on the United States’ closest allies with a more flexible plan than originally envisioned. After a week of furious lobbying and a burst of last-minute internal debates and confusion, Mr. Trump agreed to exempt, for now, Canada and Mexico, and held out the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia. But foreign leaders warned of a trade war that could escalate to other industries and take aim at American goods. “The actions we are taking today are not a matter of choice; they are a matter of necessity for our security,” Mr. Trump said in a ceremony at the White House where he officially authorized the tariffs, which will go into effect in 15 days. Flanked by a handful of steel and aluminum workers, some wearing coveralls and holding hard hats, Mr. Trump presented the move as a way to rebuild vital industries decimated by foreign competition. “Our factories were left to rot and to rust all over the place; thriving communities turned into ghost towns,” he said. “That betrayal is now over.” The orders were Mr. Trump’s most expansive use of federal power to rewrite the rules of global trade since he took office and upended the prevailing consensus on free markets that has largely governed Washington under administrations of both parties for decades. A longtime critic of globalization, Mr. Trump argued that the United States had been ravaged by unfair trading partners. As a result of Mr. Trump’s action, levies on imports of steel will rise by 25 percent and aluminum by 10 percent. Business groups have warned that the effect could be felt across the global supply network as consumers face higher prices for automobiles, appliances and other goods. But Mr. Trump’s aides dismissed such predictions as “fake news” and said most Americans would hardly notice any impact. "
889,"LOS ANGELES — Three immigration agents showed up last month at Poindexter Nut Company, which processes walnuts for 300 growers in California’s Central Valley, demanding payroll records to verify whether its employees were authorized to work in the United States. To comply with federal law, Mike Poindexter began amassing documents to turn over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. To comply with a new state law, he posted a notice above the time clock informing workers that ICE was auditing their employment records, a process that could take months. Immediately, workers began resigning, and Mr. Poindexter signed their last pay checks. “I am a pawn caught between the federal and state governments, like a child between two fighting parents,” said Mr. Poindexter, the company’s chief executive. “Each is threatening to punish me if I don’t listen.” The Trump administration is in combat with the nation’s liberal bellwether, filing a lawsuit against California this week seeking to nullify three state laws that protect undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, both sides threw gasoline onto their feud, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions denouncing the state’s “open borders radicals” and Gov. Jerry Brown saying the administration was “full of liars.” The fight has energized partisans on each side. And it has squeezed those in the middle like Mr. Poindexter — the people directly affected by the laws. Employers are now bearing the brunt of the Trump administration’s wrath against California and illegal immigration more broadly; ICE’s chief, Thomas D. Homan, has vowed more workplace enforcement and warned that the state had better “hold on tight.” "

891,"To the Editor: Re “Justice Dept. Sues California Over State Immigration Laws” (news article, March 7): “This is basically going to war against the State of California,” Gov. Jerry Brown said on Wednesday. This is not only a war against California. This is a nationwide civil war that has been festering just beneath the surface for some time, and more recently has surfaced with a vengeance. I’m not sure how best to define the adversaries — certainly not strictly by region — but it’s fairly easy to predict where proponents of either side will stand on any given issue, “sanctuary cities” being an obvious example. It is really a fight for the soul of America, and a great deal hangs in the balance. I can say that “my side” is not winning that battle at the moment. But there is hope. Let’s make November 2018 our Gettysburg. JIM BISHOP, BANGOR, ME. To the Editor: Re “Chief of Immigration Agency Compares Oakland’s Mayor to ‘Gang Lookout’ ” (news article, March 1): Rather than likening Oakland’s mayor, Libby Schaaf, to a “gang lookout” for tipping off her city’s Latino residents about an impending Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency raid, I prefer to compare the mayor’s actions to those of abolitionists who helped slaves escape from the South. On Thursday, President Trump called Ms. Schaaf’s actions a “disgrace,” but it is ICE’s maltreatment of Latino and Muslim immigrants that is reprehensible. These raids sweep up hardworking people, deport them and leave their families to suffer the consequences. Ironically, we are a nation of immigrants, and the growing sanctuary movement and the courage of people like Ms. Schaaf are hopeful signs that ICE’s anti-immigrant witch hunts will eventually come to an end. "
892,"WASHINGTON — When the message from Matt Skiber arrived in the mailbox of the Facebook account for Donald J. Trump’s Florida campaign in early August 2016, it raised no flags, despite its slightly awkward attempts at colloquial American English. It was one of thousands of inquiries about getting involved — in this case asking for the campaign’s support in planning “a YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town” — that were fielded by an overextended staff that was mostly new to presidential politics. The campaign employee who oversaw the Facebook account took more than two weeks to get back to Mr. Skiber, according to private Facebook messages obtained by The New York Times. The employee, who did not want to be remembered as the victim of a Russian plot and asked for anonymity, thanked Mr. Skiber for his enthusiasm and creativity and recommended that he contact Chad Tucker, the Florida communications director, at his campaign email address. Adding a thumbs-up and American flag emojis, the employee told Mr. Skiber, “We can win this!” But Mr. Skiber was not an American supporter of Mr. Trump. Instead, he was a persona created by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian company indicted last month. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, alleged that the company, linked to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his country’s intelligence services, executed an elaborate and expensive plot to “sow discord” in American politics and ultimately to boost Mr. Trump and damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. A review of the private Facebook messages, as well as interviews with the Trump campaign operatives who were targeted by Russians, reveal that Mr. Trump’s team was susceptible to Moscow’s interference campaign. It preyed on unsuspecting staff members who were more interested in capturing the enthusiasm of supporters of their unorthodox nominee and did not envision the seemingly far-fetched possibility that Russians might enlist them as unwitting players in a scheme to undermine American democracy. “Nobody reasonably would have asked — or even thought to ask — ‘Are you sure you’re not with Russia?’” said Karen Giorno, a Republican operative who was the Florida state director for Mr. Trump’s campaign at the time it was contacted by the Internet Research Agency. “It’s just not something that normally you would think you have to watch out for.” In a plot carried out by 80 employees, the Internet Research Agency, which has come to be known as the “troll factory,” stole identities from Americans and created social media campaigns and fake online personas like Matt Skiber to try to manipulate voters, activists and Trump campaign staff members, court papers show. The Russians focused on Florida, the nation’s most critical swing state, contacting activists and Mr. Trump’s campaign primarily for help in staging rallies across the state on Aug. 20, in the heat of the presidential race, called Florida Goes Trump, according to the indictment. Court papers do not indicate whether the Russians succeeded in winning help from the campaign’s Florida operation. And the rallies appear to have attracted few attendees and relatively little attention at the time. The Trump campaign’s operation in Florida, as in many key states, was thinly staffed, inexperienced and often overwhelmed by the demands of a white-hot presidential race. Any procedures for vetting and verifying people or groups who sought to get involved were not widely shared by campaign staff members. And they were generally not on the lookout for infiltration efforts by anyone, let alone by Russians who had gone to great lengths to create false identities. The informal setup and small staff was typical of the on-the-ground operations of most statewide or presidential campaigns, which tend to be chaotic hives of activity where offers of volunteer assistance are usually welcomed with little scrutiny. “I would have been more concerned with whether or not the opposition would try to infiltrate our campaign,” Ms. Giorno said, “or whether someone who was trying to represent the campaign had a criminal record, or had the right character or background.” Ms. Giorno said she was not involved in running the Facebook account and was “shocked” by the revelations in the indictment that someone on her staff had unknowingly opened the door for the Russians. But, she added: “I don’t know how you stop that. Anybody can put up a fake profile on anyone.” The Trump re-election campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, “Out of respect for the special counsel, we are not going to comment.” The employee who oversaw the Facebook account had wide latitude and focused primarily on policing for offensive content on the public-facing portion of the page, while also trying to respond to everyone who privately expressed an interest in boosting Mr. Trump. The employee cited a desire to be polite to supporters and to make them feel heard. Expressing embarrassment over being tricked by the Russians, the employee compared the situation to “The Americans,” the television show in which Russian spies collect intelligence while passing themselves off as business owners in Washington during the height of the Cold War. Using the information provided by the employee, the Russians at the Internet Research Agency emailed Mr. Tucker, the campaign’s Florida communications director, from an account set up under another alias, Josh Milton, court documents show. The Russians presented the Milton persona as the “team leader” of a pro-Trump social media group called Being Patriotic, according to a Facebook message. Being Patriotic had planned rallies in 13 “confirmed locations” in Florida and asked the campaign for help at each one, the Russians using the Josh Milton email address wrote to Mr. Tucker, according to the indictment. Days later, on the recommendation of the campaign employee operating the Florida Facebook account, the Russians contacted another campaign staff member, Beatriz J. Ramos, who served as the coalitions director for the Trump campaign in Florida, according to the indictment, which does not identify either Mr. Tucker or Ms. Ramos by name. Mr. Tucker and Ms. Ramos said that they received a high volume of messages during the campaign, and had no recollection of receiving, let alone responding to, the messages. Both said they could not recall any messages that prompted suspicions about Russian outreach, though they acknowledged they were not attuned to that possibility, either. “No one was talking about the Russians back then, so it’s not like something that anyone was looking out for,” said Mr. Tucker, adding that his job did not include vetting volunteers or communicating with people who wanted to set up rallies. He worked for Mr. Trump’s presidential transition after the election and is now a telecommunications official based in South Carolina. Ms. Ramos, who briefly worked for the Trump administration before returning to Florida, suggested that Mrs. Clinton’s allies might have tried to frame the Trump campaign. “I’ve been around long enough to know that if Democrats are blaming Republicans for something, they’ve already done it, and they’ve done it worse,” she said. “So I feel like maybe your questions are best directed to someone from the Hillary campaign, rather than myself, because I’ve not seen anything that would represent any type of collusion or any Russian influence.” Ms. Ramos and Mr. Tucker said they could not check their campaign email accounts because they no longer had access to them. The messages sent by the Russians via Facebook are no longer accessible from the Trump campaign’s Florida account, the employee said, because the Matt Skiber account from which they were sent was deactivated. According to the indictment, the Russians deleted social media accounts and emails “in order to avoid detection and impede investigation” once it became apparent that Mr. Mueller’s team was working with Facebook and other social media companies to investigate Russian interference. Mr. Mueller’s team did collect at least some of the Facebook messages and emails sent to the Trump campaign officials in Florida. The dates of the Facebook messages obtained by The Times roughly correspond to those referenced in the indictment. Mr. Mueller’s investigators likely would have emails sent by the Trump staff in response to the Russian entreaties; the special counsel requested and received documents from the campaign, which instructed former staff members to retain all documents and communications related to the campaign. Mr. Tucker, Ms. Giorno, Ms. Ramos and the employee who sent the Facebook messages said they had not been contacted by the special counsel. “We were never notified or aware of any Russian efforts to interfere in the election by the F.B.I. or any other agency,” Ms. Giorno said. “As someone who worked very closely with then-candidate Trump, I can tell you that security and integrity of the process was paramount to him and his senior staff.” The ability of campaigns to detect and prevent foreign infiltration could be tested again soon. Intelligence agencies and outside experts agree that Russians are planning to meddle in elections this fall and beyond, but Mr. Trump and key parts of his administration are doing little to combat such meddling.

893,"Last week saw so many wonderful comments that we were moved to make a note of it on Twitter: The best of all that commenting can be seen below in the individual posts and conversations we chose as favorites. We heard from new schools in Fresno, Calif., New Egypt, N.J., and Texas and Georgia, as well as from old friends like a school in Danvers, Mass., and we noticed students choosing from among prompts past and present. (Though we don’t include old questions in this roundup, some we asked over a year ago lit up again this week.) Before we leave you to the student roundup, we want to call out the one school that is perhaps most responsible, week after week, for comments across forums, and for encouraging students to respond to each other thoughtfully: Wilmington, N.C., we love you! If your teacher is reading this, please ask him or her to write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, and tell us how this writing has become such an embedded part of the curriculum. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ Our most popular writing prompt this week — “Is It Harder to Grow Up in the 21st Century Than It Was in the Past?” — was suggested by a student reader, Jordyn, 14, from Westfield, N.J. With over 150 comments, it seems this was a question that was on many young people’s minds. The majority of students said yes, it felt harder to grow up today than it was in the past — and they overwhelmingly attributed it to the abundance of school shootings and everyday violence, which has left them feeling less safe than their parents and grandparents. "
894,"Since announcing new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week, the Trump administration has argued that it is protecting American industry from China, which in recent years flooded the global market with cheap metals. It is impossible to take this argument seriously. For starters, the tariffs will have little impact on China. That country supplies less than 5 percent of the steel and about 10 percent of the aluminum that the United States imports. Further, a vast majority of metal imports from China are already subject to tariffs put into place by previous administrations, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Oddly, the primary victims of these tariffs, which are being imposed under a law that lets the president restrict trade to protect national security, will be American allies like the European Union and South Korea. Canada and Mexico will be temporarily exempted, but could still be hit with tariffs later if they and the United States fail to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Before President Trump signed orders authorizing the tariffs on Thursday, he suggested other countries could be exempted, too, but only if they treated the United States “fairly,” including by spending more money on their own defense. “Many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies as they like to call them,” he said at the White House, flanked by steel and aluminum workers and administration officers. More important, the Trump administration has repeatedly dropped the ball on efforts that might have succeeded in prompting China to curb production, something that would have benefited not just the United States but also allies that are now threatening to retaliate by imposing tariffs on American goods and services. Most experts agree that China is not moving fast enough to close steel mills and aluminum smelters that it no longer needs because its economy is growing more slowly as it has gotten much bigger. The country’s leaders fear that moving faster could hurt its economy, harm state-owned banks that have lent to the metal industries and create unrest among workers who lose their jobs. But experts like Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, say that the United States, the European Union and other countries could pressure China to move faster to address this problem, especially if they worked together. Characteristically, the Trump administration has displayed none of the diplomatic and economic savvy required to get China to change its policies. On Jan. 12, 2017, the Obama administration filed a case with the World Trade Organization that accused China of unfairly subsidizing aluminum producers and thus driving down global prices for the metal. But Mr. Trump’s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has failed to ask the W.T.O. to convene a panel of judges to hear the case, effectively suspending it. Mr. Lighthizer’s office declined to answer questions about the case. Perhaps Mr. Lighthizer, a trade lawyer who has represented the steel industry, did not believe the case would have been successful because he shares Mr. Trump’s contempt for the W.T.O., an organization the United States was instrumental in creating to help prevent trade wars. Last month, Mr. Trump said the organization “makes it almost impossible for us to do good business,” arguing that American officials get to pick too few judges on its dispute resolution panels. But these assertions are belied by the fact that the United States has won nearly 86 percent of the cases it has brought before the W.T.O. since 1995. Another opportunity for addressing excess steel production came in talks last summer between Chinese officials and Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. The Chinese told the Americans they would be willing to reduce China’s steel production capacity by 150 million tons by 2022. But Mr. Trump rejected the offer. An unnamed administration official told The Financial Times that Mr. Trump wasn’t interested in striking a deal because he had already decided that he wanted to impose tariffs. By now it should surprise no one that Mr. Trump prefers empty statements to doing the work needed to achieve lasting change. The former is easy to deliver in tweets and public pronouncements, while the latter takes patience and persistence. The president would rather impose tariffs and claim he is protecting the country and bringing back lost jobs than take the time to properly address the problem of excess Chinese steel and aluminum capacity. And he does not seem to care that, in doing so, he might penalize and anger an ally like South Korea, with which the United States needs to work closely on potential negotiations with North Korea, an unpredictable adversary. The president’s approach should worry everyone concerned about a trade war or the health of the steel and aluminum industries. "
895,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trade retaliation, murmurs of dissent in China and overlooked obituaries. Here’s what you need to know:      "
896,"BEIJING — China pledged Thursday to hit back at the United States if it sets off a trade war, issuing its strongest threat yet as President Trump prepares to impose more tariffs against China. The White House is hours away from putting into effect sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs on its trading partners that have caused an international outcry. But more worrying to China are separate trade sanctions that Mr. Trump could impose under an investigation into China’s intellectual property practices. Hundreds of Chinese companies could be singled out in that process, known as a Section 301 investigation. Speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China’s legislature, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “History has shown that fighting a trade war has never been a correct way to solve a problem.” “Especially given today’s globalization, choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,” Mr. Wang said. “The outcome will only be harmful. China would have to make a justified and necessary response.” He did not elaborate on the measures that Beijing might take. But he urged the United States to “sit down peacefully” to constructively discuss finding a mutually beneficial solution. China has told American executives that it will retaliate against American companies if Mr. Trump levies tariffs against Beijing, according to a business lobby group, the American Chamber of Commerce in China. The most likely targets would be airplane and agricultural companies — political constituencies that are important to Mr. Trump. The group has said that trade tariffs imposed by the United States could also prompt Beijing to investigate American exports to China. China could say that these goods are sold below their fair value and subsidized by the United States. China is now less dependent on trade than it used to be, even though on paper it has more to lose from a trade war. It exports more to the United States than it imports, according to an analysis by Capital Economics, a London-based research company. Exports to the United States contribute only 2 percent to China’s annual economic output, which is driven largely by domestic demand. On Thursday, China released trade data that showed that its exports in February rose 44.5 percent from a year earlier, giving it a trade surplus of $33.7 billion for the month. Economists said, however, that this was a one-off and largely related to the Chinese New Year. Exporters usually rush to ship goods before closing for the holiday. "
897,"WASHINGTON — President Trump dined at the ornate Georgetown home of a prominent Washington lawyer on Wednesday night with wealthy donors who are expected to play crucial roles in financing his re-election campaign. The dinner was the latest in a series of donor events associated with a pair of independent groups — America First Policies and America First Action — that are aiming to raise $100 million this year, mostly in large donations, to support Mr. Trump’s agenda and the election campaigns of allied congressional candidates. Attendees included donors and operatives who are working to raise money for the America First groups, such as the Dallas financial executive Roy W. Bailey and the Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm, as well as the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., according to someone briefed on the list of attendees and published reports. Mr. Hamm and Mr. Bailey are on the board of America First Policies, a nonprofit group that was created to advocate Mr. Trump’s agenda and that has paid for a series of polls and strategy memos about the political effects of the Trump administration’s efforts. America First Action, on the other hand, is a “super PAC” that is raising money to air advertisements in support of Republican congressional candidates allied with the president. The two groups are headed by the veteran Republican operative Brian O. Walsh, who also attended Wednesday’s dinner. The gathering was hosted by C. Boyden Gray, a Washington lawyer who served in top positions in both George Bush’s and George W. Bush’s presidential administrations, and who is known for hosting gatherings of the capital’s Republican elite. "

899,"PARIS — On Nov. 9, 2016, when we Europeans woke up to the news of Donald Trump’s election as president of the United States, most of us understood that it would have a significant impact on world politics. What we did not realize at the time was how much that event would alter the basic fabric of international relations. Over the past 16 months, we have been through roughly three stages in dealing with the fact that our first ally, the United States of America, is ruled by such an unorthodox president. We began by betting on human wisdom and political realism: Soon enough, Donald Trump, the nationalist, populist candidate, would wise up and become President Trump. Maverick politicians tend to do this in democratic societies. Then came the “adults in the room” stage. When it became clear that there was no wising up in the Oval Office, we were led to believe that fortunately, the celebrated checks and balances of the American system were functioning. The toxic Steve Bannon would soon be on his way out. Some experienced, reliable generals were taking over; their advice would prevail. How would official Washington have reacted if generals were appointed to key posts in a French or German government? Not warmly, one suspects. But these being no ordinary times, Europeans went along with the idea. For those who still bought it, the “adults in the room” theory took a serious beating last month at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top dogs in foreign and defense policy. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis came, but surprisingly did not take the floor. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, did speak but was very publicly chided a few hours later by a presidential tweet because he “forgot” to say that Russian interference had no impact on Mr. Trump’s election. Senior European officials admit that however good their cooperation may be with counterparts in the Trump administration, the president’s unpredictability looms too large over decision-making. We have now entered the third stage of the great European disbelief. It could be called the “Angela Merkel was right” stage, in a nod to the German chancellor’s statement after the NATO and Group of 7 meetings last May that “we Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands.” American officials keep trying to reassure their puzzled European interlocutors: “Don’t look at the tweets, look at what we do.” Repeated over and over, it is truly an extraordinary line. Think of representing your administration and telling foreigners every day: Ignore our president. But that’s a pipe dream. This president cannot be ignored because he is already profoundly transforming international relations, well beyond promoting unilateralism at the expense of multilateralism. "
900,"The gun control bill that the Florida Legislature passed on Wednesday was, in many respects, a major victory for the new activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It was passed in defiance of the National Rifle Association and, if Gov. Rick Scott signs it, will be the first successful gun control measure in Florida in more than 20 years. But it left out many of the biggest provisions the students and their supporters had sought, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Here is a look at what is in the final bill, and what is not. • Raise the minimum age. The bill would change the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21 from 18 — a provision that would have prohibited the Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz, 19, from legally buying the rifle he used in his massacre. This is a divergence from federal law, under which people cannot buy handguns from licensed dealers until they are 21, but can buy shotguns and rifles — often much deadlier than handguns — at 18. (Unlicensed sales, such as at gun shows, have looser restrictions.) Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, a fellow Republican, endorsed the age increase last month. • Create a waiting period. Prospective gun buyers would have to wait three days, or until a background check is completed, whichever is longer. There would be some exceptions, including for police officers, members of the military, licensed hunters and licensed concealed carriers. • Ban bump stocks. Bump stocks are devices that can be attached to rifles to enable them to fire faster, and they will no longer be legal in Florida if the bill is signed. (You can learn more about them here.) They came to public attention in October, after a gunman in Las Vegas used them to kill 58 people and wound hundreds; with the devices, his semiautomatic weapons were able to fire almost as fast as fully automatic machine guns. After that massacre, the N.R.A. said it supported a national ban on bump stocks, an extremely rare gun control endorsement by the group. But the proposal languished in Congress, and while President Trump told the Justice Department last month to issue new regulations, thus far it has not. "

News consumption advice and the latest on Britain’s spy poisoning, President Trump’s metal tariffs and the Champions League. Here’s the news: • For two months, our tech columnist skipped digital news and social media, reading only newspapers, newsletters, books and magazine articles. He said he ended up better informed and less anxious, with more free time. “Most of all, I realized my personal role as a consumer of news in our broken digital news environment,” he writes. “I distilled those lessons into three short instructions, the way the writer Michael Pollan once boiled down nutrition advice: Get news. Not too quickly. Avoid social.” _____ • The British authorities confirmed that a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent in England this week. Suspicion is now rampant that the episode was an assassination attempt, and that Russia might be responsible. The former spy, Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, remain in critical condition. _____ •  President Trump is expected to formally impose new tariffs on steel and aluminum today, despite a strong opposition from establishment Republicans. As aides quit in record numbers, the president increasingly relies on his own judgment. European Union officials unveiled an array of retaliatory tariffs they would place on American imports, including products made in Republican states, like Kentucky bourbon. Separately, we learned that Mr. Trump ignored his lawyers’ advice and asked key witnesses in the Russia inquiry about their conversations with investigators. _____ • Turkey asked Washington to stop Kurdish commanders from sending more troops to Afrin, the Kurdish stronghold in Syria’s west that Turkey invaded last month. Besides creating a diplomatic quandary, the Kurdish deployment to Afrin is depriving the U.S. of allied troops in the campaign to stamp out the last vestiges of the Islamic State. Meanwhile, negotiations between the Syrian government and Jaish al-Islam, the rebel group that controls diminishing parts of the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta, went nowhere. New government troops are adding momentum to the brutal siege that began in 2013. _____ • In honor of International Women’s Day, an official holiday in many countries, here are some stories on the state of gender equality: In France, the government may fine companies that do not erase gender pay gaps within three years. Some workers in Spain are striking over inequality. And in Britain, Parliament and social media debated  “mansplaining.” In the U.S., a Muslim fashion blogger is making waves by challenging stereotypes about hijab-wearing women. And the first female artistic director of the Maxim Gorki Theater in Berlin is focusing on cultural conflicts. Finally, there are signs that American parents’ traditional preference for sons over daughters is changing. • A robot at the world’s largest bricklaying competition fed dreams of solving housing shortages — and raised fears for bricklayers’ jobs. • The European Central Bank had been expected to take another small step toward normalcy today, but the populist surge in Italy’s election changed its calculus, our correspondent in Frankfurt writes. •  Huawei is determined to lead 5G mobile technology, worrying Washington. “Whoever controls the technology knows, intimately, how it was built and where all the doors and buttons are.” • Peter Thiel, the billionaire Facebook board member and Trump supporter, discusses politics, Silicon Valley and how he was influenced by the French philosopher René Girard. •  Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • China’s Communist elders were too old or too cowed to resist President Xi Jinping’s backroom campaign to abolish term limits.

Today is International Women’s Day, a global recognition of women’s achievements. We’re looking back more than 100 years to recognize the place in history of a group of 223 women. In 1917, on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War I, the U.S. government drafted 2.8 million men into military service. The Army realized that its success would rely on the Allies’ use of a new technology: the telephone. Enter the Hello Girls, a group of bilingual telephone operators selected for working the switchboards in France, connecting the front lines with supply depots and military command. They often handled over 150,000 calls per day. But because they were women, the U.S. government denied them veteran status for more than 60 years after the war. “The unfortunate reality is their service wasn’t officially recognized with veteran status until 1979, when a small fraction of those who served were still alive,” a senior curator at the National World War I Museum and Memorial said. “To achieve that point of hard-won recognition took a monumental effort.” Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

902,"Many events of the last week have had the ominous undertones of a destructive global trade war. There was President Trump’s seemingly spontaneous announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs, as well as retaliatory threats from close allies, and the president’s tweets predicting that a trade war would be easy to win. It has all felt a little too much as if we’re in the early chapters of a history book about a calamitous event. But there is nothing inevitable about a trade war. In fact, the rebound in the financial markets in the last week suggests that the chances of a complete breakdown in the global trade system remain remote, if a little less remote than a week ago. That’s because the Trump administration has mostly paired the president’s bellicose language with signals that it will act within the rules of the global trade game. That is especially true if you follow formal documents issued by the relevant government agencies instead of the president’s tweets. This approach was evident Wednesday when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, “There are potential carveouts for Mexico and Canada based on national security and possibly other countries as well,” regarding the steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week. This implies the administration is seeking to use the tariffs more as a negotiating chit with two of the nation’s biggest trading partners. It was also evident in the relative quiet from the just-finished round of negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico City. A rule of thumb is that the less the participants are airing in public, the more productive negotiations are behind the scenes. That’s not to say that the steel and aluminum tariffs don’t risk economic and diplomatic damage. They are likely to harm industries that use the metals as an input, like makers of automobiles and aircraft. And by invoking national security grounds as cause for the action, the Trump administration may be giving other countries more license to do the same to protect their favored industries. But for the years ahead, the smart money is on “no trade war, but also no trade peace,” as Terry Haines, managing director and head of political analysis at Evercore ISI, put it. The United States could launch a steady stream of actions against trading partners, especially China, and some of them may even prove costly. But Mr. Haines argues it is unlikely that the administration will escalate things in ways that might launch a 1930s-style cycle of rising tariffs and all-out economic warfare, even as the administration turns its focus to China. “You’re going to see tit-for-tat actions, but our view of this is that you’re going to get two countries who understand that it is fundamentally more in their interest to cooperate than compete,” Mr. Haines said. “They’re going to figure out ways to cooperate even in the midst of things that sound like they’re escalating.” Scholars who have studied trade disputes have found that trade skirmishes can end with more mutually satisfactory arrangements. One key is for countries to retaliate carefully against what they consider to be unfair practices, targeting politically sensitive industries in the country with which they are clashing. It is a safe bet that negotiators in the United States, China and elsewhere are well aware of this. The implication of this view is not that an all-out trade war is impossible, just that some of the loose talk about the idea in the last week — including by the president  — is getting far ahead of the facts. Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at the accounting firm RSM, sketched out what a true trade war would look like. “The first indicator that a trade war has begun would be the announced intention to withdraw from, or abrogate, current trade treaty arrangements,” Mr. Brusuelas wrote recently. He contrasts that with “trade spats,” which take place continually, and tariff actions that are rarer but have been used many times without setting off a major economic dislocation. A recent example was the Obama administration’s 2009 tariff on Chinese tires, which did coincide with a rebound in domestic tire production (though it was costly relative to the number of jobs created). If the United States ignored rulings of the World Trade Organization, or pulled out of Nafta, it could trigger a series of steps including not just tariffs but other restrictions on international commerce, and perhaps limits on the flow of capital across borders and even the expropriation of foreign-owned assets. He does not see that dark scenario as imminent. “While the U.S. rests on the edge of a trade friction spilling over into a period of trading tariffs, it is not yet on the brink of a trade war,” he said. What should people who are worried of dangerous escalation watch for? An early one will be whom Mr. Trump appoints to succeed Gary Cohn as director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Cohn, a Wall Street veteran who announced his resignation after the tariff plan was announced, was a voice for restraint in trade policy. It’s an open question whether his successor will be as well. Beyond that, an important question is whether the Trump administration continues along with negotiations and measured, narrowly focused tariffs aimed at specific policy goals — or tries to withdraw from or ignore Nafta or the trade agreement with South Korea. The biggest question of all will be whether the administration will reject the authority of the W.T.O. in the event of an unfavorable ruling, which would undermine a mainstay of global trade governance. Those risks are out there, and it’s clear that the president’s personal instincts are to run toward risk rather than away from it. But that doesn’t mean a trade war is upon us. "
903,"LONDON — Few world leaders have looked weaker than Theresa May, the British prime minister. Yet in Parliament on Wednesday, she vowed to stand tough in the escalating confrontation with Russia over the use of a nerve agent to poison one of its former spies on British soil. In language reminiscent of the Cold War, Mrs. May — until recently, accused at home of not being hard enough on Moscow — expelled 23 Russians she said were spies, promised a crackdown on corrupt Russians and the money they funnel into Britain, and called off high-level contacts between the two governments. Suddenly, she is the most forceful Western leader in denouncing President Vladimir V. Putin’s government, which she portrayed as a malevolent and lawless force. Her decision makes for a particularly sharp contrast with President Trump, who has been notably reluctant to criticize Mr. Putin and is dogged by accusations that the Kremlin tried to help him in the 2016 election. But it was not clear how strongly allies would rally to her side, and experts said that behind Mrs. May’s tough talk lay relatively mild measures, aside from the headline-grabbing expulsion, which she described as the biggest one of Russian diplomats in more than 30 years. That, in turn, reflects Britain’s weakened position in the world, as well as Russia’s continuing success in sowing discord and division. “I expected a stronger reaction,” said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based defense and security research institute. He said Mrs. May might have calculated that in response to tougher measures, Russia would “decapitate the British Embassy in Moscow” with its own expulsions. "
904,"Brooke Shields drew herself up to her full 6 feet, fielding reporters’ questions with an agility that has become second nature. At the Beekman Hotel in downtown Manhattan last month, Ms. Shields, the model, actress and veteran of numberless interviews, was delivering but the latest in a series of canny performances. She bantered good-naturedly, as is her habit, displaying an unflappable poise and a set of curves pneumatically packaged inside a closefitting top and skirt from the collection she was about to unveil for QVC, which will be introduced in its entirety on March 14. Her features and frame were considerably fuller than in 1980, when she scandalized television audiences with the coy claim that nothing came between her and her Calvins. The once-angular jaw is softer. Not that it matters. At 52, Ms. Shields, after transitioning through the decades from wide-eyed innocent to self-mocking glamorista in television shows like “Suddenly Susan” and “Friends,” has ripened into the kind of consummately relatable personality much coveted by QVC, the home-shopping behemoth that found success with celebrities including Iman and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Ms. Shields’s history is part of the draw. On screen and on the page, she has been a continual presence in the lives of her fans: a comedic talent and the author of several viscerally revealing memoirs in which she casts herself as a survivor, beating back demons that include a codependent relationship with an alcoholic mother and a severe episode of postpartum depression. As Rachel Ungaro, the vice president of fashion merchandising and design development for QVC said, “she transcends the decades”: fixed firmly in home viewers’ imaginations as paradoxically tough and alluring but approachable. “Our customer is going to love her,” Ms. Ungaro said, “because to their minds she is very real.” "
905,"Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, and his wife were directly involved in selecting a $31,000 custom mahogany dining room set for his office — contrary to Mr. Carson’s claim that the decision was handled by subordinates, newly obtained documents show. In an August email, the department’s administrative officer referred to “printouts of the furniture the secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out,” according to a 163-page cache of emails obtained by American Oversight, a Washington-based watchdog group, under the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Carson’s wife, Candy Carson, played a central role in coordinating the redecoration of his office suite — down to scheduling an appointment with an interior decorator, reviewing photo boards of furniture choices last summer and pressuring staff members to find more money for furnishings, according to the emails. The correspondence came as the Trump administration proposed extensive cuts to the department. It also reveals that senior HUD staff members scrambled to figure out ways to reconcile Mrs. Carson’s demands for major upgrades to the outdated office suite with federal laws that prohibit expenditures of more than $5,000 on office furniture without congressional approval. The emails contain vivid descriptions of the “wobbling” chairs and table. In one message, a top HUD official, Sheila Greenwood, wrote that she feared one of the chairs might collapse under a visitor — which she described as a potential “embarrassment.” At least one of Mr. Carson’s predecessors — Shaun Donovan, who served under President Barack Obama — abandoned the idea of replacing the furniture when told it would exceed the statutory price limit, according to two former agency officials. "
906,"MONTREAL — Since arriving back in Montreal after nearly three decades abroad, one of the most striking changes I’ve noticed has been the seeming retreat of the separatist movement here. The younger generation seems far more focused on becoming the Quebecois Steve Jobs than in fomenting revolution. So as I began my Quebec road trip this week in my hometown, I sought out Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, a charismatic young proponent of Quebec’s independence from Canada. My aim was to try and understand how the movement has evolved since the culture wars of the 1980s, when the province was buffeted by the aftermath of a referendum on independence. Mr. Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc Mélenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 “Maple Spring,” huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty. “Quebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,” he told me on Monday over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the province’s National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire. While he acknowledged that the separatist movement was “not at its peak,” he stressed that about 30 percent to 40 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls. Moreover, he argued that Quebec’s independence would help neutralize the province’s simmering far right by expunging easy nationalism and xenophobia in favor of cultural affirmation and human rights. Having an independent country, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said, would mitigate against fear of the other. "
907,"This week Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced that they will be ending their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, having found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Trump administration. That’s no surprise: The announcement punctuates a process that has been a sham, falling far short of the benchmarks laid out by a bipartisan group of experts (including one of us, Ms. Schneider) last fall for effective, credible congressional investigations. But for those who may be thinking good riddance, think again. Every indication is that this is far from the end of the committee majority’s mischief. All signs instead point to this week’s developments as the beginning of a new chapter in the story, in which House Republicans go on the offensive to support President Trump — and fight the special counsel, Robert Mueller. That likely trajectory emerges from plotting the data points before us. First, the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, attempted to provide cover for President Trump’s false allegation that he was wiretapped by his predecessor. Mr. Nunes met with White House officials in secret and then held news conferences in which he claimed that the outgoing national security adviser, Susan Rice, and her colleagues had wrongly sought to “unmask” (i.e., identify by name) certain Trump associates in surveillance reports. When that effort ran out of steam, Mr. Nunes and the majority shifted their attention to the process by which law enforcement agencies obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorization to conduct electronic monitoring of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The committee released a highly misleading memo claiming that the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice had abused their powers — claims which turned out to be unfounded. Now, with their forthcoming report, the Republicans on the committee have turned their focus to attacking the substance of the Mueller investigation. The special counsel is examining three core issues: Did Russia attack the 2016 elections to aid Mr. Trump; did Mr. Trump or members of his campaign collude with the Russians to do so; and did Mr. Trump or others obstruct the investigation of these matters? The committee majority report, which has yet to be released but which members of the majority have begun to tease out in recent days, is an attempt to defang the first question, finding against all evidence that the Russian attack was not intended to help Mr. Trump (though a few members of the majority, including Representative Trey Gowdy, have been more equivocal). And the majority report endeavors to gut the second question, declaring the absence of collusion altogether. "
908,"BRUSSELS — The operatic ouster of Rex Tillerson leaves a State Department angry and adrift, and a world even more confused about the management and direction of American foreign policy, hoping but not expecting that the change leads to greater coherence in Washington. The angst is being felt especially acutely among European leaders. With the back-to-back resignation of Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, and the firing of Mr. Tillerson they fear the period of “benign neglect” they have experienced so far from Mr. Trump is over. Mr. Tillerson was roundly criticized by a much-demoralized diplomatic corps, accused of gutting budgets and staffing levels in a reflection of what many see as a long, downward trajectory of the State Department’s influence. But for allies, in particular, he was also seen as “one of the grown-ups” and a relative voice of reason, even comfort, in comparison with his boss’s brash impulsiveness. Mr. Trump’s move to replace him with Mike Pompeo, who was running the C.I.A., appears part of a forceful shift by the president to surround himself with a more like-minded cast. Mr. Tillerson was reported to have called his boss “a moron.” His successor has been an outspoken Trump supporter. Some expect that the potential alignment of views may usher in greater consistency from the Trump administration, but not necessarily on the positions America’s allies want. "
909,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Cold War-esque clash, a huge fine for stock manipulation, and an ocean voyage to the land of the long white cloud. Here’s what you need to know: • His mind and spirit soared past physical paralysis, making discoveries that changed our understanding of the universe. Tributes are pouring out for Stephen Hawking, the physicist and best-selling author, who died at 76. Our longtime science writer notes in this appraisal that Mr. Hawking “not only overturned our imaginations, he became an icon of mystery, curiosity and determination.” Here’s a recent video of Mr. Hawking speaking of using advanced technology to transcend human limitations. We also collected six cultural moments he inspired and a mix of memorable quotations. Mr. Hawking was beloved around the world, but the respect he commanded in China was, as the BBC put it, in another universe. "
910,"Britain’s expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats over what officials called Russia’s role in the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil echoes the espionage feuds between Washington and Moscow. For both Britain and the United States, such expulsions have their roots in the spying between Russia and the West that has endured since the end of the Cold War. Here is a summary of the best-known expulsions in recent years between the United States and Russia: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered the United States diplomatic mission to reduce its staff by 755 employees in response to American sanctions, including the expulsion of 35 Russian officials, imposed in the final weeks of President Barack Obama’s administration. Mr. Putin had delayed such a move, hoping for an improved relationship under President Trump, “but, judging by everything, if it changes, it will not be soon.” The United States expelled 35 Russian officials, the largest number of diplomats forced to leave since 2001, in retaliation for what American spy agencies said was Russian interference in the presidential election. The United States expelled two Russian diplomats in retaliation for a bizarre episode outside the United States Embassy in Moscow, in which a Russian police officer attacked an American diplomat. Russian television broadcast a short clip of the scuffle and said the American was an undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative who had refused to show identification before entering the embassy. The State Department said the American was an “accredited diplomat” who had been assaulted as part of systematic harassment of American Embassy staff members by the Russian authorities. "
911,"WASHINGTON — President Trump loves big personalities, live television, the stock market and loyalty. In choosing Larry Kudlow, a CNBC television commentator, to serve as the next director of the National Economic Council, he has checked all those boxes. Mr. Kudlow, often clad in a pinstripe suit and colorful tie, is a frequent pundit on the financial news channel where he opines about everything from the economy to the stock market to tax cuts and free trade. He is an unabashed prognosticator who relishes making the kinds of provocative statements that Mr. Trump has turned into an art form. He has lamented “growing government dependency,” touted tax cuts for the wealthy and lavished praise on high-flying corporate executives. Mr. Kudlow will assume the role of Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, replacing Gary D. Cohn, who said he would resign after losing a battle over the president’s longstanding desire to impose large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that Mr. Kudlow had been offered the job and that the administration would “work to have an orderly transition.” The decision to pick Mr. Kudlow, a longtime cheerleader of the president, is the latest move by Mr. Trump to surround himself with loyalists in high administrative posts. On Monday, Mr. Trump ousted Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state and said he would nominate the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, to take his place. As with the Pompeo announcement, which took Mr. Tillerson and some others in the administration by surprise, Mr. Kudlow’s selection startled some in the West Wing, who were unaware it was happening. In an interview on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Kudlow said Mr. Trump had called him Tuesday night and offered the job, which he had immediately agreed to take. “I knew I was the guy because he offered it last night and I accepted,” Mr. Kudlow said. The White House had not expected to announce his hiring until Thursday or Friday, Mr. Kudlow said, but by Wednesday morning, news of his likely naming was widespread, and then “the deluge came.” Mr. Kudlow, who has publicly criticized the president’s recently announced tariff plans, said Mr. Trump had a more nuanced view on trade than many people understood. “He regards himself as a free trader,” Mr. Kudlow said. “He does not like to create obstacles, like tariffs. But he also has to protect the U.S. And he feels that many countries” have engaged in unfair trade practices. Mr. Kudlow cited China as a prominent example, expressing a view that is widely held within the administration. The White House has taken a series of steps to curb China and is expected to announce tariffs on certain Chinese products in the coming weeks. Mr. Kudlow has long espoused a traditional conservative embrace of free trade, but it remains to be seen how vocally he will push back on the growing ascendance of West Wing advisers who are trade skeptics and have urged Mr. Trump to adopt protectionist measures to protect American industry. Stock markets, which have been rattled by the White House tariffs, did not react positively to news of Mr. Kudlow’s appointment on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 200 points for most of the afternoon, once news media outlets began reporting Mr. Kudlow was the pick. Mr. Kudlow is a radio and television commentator and an economics consultant. He was a zealous convert to the supply-side economic policies that swept the Republican Party in the late 1970s. He is a protégé of the supply-side economist Arthur Laffer, with whom Mr. Kudlow worked on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign. Mr. Kudlow went on to serve in Mr. Reagan’s Office of Management and Budget. Like many past National Economic Council directors, he is not an academically trained economist — he studied for a master’s degree at Princeton University but did not earn one — but he served as chief economist for Bear Stearns and made a name advising prominent conservative politicians. In the early 1990s, Mr. Kudlow took a leave from the firm to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addiction; his colleagues said he abused cocaine. Mr. Kudlow has spoken frequently about his addiction and ensuing sobriety in the ensuing years. He said Thursday that staying clean and sober for nearly 23 years “is the center of my life” and “my No. 1 job.” Asked whether he thought the substance abuse could prove problematic for him as a White House staff nominee, he said, “We’ll see how that plays out.” Mr. Kudlow was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Trump’s run for the presidency, advising the neophyte candidate on economic issues and pushing him to go big on cutting taxes. The men agreed on their desire for growth-goosing tax cuts but disagreed on trade, on which Mr. Trump ran as a populist and Mr. Kudlow preached free-market principles. Mr. Kudlow criticized the president after the emergence of the “Access Hollywood” tape in October 2016. He later re-endorsed him, but Mr. Trump, who nurses grudges, was angry for some time, according to people close to him. The trade critique carried into Mr. Trump’s tenure in the White House. Like Mr. Cohn, Mr. Kudlow had been publicly critical of Mr. Trump’s push for stiff and sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. He jointly wrote a critical column urging the president to reconsider his plan to impose tariffs. “Trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs,” he and his co-authors wrote, “because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always deliver an unhappy ending.” Mr. Kudlow said Wednesday that although he had little stomach for blanket tariffs, he was “absolutely delighted” that Mr. Trump had softened his stance since first announcing global tariffs on steel and aluminum. “We talked a lot about that,” Mr. Kudlow said, adding that Mr. Trump “regards tariffs as a negotiating tool. And I think that’s fair.” Mr. Trump indicated on Tuesday that he saw little disagreement with Mr. Kudlow on the issue of tariffs. “I want to have a divergent opinion,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “We agree on most. He now has come around to believing in tariffs as also a negotiating point. I’m renegotiating trade deals and without tariffs we wouldn’t do nearly as well. But Larry has been a friend of mine for a long time. He backed me very early in the campaign; I think the earliest; I think he was one of my original backers. He’s a very, very talented man, a good man.” It remains to be seen whether Mr. Kudlow can navigate the chaos that has surrounded the White House and often clouded its message or if he can convince Mr. Trump to follow his advice. Mr. Kudlow said he plans to try. “I expect to have a very disciplined process,” he said, one that “provides the best policy advice possible to the president.” Stephen Moore, a longtime friend of Mr. Kudlow’s and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, said Mr. Kudlow would help with a pressing challenge: How to convince voters to credit the president, and his policies, for an improving economy. Surveys of businesses and voters show economic confidence is strong, but Mr. Trump’s approval ratings are still hovering around 40 percent. “The communication of all these triumphs has not been fully communicated,” said Mr. Moore, whom many expect to ultimately go to work with Mr. Kudlow at the N.E.C. After Republicans pushed a $1.5 trillion cut through Congress late last year, Mr. Kudlow praised it effusively, predicting it would usher in long-term annual growth of 3 percent to 4 percent — a more optimistic assessment than most independent economists have offered — and would help Republicans in this year’s midterm elections. Gene Sperling, a former N.E.C. director under President Bill Clinton and again under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Kudlow would have a difficult job — and that communicating happy economic news was the least of his tasks. “The fundamental job of the N.E.C. director is to ensure that the president is getting, in a fair way, the diverse advice of his economic cabinet, and to be the top economic person in the West Wing in advising the president on day by day and long term matters,” Mr. Sperling said. “However good Larry may be on TV, it would be very, very sad if the president looked at this job as fundamentally promoting with the media whatever the president’s political interests are.” "
912,"The title of Yascha Mounk’s new book, “The People vs. Democracy,” makes clever use of what looks like a glaring oxymoron: After all, what is democracy if not rule by the people? When democracy is under siege, the belligerents are supposed to be dictators, oligarchs and autocrats; the people are supposed to be the guardians (if all goes well), or else the victims (if it doesn’t). But that’s just the delusions of liberal democracy talking. Mounk, who lectures on political theory at Harvard and builds on the important work of scholars like Jan-Werner Müller and Cas Mudde, shows how populist insurgencies can undermine democracy — in the long run, that is. At first, populist movements often present themselves as deeply, even radically, democratic. The 2016 Brexit referendum is a case in point. Inviting citizens to vote on such an enormous policy change was a simple enactment of direct democracy. Those who voted for Britain to leave the European Union declared they were wresting autonomy away from the bureaucratic clutches of an unresponsive, Brussels-based elite. A characteristic slogan of the pro-Brexit campaign was “Take Back Control.” Much of this rhetoric baldly exploited anti-immigrant bigotry — a classic tactic in the populist playbook. For all that populists purport to champion the will of the people, their definition of the people is often restrictive and “deeply illiberal,” Mounk writes, if not downright exclusionary. They also rail against institutions that circumscribe what they deem to be the popular will: “They openly say that neither independent institutions nor individual rights should dampen the people’s voice.” Which is what makes populism ultimately inimical to liberal democracy, and what allows Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, to say he is building an “illiberal new state based on national foundations” while maintaining his popular support. Notice how far we’ve gotten without a mention of you-know-who, the chief populist of the United States. He’s included in “The People vs. Democracy,” as he should be, but one of the many things to recommend this clarifying book is its international scope. As much as Donald J. Trump might fancy himself one of a kind, Mounk argues that the American president is part of a global wave. Populist forces are surging in Britain, Germany, Italy and France; in places like Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey and Poland they have already settled in, set up house and gotten around to the next step: gutting institutional safeguards in order to shore up their rule. Political scientists like Mounk talk about norms and institutions with a kind of reverence that can seem puzzling to non-scholars and non-wonks. But institutions are what allow people, whose experiences and interests differ and diverge, to live together in a democratic system. Whether entrusted with regulating banks or protecting civil rights or enforcing term limits, “liberal institutions are, in the long run, needed for democracy to survive.” "
913,"To the Editor: Re “Tillerson Ousted as Trump Silences Dissent in Cabinet” (front page, March 14): It has been nearly a year and a half since Donald Trump became president, and only now is he assembling a cabinet he wants? That shows once again his abysmal and unprecedented unpreparedness for the office. After Stephen Bannon was fired, and then seemingly apolitical John Kelly made chief of staff, it appeared that Mr. Trump wanted to govern more from the center. But now, with the apparent declining influence of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the departures of Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn, and the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state, it seems that while Mr. Bannon left in disgrace, his ideology has taken hold in Mr. Trump’s mind and government. JAMES ADLER, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: As a former superintendent of schools and executive director of a professional association, I know how difficult it is to fire someone face to face. So I understand why President Trump decided to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter instead of meeting with him. Understanding, however, does not equate to justification. Nobody deserves to find out via a tweet that he has lost his job just because his boss does not have the courage to deliver the news in person. The president enjoys giving bellicose speeches that attempt to bully others into doing what he wants them to do. Like many bullies, however, Mr. Trump runs away from situations in which he has to actually display courage with actions instead of just words. JOSEPH J. CIRASUOLO

914,"An article about an Ohio man who has avoided political news since the election of Donald Trump caused a stir among readers, who expressed mixed opinions over the story’s subject, Erik Hagerman. Some criticized what they considered a sense of privilege while others lauded him as a modern day Henry David Thoreau. The story also hit a chord with journalists. Tyler Buchanan, the editor of The Athens Messenger, Mr. Hagerman’s local newspaper, said he was rattled by Mr. Hagerman’s decision to remain uninformed. Another journalist called Mr. Hagerman “the most selfish man in America” while another criticized his “willful ignorance.” Mr. Hagerman may never know how people reacted to his experiment because he does not read The New York Times or use social media. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and best-selling author, tweeted that Mr. Hagerman, whom he called one of his “best friends from back home,” received a copy of the article to read, with current events redacted. Below is a selection of the comments from the article. I am an African-American openly gay man. Such a sealed off life is not even an option for me or those like me. I suppose on some level I may harbor some deep-seated envy of this choice to retreat. Only a man of privilege — and a white man — can remove himself in this way. Those of us for whom existence means fending off onslaughts to our fundamental humanity can afford to not know and prepare for the latest threats. Our lives — almost always under siege in some way — also move us to protect and bond with those similarly situated, and we are obligated to protect them as they in turn inform themselves and take action to protect us. It would also be an abdication of responsibility to be a good citizen — to be informed and to work to make life better for others. — Riley Temple, Washington, D.C. Whatever judgment I would pass on Mr. Hagerman is the same judgment I would pass on people who retreat from the world into their own political bubbles. That goes for those on the left and the right. I appreciate his approach more than any of them. — Jeff Perkins, Iowa Mr. Hagerman can hide from Trumpism only because he is wealthy and white. Lack of engagement might make him feel healthier, but it doesn’t absolve him of responsibility in democracy. I can’t think of one historical example that ended well when citizens of privilege chose to ignore politics. — Tess, San Jose, Calif. Not many people can disconnect from their phones for even just ten minutes. We have become sheep, being led around by marketers and pundits. This man is totally unique and an inspiration to many who would like to be able to do what he is doing: being his own person. — Dee, Los Angeles Honestly, there are times that I wish I could do the same. But I can’t. Being a grandfather, I am sick worried that my children and my grandson will be badly hurt from the decisions that are made in the White House. I am old enough and realistic enough to know that my views, expressed here and elsewhere, most probably won’t change anyone’s mind about anything. But, I see that as a way to feel that I am not alone, but connected to the rest of humanity. — Eddie B., Toronto If this guy is successful with his plan and ultimately donates the restored land to his local community as his own “Walden Pond” project, I daresay his contribution will be much more meaningful and long-lasting than if he spent his days stressed out and yelling at a TV screen. Good for him. That said, if we all did that, this country would be in more serious trouble than it already is. But it’s nice to know that there are people out there doing other things besides being held hostage by the current horrors of the daily news cycle. A reminder that life goes on, I guess, sometimes in spite of us. — WesternMass, The Berkshires I’m a native of Athens County, where Mr. Hagerman resides. On Nov. 8, 2016, I knocked on doors in the Glouster area. I might’ve even knocked on his, who knows. Many of his neighbors voted for Donald Trump, while others didn’t bother voting at all. Some of them didn’t have rides to the church that served as their polling location (though we did offer to drive them). I don’t fault them for not participating in a system that did not appear to acknowledge their existence. But I think about Mr. Hagerman, and the resources available to him. And how he chooses to squander them on personal comfort. In the same situation, I don’t think his neighbors would do the same. — Emily, Columbus, Ohio Mr. Hagerman is not alone. My wife has blockaded all political news since Election Day as well. However, she does have a vague sense of nonpolitical news. She does follow Facebook but has several kinds of blocks on her computer to keep the content politics free. It isn’t that hard to do. She just changes the subject t if politics come up. Part of her reasoning is that as a senior she may not live long enough to see things turn around. She can’t fix anything so there seems to be no point in being stressed all the time. — Franklin Khedouri, Scottsdale, Ariz. "

916,"WASHINGTON — For the Democratic Party, Conor Lamb seemed like a candidate generated from reams of election data mined and analyzed to produce an ideal fit for his Southwestern Pennsylvania congressional district. A former Marine who favored gun rights, he was culturally conservative enough to appeal to rural voters. He was pro labor and pro tariff in an area that still has thousands of steelworkers union members. As a federal prosecutor, he cracked down on drug dealers but also offered empathy about the tragedy of opioid addiction. And his Ivy League polish and earnest manner played well with college-educated suburban voters. And now, with his victory in a district so Republican that Democrats did not even field a candidate in the last two elections, Mr. Lamb, 33, has offered a template that will be studied in congressional races where Democratic candidates need to win over voters who supported President Trump. “He is like the type of Democrat that won in ruby-red districts in 2006, who breaks the mold and is much more of a nontraditional, outside-the-mainstream, everyday American law enforcement type,” said John Lapp, a Democratic strategist who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006, when the party wrested control of the House from Republicans. Mr. Lamb had to navigate a district that President Trump had won by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. The president labeled him “Lamb the sham” in a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania last Saturday, and the administration deployed Vice President Mike Pence, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, and Donald Trump Jr. to defeat him. "
917,"Conor Lamb, a Democrat and former Marine, scored a razor-thin but extraordinary upset in a special House election in southwestern Pennsylvania after a few thousand absentee ballots cemented a Democratic victory in the heart of President Trump’s Rust Belt base. The Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, may still contest the outcome. But Mr. Lamb’s 627-vote lead Wednesday afternoon appeared insurmountable, given that the four counties in Pennsylvania’s 18th district have about 500 provisional, military and other absentee ballots left to count, election officials said. That slim margin — out of almost 230,000 ballots cast in a district that Mr. Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016 — nonetheless upended the political landscape ahead of November’s midterm elections. It also emboldened Democrats to run maverick campaigns even in deep-red areas where Republicans remain bedeviled by Mr. Trump’s unpopularity. Republican officials in Washington said they were likely to demand a recount through litigation, and the National Republican Congressional Committee put out a call for voters to report any irregularities in the balloting. Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the committee, said the party was “not conceding anything.” The battle for a district in suburban and rural areas around Pittsburgh underscored the degree to which Mr. Trump’s appeal has receded across the country. And it exposed the ways in which both parties are weighed down by divisive leaders: Democrats by Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader; Republicans by Mr. Trump and Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House. Just as vividly, the race showed that only one party — the Democrats — appears willing to grapple with the implications of campaigning under its unpopular figurehead. "
918,"President Trump’s decision to block a foreign company’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones and other devices, before the deal had even been signed, was extraordinary. It was also the right move, given the series of mergers that has left the semiconductor industry already dominated by a few large companies. Singapore-based Broadcom was trying to acquire Qualcomm, headquartered in San Diego, for $117 billion — which would have made it the largest technology deal in history — in a hostile takeover. Mr. Trump pre-emptively blocked the purchase on Monday, citing national security concerns. While the president did not provide a detailed rationale, a March 5 letter from the Treasury Department calling for a review of the deal said that the administration was concerned about Broadcom’s relationships with other foreign companies. The letter strongly hinted that those companies of interest are based in China. It also noted that Broadcom has reduced spending on research and development at the businesses it acquires, a practice that could make Qualcomm less innovative. That, in turn, would give Chinese businesses a leg up in the race to develop the technology for the next generation of cellphones, known as 5G, which is expected to provide faster internet access and generate billions of dollars in profits for the wireless industry in the coming years. Seen against the backdrop of the president’s protectionist statements and policies, this decision is unnerving. He recently used another national security law to announce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, arguing that he was seeking to force China to reduce excess production of those metals. In reality those tariffs will not hurt China much, landing a heavier blow on American allies like the European Union, Brazil and South Korea and possibly starting a wider trade war as other countries retaliate against the United States. That is why some experts fear that by blocking the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, Mr. Trump could further rattle the global economy and international norms. Other countries might now feel emboldened to block as a security threat inbound foreign investment that they consider significant, justifiably or not. France and other countries have a history of protecting companies they consider “national champions,” but the United States has been reluctant to do so. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is made up of representatives from across the executive branch, looks at acquisitions that could represent a national security problem, but its reviews typically end up scuttling only a few deals annually, though the number has increased in recent years. Because the committee does most of its work in secret, it is hard to know if it is making the right calls. But in this case, the ultimate outcome was correct because the potential takeover raised serious antitrust concerns. There are good reasons to worry about the growing concentration of power — and lack of competition — in the semiconductor business, which supplies chips used in everything from phones and computers to cars and fighter jets. If the Broadcom-Qualcomm merger had gone through, just three companies — Samsung, Intel and Broadcom — would have controlled more than 36 percent of the global market for chips, according to Gartner. And the concentration would have been far greater in certain fields, like telecommunications. As the number of players in the industry shrinks, innovation tends to decline because companies have less reason to worry about losing business to competitors. And they have a bigger incentive to milk profits by raising prices on existing products, which are often protected by patents that in the United States typically give inventors a 20-year monopoly over their creations. Such arguments would typically arise during antitrust reviews by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, but they are also important to national security. That’s because the government is heavily dependent on private companies like Qualcomm, which got its start in the 1980s by developing communications systems for the military. Broadcom being based in Singapore provided the Trump administration an easy way to block this deal. But even if it had been an American company, this acquisition would have been a hard sell. "

921,"ST. LOUIS — Amid all the turmoil and uncertainty, with his White House seemingly fraying, his legislative agenda stalled and his electoral base in danger, President Trump these days finds one area of comfort: talking about his tax cuts. He finds it so reassuring, in fact, that he is increasingly talking about doing it all over again. Mr. Trump came here to red-state Middle America on Wednesday to promote the economic benefits of the $1.5 trillion in tax breaks he signed in December, surrounding himself with workers and business owners who celebrated the prospect of more money in their pockets. As he basked in the praise, the president promised that he was not done. “We’re now going for a Phase 2,” he told a selected group of supporters at a Boeing factory in St. Louis. He did not describe what would be in such a Phase 2 but said he would team up with Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “It’s going to be something very special. Kevin Brady’s working on it with me.” Mr. Brady said earlier in the day that he hoped to pass another tax-cutting bill by the end of the year. “We’re really encouraged,” he said on Fox Business Network. “Main Street optimism is at record levels. Our economy is really gaining momentum and booming in a big way. But look, we think even more can be done. We want to make sure that we’re encouraging innovation in America. We want to help families save for the long term.” If Mr. Trump had a plan in mind, it was a mystery to many of his aides, who knew nothing about it. What Mr. Trump and Mr. Brady might be talking about, however, could be more of a branding exercise than a major legislative effort that stands any chance of becoming law this year. The effort they are calling “Phase 2” appears to unify two lingering problems from the tax cut bill that Republicans sped through Congress late last year. In both cases, fixing them would require support from Senate Democrats, who are not inclined to lend any backing to a tax bill that they opposed and that was passed over their objections. One problem is that tax cuts for individuals are set to expire at the end of 2025. That is a byproduct of the budget reconciliation process that Republicans employed to pass the bill without Democratic support. To comply with rules against increasing budget deficits after 10 years, Republicans made the individual cuts temporary. Mr. Brady alluded to that on Wednesday. “While the tax cuts for families were long term, they’re not yet permanent,” he said. “So we’re going to address issues like that, and we’re in discussions with the White House, with the president about this issue.” A second issue, which Mr. Brady also addressed, is the host of legislative ambiguities and hiccups that companies and accountants have discovered in the law since it was passed. Those include the so-called grain glitch, which inadvertently gave an advantage to agricultural cooperatives over other, independent businesses that farmers might sell to, and a provision that diminishes the tax benefits from renovating restaurants. Senate leaders have discussed fixing the grain glitch in a coming spending bill. But a Republican Senate aide said there was little optimism for Congress pushing another stand-alone tax package this year. Mr. Trump’s interest in repeating his tax cut success may not be surprising given the validation he received at the Boeing plant here. Bonnie Brazzeal, who works in the cafeteria at the College of the Ozarks, choked up when she told the president that she received a bonus from her employer as a result of the tax cut. “I am very grateful for the bonus when the college gave it to us,” Ms. Brazzeal said. “I put mine in my savings for retirement.” She then wiped away tears. Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, attributed the company’s strong performance to Mr. Trump. “What you see is your leadership on tax reform and creating jobs,” Mr. Muilenburg said. “There’s no place that’s more evident than the factories of America, and you can see it here.” Mr. Trump said that when it came to the economy, there was more to come. “I don’t see any downward movement,” he said. “I see just up.” "
922,"A decade after the federal government rescued the first of many faltering financial firms, the Senate voted on Wednesday to pass legislation that would relax restrictions on large parts of the banking industry, representing the most significant changes to the rules that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. In a rare showing of bipartisanship, the Senate voted 67 to 31 to pass the bill, which is intended to help small- and medium-size banks but which critics say is a dangerous rollback of financial regulations intended to prevent another meltdown. The legislation faces an uncertain fate going forward, as House Republicans are expected to push for a much more expansive rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Senate Democrats who voted for the bill that passed on Wednesday have insisted that major changes along the lines of what the House passed last year will sink the effort but expressed hope that the legislation could herald a return to the kind of cooperation that has recently eluded Congress. “This legislative package is an example of what we can achieve by working together and shows Democrats and Republicans can break the gridlock,” said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. The bill, which the Senate Banking Committee drafted over several years, would let hundreds of smaller banks avoid some federal oversight such as stress tests, which measure a bank’s ability to weather an economic downturn. Banks with $50 billion of assets are currently considered “systemically important” and are governed by more stringent regulations. The Senate bill raises that threshold to $250 billion, leaving only a handful of the biggest banks facing the toughest oversight. The bill also exempts firms with less than $10 billion in assets from the so-called Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making risky bets with federally guaranteed deposits. Mortgage rules for small lenders would also be eased, and midsize banks like SunTrust, P.N.C. and Regions would be substantially relieved of strict regulation. “This bill is an important step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks, and it will allow financial institutions to better serve their customers and communities while maintaining safety and soundness,” said Rob Nichols, the president of the American Bankers Association. Big banks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase aggressively lobbied to tuck in provisions that would be beneficial to Wall Street, but there has been little bipartisan appetite to change the regulatory infrastructure that governs the largest financial institutions in the country. Unlike the House bill, the legislation would not touch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a longtime target of Republican lawmakers who view it as an unaccountable agency with too much power. Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, suggested this month that he did not expect his colleagues to just rubber-stamp the legislation that passed the Senate and that there would be changes to a final bill. More than a dozen Senate Democrats, several of whom are facing tough re-election contests in states that President Trump won in 2016, backed the banking bill despite public criticism from members of the progressive wing of the party. They have said that they hope to avoid a conference process with the House that could lead to changes that they would find unacceptable. “If the House overreaches in its effort to amend the Crapo bill, it could slow down the bill’s progress,” said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the financial services firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, referring to Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, who is a sponsor of the measure. The passage of the bill in the Senate has exposed deep rifts in the Democratic Party, with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts publicly clashing with colleagues like Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota over what she calls the “Bank Lobbyist Act.” “What does it say about Washington that Republicans and Democrats can’t come together to support common sense gun reforms or solutions for working families — but can come together to deregulate big banks on the 10th anniversary of the start of the 2008 financial crisis?” Ms. Warren said Wednesday. Ms. Warren pointed to a Congressional Budget Office report this month that analyzed the bill and concluded that it could increase the likelihood of failure for a bank or credit union. The measure has put Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader who voted against it, in the difficult position of mediating the split in his party after more than a year of holding a united front against Mr. Trump. However, before the midterm elections in November, he has given conservative-state Democrats leeway to vote as they see fit and has urged progressives in the party to tread lightly when criticizing moderates. But the dissension in the party has spilled into public view. In an interview with The Atlantic this week, Ms. Heitkamp shot back at Ms. Warren. “I think people in North Dakota don’t care what Elizabeth Warren thinks,” Ms. Heitkamp said. With the passage of the bill, the onus will now be on House Republicans to decide whether to push for more sweeping changes that will appeal to their base or settle for modest adjustments to Dodd-Frank that have a chance of passing and getting to the president’s desk for his signature. Last year, the House Republicans passed the Choice Act, which would have gutted Dodd-Frank, in a party-line vote. But the bill was considered dead on arrival in the Senate. Pressure to send something to the president’s desk will be great, as the White House expressed support for the Senate bill and urged Congress to forge ahead in hopes of scoring another legislative achievement after last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut. Although Mr. Trump promised to do a “big number” and dismantle Dodd-Frank, the relatively modest bill that cleared the Senate on Wednesday may have to suffice. “The president looks forward to discussing any further revisions the House is interested in making, with the goal of bipartisan, pro-growth Dodd-Frank relief reaching his desk as soon as possible,” the White House said in a statement on Wednesday. "
923,"Dear Career Counselor, My grandson just graduated from college and is having a terrible time finding work. I was wondering if he would qualify for a job with the White House. I hear there’s lots of turnover. Is secretary of state still available? Or what about the young man who carried around extra pens for the president? Didn’t he just get fired? — Ambitious Grandmother Dear Grandmother, Good thinking! About a third of the top jobs in the Trump administration are still wide open, and while they usually aren’t the kind of things that go to 21-year-olds, most of the people who are actually qualified wouldn’t touch them with a 10-foot résumé. Secretary of state seems to be off the table for the moment. But there’s definitely an opening for personal assistant to the president — that’s the guy with the pens. The previous incumbent, John McEntee, was escorted off the White House grounds this week after he failed his long-delayed security clearance — reportedly because of financial issues involving gambling and taxes. There aren’t any specific job requirements, but McEntee did star in a very popular video in which he demonstrated his ability to knock a bottle off a friend’s head with a football. Can your grandson do that? I guess he could practice. But what happens if my grandson goes to work for the White House and then fails a basic background check and gets tossed out the door? Would he ever get employment again? No problem! McEntee, 27, has already been hired as senior adviser for the Trump re-election campaign. This is an administration that believes in failing upward. Dear Career Counselor, I used to be a happy, successful guy with lots of friends and a good job. Then I fell in with the wrong crowd. They gave me heaps of money and told me if I hung out with them, I’d be famous. It was all a lie! They held a big party for me, but their leader talked about himself all night while I stood there like a dopey janitor. Now everybody’s making fun of me! Where do I go from here? — Ruined Rick Dear Rick, Hey, aren’t you the Republican who was running for Congress in that safe seat in Pennsylvania? I saw you at the end of the campaign, claiming Democrats hate God. Lots of luck. Dear Career Counselor, I think my grandmother’s been trying to get me the secretary of state job. Please make her stop. It’s true I got a very high B in my international affairs course, but I don’t want to be tweet-fired! Isn’t there a cushier opening? Did they ever find anybody to be ambassador to South Korea? — Generation Z Dear Z, South Korea is a very sensitive post and you would be crazy to think you can qualify just because Trump hasn’t found a nominee in more than a year. Be realistic. How about ambassador to Ireland or Iceland or Belgium or Jordan or Bolivia? Dear Career Counselor, I have a degree in public relations and I hear you know a lot about getting jobs in Washington. I would like something that’s not boring and is over in time for me to spend the summer with my friends in Boca Raton. — Frat Brat Dear Brat, Consider becoming White House communications director. The job is open and if you get appointed, you should definitely be out by June. The first guy disappeared before Trump was even inaugurated, in the midst of what would have been regarded, in a less lively administration, as a sex scandal. And then there was Mike Dubke, who lasted three months, and Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted 10 days, and Hope Hicks, who quit when her boyfriend, the staff secretary, was accused of spousal abuse. Wow, definitely not boring. And I think they’d like me! I’m way better than some of the people they have now. I would never try to buy a $31,000 dining room set. Really, you can come look at my apartment. Where do I apply?  Well, there are a lot of forms to fill out, but first you should try to find a contact in the administration who can put in a good word for you. Someone in as high a place as possible. As long as it’s not Jeff Sessions. Dear Career Counselor, I am a teacher and I’m beginning to think I have a moral obligation to volunteer to become secretary of education. Really, I’d much rather stick with the fourth grade, but this just can’t go on. Without being boastful, I’m pretty sure I would be way better than Betsy DeVos. For instance, I have visited underachieving schools. And I would never sit on national television grinning like an idiot and claiming you can’t talk about school quality because “schools are made up of individual students.” What has she got that I don’t have? — Brenda at the Blackboard Dear Brenda, A father-in-law worth $5.4 billion. "
924,"The nearly 17-year-old Afghanistan conflict, the longest war in United States history, will not end on the battlefield. It can be resolved only at the negotiating table. So, the bold offer last month from President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan to negotiate with the Taliban “without preconditions” is a welcome initiative. But it faces daunting obstacles. Mr. Ghani’s proposal envisions an outcome in which the Taliban would be recognized as a legitimate political party, prisoners would be released and United Nations sanctions against the group would be lifted. In exchange, the Taliban would have to recognize the Afghan government and respect the rule of law, including women’s rights. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, during a surprise visit to Afghanistan this week, said there was evidence that some Taliban factions are interested in talks. The Taliban have not responded formally to Mr. Ghani’s proposal, but in the past they have refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, which they deem an American puppet. Instead, the Taliban have insisted on direct talks with the United States that exclude the Kabul government, as a way to discredit it. The United States has long supported an Afghan-led peace process, in which Washington might play a role but would not stand in for the Afghan government. Assuming the Taliban refuse Mr. Ghani’s offer, it’s timely to ask: Is there an alternative to an indefinite United States military presence in Afghanistan? The fact is the Taliban remain strong, controlling or contesting over a third of the country. Their share continues to grow slowly, despite persistent Afghan and American efforts to weaken them. The early Obama-era surge to 100,000 United States troops, plus the infusion of an additional 40,000 troops from NATO nations, did not defeat or even permanently debilitate the Taliban. Late in his administration, President Barack Obama drew down American troops to below 10,000 and focused the mission squarely on counterterrorism, fighting Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, while providing only training, advice and assistance to Afghan forces fighting the Taliban. He ultimately ordered a deadly 2016 strike against the Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, in the hope that his removal would substantially weaken the Taliban. It did not. "
925,"BETHEL PARK, Pa. — There is the straightforward story about what happened on Tuesday in Western Pennsylvania: Another election in the Trump era, another surprising Democratic performance in the suburbs, this one in the affluent, but staunchly Republican townships south of Pittsburgh. But there is also a more refined account, one shared by the Trump lovers at Bob’s Diner and the Trump loathers at the Panera Bread down the road: Anti-Trump motivation is abundant, but in close races, candidates still matter. “I don’t have enough curse words to describe our current president,” said Paul Cohen, 74, a retired insurance broker eating lunch with his wife at Panera. But, he said, “I’m not necessarily a liberal. And to find a Democrat running as a centrist immediately got my attention.” This is a safe description of Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate who on Wednesday claimed a razor-thin victory over the Republican candidate, State Representative Rick Saccone, in a special congressional election. Mr. Lamb — moderate on gun control, personally disapproving of abortion but against stricter bans and supportive of Mr. Trump’s plan to put tariffs on steel and aluminum — seemed a particularly good fit for this generally conservative district. “His positions were more Republican than Democrat,” said Deb Vosel, 62, a retired nurse sitting with her husband at Bob’s Diner. She knows plenty of people who voted for Mr. Trump and almost no one who regretted it. Many of the same people, she said, voted for Mr. Lamb. “In this neck of the woods,” she said, “people judge people on their merits.” As simple as that sounds, it should not detract from Mr. Lamb’s feat. The 18th Congressional District runs from the rural southwest corner of the state, a blue-collar wedge of gas fields and coal mines, up to the middle- and upper-class Pittsburgh suburbs, a mix of dependably Democratic communities and Republican strongholds. "
926,"In a “Meet the Press” interview on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin shrugged off questions about President Trump’s incendiary tweets, personal insults and vulgar language. Mr. Mnuchin suggested that he was above riffraff talk. “I think you should be focused on what the policies are,” he told the show’s host, Chuck Todd. His words sounded high-minded, but they rang hollow. Mr. Mnuchin, who has milked taxpayers so that he and his wife can travel in style, might benefit from a refresher course in the axiom that character is destiny. It’s an idea that has been around for a couple of thousand years, and for good reason: It’s inherently true. This brings us to Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor, who also once seemed to give that concept short shrift. “I do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals,” he said. “It is about ideas, the public good and doing what is best for the state of New York.” That was on March 10, 2008, a few days before Mr. Spitzer was forced to resign as governor amid revelations that he’d been a frequent patron of a prostitution ring. His hypocrisy was manifest, given how he had proclaimed himself an implacable foe of the sex trade because it exploited women. Character, meet your destiny. This week, the 10th anniversary of his resignation, news organizations have resurrected the scandal, exploring how it rapidly unfolded and offering where-are-they-now profiles of key figures. Mr. Spitzer, now 58, has taken control of his family’s real-estate business. After an unsuccessful run for city comptroller five years ago, he’s not through with politics so much as politics is through with him. Few New Yorkers shed tears over his demise because, in the course of fewer than 15 months as governor, he had alienated many voters and fellow politicians alike with his heedless manner. His fate is worth noting in light of present-day national politics. "

arlier this week, I found myself trying to explain Nippers to my editors in Hong Kong. “It’s this Aussie beach surf lifesaving thing,” I said. “All the kids wear these colorful beanies and go down to the beach early on Sunday, and there’s swimming and running and then there are these boards and …” My description was interrupted by laughter and questions. I could tell from our video conference call that my American editors were a bit confused. And honestly, I could relate. I still recall having no idea what this whole Nippers thing was when we first arrived in Sydney a year ago. Even when I signed up our two children, I didn’t really understand what we were getting ourselves into. But now, as the Nippers season comes to a close, I’m overwhelmed with appreciation. It may take a few more Sundays to figure out exactly why, but there are a few things I greatly admire about Nippers — and perhaps by extension, Australia itself. First and foremost: the encouragement of managed risk, at least with nature. (Culture and business are subjects for another newsletter.) Here, children are not told to avoid the mighty ocean. They’re taught to be safe in it. "
928,"UNITED NATIONS — Britain called an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday to formally accuse Russia of trying to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil with a military-grade nerve agent. The March 4 attack in the British cathedral town of Salisbury was “indiscriminate and reckless,” Ambassador Jonathan Allen said, part of what he suggested was a pattern of Russian misbehavior that had become a threat to international peace and security. He received unequivocal support from his American counterpart, Nikki R. Haley, who, unlike her boss, President Trump, has bluntly rebuked Russia on a range of topics. “Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent,” Ms. Haley said, calling the poisoning “an atrocious crime.” The Security Council session was unusual. Permanent members of the council do not normally accuse one another of what under certain circumstances could be construed as acts of war. The former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on March 4 with what British investigators have identified as Novichok, a potent nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. "

930,"WASHINGTON — Green Berets working with government forces in Niger killed 11 Islamic State militants in a firefight in December, the American military acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday. The battle occurred two months after four United States soldiers died in an ambush in another part of Niger — and after senior commanders had imposed stricter limits on military missions in the West African country. No American or Nigerien forces were harmed in the December gun battle. But the combat — along with at least 10 other previously unreported attacks on American troops in West Africa between 2015 and 2017 — indicates that the deadly Oct. 4 ambush was not an isolated episode in a nation where the United States is building a major drone base. After the ambush, senior officers at United States Africa Command, which oversees American military operations on the continent, imposed additional measures to enhance the safety of troops on missions that were designed to train and advise local forces in Niger. But the missions did not end. On the morning of Dec. 6, a combined force of Nigerien and American troops “came under fire from a formation of violent extremists,” Samantha Reho, a spokeswoman for Africa Command, said in a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday. She said the gun battle killed 11 militants — including two wearing suicide vests — who were believed to be affiliated with the Islamic State in West Africa. No American or Nigerien forces were killed or wounded, she said. It was the first time the American military has acknowledged the December firefight, and Ms. Reho gave no explanation for the Pentagon’s failure to disclose the episode at the time. "

The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump
By Michael Isikoff and David Corn
338 pp. Twelve. $30. It is an article of faith among President Trump’s most ardent detractors that he is a corrupt blowhard catapulted to the office by a devious intelligence operation ordered up by America’s supervillain, the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin. On the other end of the country’s hopelessly splintered political spectrum are those who join Trump in rebutting the idea, often with the caps lock on: “FAKE NEWS!” “NO COLLUSION!” Somewhere in between are those — and let us presume to count among them the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III — who are determined to establish what exactly Russia did to influence the outcome of the presidential election of 2016. For that, it seems, we will have to wait for Mueller’s band of investigators to complete their work. His latest indictment inched ever closer to the Kremlin, targeting 13 Russians, including one close enough to the top to be nicknamed “Putin’s cook,” but still stopped short of implicating the Russian leader or establishing the collusion with Trump’s campaign that critics are certain took place. In the meantime comes “Russian Roulette,” a new book by two veterans of Washington political journalism, Michael Isikoff and David Corn, whose subtitle promises to reveal “the inside story of Putin’s war on America and the election of Donald Trump.” "

936,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand’s foreign ministry censured its second-ranking envoy to the United States on Wednesday after she tweeted that the Democratic Party in America should get its act together “or we will all die.” Caroline Beresford, New Zealand’s deputy high commissioner to the United States, and second in charge to the ambassador, Tim Groser, has since made her Twitter account private, with the news website Newsroom reporting that her tweets had been deleted. Responding to an opinion piece from the politics website The Hill, titled “A Sanders-Warren ticket could win big in 2020,” Ms. Beresford responded on Twitter, “No it couldn’t.” “Please get your” — and here she used an expletive — “together or we will all die,” she wrote. That was apparently in response to the suggestion that two senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, could form a presidential ticket for the 2020 election to defeat President Trump. The two senators are among the most liberal in Congress and have fervent supporters, but some Democrats fear that putting them on a presidential ticket would turn off moderate voters. Minutes before her provocative tweet, Ms. Beresford tweeted about the same article in The Hill, saying of Democrats, “They’ve learned nothing.” A spokesman for New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, said he had been advised of the matter Wednesday, and was “confident the ministry is responding in an appropriate way.” Discussing Ms. Beresford’s acts, New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that there were “very clear expectations of staff” that they “maintain political neutrality and care in expressing personal opinion” when making public comment, and that had “not been met” in this case. “The ministry does not in any way endorse the content or tone of the tweets, which we note were deleted,” a spokeswoman said, adding the ministry was taking “appropriate action.” Ms. Beresford did not respond to a request for comment. She earlier confirmed to the Newsroom website that she had personally sent the tweets, but “realized very quickly that they were inappropriate, which is why I deleted them.” "

It was the answer to a clue in last Friday’s crossword: “Poem greeting the dawn.” (It might also be clued as “morning music,” “Morning song” or “Sunrise song.”) An aubade (pronounced o-BAHD) can also be a musical composition about the morning. Its counterpart, a poem or song about the evening, is a nocturne. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word was first used in 1678 and was adopted by the French from the Spanish word “alba,” meaning sunrise. Ben Zimmer, the language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, noted that “A skim of Google Books shows that aubade appeared chiefly in French sources, or French-English dictionaries, until the early 19th century.” An example of an aubade would be John Donne’s “The Sun Rising,” which, if nothing else, shows that the English poet was clearly not a morning person.

939,"The passage, from a book read three decades back, came to mind not long ago. A tweet-driven tumult was, as usual, roiling Washington. Surly and defiant, President Trump was ensconced in the White House, lashing out like King Lear with a cellphone. The issue of the hour was our policy toward a defiant North Korea, and the president had chosen that moment to boast that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim Jong-un’s — hardly an Achesonian diplomatic strategy. Which doubtless would have pleased, rather than troubled, Trump, who, like Miranda in “The Tempest,” looks upon each day as a “brave new world” that offers him fresh opportunities to star in a global drama of his own direction. Shifting between cable news and my own Twitter feed, I recalled the historian Barbara W. Tuchman’s observation in her 1984 book “The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.” “Wooden-headedness” in statecraft, which she defined as “assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting any contrary signs,” has clearly become a prevailing factor in our politics. As Tuchman wrote, wooden-headedness was best captured in a remark about Philip II of Spain: “No experience of the failure of his policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence.” Why did the Trojans allow the Greek horse within the gates? How did the Renaissance papacy so badly misjudge the moment, accelerating the Protestant Reformation? What could the British ruling class have done differently to keep the American colonies within London’s reach? Who, if anyone, could have prevented Washington’s tragic misadventure in Vietnam? These were Tuchman’s topics, and now, in our own time, we are forced to ponder the why, the how, the what and the who about America in the Age of Trump. “A prince, says Machiavelli,” Tuchman wrote, “ought always to be a great asker and a patient hearer of truth about those things of which he has inquired, and he should be angry if he finds that anyone has scruples about telling him the truth. What government needs is great askers.” To put it mildly, though, the Trump White House seems more “Shark Tank” than Brain Trust. Tuchman’s literary legacy is various and important. She wrote well about many things, including the coming of World War I (“The Guns of August,” a favorite of John F. Kennedy’s, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1963), the Black Plague (“A Distant Mirror”), the Far East (“Stilwell and the American Experience in China”) and the American Revolution (“The First Salute”). There is something notable, though, about “The March of Folly,” a collection of sketches about mature countries getting things woefully wrong. To Tuchman, folly begins with the most fundamental of things: an outsize and self-destructive will to power. Both the governors and the governed can overreach, convinced of their own rectitude and righteousness. “Chief among the forces affecting political folly is lust for power, named by Tacitus as ‘the most flagrant of all the passions,’” Tuchman wrote. “Because it can only be satisfied by power over others, government is its favorite field of exercise,” or what she calls the “paramount area of folly because it is there that men seek power over others — only to lose it over themselves.” In this light, President Trump and his alt-right coterie are not something new under the sun but another chapter in the oldest of human dramas: the tension between appetite and the common good, between ambition and common sense. There is a lesson here not only for the president but for the people — particularly the people who chose to support him in 2016 and who stand with him now, apparently come what may. “Persistence in error is the problem,” Tuchman wrote. One of the more troubling features of popular political life is blind tribal loyalty — the refusal to acknowledge that your chief or your kind could be wrong. A perennial issue, this reflexive defensiveness is especially pronounced at the moment. But the historically literate voter, like a historically literate decision maker, need not be captive to previously held opinions at all times and at any cost. “There is,” Tuchman wrote, “always freedom of choice to change or desist from a counterproductive course if the policy-maker” — or, in my view, the voter — “has the moral courage to exercise it. He is not a fated creature blown by the whims of Homeric gods. Yet to recognize error, to cut losses, to alter course, is the most repugnant option in government.” And in the mind and heart of a fervent voter who was determined to send a message to Washington that business as usual was not working. The question now, more than a year into business as unusual, is whether those who supported the populist insurgency of 2016 will honestly assess its effectiveness in 2018 and in 2020. “Wooden-headedness” in the Oval Office, alas, begins in the voting booth. How do we stop marches of folly? Tuchman was thoughtful on the question, realizing that history was not a panacea. “Whole philosophies have evolved over the question whether the human species is predominately good or evil,” she wrote. “I only know that it is mixed, that you cannot separate good from bad, that wisdom, courage and benevolence exist alongside knavery, greed and stupidity; heroism and fortitude alongside vainglory, cruelty and corruption.” That observation appeared in a 1981 collection of her essays titled “Practicing History.” Perhaps her least known work, it is engaging and wise, and in it she took a proportionate view of the human condition. “Amid a mass of worldwide troubles and a poor record for the 20th century,” Tuchman wrote, “we see our species — with cause — as functioning very badly, as blunderers when not knaves, as violent, ignoble, corrupt, inept, incapable of mastering the forces that threaten us, weakly subject to our worst instincts; in short, decadent.” It was, she argued, an easy, if unhappy, case to make at the time. (As it is now.) “A century that took shape in the disillusion which followed the enormous effort and hopes of World War I,” Tuchman wrote, “that saw revolution in Russia congeal into the same tyranny it overthrew, saw a supposedly civilized nation revert under the Nazis into organized and unparalleled savagery, saw the craven appeasement by the democracies, is understandably marked by suspicion of human nature.” And yet, and yet, there were grounds for hope. History had been, and still was, notable for human discoveries and inventions; for battles to secure and spread liberty; for majestic achievements in art and athletics and architecture. Reflecting on the Middle Ages’ zeal for cathedrals, she quoted an observer: “Who has ever seen or heard tell in times past that powerful princes of the world, that men brought up in honors and wealth, that nobles — men and women — have bent their haughty necks to the harness of carts and, like beasts of burden, have dragged to the abode of Christ these wagons loaded with wines, grains, oil, stones, timber and all that is necessary for the construction of the church?” History, like humanity, defies clinical categorization. There were, she wrote, two ways in which that which came before could teach us lessons. “One is to enable us to avoid past mistakes and to manage better in similar circumstances next time; the other is to enable us to anticipate a future course of events,” Tuchman wrote. Her verdict: “To manage better next time is within our means; to anticipate does not seem to be.” That, at least, may be the beginning of wisdom. "
940,"T
he V.I.P. terminal of Baghdad International Airport is a clean and quiet place, about a quarter-mile removed from the noise and squalor of the main arrivals-and-departures hall. If you have the right connections and $150 — American dollars only — you can wait for your flight in comfort on one of the soft white leather couches, sipping an espresso and getting a close-up view of some of the colorful people who run today’s Middle East. On a typical afternoon, your fellow passengers may include Iranian-trained guerrillas and death-squad veterans who have grown rich on embezzlement. If you stay long enough, gulf oil barons may glide by with their white-robed entourages, perhaps brushing past Iranian Revolutionary Guardsmen in uniform or diplomats from Turkey or Russia, all of them hoping to bully or bribe Iraq’s weak state to their own preferred shape. Everyone is welcome as long as you speak the language of money. On the wall above you are wide-screen TVs and a stylized mural of ancient Iraq, so that you can compare today’s catastrophes with those of yesteryear. Before you leave, a customs official in a dark suit will take your ticket and passport and then return 10 minutes later, smiling obsequiously and extending your stamped documents with both hands. But even here, special treatment has its limits. On April 15 last year, a Qatari man arrived in the V.I.P. terminal on an evening flight from his country’s capital city, Doha. After identifying himself as a senior government envoy, he announced that he and his 14 colleagues, all dressed in crisp white ankle-length tunics called thobes, did not want their luggage inspected. The Qataris had brought 23 identical black duffels, a small peninsula of black nylon that covered a sizable portion of the lounge’s hardwood floor. Each bag was so heavy — well over 100 pounds — that the porters had trouble rolling them into the room. The Iraqis insisted, politely, that all bags must be screened, even in the V.I.P. terminal. The leader of the Qatari team was visibly shocked to hear this. He asked for time. The Qataris huddled for a quiet discussion and then made a number of phone calls. Eventually, they relented and allowed the bags to be screened. Each of them contained stacks of bricklike squares, wrapped in black tape that the scanner could not penetrate. When customs officials asked what was under the tape, the Qataris refused to say. The standoff lasted all night, and finally, near dawn, the exasperated Qataris gave in and drove to Baghdad without their luggage. It was only later that the Iraqis opened the 23 duffels and discovered a mix of dollars and euros, amounting to some $360 million. The bills alone weighed more than 2,500 pounds. A week later, the money still impounded, the Qatari team left Baghdad in the same jet that had brought them. They were now accompanied by two dozen Qataris, including members of the ruling Al Thani family, who had been kidnapped during a hunting trip in southern Iraq 16 months earlier. The story of what happened on that trip has not been reported until now. It entails a ransom deal of staggering size and complexity in which the Qataris paid vast sums to terrorists on both sides of the Middle East’s sectarian divide, fueling the region’s spiraling civil wars. The cost to Qatar wound up far exceeding $360 million, but ultimately cash was less important than the deal’s political dimension. In order to retrieve its hostages, Qatar was made to negotiate a tightly choreographed population exchange in Syria, using the rebel militias it finances to forcibly uproot every resident of four strategically located towns. The transfers advanced Tehran’s larger goal of transforming Syria — along with Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen — into satellite states that will enshrine a dominant Iranian role across the region. The deal was a blow for the Trump administration’s goal of pushing back against Iranian aggression, and for thousands of starving Syrians, it meant being driven into exile by a shadowy agreement, with little say from Syria’s own government. What began as a brazen kidnapping eventually became a measure of the geopolitical forces tearing the Middle East apart, and of their human cost: corruption, sectarian hatred and terrorism. Everyone involved had something to hide — except, perhaps, the hapless hunters who set it all in motion. To Arab falconers, the houbara bustard — a bug-eyed, long-legged creature about the size of a large chicken — is the king of game birds. It is a fast flier with an unusual defense: When cornered, it vomits an oily green substance that can temporarily blind an attacking falcon or hobble its wings. In the days before oil was discovered in the Arabian desert, the houbara’s seasonal return every fall was met with celebratory poetry and long hunts on camelback. The Land Rover made things a lot easier, but chasing the houbara, whose stringy flesh is said to be an aphrodisiac, remains one of the hallowed pursuits — along with thoroughbred stallions, huge yachts and French chateaus — that occupy the minds of Persian Gulf royalty. "
941,     
942,"For the first year of the Trump administration the story was one of containment and constraint. President Trump was constrained ideologically by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, pursuing a conventional Republican agenda on health care and taxes and letting his populist promises hang fire. But more important he was constrained institutionally, in roughly the ways that Republican politicians had promised that he would be — surrounded by a conventional Republican cabinet and (after a while) a conventional White House that essentially governed for him, letting him play the authoritarian on Twitter while the business of the presidency was conducted elsewhere. The problem with this arrangement is that unlike other out-of-the-loop presidents — Richard Nixon at his nadir, Woodrow Wilson after his stroke, Ronald Reagan with a bullet in him — Trump was not actually incapacitated or about to be impeached. He was just, well, Donald Trump: a septuagenarian cable-TV addict ill-suited for the responsibilities of his office but still fully capable of attempting to exercise its powers. Which meant that the containment game had to last, not weeks or months, but three more long years to work. And it may not last that long. From his exciting new steel tariffs to his promised summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, Trump has been acting lately like a man less inclined to listen to his handlers — and now those handlers have begun to disappear. The firing of Rex Tillerson, on the heels of Gary Cohn’s departure about a week ago, evokes the wildly chaotic atmosphere that characterized Trump’s first few months in office. But as my colleague Maggie Haberman tweeted, this time it seems less like something happening to Trump and more like chaos orchestrated from the Oval Office: “The narrative of Trump unglued is not totally wrong but misses the reason why — he was terrified of the job the first six months, and now feels like he has a command of it. So now he is basically saying, ‘I’ve got this, I can make the changes I want.’” In other words, Trump knows that he’s been constrained and tamed — for all I know he might have read my columns, or at least the headlines, saying so — and doesn’t want to play the incapacitated Twitter president anymore. He wants to actually use the office, and not just occupy it — and since he is the president, nobody can stop him from trying. What would Trump becoming a real president mean in practice? In terms of personnel, it might mean that instead of easing out the hacks and cranks and TV personalities, as his staff managed to do during the year of constraint, Trump will begin to usher out his more qualified personnel and replace them with, well, TV personalities — Cohn with Larry Kudlow, perhaps, or H. R. McMaster with John Bolton. But it also promises to further multiply the number of important vacancies within the government, since more true-to-Trump personnel choices would inevitably have some trouble with the confirmation process, which in turn — as Haberman notes — will encourage Trump to take more counsel from the shadow Trumpland of his campaign, where his more misfit-toy advisers tend to congregate. "
943,"At a time when deals between American and Chinese companies are on the rocks, an early example that united a major Wall Street deal maker with the Chinese government has come to an end. China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, has sold its stake in Blackstone Group, the American private equity giant, the latter said in a recent filing. The fund, known as C.I.C., did not disclose a reason for the sale, and neither side disclosed how big it was. The sale ends an 11-year investment that seemed to presage a new era of economic relations between the two countries. It helped Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder, become a major player in business and diplomatic circles between the two countries. That era seems very much over. American officials have taken a harder stance against Chinese money as Chinese buyers have looked to strike deals in sensitive areas like semiconductors and self-driving cars. President Trump’s criticism of China’s trade policies and his new tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum have worsened relations between Washington and Beijing. The souring atmosphere could put Mr. Schwarzman, who serves as an informal economic adviser to Mr. Trump, in a difficult position. Blackstone sought to emphasize its continuing relationship with C.I.C., pointing to money that it said the Chinese company still had in some of its investment funds. “We greatly value our partnership with C.I.C. and are grateful for their successful, long-term investment in our firm,” a Blackstone spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We continue to expand this important relationship as one of C.I.C.’s major asset managers and look forward to working closely together.” "
944,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Rex Tillerson and President Trump never really saw eye to eye. During his 405-day tenure as secretary of state, Mr. Tillerson had favored remaining in the Paris climate accord, preserving the Iran nuclear deal, and undertaking negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis. Those positions put him at odds with the president, on whom Mr. Tillerson was considered a restraining influence. On Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson learned from Twitter that he had been replaced by Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, who more closely aligns with the president’s “America First” worldview. • Looking for a pattern in the many staff changes? Don’t, our chief White House correspondent recommends. “I like conflict,” Mr. Trump said. "

946,"LOS ANGELES — President Trump woke up here in the land of earthquakes on Wednesday morning, but he was 2,500 miles away from the tremor that was really shaking his party. While the president hobnobbed on Tuesday night with wealthy donors in the exclusive enclave of Beverly Park, the voters in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh were in revolt, giving the Democratic candidate a narrow victory in a special election in Pennsylvania that was taking on outsize proportions. Just as they did outside Birmingham and Montgomery, Ala., in December, and Richmond, Va., and Washington in November, energized and angry suburban voters were swamping the Trump stalwarts in the more rural parts of those regions, sending a clear message to Republicans around the country. While Republican turnout in a district that Mr. Trump won in 2016 by 20 percentage points was healthy, Democrats showed again that they could tap unions and other traditionally friendly groups to get their voters out in droves. The N.A.A.C.P. helped win Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s former Alabama Senate seat for Doug Jones in December. Organized labor, once seen as fractured and feckless in the Trump era, gave the Democrat Conor Lamb his edge in Pennsylvania. Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate who wrapped himself in Mr. Trump’s cloak and drew the president to his district last weekend in a bid to rescue a faltering campaign, trailed Mr. Lamb, a former Marine seeking to show his party can compete even in red territory. Mr. Lamb held an apparently insurmountable lead of 641 votes on Wednesday, with about only 500 absentee, provisional and military ballots remaining to be counted, according to county election officials. The victory may yet be contested, but whether Mr. Lamb holds on to officially win the House seat matters less than the fact that he was so competitive in the first place. The rebuke of Mr. Trump came from a part of western Pennsylvania that overwhelmingly supported him in 2016 and that typically would not seem likely to turn to a Democrat. The district was seen as so strongly Republican that the Democrats did not even field a candidate in recent years. And while Mr. Saccone carried the most Trump-supporting counties along the West Virginia border, Mr. Lamb made just enough inroads in those rural areas to give the voters in suburban Allegheny County the chance to deliver the Democrat the slimmest of leads. Rarely shy about weighing in on other news of the day, Mr. Trump made no mention of the race on Wednesday on Twitter or at any public appearance. But during a closed-door fund-raiser outside St. Louis late in the day for Josh Hawley, a Republican running for Senate, Mr. Trump argued that he had helped Mr. Saccone come back from a seven-point deficit to a virtual tie. Moreover, Mr. Trump asserted that Mr. Lamb’s strong showing was really a validation of the popularity of the president’s own policies. “The young man last night that ran, he said, ‘Oh, I’m like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.’ He ran on that basis,” Mr. Trump said, according to The Atlantic, which obtained an audio recording of the event. “He ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, ‘Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.’” While he searched for the best possible interpretation, the stinging message could hardly have been more pointed for a Republican president mired in low approval ratings, burdened by investigations and facing the growing likelihood that Democrats may seize power in the House this year. Mr. Lamb, 33, defied political geography and appeared on the verge of capturing the state’s 18th District despite a torrent of Republican money and Mr. Trump’s personal intervention. At a rally Saturday, Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Lamb as “Lamb the Sham,” promised that Mr. Saccone would “vote for us all the time,” and rambled about his own achievements as he sought to transfer his own political success to the Republican candidate. In the end, none of it seemed to be enough. Democratic enthusiasm appeared to overwhelm a part of the state that has long been a Republican stronghold. For the president, the vote is an ominous echo of Democratic victories in Virginia and Alabama, where his political efforts were shrugged off or counterproductive. The tally was also a blunt rejection of the president’s political calculation that tax cuts and steel tariffs would persuade voters in a region once dominated by the steel industry to embrace the Trump agenda on behalf of Mr. Saccone. “Steel is back,” he repeatedly said at the rally, apparently to little effect. A Republican victory in Pennsylvania might have helped deflect attention from the continuing collapse of the president’s inner circle, which Tuesday included Mr. Trump’s abrupt firing of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the forced resignation of John McEntee, one of Mr. Trump’s closest personal aides, who is under investigation for financial crimes and was marched out of the White House. Instead, Mr. Saccone’s lackluster performance was a grim bookend for a day in which the president’s trip to the Mexico-California border to view wall prototypes was completely overshadowed by the churning turnovers in his national security team. Mr. Trump and Republican Party leaders had desperately sought to head off an outcome that was once thought of as politically impossible. Conservative groups spent more than $10 million in the hopes of defeating Mr. Lamb, who received similar help from Democratic politicians like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. A barrage of Republican advertisements condemned Mr. Lamb as a “Rubber Stamp for Nancy Pelosi,” the Democratic leader in the House. One flier sent to voters showed Mr. Lamb firing an assault weapon, an attempt to weaken the Democrat’s support among liberal voters. A deceptive video purported to show Mr. Lamb in a fight with labor unions. But in recent weeks, polls in Pennsylvania consistently showed Mr. Saccone’s popularity slipping, and Mr. Lamb gaining traction. Visits by Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials did little to buck up the party’s candidate. By the time Mr. Trump arrived in Moon Township, Pa., for the rally, the race had tightened significantly, and many White House and Republican Party officials were already worried that he was lending his support to a lost cause. As it turned out, they may have been right. During the rally, Mr. Trump called Mr. Saccone “an extraordinary person” and dismissed Mr. Lamb as someone who should not be trusted by voters in western Pennsylvania. “The people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lamb because he’s not going to vote for us,” Mr. Trump said. Only after the election did the president pivot to argue that, in fact, Mr. Lamb was something of a quasi supporter. "

But it was still a huge surprise when Mr. Tillerson was fired as secretary of state on Tuesday. Mr. Tillerson was the most persistent advocate of opening diplomatic channels with North Korea — a position that put him publicly at odds with his boss. As Mr. Trump prepares to meet Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, we talk with the man who came closest to a deal with Pyongyang about what the current administration can learn from previous attempts. On today’s episode: • Mark Landler, a White House correspondent at The New York Times. • William Perry, a former secretary of defense and one of the few senior U.S. officials to have negotiated directly with the North Koreans. (We last spoke with Mr. Perry in August. Listen to that interview here.) Background reading: • Mr. Tillerson’s dismissal pulls the White House even closer to the nationalist ideas that animated Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. • Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director who is Mr. Trump’s choice for secretary of state, opposes the nuclear deal with Iran and doubts North Korea will give up its nuclear arsenal through negotiations.

948,"A month ago, hundreds of teenagers ran for their lives from the hallways and classrooms of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and staff had been shot to death. On Wednesday, driven by the conviction that they should never have to run from guns again, they walked. So did their peers. In New York City, in Chicago, in Atlanta and Santa Monica; at Columbine High School and in Newtown, Conn.; and in many more cities and towns, students left school by the hundreds and the thousands at 10 a.m., sometimes in defiance of school authorities, who seemed divided and even flummoxed about how to handle their emptying classrooms. The first major coordinated action of the student-led movement for gun control marshaled the same elements that had defined it ever since the Parkland shooting: eloquent young voices, equipped with symbolism and social media savvy, riding a resolve as yet untouched by cynicism. “We have grown up watching more tragedies occur and continuously asking: Why?” said Kaylee Tyner, a 16-year-old junior at Columbine High School outside Denver, where 13 people were killed in 1999, inaugurating, in the public consciousness, the era of school shootings. “Why does this keep happening?” Even after a year of near continuous protesting — for women, for the environment, for immigrants and more — the emergence of people not even old enough to drive as a political force has been particularly arresting, unsettling a gun control debate that had seemed impervious to other factors.

949,"Broadcom officially withdrew a $117 billion takeover bid for its rival chip maker Qualcomm on Wednesday, two days after President Trump issued an extraordinary order to block the acquisition effort on national security grounds. In a statement, Broadcom said that it would comply with Mr. Trump’s order, formally abandoning what would have been the biggest takeover in the history of the technology industry. Broadcom has nevertheless said it will continue with plans to move its legal headquarters from Singapore to the United States. “Broadcom’s board of directors and management team sincerely appreciate the significant support we received from the Qualcomm and Broadcom stockholders throughout this process,” Broadcom said. Mr. Trump issued his order after a government panel tasked with reviewing the national security implications for business deals disclosed serious concerns about the bid. The panel’s finding was in keeping with the misgivings within the White House about China’s gaining access to important technologies like the nascent wireless standard known as 5G. The move by Mr. Trump was a rare intervention by a president, but under his administration, multiple deals have been quashed after a review by the panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, popularly known as Cfius. Those prospective deals have included the sale of Moneygram to a unit of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and an agreement involving Lattice Semiconductor and an investment firm with reported ties to the Chinese government. Mr. Trump acted despite efforts by Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, to win over the White House, even before the hostile takeover bid was announced. "

951,"LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats on Wednesday over the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil, raising tensions between the two countries to a level not seen since the heights of the Cold War. She vowed to crack down on Russian spies, corrupt elites and ill-gotten wealth in Britain. Her statement to Parliament came after Moscow rejected a British deadline for Russia to explain itself over this month’s attack on the former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter. The two countries have engaged in a worsening clash in recent days, with Britain widening an investigation into the incident and courting friends and allies to increase pressure on Russia, while Moscow has threatened to retaliate over any punitive action. The strident remarks from the British prime minister were a marked departure from the norm for a leader who has faced a litany of domestic and international issues. Mrs. May’s government is consumed with Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, a complex negotiation that it appears to be struggling with. And its closest international ally, the United States, is led by a president who has appeared reluctant to openly criticize Russia. “This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,” Mrs. May said in an address to the House of Commons. “It must therefore be met with a full and robust response.” "

953,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reviewing a recommendation to fire the former F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew G. McCabe, just days before he is scheduled to retire on Sunday, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. McCabe was a frequent target of attack from President Trump, who taunted him both publicly and privately. Mr. McCabe is ensnared in an internal review that includes an examination of his decision in 2016 to allow F.B.I. officials to speak with reporters about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The Justice Department’s inspector general concluded that Mr. McCabe was not forthcoming during the review, according to the people briefed on the matter. That yet-to-be-released report triggered an F.B.I. disciplinary process that recommended his termination — leaving Mr. Sessions to either accept or reverse that decision. Lack of candor is a fireable offense, but like so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe’s fate is also entangled in presidential politics and the special counsel investigation. He was involved from the beginning in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. He is also a potential witness in the inquiry into whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump’s supporters have tried to cast Mr. McCabe as part of a “deep state” that operates in secret to undermine the administration. Mr. Trump has goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against him. Now, Mr. Sessions is the final arbiter of Mr. McCabe’s dismissal, shortly before his retirement takes effect Sunday. Though no decision has been made, people inside the Justice Department expect him to be fired before Friday, a decision that would jeopardize his pension as a 21-year F.B.I. veteran. "
954,"The special election in southwest Pennsylvania garnered national attention for what it could portend for the midterm elections in November. Democratic enthusiasm in the heart of Trump country may have signaled a brewing blue wave in November. But on Wednesday morning, the winner of the House’s 18th district in Pennsylvania was not officially decided. Here’s a look at what’s next for the candidates and the district that President Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. As of Wednesday morning, one small Republican-leaning county was still counting more than 1,000 absentee ballots. Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate, had already claimed victory over Republican Rick Saccone. And House Republicans were talking about a recount and a legal challenge. Under Pennsylvania’s state election law, this type of race does not require an automatic recount, but voters could request one through two different processes over the next week. A recount, however, is unlikely to change the results, because most ballots in the state are cast electronically, said Neil Makhija, a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school and a former Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania’s state house. "
955,"FROM RICK OWENS’S ragged T-shirts and canvas shifts to the giddy ornamentation of Alessandro Michele’s Gucci, all glitz and blitz and reconstituted Elton John costumes, the spring collections appeared to not have a common thread between them — a seemingly bipolar mix of downtrodden, derelict styles and escapist fantasies. Rei Kawakubo’s Boschean excess at Comme des Garçons — clashing Renaissance paintings and Japanese cartoons as prints and reconstituted pileups of tacky plastic children’s toys as headpieces — was a stark contrast to Miuccia Prada’s comic-book-print warrior women and the tatty gewgaws and currency-war patterns of Demna Gvasalia’s Balenciaga collection. There, the idea of luxury was debased and devalued with gaudy dresses, blouses and skintight pant-boot hybrids cut in post-Brexit-inspired euro-note and dollar-bill patterns. So, what is it with fashion at the moment? Designers appear to have assumed a fight-or-flight response to these uncertain times, which, to some — especially those with a flair for the dramatic — look a lot like the end of days. “Fashion is a reflection of the way we live,” said Gvasalia backstage at Balenciaga. “I wanted to create a feeling that something dangerous was going to happen.” He was talking, specifically, about the sturm-und-drang mood at his show, which took place in a blacked-out venue filled with smoke and the boom of ominous trip hop music. The message was less “apocalypse now” and more “apocalypse soon.” Art, literature and film frequently tackle themes of end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it destruction — in 2017 alone, there was the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which felt eerily prophetic; Kara Walker’s towering Goya-esque murals shown at New York’s Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in September, which depicted the unfolding of a modern, racially charged civil war; the artist Jonathan Horowitz’s doctored photo of President Trump playing golf while the sky above him burned; and, even, a sequel to that earlier neon-fizzed end-times nightmare, “Blade Runner.” But apocalyptic naysaying is less frequently found in fashion, an industry that trades on optimism, fantasy and, most importantly, an ability to predict the future. But in moments of great distress, even clothing tends to reflect our troubles. Immediately prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a surfeit of Austrian and Bavarian influences in the industry; in the late ’80s, Black Monday gave way to the rise of a movement dubbed “deconstruction” that originated with the Belgian designer Martin Margiela, whose leitmotif was the unfinished hem and the inside-out seam. His clothes were purposefully made to look poor — because the world suddenly was. It was a volte-face to the excess of the early ’80s, the dancing-on-the-lip-of-the-volcano styles of Christian Lacroix and his archaic indulgences of crinoline pouf skirts and Second Empire extremes. YET THIS SPRING’S fashions, more than in any era in living memory, seem inextricably linked to the times in which we live. They are hysterical, scatterbrained and lunging toward extreme opposites (glittery at Gucci, wasteland-era at Rick Owens) just as global political parties have become more polarized themselves. The collections telegraph post-national, post-history and post-internet ideas — all of which bear individual examination. The post-national is, perhaps, the easiest to connect to culture’s current fixations: Eschewing borders as various governments seek to enforce them, fashion is, in a sense, evoking an aesthetic idyll, a leftist liberal dream in step with most fashion designers’ sensibilities. The post-nationalism of fashion has emerged perhaps in response to the rise of the right wing — not only across America, but in much of Europe, too, where the notion of patriotism has been used as a Trojan Horse for prejudice and white supremacy.

956,"To the Editor: Re “House G.O.P. Closes Inquiry Into Collusion” (front page, March 13): Once again, Republicans have placed party above country and principle. When all the intelligence agencies conclude with “high confidence” that Russia and Vladimir Putin put their fingers on the scale against Hillary Clinton and in favor of Donald Trump in the 2016 election, when the special counsel, Robert Mueller, indicts 13 Russians for having done exactly that, and then the House Intelligence Committee Republicans release a premature report rejecting this conclusion without consulting Democratic committee members, whom do we believe? This is a no-brainer! House Republicans behaved in a partisan manner and therefore have little credibility. With the same raw intelligence data as the F.B.I., the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. and without interviewing all informed parties and gathering all relevant data, the Republicans chose to rally behind their president. They are failing to act as a bipartisan intelligence committee and providing cover for Mr. Trump when Mr. Mueller’s findings are eventually released. Shame on them and shame on all of us if we allow this to continue! RICHARD CHERWITZ, AUSTIN, TEX. "

958,"Happy are the people of the Nordic nations — happier, in fact, than anyone else in the world. And the overall happiness of a country is almost identical to the happiness of its immigrants. Those are the main conclusions of the World Happiness Report 2018, released Wednesday. Finland is the happiest country in the world, it found, followed by Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Australia. Though in a different order, this is the same top 10 as last year, when Norway was No. 1 and Finland was fifth. Burundi and Central African Republic, both consumed by political violence, are the least happy countries for the second year in a row. This year, Central African Republic is slightly happier than Burundi; last year, their order was reversed. As for the United States, it is 18th out of 156 countries surveyed — down four spots from last year’s report and five from 2016’s, and substantially below most comparably wealthy nations. Though the economy is generally strong and per capita income is high, it ranks poorly on social measures: Life expectancy has declined, suicide rates have risen, the opioid crisis has worsened, inequality has grown and confidence in government has fallen. “I think there really is a deep and very unsettling signal coming through that U.S. society is in many ways under profound stress, even though the economy by traditional measures is doing fine,” Jeffrey D. Sachs, an editor of the report, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The trends are not good, and the comparative position of the U.S. relative to other high-income countries is nothing short of alarming.” The report was produced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and edited by three economists: Dr. Sachs, the network’s director and a professor at Columbia University; John F. Helliwell, a senior fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia; and Richard Layard, a director of the Well-Being Program at the London School of Economics’ Center for Economic Performance. It is based on Gallup surveys conducted from 2015 to 2017, in which thousands of respondents were asked to imagine a ladder with steps numbered 0 to 10 and to say which step they felt they stood on, a ranking known as the Cantril Scale.

960,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Conor Lamb, a Democrat, appears to have pulled off a shocking upset in a Pennsylvania congressional election last night. The race is still too close to call. But Lamb has a 641-vote lead over the Republican, Rick Saccone, and the remaining uncounted ballots are absentee ballots, which tend to lean Democratic. It will be a remarkable win if Lamb holds on. Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012 both won this district, in the Pittsburgh area, by almost 20 percentage points. Last night’s result is a sign that, while Trump may be holding onto his base, most voters are unhappy with his presidency. Republicans are looking at a very difficult midterm election. One other point: There’s an ongoing debate, which I’ve covered before, about whether Democrats should focus this year on turning out their base or persuading swing voters. Lamb’s probable win helps answer the question: Both. Democrats appear to have turned out at a much higher rate than Republicans last night, as G. Elliott Morris notes (with handy charts). But Lamb — a populist who is moderate on cultural issues — also clearly won over a bunch of Trump voters, given the district’s conservatism. The 2018 midterm elections are a vital chance to check Trump’s power. They are, as David Remnick wrote this week, a “stress test of liberal democracy.” Given their importance, Democrats shouldn’t get caught up in either-or debates about turnout and persuasion. Rexit. Serve President Trump at your own risk. Just think about how badly Rex Tillerson damaged his reputation over the last 18 months. He went from being the longtime chief executive of one of the world’s biggest companies to suffering Trump’s repeated public humiliations. They culminated in yesterday’s firing by tweet. Elsewhere: In the end, the leader Tillerson failed to understand was not any foreign head of state but his own boss, argues Politico’s Susan Glasser. Many liberals are celebrating Tillerson’s firing as the end of the tenure of the nation’s worst secretary of state. But as The New Republic’s Jeet Heer and The Times’s editorial board each write, Tillerson’s replacement, Mike Pompeo, could make Tillerson’s sins look small by comparison. In The New Yorker, Dexter Filkins looked at Gina Haspel, Trump’s new choice to run the C.I.A., and her background overseeing illegal torture. Also in The Times, Samantha Power and Paul Pillar offer their perspectives on Pompeo. "

That, according to the complaint, didn’t stop Theranos from claiming that it had a bright future ahead. Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors’ eyes. It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company. Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies. Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense. Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.

962,"At a refueling stop in Cape Verde on his way home from an exhausting visit across Africa, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson walked through howling winds late Monday night toward the airport’s V.I.P. terminal, where he pulled up a chair and started telling jokes to the reporters who had traveled with him.   He was fired by executive tweet just hours later. By the time Mr. Tillerson again spoke to reporters, on Tuesday afternoon in Washington, the man who had strode confidently and relaxed throughout the weeklong diplomatic trip was replaced by a humbled and emotional one who nearly choked up as he announced that he would be handing off his powers at the stroke of midnight. Some senior administration officials said Mr. Tillerson — who in nearly 14 months at the State Department had departed from President Trump’s policies on the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal and diplomacy with North Korea — should have seen it coming. Officials said John F. Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, urged Mr. Tillerson late last week to cut short his trip, warning vaguely that he should be on the lookout for an unspecified Twitter post. But State Department officials insisted that had Mr. Kelly intended to relay an ominous message, Mr. Tillerson did not receive it. That Mr. Tillerson missed such an important signal coming from the White House was emblematic of a tenure punctuated by inopportune comments, bureaucratic inertia and frequent and public disagreements with Mr.  Trump.

965,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals on Thursday in retaliation for interference in the 2016 presidential election and other “malicious cyberattacks,” its most significant action against Moscow since President Trump took office. The sanctions came as the United States joined with Britain, France and Germany in denouncing Russia for its apparent role in a nerve-gas attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil, calling it a “clear violation” of international law. But the joint statement said nothing about any collective action in response. In his first comment on the poison attack, Mr. Trump agreed that, despite its denials, Russia was likely behind it. “It looks like it,” he told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. “We are in deep discussions,” Mr. Trump continued. “A very sad situation. It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen. And we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.” In keeping with his reluctance to blame Moscow for meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump did not mention the sanctions or election interference. The president has repeatedly dismissed the suggestion that Russia sought to influence the vote in his favor as a “hoax” and “fake news,” even as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has concluded otherwise and is investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russian agents. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, seized a pair of diplomatic properties and imposed sanctions in response to the election interference. But while Mr. Trump’s administration has issued sanctions against some Russians for human rights abuses or for the country’s intervention in Ukraine, the measures announced on Thursday represented the first time he took action on the meddling, and only after Congress passed legislation to force his hand. "
966,"John Skipper, the former ESPN president, revealed on Thursday that he had a cocaine addiction and that an attempted extortion plot by somebody he bought drugs from caused his abrupt resignation in December. “They threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. Mr. Skipper said he spoke with Robert A. Iger, the chairman and chief executive of Disney, ESPN’s parent company, and the two agreed he had put the company in an “untenable” position and had to resign. He added in the interview that he had never used heroin or opioids. ESPN declined to comment on its former president’s interview. Disney didn’t respond to a request for comment, and Mr. Skipper didn’t respond to a message left at his home. Mr. Skipper admitted that his cocaine use had caused “a missed plane and a few canceled morning appointments,” but said that it otherwise never affected his professional work. “I judge that I did a very good job and that it did not get in the way of my work,” he said. “I worked hard, I worked smart. I worked all the time.” He did not say how long he had been using cocaine, or whether he reported the extortion plot to law enforcement. In December, at the time of his resignation, Mr. Skipper said he was entering rehabilitation. The police departments in Bristol, Conn., and Wilton, Conn., the Connecticut State Police and the New York City Police Department all said then that there were no records of any incidents involving Mr. Skipper. Mr. Skipper’s resignation, which came on Dec. 18, a Monday, took everybody, even high-level ESPN employees, by surprise. The previous Wednesday, he had presided over a mandatory all-hands meeting on ESPN’s Bristol, Conn., campus. Facing an audience nervous after layoffs, management changes and a very public battle with President Trump, Mr. Skipper projected an aura of calm and stability. He expressed optimism about the company’s future, according to attendees. Two days later, according to the account he gave The Hollywood Reporter, he met with Mr. Iger and the two mutually decided he should resign. “I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction,” Mr. Skipper said when announcing his resignation. “I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem.” It was a problem almost nobody, including those who have spent extensive time with Mr. Skipper, knew he had. His rehabilitation has included unspecified “therapy” and “treatment,” Mr. Skipper stated in the interview. He indicated that he would like to work again sooner rather than later. “I don’t think it will take the form of a large corporate job, managing a lot of people and running a big company,” he said. “I think it will take the form of helping a few smart people; people I like and respect and who do things that matter.” In the almost 90 days since his resignation, ESPN has been busy. The company is preparing to launch a completely redesigned app next month, which will include ESPN Plus, its new streaming service. It is finishing construction of a Manhattan studio, which will house a new Mike Greenberg-hosted morning show, “Get Up,” as well as a yet-to-be named midday show. Overseeing the company’s response to major challenges, including a steep decline in subscribers and a fractured relationship with the N.F.L., is James Pitaro, a Disney executive, who was recently named ESPN’s president. Mr. Pitaro is the first president to come from outside of ESPN in a long time, but he is said to be especially close to Mr. Iger. On Wednesday, Mr. Pitaro had his own town hall with ESPN employees. Echoing Mr. Skipper’s town hall from three months earlier, he expressed excitement about all of the company’s initiatives, and promised better days ahead. Eighteen hours later, ESPN employees woke up to the news that their former boss had hid his cocaine problem, and resigned because of an extortion attempt by his dealer. According to some, the news was a relief. It explained why they had seen no evidence of a problem, as well as why he had to resign. Still, plenty of questions remain. Did Mr. Skipper, Mr. Iger or ESPN report the extortion attempt to law enforcement? He says his cocaine problem didn’t affect his professional work, but if he hadn’t been using would he have handled the company’s numerous challenges over his six-year tenure any differently? Finally, is this the final shoe to drop, or will news about John Skipper continue dribbling out? For now, no one close to Mr. Skipper and ESPN is speaking publicly, leaving the questions to linger. "

Should all manufacturing jobs flow to the lowest-cost, lowest-wage environments, regardless of working conditions or environmental impacts? If not, how can a free-trade system prevent this? 3. The government of China is subsidizing the growth of its electric car industry by providing very significant subsidies (about one-third of cost) to consumers. This subsidy will allow the industry to scale up much more quickly and produce electric cars cheaper than anyone else. In a free-trade world, is this good planning, or cheating? — Nick Van Kleeck, Tucson, Ariz. Paul Krugman: 1. It’s partly a sort of optical illusion. China dominates assembly of many goods thanks to a combination of still-low wages and an extensive industrial “ecology” of supporting firms. But much of the value of the good actually comes from elsewhere. For example, iPhones are “made” in China, but China only accounts for less than 4 percent of their price. 2. Not entirely — there’s some room for insisting on basic working conditions and environmental rules. But not too much. Consider Bangladesh: all it really has is a large labor force, with fairly low productivity. Low wages are the only way they can sell on world markets. If we insist that they follow first-world rules, we’re basically telling them to go starve. 3. It’s tricky. Subsidizing consumers is O.K. under the rules, while subsidizing producers isn’t. If the U.S. offered tax breaks for electric cars, it would be perfectly legal under W.T.O. rules. The trouble is that given Chinese reality, you’re not going to see a lot of foreign electric cars sold there. But as these things go, it’s not a particularly egregious example. I remember in undergraduate school (1964) studying President Kennedy’s Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This was in a political economics class. What was the significance of this act and was it bipartisan? Also, recommend some readings on political economics. — Morgan Rauch, Houston, Tex. PK: It was bipartisan, and really a continuation of the process of reciprocal trade liberalization that began in 1934 under F.D.R. What changed under the “Kennedy Round” was that as easy targets for trade deals ran out, we shifted to internationally agreed formulas: cut all tariffs by X percent, then negotiate the exemptions. But most of the heavy lifting in tariff reduction had already happened. My question: How will American steel workers fare as a result of this tariff? I heard the head of a steel workers union on NPR welcome this tariff and he sounded as if their prayers have been answered! — James C., Brooklyn PK: We will gain a few jobs in steel. But we’ll lose jobs in lots of other, “downstream” industries like autos. Most studies of the 2002 steel tariffs say that they cost jobs on net. So yes, steel workers get a little, but at what cost to other workers? I live very near a HUGE rusted-out steel plant, Bethlehem Steel in Steelton, Pa. I came here 44 years ago and it had already started its long sad road to its present obsolescence. Trump described this phenomenon in his rollout. He then had union workers talk about the production reductions to 20 percent from the heyday of domestic steel production. What source of funding could possibly come in and want to turn this 3.5-mile row of rusted barned eyesore around? Billions of dollars of investment would be necessary. The ideas of “Making America Great Again” seem to be based in recreating the economy of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s. This and the return of coal to the high ridges of Pennsylvania seem a distant memory. Is revitalization of these old industries even a possibility? Aren’t the jobs from the Rust Belt too expensive to get back? Or would another community’s landscape be blighted instead? — CC, New Cumberland, Pa. PK: There’s no way to bring back all those steel plants and steel jobs, even if we stopped all imports. Partly that’s because a modern economy doesn’t use that much steel, partly because we can produce steel using many fewer workers, partly because old-fashioned open-hearth plants have been replaced by mini-mills that use scrap metal and aren’t in the same places. So this is all a fantasy. What is your critique of the anti-trade argument made by the Warren-Sanders wing of the Democratic Party: that free trade has been bad for the (proverbial) American worker and has been a significant contributor to America’s rising income and wealth inequality? Is the answer simply that the benefits of free trade — lower prices generally — are diffuse and therefore underappreciated, whereas the costs — worker dislocation in particular sectors — are concentrated and thus easier to highlight? How much of America’s increase in income inequality over the past half-century do you attribute to free trade? Thank you for addressing this. — JG in CT, Greenwich, Conn. How should we deal with the deindustrialization and loss of community that free trade has been causing? If tariffs are not the answer, what policies would you recommend? — L Marcus, New York PK: There’s some truth to the argument that growing trade has contributed to rising inequality; if imports of manufactures from developing countries were still as low as they were in, say, 1970, real wages of blue-collar workers would probably be a few percent higher than they are. But the level of protectionism it would take to get those few percent back would have lots of ugly side consequences. If we want to help U.D. workers — and we do — there are better ways. You may remember Bernie Sanders using Denmark as an example. It’s a good one: much better wages, a much stronger social safety net, a mostly unionized work force. But Denmark is as open to world trade as we are. It’s domestic policies — from taxing and spending decisions to pro-labor policies in the service sector — that make the difference. Universal health care and the right to organize matter a lot more for workers than trade policy. Why does the president of the United States have the authority to make decisions (such as imposing tariffs) that have significant impacts on the economy, trade, relationships with allies, etc. — with impunity, and with no input from Congress? What path should Congress be taking to restrict his powers.— Ricky, Saint Paul, Minn. PK: Actually, Congress voluntarily limited its own role, to protect itself from special-interest politics: it votes big trade deals up or down on a single vote, then stays out of it. But given the realities of trade tensions, the system needs some “escape valves” — ways to provide temporary relief in hard cases. That’s why the president has certain ways he can impose tariffs: if there’s a finding that an industry has been injured by an import surge, if national security is at stake, if foreigners pursue unfair practices. However, these powers aren’t supposed to be used arbitrarily: there’s supposed to be an independent study of the issue, and the president acts on the basis of that study. What’s happening with Trump is an abuse of the process: the Commerce Department came up with an obviously bogus national security rationale for tariffs Trump wanted to impose for other reasons. So we have a process that gives presidents some discretion, for pretty good reasons — but one that assumes that said presidents will act honestly and responsibly. It falls apart when you’re dealing with someone like Trump. Will we be able to undo this after this administration is voted out? Or does this have far too many long-term effects? — Stephanie Minister, Hingham, Mass. PK: President Oprah Winfrey, or whoever, can undo these tariffs with a stroke of the pen. However, we might get into a full-scale trade war before that happens, and in any case the U.S. has already lost its reputation as a reliable negotiating partner. My question is: What role does free trade play in income inequality, and the concentration of wealth in a global economy? I have little doubt that trade creates value. On average everyone ends up wealthier with free trade — better allocation of resources. Rarely do I see the unequal distribution of the value created by trade addressed. Sure, blue-collar workers all enjoy lower prices on apparel at Walmart with low-cost textiles from China, but some worker lost a $25/hour job in a U.S. textile mill, and the Walmart saving doesn’t offset the $15/hour job for that displaced worker. The downside of free trade is concentrated onto a relatively small group of people. I also believe that financiers and the capital class keep a large part of the savings when U.S. jobs are sent offshore, and individual workers with limited geographical scope pay a price. To me the question isn’t IF trade creates wealth, but for whom is the wealth created. — Tom Stoltz, Detroit PK: There’s been a lot of work on this question over the years. Back in 1995 I estimated that trade widened the gap between college and non-college workers by 3 percent, and that number has surely risen since, though maybe only a couple of points. By the way, the downside affects a lot of people, not just a small group. We also think that the surge in imports between 2000 and 2007 displaced something like a million workers. Most of those workers eventually found other jobs, but many faced wage cuts and some communities got hurt badly. So this isn’t a subject economists have been ignoring. You just want to ask what’s the best way to help workers, and tariffs are rarely the answer. Is a perennial (and rising) trade deficit desirable and even sustainable in the very long run? Much of our debt is now owned by other countries (see China and Japan for example). Are we not giving away ownership of our of national wealth to our trading partners? I am in favor of free trade but I was always puzzled by the decades-long rising trade deficit. Germany, for example, a Western democracy, manages to have a trade surplus (with the help of the euro of course, but they still make goods people want even outside the eurozone). I have read explanations that the privilege of having a reserve currency has a price, which is maintaining trade surpluses, and this in turn allows for lower interest rates and higher growth. Sounds interesting but still can we make the case that the rising debt is sustainable for the long run? What is your view? — Costa Glaretas PK: Basically, we have persistent trade deficits because we have low savings and remain an attractive place for foreigners to invest. And as a result, the U.S., which was a creditor country before we began running persistent deficits since 1980, is now a net debtor. But you want to keep some perspective. Our “net international investment position” — overseas assets less liabilities — is about -45 percent of G.D.P., which isn’t that big a number, all things considered. For example, it’s less than 10 percent of our national wealth. And the idea that this gives foreigners a lot of power over America has it backward. On the contrary, in a way it makes them our hostages: China has a lot of money tied up in America. Suppose they tried to pull it out: the worst that could happen would be a fall in the dollar, which would be good for U.S. manufacturing and inflict a capital loss on our creditors. Lot of things worry me; our foreign debt, not so much. Perhaps something else is going on. For example, steel and aluminum are key industries in Pittsburgh (home of Alcoa). Could the need to stop a string of Democratic midterm victories play a role in the timing and choice of targets for these tariffs? — Peter, San Mateo, Calif. PK: Quite possibly. We know that’s why Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002. But I think this is mostly Trump trying to look tough. At a guess, Stormy Daniels had a bigger impact than PA-18. Clearly, global trade is too complicated for Donald Trump to fathom. But Paul Krugman? No. Not too complicated. So: pretend you are in his position, but with your knowledge and insight. What would you do regarding trade? Top three plays/passes. — Jack, Nashville PK: Basically, U.S. trade policy is O.K. The old days of lots of manufacturing jobs aren’t coming back whatever we do, and trying to save a few of them by ripping up trade rules would have lots of nasty side effects. I was against TPP, but not because I want a return to protectionism: the trouble with TPP was that it wasn’t about trade at all, it was mainly about intellectual property (e.g. pharma patents) and dispute settlement (giving corporations more power). What we need is a renewed commitment to universal health care, much more investment in infrastructure, policies to help families and a return to policies that empower unions, especially in the service sector. Defining trade as the problem is just a way to duck real solutions. What are the worst-case repercussions of these tariffs when our trade partners retaliate? — Donald Ferruzzi, Centereach, N.Y. PK: In the short run, there’s a huge amount of disruption: we’d eventually gain jobs in import-competing industries, but we’d immediately lose a lot of jobs both in export sectors (including farming) and in industries that are currently part of global supply chains, like autos and electronics. So we’d be talking about millions of immediate losers, even if some would eventually gain. In the longer run, the economy would just be less efficient: instead of concentrating on stuff we’re especially good at, we’d be doing a lot of labor-intensive stuff for ourselves. I haven’t seen a good estimate of just how much poorer, but it would surely be worse than Brexit, which typical estimates say will make Britain about 2 percent poorer. We’re not talking the end of the world or even a major depression here. Just a big short-term mess and a longer-term drag on economic growth. What part do disparate wages and benefits paid to workers by the various trading nations play in trade policy, if any? If Country A can, because of low wages, produce a product at half or less the cost of Country B, how can trade, without tariffs, ever be fair? — abigail49, Ga. PK: What you need to ask is why wages are so much lower in some countries than they are here. The answer is that they have much lower overall productivity — globally, the relationship between productivity and average wages is pretty close to one-for-one. So when you look at low-wage countries, they have a big cost advantage in sectors like clothing where their productivity isn’t too much lower than ours, but a big cost disadvantage in higher-tech sectors. Remember, Germany, which runs the world’s biggest trade surplus, actually pays substantially higher wages than we do. Just a thought from a U.S. contractor: At Home Depot and Lowe’s it’s essentially impossible to find a steel hand tool (hammer, saw, chisel, screwdriver, etc.) or electric tool that is NOT made in China, Taiwan or Mexico. In addition, the quality of that foreign steel is clearly inferior, subject to fast oxidation (rusting) or actual fracture. Although the few American-made tools available are somewhat more expensive, those of us who want something to last buy American — IF you can find it. It’s a sad state of affairs that we can’t compete with the imports even though our production quality is far superior to foreign steel. Will the tariffs fix this? No clue. — LJM, Cape Cod, Mass. PK: If people are buying inferior foreign products, isn’t that their choice? Maybe they care more about low prices than quality. It’s kind of like buying fresh but expensive local produce: I prefer it, but I’m affluent enough to make that choice. Many people aren’t. I’m interested in the analysis of the mechanics of such decisions worldwide, especially for third world economies, rather than the important political conflicts among nations that you mentioned in your excellent article. — Wail Fahmi Bedawi PK: It all depends on how widespread the trade conflict gets. I often focus on the example of Bangladesh, where people used to predict mass deaths from starvation due to overpopulation, but it’s currently keeping its head above water and even achieving significant growth (from a very low base) thanks to open world markets that let it export lots of clothing. If we do have a full-scale trade war, the impact on places like Bangladesh will be devastating if not deadly. How much damage should we expect these tariffs to do to the economy and the markets? Will they affect some regions of the U.S. more than others? I’m a public employee and I’m wondering about state tax receipts. — UCB Parent, Calif. PK: By themselves, the steel and aluminum tariffs aren’t that big a deal. Consumers won’t notice them much; some auto plants, etc., that might have opened will be canceled, but I don’t expect to see any existing plants closed. Revenue effects will also be small. But if this turns into tit-for-tat, with Europe retaliating and Trump retaliating back, who knows? Questions: 1) How will the tariffs affect E.U. countries? Will they weaken the NATO alliance? 2) What impact will the tariffs have on England going into Brexit? 3) Will the TPP countries fare better for their new trade agreement? 4) Which countries are likely to fare better because of Trump’s tariffs? Mary M, Raleigh, N.C. PK: This is all pretty small stuff so far: the E.U. is as big an economy as ours is, so it’s marginal there as here. I don’t think it affects the Brexit calculus at all. If Canada doesn’t get a sustained exemption, it’s a bigger deal: they’re a fairly small economy that supplies most of our aluminum imports. For now, the bigger impact is on foreign relations: now nobody trusts us, and China and Russia are the big winners from that distrust. How is it that so many economists of all political stripes agree that protective tariffs are bad? Up until the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle of the 1930s, weren’t tariffs a fairly common economic policy prescription? Did the Great Depression unfairly give tariffs a bad name or did the field of economics just advance beyond tariffs as part of the economic policy tool kit? — Jason Williams Washington, D.C. PK: Actually, economists were overwhelmingly against Smoot-Hawley. There has always been a minority view supporting tariffs under certain circumstances — usually for economic development. But the failure of import-substituting industrialization in Latin America and India largely discredited that view. Please respond to Daniel McCarthy’s Op-Ed point-for-point. His arguments are very convincing but counter to yours. Someone is drinking cool aid here and without an authentic debate it’s impossible to know which position is less self-serving. — Michael, Chicago PK: Many readers asked a version of this question. McCarthy’s whole article is premised on the notion that protectionism can bring back a manufacturing-centered economy. I couldn’t find any facts at all about trade in his article, certainly no numbers. And if you actually do look at the numbers, you immediately realize that his whole premise is wrong: we could shut down trade completely and manufacturing would still employ less than 10 percent of the work force. So I’m not sure what to argue with. He didn’t do his homework. Dr. Krugman, assuming a reasonable fair and level playing field, wouldn’t a worldwide free-trade agreement benefit all of humanity? It would seem that products and services would be produced by the best and the most efficient and/or the closest in proximity to resources whether human or earth born. The E.U. is moving ahead with the TTP. Will this cripple U.S. trade in Asia? — Steve, Seattle PK: TPP won’t make that much difference to trade, since it wasn’t mostly about trade (it was about intellectual property and dispute settlement). I’m less worried about the U.S. loss of trade than our loss of influence: we’re a less and less credible negotiating partner. "
969,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince has compared the supreme leader of Iran to Adolf Hitler, and said that his country would acquire a nuclear bomb “as soon as possible” if Iran developed nuclear weapons. The comments by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ratcheted up the rhetoric in the increasingly volatile rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has fueled sectarianism and war across the Middle East. His statements were in an excerpt, released on Thursday, of a prerecorded interview with “60 Minutes,” the CBS News program. Iran’s Foreign Ministry responded by calling the prince a delusional and devious novice who “has no idea of politics.” Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, blames Iran for funding militias to undermine Arab states, while Shiite Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of backing Sunni extremist groups. Their struggle for regional dominance has put the two nations on opposite sides of conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq that have killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Prince Mohammed, who jailed hundreds of the kingdom’s most potent figures while swiftly consolidating his own power, is scheduled to arrive in the United States on Monday for an extended trip. His plans include meeting with President Trump in the White House and with business, entertainment and technology leaders in a number of American cities. One of his primary goals is to persuade Americans to invest in his reform plans, which aim to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, increase the kingdom’s military self-sufficiency and raise its citizens’ quality of life. "
970,"For many people, it’s up to Robert Mueller, the special counsel, to settle the question of “collusion” in the 2016 election. A clean, clear, nonpartisan legal finding would be the most acceptable possible outcome. If he uncovers a crime by the president, Congress would be justified in pursuing an impeachment inquiry. So it should not matter that the House Intelligence Committee has abruptly ended its “investigation,” declining to compel testimony from key uncooperative witnesses or subpoena relevant records. In the words of one commentator, we need only “wait for Mueller.” But this view is wrong, a confusion of constitutional roles and responsibilities. Mr. Mueller has one job, and Congress has another. The potential offense that each is investigating might go by the same shorthand — “collusion” — but it is not the same. What counts as evidence, and how it is weighed and debated, is by necessity different in the two proceedings. Confusion over this point has major practical consequences for how long the nation must await a full and clear resolution of the question of Russian interference in the election, and any role Mr. Trump and his campaign played in it. The problem seems to start with anxiety about impeachment as too “political” a process — especially in a hyperpartisan environment. That it is political in character is undeniable, but the founders thought of the politics of impeachment as being of the highest order, concerned with the protection of the constitutional system from serious executive misconduct. As James Madison told the Congress, a powerful presidency carried with it a high danger of abuse of office, and the remedy of impeachment was available “at all times.” Legal and constitutional concerns require clarity about the nature and relevant evidence of misconduct. On the legal side, Mr. Mueller may be headed toward a theory of collusion, potentially implicating the president and others, in the form of a “conspiracy to defraud the United States.” "

973,"For once, let’s give Donald Trump his due. In throwing Rex Tillerson out on his ear, he has treated his secretary of state exactly the way the secretary treated those under him. Poetic justice has been served. And, in the nomination of C.I.A. Director Mike Pompeo to succeed Tillerson, so will the interests of American diplomacy. I’ll get to Pompeo below, but dwell for a moment on the awfulness of Tillerson. He came to office with no discernible worldview other than the jaded transactionalism he acquired as ExxonMobil’s C.E.O. He leaves office with no discernible accomplishment except a broken department and a traumatized staff. Six of the 10 top positions at State are vacant; even now the United States does not have an ambassador to South Korea, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, South Africa or the European Union, among other posts. To his credit, he did seem to figure out that Vladimir Putin is a bad guy. But that’s progress only because he was previously the Russian despot’s premier apologist. His director of policy planning had to write a memo explaining why human rights are a vital tool of American diplomacy. And he opposed the president’s two best foreign policy decisions: moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and decertifying the Iran deal. Some secretaries of state — Colin Powell, for instance — alienate their bosses by siding with the bureaucracy. Others, like Henry Kissinger, do the opposite. Tillerson is the rare bird who managed to do both. Goodbye, Rex. You won’t be missed. Pompeo is the anti-Tillerson. He doesn’t need to learn the Washington ropes. He’s been a competent leader of the C.I.A. He has the confidence of the president, meaning that, unlike Tillerson, he will have credibility with foreign governments. Just as importantly, he’s been willing to contradict the president, meaning he’ll be able to act as a check on him, too. "

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Samantha Bee reveled in the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb’s upset victory in a special House election in Pennsylvania. Bee said that she hopes the Democratic leadership will take the win to heart and run candidates in other red districts next year. Bee went on to address the student marches in support of gun control that took place across the country on Wednesday. “We cover hard topics all the time, but gun violence is the worst because honestly, I never thought anything would change,” Bee said. “But I should have known better. I should have known that a generation would come that wouldn’t repeat our mistakes.” Trevor Noah was stunned by how boisterous a crowd of protesters was in Washington. Senator Bernie Sanders was caught on camera delivering a speech, but his voice was all but inaudible over the crowd. Like Bee, Jimmy Kimmel took a moment to celebrate Lamb’s defeat of the Republican candidate Rick Saccone. Then Kimmel focused his attention on Trumpstore.com, the Trump family’s official online store. He ordered a bunch of merchandise from the website, and noticed that despite President Trump’s “America First” philosophy, nearly everything turned out to be made in a foreign country. Stephen Colbert paid a visit to an art therapist, and he turned out to have some demons to exorcise.

976,"We recently traveled to the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as legal observers for a case against a detainee accused of being a leader of Al Qaeda. The military commissions complex known as Camp Justice — an assortment of white trailers and beige tents on an abandoned air strip — was established by the George W. Bush administration in 2001 to “swiftly” try terrorism suspects in the wake of Sept. 11. But over a decade has passed, the tents are still there, and so are 41 detainees. It is the traveling circus that never leaves town. At one point Guantánamo ignited passions across the political spectrum. Today the bipartisan consensus is apathy. And that apathy allows for enduring injustice in the form of indefinite detention, tainted procedure and dysfunctional bureaucracy. Only one journalist, Carol Rosenberg of The Miami Herald, continues to report regularly from Guantánamo. During two weeks of hearings in late January and early February, we found the court’s viewing gallery nearly empty. We watched the proceedings from behind a glass barrier with audio transmitted on a 40-second delay meant to intercept accidental disclosure of classified information. One day we toured the Gitmo gift shop — right next to the McDonald’s — where you can buy all variety of memorabilia emblazoned with “Guantánamo Bay” and images of iguanas and surfboards. A memorable shot glass bore the line “The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves.” The sleepy seaside setting obscures the reality that Guantánamo is in a state of quiet tumult, with alarming developments occurring largely outside the spotlight. President Trump announced in his State of the Union address, which we watched in an airless tent in Camp Justice, that he had signed an executive order to keep Guantánamo open. Then last month his administration indicated that it is receptive to sending more captives there, including members of the Islamic State. They would be the first new arrivals in a decade, extending the life of an institution that has disappointed on every front. "

978,"OTTAWA — First were the tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Then came a trade action over a Canadian jetliner, and duties on newsprint. Most recently the United States and Canada battled over potentially crippling duties on steel and aluminum that President Trump introduced last week. And all along the two countries have been fighting over renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now comes the latest slight to Canada from its closest ally and nearest neighbor: a report by The Washington Post on Thursday that Mr. Trump boasted at a private fund-raising event that he made up an assertion that the United States had a trade deficit with Canada during a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trade with the United States is a critical part of Canada’s export-dependent economy, and the actions and statements from the Trump administration concerning the two countries’ economic relationship have provoked equal parts anxiety, puzzlement and anger within Canada. The president’s reported comments dominated the news in Canada on Thursday morning and were greeted with bafflement by some Canadians. “I thought it was a dumb comment but I wasn’t surprised,” said Mark Warner, an international trade lawyer in Toronto. “If it came from any other world leader it would be troubling. But pretty obviously he’s not a details guy and he’s kind of got a negotiating strategy of being in the moment.” "
979,"The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will. United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West’s critical facilities in the event of a conflict. They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated. In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants. Still, new computer screenshots released by the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday made clear that Russian state hackers had the foothold they would have needed to manipulate or shut down power plants. “We now have evidence they’re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage,” said Eric Chien, a security technology director at Symantec, a digital security firm.

981,"HONG KONG — North Korea’s foreign minister flew to Sweden on Thursday, amid speculation that the country could be used as a venue for hammering out details of the planned talks between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, or could be the site of the talks themselves. Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho was seen at Beijing’s international airport on Thursday, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported, following earlier reports that he might go to Sweden. Hours later, the Swedish Foreign Ministry confirmed that Mr. Ri would indeed be visiting the country for talks on Thursday and Friday. Sweden has long played an intermediary role between the United States and North Korea, which do not have diplomatic relations. With the United States lacking an embassy in North Korea, Sweden is the so-called protecting power that provides consular services for Americans, including meeting with citizens who are imprisoned there. Sweden has also been the site of talks between North Korean officials and experts from the United States, South Korea and elsewhere. Other locations that have been mentioned as possible sites for the Trump-Kim talks include the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea; Washington; Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital; Ulan Bator, Mongolia; and Switzerland. Mr. Trump’s decision to accept Mr. Kim’s invitation to meet shocked the diplomatic establishment last week, coming after months of bellicose insults and threats between the two leaders and their governments. Any meeting, should it actually come to fruition, would probably be held by May, said Chung Eui-yong, a South Korean official who conveyed the invitation to the White House. Mr. Ri was seen at the Beijing airport with Choe Kang-il, the deputy director general for North American affairs at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, Yonhap reported. Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said on Saturday that he was willing to host a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. “If we can help in any way, we will do it,” Mr. Löfven said at a news conference. Mr. Löfven, in an interview with Sweden’s TT newswire, also cited his country’s role as a protecting power for the United States as a reason for acting as a conduit between it and North Korea. “The fact that we are a protecting power for the U.S., have been at the border since the 1950s and have had an embassy in Pyongyang since the start of the 1970s has given us a relationship with North Korea in which we feel they trust us,” he said. During Mr. Ri’s two-day trip to Stockholm, he will meet with Margot Wallstrom, Sweden’s foreign minister, the Swedish government said in a statement. The newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the talks would not include American or South Korean officials, but added that the United States and South Korea had been involved in preparations for the talks with Mr. Ri. Mr. Ri’s trip to Sweden came as South Korea’s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, traveled to Washington Thursday to meet with State Department officials with the aim of keeping a Trump-Kim meeting on track. The recent firing of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has fueled fears that a changing of the guard at the State Department could derail plans for the talks. “It is necessary to maintain close coordination at various levels in making preparations for critical diplomatic events going forward,” Ms. Kang said, alluding to relations between Washington and Seoul. Ms. Kang was originally supposed to meet with Mr. Tillerson, but will instead meet with John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, who is now serving as acting secretary. Mr. Tillerson’s expected replacement, Mike Pompeo, is skeptical that negotiations with North Korea will lead it to give up its nuclear arsenal. "
982,"WASHINGTON — Long before Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, Larry Kudlow was selling his future tax plan. Mr. Kudlow spent the years leading up to the 2016 election trying to convince every potential Republican candidate that by slashing corporate tax rates, America’s rate of economic growth could double. His arguments foreshadowed Mr. Trump’s pitch for the tax cuts he would sign as president in late 2017. “The single group that benefits the most from a lower corporate tax is the middle-class wage earner,” Mr. Kudlow said in a February 2015 interview, “and every study shows that.” Several studies dispute that, but they do not deter Mr. Kudlow, whom Mr. Trump picked this week to head the National Economic Council. Mr. Kudlow is not an academic economist. He is a Wall Street economist, a polished television host and, most of all, an evangelist for supply-side economics, which espouses that cutting taxes on businesses and the rich will rain down benefits on everyone else in the country. Mr. Kudlow believes that limiting the federal government will unleash Reagan-level economic growth, and he derides the “highly flawed econometric models” of economists whose forecasts do not share his optimism, including those at the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s economic scorekeeper. His zeal has led him to issue some predictions that beat consensus and others that were wildly wrong, including twice denying the existence of recessions while they were already underway during President George W. Bush’s administration. (“Despite all the doom and gloom from the economic pessimistas,” he wrote in December 2007, right as the worst recession in a generation was beginning, “the resilient U.S. economy continues moving ahead.”) But his preaching is consistent, effective and entertaining. Mr. Kudlow’s admirers say it might be just what Mr. Trump needs right now, at a time when the economy is humming but Americans aren’t giving the president or his party much credit for it. “He’s a great guy to have in a bull market, freewheeling economy,” said James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a regular guest on Mr. Kudlow’s syndicated radio show. “He was made to be a spokesman for an administration in that kind of economy.” Mr. Trump is confident that the economy is roaring and that he deserves credit for it, as evidenced by his announcement of Mr. Kudlow’s appointment Thursday on Twitter. Americans are similarly confident in the economy’s performance, but that is not translating into widespread approval for Mr. Trump or his signature economic policies. A survey of 10,089 adults conducted this month for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that consumer confidence was strong, and remained at its highest point since Mr. Trump took office. But only 44 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Trump’s performance in office, compared with 54 percent who disapproved. The poll found support dipping slightly for Mr. Trump’s signature tax law: 49 percent of respondents approved of the bill, down from 51 percent in February, while 46 percent disapproved. That drop signals a potential ceiling of support for the new law, which had gained popularity after Mr. Trump signed it. In a worrying sign for conservatives, “strong” approval of the bill among Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents fell to 46 percent from 52 percent. Promoting the tax law did not prove to be an effective strategy for Republicans in a special congressional election this week in Pennsylvania. After flooding the airwaves of a district that Mr. Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016 with tax-themed advertisements, Republicans shifted strategy for their closing argument, apparently judging the message to be ineffective. Their nominee, Rick Saccone, lost the race narrowly to  Conor Lamb, a Democrat. Mr. Kudlow, though, sees the tax law as a boon for the country and a powerful messaging weapon in the midterm elections this fall. He told his longtime colleagues at CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that one of his roles in the administration will be helping Mr. Trump persuade more Americans to see the law similarly. “The president likes me as a media communicator,” Mr. Kudlow said, “so I will be more than happy to oblige.” Most recent directors of the National Economic Council have not been academic economists, but the role has traditionally demanded more policy advice than salesmanship. The director is in effect the point person in the White House for economic issues, coordinating advice from across the cabinet and the West Wing. Mr. Trump’s advisers generally agree on tax issues, but they often diverge on trade, with warring factions between the traditional free-market group and a more populist group that reinforces Mr. Trump’s own inclinations and campaign talk. Mr. Kudlow is a longtime advocate of free trade, seeing it as critical to America’s economic growth. He criticized Mr. Trump’s recent plan to levy global tariffs on aluminum and steel, but has since endorsed a slightly more tailored version of the tariffs that Mr. Trump announced this month. His predecessor, Gary D. Cohn, announced that he would step down after losing the battle over those tariffs. Wall Street researchers were skeptical that Mr. Kudlow could persuade Mr. Trump to back away from his anti-trade agenda. “We expect that the president and Mr. Kudlow will be at odds over trade policy,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote on Wednesday, “but that the president’s view will prevail.” In the CNBC interview, Mr. Kudlow distilled the economic philosophy — including his love of tax cuts — that has animated him for four decades. “I believe, first of all, the greatest and most important thing for this or any other country is rapid prosperity for everyone,” Mr. Kudlow said. “If you keep tax rates minimal, if you keep regulations and government spending minimal, if you keep the dollar sound and steady, you are going to have a terrific economy.” He also emphasized how he, like Mr. Trump, viewed the stock market as a barometer for economic success. “Look, I love the stock market,” he said. “I love wealth. I think rising stocks help everybody.” Faith in those principles has at times led Mr. Kudlow to better his peers in economic forecasting, most notably in the late 1970s, when he bet against Wall Street’s consensus predictions that inflation would remain low. Mr. Kudlow also cites economic growth during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and what he calls the five-year “boom” that followed the permanent tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law in 2003, as evidence of the power of the supply side policies he preaches. But Mr. Kudlow has been off on other predictions. Like many conservatives, he warned in 2010 that the Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to help prop up the economy, risked stoking rapid inflation, which did not happen. He said in 1993 that President Bill Clinton’s “across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy’s long-run potential to grow.” Several booming years later, in 1998, he was telling conservatives to cut taxes and expect a surge of new federal revenue to follow for years to come. It did surge, briefly, but large budget deficits returned in the mid-2000s and have hung around. Critics worry that Mr. Kudlow could miss the warning signs of another recession, or advise against government action to help pull the country out of any economic dip that might occur. Liberal groups criticized Mr. Kudlow this week for dismissing concerns about inequality and the pay gap between women and men, and for his critiques of expanded safety net programs — which he has said discourage work and contributed to slow growth under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama. He has also expressed opposition to the federal minimum wage. Those critics who have jousted with him on air for years also say that Mr. Kudlow is, almost uniquely in the spirited world of economic debate, an engaging and curious adversary. “There’s probably nobody I disagree with more, and like as much,” said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who advised Mr. Obama.

985,"Shortly after the inauguration of Donald Trump, at a particularly turbulent and divisive moment in American politics, The New York Times launched “The Daily.” The free, roughly 20-minute podcast posts every weekday at 6 a.m. Eastern, and provides in-depth analysis of key news events in a compelling, distinctive format. Hosted by the former New York Times political reporter Michael Barbaro, the show arms listeners with clarity and context for confronting the often-chaotic onslaught of news we’re bombarded with every day, and has been downloaded millions of times by listeners across the country. The show features engaging interviews with journalists from The Times on the front lines of major developments. These reporters are uniquely qualified to objectively explain the multifaceted nature of the stories they cover, and to guide listeners through the complex historical context crucial to understanding how we got here in the first place. As Mr. Barbaro says in a Times Insider piece about the origins of the podcast, “The whole point of the show was to disentangle and to explain this extraordinarily consequential and incredibly difficult-to-understand moment in our history.” Teaching with ”The Daily” can be a great way to bring Times reporters and the stories they cover into your classroom. The show offers a regular source of boiled-down news analysis and powerful storytelling, addressing a broad swath of national and international issues that can provoke student discussion and further investigation into the complex nuances of an issue and the history that shaped it. Keep in mind that most students are probably not accustomed to listening to long chunks of spoken word audio without any visual aids, and it may initially be challenging to capture their attention as easily as a video might. You can help prepare them for the experience by having them first read and discuss one of The Times articles related to the podcast episode, which you can find linked from each episode. It may also sometimes make more sense to just play samples of an episode rather than all 20 minutes of it. Or, consult our lesson plan Active Listening: Using Times Videos, Podcasts and Articles to Practice a Key Skill for even more ideas. Below, we explore two shows in depth, suggest five ways you can teach with any episode, and list seven more episodes we especially recommend for classrooms. "
986,"MIAMI — For the latest on the bridge collapse in Miami, read Friday’s live updates. The graceful pedestrian bridge was swung into place on Saturday. Heralded as a triumph of “accelerated construction,” the walkway would allow pedestrians to safely cross eight lanes of traffic separating the campus of Florida International University from the small city where many of the students lived. Five days later, around midday Thursday, the walkway collapsed in a pile of 950 tons of metal, concrete and dust, before ever opening to pedestrians. At least six people were killed, according to the Miami-Dade County police. Some reports put the number of dead a high as 10. Cars were caught under the bridge when a stoplight turned red at a nearby intersection. Eight of them could be seen poking out from the rubble, in a scene that resembled the aftermath of an earthquake. “I heard what sounded to me like a sonic boom from an aircraft which shook the ground below,” said Kurt Baker, a student at the university who had just exited the Florida Turnpike. “There was a large plume of smoke,” said Sgt. Adrian Mesa of the Sweetwater Police Department. “And then you could see the south end of the bridge was tilted over.” Drivers leapt from their cars to help pull people free, but quickly realized they could save only the people in cars that were partially crushed, said Lynell R. Collins, who had been about to turn onto the street in his pickup. The others were gone. "
987,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A pileup on Russia, a South African scolding for Australia, and the world’s coldest capital has a coal problem. Here’s what you need to know: • More fingers pointing at Russia. France, Germany and the U.S. joined Britain in denouncing Russia over an attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil that used a terrifyingly powerful, military-grade nerve agent, Novichok. The move came a day after Britain formally accused Russia of attempted murder, in an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, above. (The British royal family’s symbolic slap of boycotting the World Cup this summer in Russia was dismissed by a Russian official as “not so important.”) U.S. authorities accused Moscow of engineering a series of escalating cyberattacks that could have enabled it to shut off American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems. And the Trump administration took its toughest action yet against Russia — over a different issue, issuing new sanctions on Russian groups and individuals for election interference and other “malicious” cyberattacks. "
988,"Few investors had more at stake in Broadcom’s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the chip maker Qualcomm than Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and chief executive of Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, and chief portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor mutual fund. Endeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor’s assets, a highly concentrated position. By pursuing a mix of value and socially responsible investing — avoiding companies that harm the environment, and favoring companies that treat their employees well — Mr. Dodson has emerged as one of his generation’s most successful investors. Morningstar ranks his Endeavor fund first among large capitalization blended mutual funds over 10-, five- and three-year periods. Then, this week, President Trump killed Broadcom’s takeover bid on national security grounds, and Qualcomm shares plunged. They dropped more than 5 percent on Tuesday, a $25 million hit to the Endeavor fund. Yet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president’s decision — he applauded it. “There’s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,” he said. “But as a shareholder, I voted against it.” "
989,"In the past two years, a wave of distressing commentary has stressed the fragility of American democracy and the potential, inspired by President Trump, for emerging authoritarianism. But a year into the Trump administration, Americans are rejecting authoritarian alternatives to democracy. In a new survey by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, we found that the percentage of Americans who expressed support for a “strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with elections or Congress” fell to levels not seen since the mid-1990s. In particular, young people overwhelmingly reject authoritarian rule, despite concerns about a rising generation retreating from democracy (raised most prominently by Roberto Foa and Yascha Mounk). Mr. Trump is almost certainly giving authoritarianism a bad name. Support for authoritarian rule declined most among Democrats and young people, while significantly increasing among Republicans. So when it comes to American authoritarianism, perhaps the problem isn’t so much Mr. Trump as it is hyper-partisanship. Support for authoritarian leadership is concentrating in the Republican Party, and its elites are doing little to push back. In our highly polarized two-party system, this poses the risk that future partisan conflict could become a battle over democracy itself. Mr. Trump’s illiberal style of politics fits the authoritarian leanings of a significant portion of his electoral base. Support for a “strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with Congress or elections” is much higher among Trump primary voters (32 percent) than among voters for any other primary candidate, Republican or Democrat.

991,"PARIS — Europe is pushing for more stringent vetting of foreign investments, with an eye on Beijing. Australia has been blocking bids by Chinese buyers for strategic assets. And in Canada, a Chinese takeover of a major contractor faces a national security test. As China looks to spread its wealth and influence, the United States is not the only country seeking to shield its industries under the guise of national security. Governments around the world, and especially in Europe, are increasingly inclined to use such concerns as a litmus test for Chinese investments to protect their competitive edge. It’s a mixture of political posturing, national pride and outright paranoia. But China presents a difficult policy puzzle. Countries must balance safeguarding their strategic industries and preventing the loss of sensitive technologies, while still courting Chinese investors and improving trade with Beijing. “There’s a general impression that China is rising on all fronts, and the question is how to deal with that,” said Philippe Le Corre, a China specialist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Most countries don’t know how to react.” The United States appears to be taking the hardest line toward China. President Trump’s decision this week to block a hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom for the rival American chip company Qualcomm fell apart over concerns that a takeover could hand Chinese rivals an advantage. And the panel that reviewed the Qualcomm deal, known as Cfius, is likely to get tougher still on China. The committee, which can essentially block foreign acquisitions of American firms on national security grounds, has already quashed a number of deals by Chinese-linked buyers. Lawmakers are now calling to broaden the types of transactions the panel can vet. "
992,"LONDON — While Prime Minister Theresa May has united her warring Conservative Party by denouncing Russia over the poisoning of a former spy, things have not gone so smoothly for the opposition Labour Party. Among Labour lawmakers, familiar wounds have reopened over the more ambivalent stance of its left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Twice in Parliament this week, Mr. Corbyn, whose political views were forged in his leftist activism in the 1980s, has eschewed the supportive, cheerleading role that opposition leaders traditionally play to the prime minister when Britain is in conflict with a foreign power. At times, in his reluctance to criticize Moscow, he sounded like his ideological opposite, President Trump. While he condemned the attack in Salisbury, England, as an “appalling act of violence,” Mr. Corbyn has claimed that the Conservatives took donations from wealthy Russians, and he has highlighted cuts to the British Foreign Office and called for the Russian authorities to be “held to account on the basis of the evidence.” On Thursday, in an article in The Guardian, Mr. Corbyn added that criticism of Russia should not mean acceptance of “a ‘new cold war’ of escalating arms spending, proxy conflicts across the globe and a McCarthyite intolerance of dissent.” His resistance to falling into line with Mrs. May’s tough stance revived tensions with centrist Labour lawmakers who were reluctantly reconciled to Mr. Corbyn’s leadership last year after his better-than-expected performance in national elections. After Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn spoke in Parliament on Wednesday, several Labour lawmakers welcomed the prime minister’s statement, including Hilary Benn, a former shadow foreign secretary, who argued that “as Russia has chosen to act against us in such an outrageous way, we have to demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves.” "
993,"Chirlane McCray suddenly seems to be everywhere. She is in Puerto Rico, checking on mental health efforts in the wake of Hurricane Maria. She is sitting beside her husband, Mayor Bill de Blasio, at a City Hall news conference to announce the appointment of a new schools chancellor. Since the start of Mr. de Blasio’s second term in January, Ms. McCray, who once shied from the spotlight, has undertaken a political transformation, raising her visibility and profile — so much so that she is now contemplating running for office. But behind the scenes, a similar makeover has also quietly been taking place. Ms. McCray has stepped up her out-of-town travel, meeting with political leaders, speaking about her signature mental health initiative, networking and building the family brand outside New York City. Mr. de Blasio has been criticized for craving a role as a national progressive leader, a status that has eluded him as an individual. But as Ms. McCray’s activities come into focus, it appears that the couple are seeking instead to establish a brand as one of the nation’s first families of progressive politics — modeling themselves, consciously or not, after Bill and Hillary Clinton, who took turns, with one holding office while the other exerted influence from the sidelines. “The word has spread about what we’re doing,” Ms. McCray said in a City Hall interview this week, referring to invitations she receives to travel the country and talk about ThriveNYC, the wide-ranging mental health initiative that she has championed, and other matters. “Homelessness is not a New York City issue; it’s a national issue. Incarceration rates: not a New York City issue; it’s a national issue. What we’re doing here is a model for so many other places.” This week marked a political unveiling for Ms. McCray: No longer simply the partner and chief adviser to New York City’s mayor, as she has been for four years, she now has presented herself as a potential candidate in her own right. “As we live and grow, I feel like, my goodness, I am actually capable; I could do this,” she said in the interview, citing possible offices for a future run. “It could be something in Albany, it could be Brooklyn, local, citywide. I don’t know,” she said. Tellingly, Mr. de Blasio began his week out of town, the tail end of a long weekend of appearances in Maryland, Texas and Washington and the latest in his ongoing — and as yet futile — attempt to establish himself as a player on the national stage. With the trip to Puerto Rico this week, Ms. McCray has taken four out-of-state jaunts on city business this year, the same number she took in the first two years after her husband took office. The pace of her travel, much of it paid for by city taxpayers, quietly accelerated in the final two years of Mr. de Blasio’s first term, when she logged at least 18 out-of-state trips. The trips, she said, are chances to teach and to learn from others, yet always with a broader political goal shaped by national politics: to “push the national agenda so that we cannot lose ground, which I feel like we’re doing every day.” Ms. McCray wears many hats, but she has only one formal city job: chairwoman of the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City, a government-controlled nonprofit that raises money to support city programs. Her other jobs, described by City Hall as informal or advisory, include leading the ThriveNYC effort, acting as a chairwoman of both the Commission on Gender Equity and the NYC Domestic Violence Task Force, heading up the Gracie Mansion Conservancy and acting as a member of the NYC Children’s Cabinet. Ms. McCray resisted the characterization of her multiple roles as informal, although she is not paid for any of them. “I’m highly scheduled,” she said. “I work hard.” That is also a notion that her husband has pressed recently, insisting that Ms. McCray should be paid for her work, and bristling at the anti-nepotism laws and rules that prevent her from drawing a salary or holding an official position with the city. “Ask the people who wrote the laws; I don’t understand it,” Mr. de Blasio said. “She works full time. It makes no sense to me. But that’s the reality.” Asked about the statement, Ms. McCray laughed and said: “I love my husband.” But she added, “I should not be paid.” Still, she said that it was an idea that should be studied, for the benefit of future mayoral spouses. “I do think that the appropriate body should look at the role of spouse or partner and make some kind of recommendations or guidelines,” she said. The charter review commission, which her husband has promised to create, might present an opportunity to take on such a task, she said. In the last two weeks alone, Ms. McCray has appeared with the mayor at a town-hall meeting for high school students to discuss gun violence and safety; accompanied him to a makeshift memorial placed where two children were killed by a driver in Brooklyn; and visited Washington on her own to discuss mental health with congressional lawmakers. Her increased role has not escaped attention. “Pay My Wife,” The New York Post shouted in a headline about the mayor’s perspective. And Errol Louis, who interviews Mr. de Blasio every Monday on NY1, recently questioned the mayor about Ms. McCray’s influence over government decisions. “What is her role and, when people say, ‘Look, we didn’t elect her, we elected you’ …” Mr. Louis said. “That’s the most idiotic thing I’ve heard in my life, and it smacks of sexism,” the mayor interjected. Christina M. Greer, a political-science professor who is a McSilver Institute Fellow at New York University, said that concerns over nepotism may be particularly strong at the moment given the way President Trump has included his daughter and son-in-law in his inner circle. But Professor Greer also saw the Clinton parallel in the working relationship between Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray. “That reminds me of the Clintons from the ’90s, when they said you can get two for the price of one,” Professor Greer said. “But many voters say, ‘I didn’t ask for two for the price of one. I asked for one. I voted for one person on the ballot.’ ” City Hall refused to provide details about the cost of Ms. McCray’s travel. Last year, she spent 19 days away on nine out-of-state work trips, and she brings a security detail and frequently travels with staff members. She has made two recent trips to Atlanta, once for a meeting at the Carter Center, where she discussed mental health issues with Rosalynn Carter, and another for the Power Rising Summit of black women. In the last two years, she has traveled to Boston and met with that city’s mayor; she has gone to Seattle to meet with public health officials and the mayor there, as well as to Maryland, Miami and New Orleans, among other places. Her travels have included trips with the mayor to the United States Conference of Mayors. She has on two occasions addressed gatherings of female mayors. “Everybody that I see her come in contact with, they know she’s married to Bill de Blasio, but they see her as someone in her own right,” said Kim McMillan, a two-term Democratic mayor of Clarksville, Tenn., and the first woman to lead that city. Indeed, Ms. McCray’s influence with her husband is so great that job applicants now know whom they need to appeal to in the interview process. When the newly chosen schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, interviewed with the mayoral couple at Gracie Mansion earlier this year, he sang them a mariachi song, “Maria Elena,” a man’s paean to his lady love: “You are my heart,” the song says, “the sun of my love, my entire being is yours.” Mr. Carranza dedicated the song to Ms. McCray.

996,"To the Editor: Re “Democrat’s Win on Trump’s Turf Offers Road Map” (front page, March 15): There is a lesson of overriding importance for Democrats in Conor Lamb’s stellar result in the special House election in a red district in which the party sometimes did not even bother to field candidates. Democrats should run candidates who reflect the tenor of the local district or state, not those who strictly adhere to some fixed ideological template. Given President Trump’s great unpopularity and how well Democrats have done in recent elections, it looks increasingly likely that Democrats can recapture the House in 2018. Retaking the Senate will be a much more difficult challenge because several Democratic senators are running for re-election in red states. The stakes here are of enormous historic importance. Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans are zealously intent on stacking the federal judiciary — including the Supreme Court — with right-wing judges. It is the Senate that confirms these potentially lifetime appointments. Let the wingmen of Trump Republicans follow their kamikaze leader. It is crucial that the Democrats adopt a strategic battle formation. RUSS WEISS
PRINCETON JUNCTION, N.J. To the Editor: I don’t think Conor Lamb’s victory in the Pennsylvania congressional election was because he is a Democrat, or because he is a populist, or because he leans right on certain issues or even because Rick Saccone was a poor candidate. It was because Mr. Lamb is smart, articulate, works hard and is likable. But, in my opinion, he won because, above all, people believe him to be ethical. This November, I hope that people, whether they’re Republicans or Democrats, vote for candidates who are willing to listen to those who disagree with them, to work across the aisle and to put country above party. Pennsylvania voters believe that Mr. Lamb will do just that. In spite of the fact that I am a die-hard, lifelong Democrat, I would like to see purple hats predominate in the landscape. Purple hats with the words “Make American Ethical Again” printed in bold clear letters. Let’s elect more people like Mr. Lamb. ANNE KRICK, WHEATON, ILL. To the Editor: The razor-thin margin in Tuesday’s special election in Pennsylvania is dramatic evidence of how little it will take for Russian meddling to have a huge impact on our elections. That makes it all the more alarming that the administration’s response to this prospect has been so slow and so inadequate. MARK R. KILLINGSWORTH
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. "
997,"WASHINGTON — In his State of the Union speech two months ago, President Trump vowed to end welfare as he defined it, heralding a plan to force recipients off federal housing vouchers, food assistance and Medicaid if they were not willing to do “a hard day’s work.” Days before the speech, as part of the plan, several federal departments took steps to impose the stricter work requirements on able-bodied adults receiving noncash aid. The move could result in the loss of subsistence benefits for as many as four million poor, single adults over the next few years, experts say. But Mr. Trump’s effort faces an uncertain future. The centerpiece of the plan, a sweeping executive order mandating that federal agencies review safety net programs with an eye toward cutting their rolls, has been delayed indefinitely, according to three senior administration officials. Disagreement among congressional Republicans over how to proceed, Mr. Trump’s own ambivalence — and the absence of any proof that the approach will achieve its intended goal of reducing dependency on federal programs — have resulted in a scattershot process that lacks the coherence and force of previous efforts at overhaul. “This isn’t the 1990s, when you had a broad national consensus for ending welfare as we know it,” said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which has worked closely with the administration on several domestic policy initiatives. Republicans have argued that the requirements are a way to cut down on federal caseloads, and the idea that people should try to work for their benefits, in principle, enjoys broad support, even among Democrats. “It’s good policy and it’s also remarkably popular,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who made welfare overhaul a focal point of his “Contract With America” plan and who succeeded in enacting such a proposal in 1996 in collaboration with President Bill Clinton.

998,"A few years ago, I installed a web browser extension that swapped out the word “millennial” any time it appeared on a website in my Chrome browser. In its place? The ridiculous phrase, “Snake People.” Why? Well, why not. The word millennial was being used to describe many different kinds of millennials in many different millennial think pieces. Once I installed the extension, any tendentiously oversaturated sentence would be transformed into something absurdly sublime. The creator of the extension, a designer named Eric Bailey, eventually added other preposterous text-swapping constructions to his software. And so my web browsing experience was peppered not only with mentions of Snake People, but also “Zolom’s Children” (for the emerging Generation Z) and the “Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.” (for the Great Recession). Harmless fun! An amusing distraction for myself during my time online. Or so I thought. That text-swap functionality about the Great Recession got me in a spot of trouble last week. As many people around the internet noticed, The New York Times had to issue a correction when an errant copy/paste job led to the fictitious “Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.” appearing in a trade policy article I worked on.

999,"WASHINGTON — In his first full cabinet meeting last June, President Trump invited a chorus of gushing praise from his top aides by boasting that he had assembled a “phenomenal team of people, a great group of talent.” But in the nine months since then, Mr. Trump has fired or forced out a half-dozen of the “incredible, talented” people in the Cabinet Room that day: his secretaries of state and health, along with his chief strategist, his chief of staff, his top economic aide and his press secretary. And the purge at the top may not be over. Mr. Trump, who is famously fickle, appears to have soured on additional members of his senior leadership team — and his frequent mulling about making changes has some people around him convinced that he could act soon. “There will always be change. I think you want to see change,” Mr. Trump said, ominously, on Thursday. “I want to also see different ideas.” John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, met early Friday morning with Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, according to one official briefed on the meeting, amid speculation that Mr. Carson would be pushed out of the cabinet because of the bad publicity he received for the purchase of $31,000 in furniture for his office. Mr. Trump is also facing new reports that he plans to replace Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. Three people close to Mr. Trump said that he has concluded that he should remove General McMaster, but he has not disclosed when he will do it and who he will appoint as Mr. McMaster’s successor. General McMaster has often been at odds with Mr. Trump on policy. But unlike last year, when General McMaster tried to conform to please the president, he is now ready to leave and is merely waiting for Mr. Trump to ask, two people familiar with the adviser’s thinking said. Among those strongly pushing for him to go is Mr. Kelly, according to four officials familiar with West Wing staffing discussions. Mr. Kelly, who is a former four-star Marine general, also feuded frequently with General McMaster. The four officials said that Mr. Kelly had become increasingly angry at what he viewed as General McMaster’s prolonged effort to undermine Rex W. Tillerson, whom Mr. Trump fired  as secretary of state this week. Mr. Kelly repeatedly staved off efforts to get rid of Mr. Tillerson. After Mr. Tillerson was ousted, Mr. Kelly loudly criticized the decision to colleagues and accelerated his efforts to remove General McMaster, the officials said, adding that Mr. Kelly appeared more eager to act swiftly than the president. One person close to the president said General McMaster, whom officials have described as never having clicked with the president personally, could be replaced as early as Friday. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied late Thursday a report in The Washington Post that Mr. Trump had already decided to fire General McMaster. “Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster — contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC,” she wrote on Twitter. If General McMaster does depart the White House, the name most often mentioned as a replacement has been John R. Bolton, a hawkish former ambassador to the United Nations whom Mr. Trump likes seeing on television. But another option is Keith Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general who is currently the chief of staff at the National Security Council, according to two people briefed on the discussions. Mr. Kellogg is a favorite of Mr. Trump’s from the 2016 campaign, but there has been resistance to him among White House staff, those briefed on the discussions said. Mr. Kelly himself is also on thin ice, according to officials in the White House. He is said to have angered the president by privately saying “no” to the boss too often. Mr. Trump grew frustrated with Mr. Kelly, in part for stalling on the president’s desire for tariffs. The president finally forced the issue a few weeks ago, announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum, which prompted Gary D. Cohn, his top economic adviser, who had opposed the policy, to announce his resignation. In recent days, Mr. Kelly has sought to repair his standing with the president by moving more aggressively to address issues that have festered, including staffing concerns at the White House and cabinet secretaries with political liabilities. Several high-level people in the administration are at risk. Mr. Carson and David J. Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs, have both embarrassed the president by generating scandalous headlines. Mr. Carson could be cut over an eye-popping $31,000 dining set, and Mr. Shulkin might be replaced over a 10-day, $122,000 European trip with his wife. And then there is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose original sin — the decision to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia investigation — made him the regular target of presidential ire. The attorney general has threatened to resign at least once, but has more recently indicated his determination to resist Mr. Trump’s obvious desire for him to leave his post at the Justice Department. Mr. Trump could act as early as Friday to remove one or more of them, though the president is known to enjoy keeping people off kilter. In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Trump assailed predictions of further staff shake-ups by saying such reports were “a very exaggerated and false story.” But he hinted that his choices for a cabinet might have been different had he known then what he knows now. “I’ve gotten to know a lot of people over the last year,” Mr. Trump said. Whether that means the president is about to exercise his option to find new people for his White House is unclear. Mr. Trump has a long habit of musing about staff changes that he does not enact. He does his own version of poll-testing different possibilities, asking aides what they think of one another and asking outside friends and top advisers whether different people would be better in specific jobs, but he often drops the topic without acting. That was certainly the case with Mr. Tillerson, whom he needled for months before finally firing him in a tweet on Tuesday. It has also been true of Mr. Sessions, who has had to endure a series of Twitter attacks from the president, each of which prompts new reports about whether Mr. Trump is about to dump his top law enforcement official. “It’s devastating,” said William M. Daley, who served as former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff for about a year. “No business could handle this, much less the government. It’s supposed to be about stability and continuity. That’s just not in his lexicon.” Just last month, Mr. Trump lamented that Mr. Sessions had failed to investigate the Obama administration’s handling of Russian election meddling, and later called it “DISGRACEFUL!” that Mr. Sessions was not investigating surveillance abuse. “How Trump’s Saturday Night Massacre Might Start With Jeff Sessions,” blared a headline this month in New York magazine. Some White House officials believe that Scott Pruitt, an ambitious lawyer who is the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is behind rumors that he is in line to replace Mr. Sessions. And yet, Mr. Sessions remains in his job, at least for now. Some associates speculate that Mr. Trump realizes that firing his attorney general would cross a red line for many in his own party, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. “When the shoe drops on Sessions or Kelly, no one is going to be surprised,” Mr. Daley said. “But the long goodbye totally deflates their ability to be effective.” At times, when Mr. Trump is focused on a specific person, he has taken action — hiring Mr. Kelly to replace Reince Priebus, for instance, or empowering Mr. Kelly to expedite the departure of Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s onetime chief strategist. Recently, people close to Mr. Trump say that he has begun to feel more confident that he understands the job of president. He is relying more on his own instincts, putting a premium on his personal chemistry with people and their willingness to acknowledge that his positions are ultimately administration policy, rather than on their résumé or qualifications for the job. That could explain the president’s decision to replace Mr. Tillerson and his choice of successor for Mr. Cohn. If people are unwilling to do what he wants, one adviser said, Mr. Trump now believes that he can get things done himself. Right now, Mr. Trump is surrounded by cabinet officials and a chief of staff who either have caused him negative headlines, such as Mr. Carson and Mr. Shulkin, or have declined to do what he wants, such as Mr. McMaster, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Sessions. Contrary to the notion that Mr. Trump is surrounded by sycophants, the president has aides who are willing to say “no.” But he has increasingly grown frustrated when they do. Mr. Trump also grew frustrated last year with Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, for refusing to enact a ban on transgender members of the military. Mr. Mattis essentially ignored Mr. Trump for several weeks, White House officials said, until the president finally went around him and tweeted it. But Mr. Mattis appears to be safe, even when he ignores the president, in part because he is a general who in Mr. Trump’s mind “looks the part” of a military leader. Mr. Kelly has not fared as well. A few weeks ago, when the scandal surrounding Rob Porter, the staff secretary, exploded into view, Mr. Trump began working the phones to old friends, telling them that he needed his former advisers back and complaining that he was surrounded by people he did not know. He told them that Mr. Kelly had badly botched the Porter issue. (His language was saltier and unfit for publication, according to several people with knowledge of the calls.) This week, he was not in the loop for some of Mr. Trump’s decisions, people briefed on the discussions said, including that he was not immediately aware that Mr. Trump was seriously considering Larry Kudlow for the director of the National Economic Council. Since the Porter scandal, the president has mulled over a number of potential replacements for Mr. Kelly, but he has kept his own counsel about his plans, according to several people close to him. In remarks on Tuesday at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Kelly, calling him a “four star” general who is “doing a great job in Washington.” But in a bit of potential foreshadowing, the president also told the Marines in the audience: “I think he likes what you do better than what he does, but he’s doing a great job. He misses you.” "
