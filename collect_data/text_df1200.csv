0,"CHANDLER, Ariz. — Hannah O’Sullivan dipped her toe in professional golf, and the next thing she knew she was being carried by a swift current away from college and toward the L.P.G.A. The same white-knuckle course had deposited others like Cristie Kerr, Morgan Pressel, Paula Creamer, Lexi Thompson and Lydia Ko into the shallow pool of major winners. But as O’Sullivan hurtled toward a pro career, she did something considered radical in today’s carpe-diem sports culture. She abruptly changed courses, withdrawing from L.P.G.A. qualifying school last fall and renewing her commitment to attend college. Like a swimmer caught in a riptide, O’Sullivan relaxed and floated back to shore. In the midst of a gap year before entering Duke, O’Sullivan, 18, will compete in the women’s first major tournament of the season, the ANA Inspiration, which begins Thursday in Rancho Mirage, Calif. At last year’s event, she tied for 65th to share low amateur honors with Albane Valenzuela of Stanford. In a climate where the women’s top player, Ko, first reached No. 1 at age 17 and the average age of the players in the top 10 is 24, O’Sullivan’s refusal to put a full-time golf career ahead of a college experience sets her apart. It is as distinctive as her historic Symetra Tour victory a few months before her 17th birthday and her United States Women’s Amateur championship a few months later. “There’s so many people out on tour right now who are obviously doing super well at 17 or 18 years old,” said O’Sullivan, whose first name is pronounced HAH-nah. “But I realized for me a college experience is really important, and I didn’t really see the reason to push past that.” O’Sullivan was speaking during a break in an afternoon hitting session at Whirlwind Golf Club, near her home in the Phoenix suburbs. It was three days after she missed the cut in her first competition in several months, the L.P.G.A. Founders Cup in Phoenix, and the temperature had climbed into the mid-90s. At the start of her practice, O’Sullivan was the only person at the back of the spacious range.

1,"HONG KONG — As China looks to spread its economic influence around the world, it is taking a bigger interest in financial companies, a move that could raise scrutiny in the era of President Trump. In the latest deal, CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, agreed on Wednesday to buy a stake in a century-old New York boutique investment bank, the Cowen Group. For Cowen, the deal brings an injection of cash and debt financing and the promise of better access to the Chinese market. CEFC gets a ready-made springboard into high finance in the United States. It is the latest example of surging amounts of Chinese investment targeting overseas companies, especially American ones. Chinese firms made 173 deals targeting American businesses in 2016, according to data compiled by the research firm Dealogic, for a total value of $67.8 billion, more than the total for the six previous years. But the strategy is not a sure bet. Previous attempts by Chinese companies to penetrate American financial services have come under regulatory scrutiny or struggled to generate hoped-for financial returns, though Cowen’s chairman, Peter Cohen, said he viewed his deal as “pretty benign” from a regulatory standpoint. A decade ago, the China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, bought a stake in Morgan Stanley, a deal that signaled a shift in the investment strategy of organizations with links to the Chinese government away from domestic acquisitions to overseas purchases.

2,"NEWARK — Two former allies of Gov. Chris Christie were sentenced to prison on Wednesday for their role in closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political payback against a New Jersey mayor, a key chapter in the plot that derailed Mr. Christie’s presidential aspirations and then dimmed his chances to become President Trump’s pick for vice president. Bridget Anne Kelly, 44, who was a top aide to Mr. Christie, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, while Bill Baroni, 45, who served as deputy executive director at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was sentenced to two years in prison. The scandal, which became known as Bridgegate, was as brazen as it was bizarre. In an effort to punish Mayor Mark J. Sokolich of Fort Lee, a Democrat, for not supporting Mr. Christie’s re-election bid and his desire to cultivate bipartisan support ahead of a presidential run, members of the governor’s administration schemed with Port Authority officials to trigger a massive traffic jam in Fort Lee. Over five days in September 2013, the gridlock ensnared emergency vehicles, school buses and commuters, even as Mr. Baroni ignored Mr. Sokolich’s messages seeking an explanation. The plan was put into motion by Ms. Kelly’s now infamous email to David Wildstein, Mr. Baroni’s top deputy at the Port Authority, who pleaded guilty for his role in the scandal in 2015: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” The seven-week trial last fall of Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly revealed Mr. Christie’s aggressive political operation, which seemed as focused on carving a path to the White House as it was on the needs of New Jersey. While Mr. Christie was never charged in the scandal, Judge Susan D. Wigenton alluded to the political culture his administration created on Wednesday as she handed down her sentences against Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly at the federal courthouse in Newark, calling it a toxic “with us or against us” mentality detrimental to New Jersey residents.

3,"Shortly after hundreds of students at Texas A&M University protested an appearance in December by Richard Spencer, a leading white supremacist, administrators there revisited its policy for hosting speakers on its campus. The task was not easy. The university expressed support for free speech, while emphasizing that Mr. Spencer’s remarks — at one point he said that America “belongs to white men” — did not reflect its values, said Amy B. Smith, a university spokeswoman. It also had to consider the extra burden of security costs. Eventually, Texas A&M settled on a new policy: All speakers must now be sponsored by a student, faculty member or organization affiliated with the university. The rule would have affected Mr. Spencer’s appearance, which was arranged by a private citizen who had paid about $3,000 to rent space at a student center. “We certainly don’t want to be affiliated with this guy,” Ms. Smith said in a telephone interview in which she declined to mention Mr. Spencer by name. “You are either for free speech or you are not, but with this person it was jarring because everything he stands for is against our core values, and we don’t want that reflected on our university in any way.” The new policy, posted on the university’s website in February and reported by CNN last week, is intended to give students or other groups affiliated with the university priority when assigning facilities. If the university is going to incur security and overtime costs associated with controversial speakers, Ms. Smith said, at least it will be for its own students. “We are not an American Legion hall,” she said. The university, a state institution with about 66,000 students located in College Station in east-central Texas, is not alone. In interviews, officials at a half dozen higher education institutions say they are taking steps to address the consequences of allowing provocative speakers amid heightened awareness of racial, ethnic, religious and diversity issues after the election of Donald J. Trump. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/texas-aandm-speaking-policy-richard-spencer.html?searchResultPosition=84
4,"A Chinese company with ownership ties to some of the Communist Party’s leading families has ended talks to invest billions of dollars in a Manhattan office tower owned by the family of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a senior White House aide. The Chinese financial conglomerate, Anbang Insurance Group, and the Kushner Companies “mutually agreed to end talks regarding the property,” a Kushner Companies spokesman said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. The development came days after Democratic lawmakers wrote letters to the Office of White House Counsel and Treasury Secretary, expressing concern that the possible deal could breach federal ethics rules, and as Mr. Trump is preparing to meet Xi Jinping, China’s president, for their first summit at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The possible $4-billion deal between the two companies, first reported by The New York Times in January, would have paired a company led by a man who married the granddaughter of China’s late paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, with the family company of Mr. Kushner, a principal White House adviser on foreign affairs, including China policy. Any deal faced headwinds on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. In the United States, it was subject to increasing scrutiny by lawmakers, who also called on the government committee that reviews overseas investment to scrutinize the agreement for possible national security issues. In China, government regulators are trying to stanch the loss of foreign exchange reserves, and are wary of signing off on multibillion dollar deals in industries, such as commercial real estate, not deemed to have strategic value. Plans for the redevelopment, which envisioned gutting the aging office tower and erecting a soaring glass-sheathed tower with luxury residences, a hotel and retail spaces designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid, will now require a new investor. “Kushner Companies remains in active, advanced negotiations around 666 5th Avenue with a number of potential investors,” the company spokesman said in a statement. A spokesman for Anbang declined to comment. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/nyregion/talks-end-between-kushners-and-chinese-company.html?searchResultPosition=85
5,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — The party once ruled China, helping to vanquish Japan in World War II. Defeated by Mao Zedong’s Communists, it fled to Taiwan, where it imposed martial law for decades before grudgingly yielding to popular demands for democracy. But now the days of power and wealth are gone for the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, as it struggles to stay relevant in Taiwan politics — a situation that has implications for Beijing and Washington. After a disastrous performance in last year’s general election, the Kuomintang, also known as the K.M.T., lost control of the presidency for the second time since Taiwan’s presidential elections began in 1996. For the first time, it is a minority party in the island’s legislature. “The K.M.T. is looking for its footing in a new environment,” said Nathan Batto, assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica and an expert on Taiwan’s elections. How it will adapt to challenges on several fronts is still an open question. The Kuomintang’s base is made up of those who think of themselves “as Chinese in some way,” Mr. Batto said. That base, however, is now only 20 to 40 percent of voters. Corporations seeking access to the Chinese market are an additional pillar of support — especially financial. The Kuomintang is under investigation regarding public and private assets it seized after arriving in Taiwan seven decades ago. In the 1990s, Kuomintang assets totaled $2.9 billion, according to party data. Its assets now frozen, it has recently cut staff from 800 to under 400 because of insufficient funds.

Mr. Hannity is often very upset, at things like the past friendships of President Barack Obama; the suspected political leanings of his former colleague Megyn Kelly; the resignation of Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser; and the tweets of media reporters from rival news organizations. But the primary target of his anger in recent days has been Ted Koppel, a veteran news anchor and contributor to “CBS Sunday Morning,” which last weekend broadcast a clip from an interview with Mr. Hannity that the Fox star did not like at all. The interview was conducted by Mr. Koppel roughly three weeks ago, Mr. Hannity said on his show Monday night, and had been presented to him as an opportunity to discuss the political polarization in American life. But only a minute or so of the full interview was used. And it looks as though it may have been the part that Mr. Hannity found the most insulting. The night before the segment aired, CBS News posted online a part of the interview in which Mr. Hannity described his upbringing, which he said shaped his views. But in the televised footage, he was shown complaining about socialism, liberalism and “angry snowflakes,” right-wing slang for liberals that conservatives see as easily upset. Then he led with his chin: Mr. Hannity asked if Mr. Koppel, an elder statesman of broadcast news who hosted the ABC show “Nightline” for 25 years, thought he and his show were “bad for America.” Mr. Koppel responded, “Yeah.” “Really?” Mr. Hannity responded, his voice rising an octave or two. “That’s sad, Ted.

7,"“You’ve got lovely beds. Good beds,” the actress Patti LuPone said. She was referring not to furniture, but fingernails: the unvarnished ones on the hands of her current co-star, Christine Ebersole. They contrasted markedly with Ms. LuPone’s nails, which she herself had lacquered in shiny maroon, after years observing professional manicurists. “I watch how they depress the fluid,” Ms. LuPone said, pantomiming bottle and brush. “The problem is, when I put nail polish on it really weakens my nails,” Ms. Ebersole said in a sisterly way. “They just flake off.” The talons were out, in other words, but this was not a catfight. More a chat ’n’ chew between Tony Award-winning actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in “War Paint,” one of a half-dozen new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends. Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves, the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue, where the flagship of Elizabeth Arden’s signature spa, the Red Door, moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north. They had refused treatments and were instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups. In “War Paint,” which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6, Ms. Ebersole, 64, plays Miss Arden, née Florence Nightingale Graham: the entrepreneur who made cosmetics, long associated with prostitutes, acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s. Ms. LuPone, 67, plays Arden’s less-remembered but equally esteemed competitor, Helena Rubinstein, who imparted both artistic and clinical prestige to the pursuit of beauty, and who is credited with the phrase “there are no ugly women, only lazy ones.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/theater/patti-lupone-christine-ebersole-war-paint-broadway.html?searchResultPosition=88

She was talking to a friend in Spanish when a man approached her and began calling her racist names. Afterwards, her husband asked her to buy mace so she could protect herself. The second time Ms. Russ experienced racist harassment after the election of President Trump, it came in the form of a note left on her car while it was parked outside her home in Phoenix. The note included a swastika, a racial slur and the phrases “Trump won” and “go back to Mexco.” “The thing that stuck out was they couldn’t even spell ‘Mexico’ properly,” Ms. Russ said. The third time was at the grocery store, in January. Ms. Russ was talking on her phone in Spanish when a woman walked by and said, “I can’t wait for them to deport you.” This time, Ms. Russ said, “I was just fed up.” She confronted the woman, who claimed she had been talking to someone on the phone.

9,"President Trump has repeatedly slammed pharmaceutical companies for “getting away with murder” on soaring drug prices, but he and his nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration have pledged to ease industry regulations and speed approvals for medicines and other consumer products. The nominee, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, has spent the bulk of his career working in the drug and health care industry, which experts say raises the potential for myriad conflicts of interest. If confirmed to head the F.D.A., he would wield considerable power over companies and investment firms that have paid him millions of dollars over the years. From 2013 to 2015, for example, Dr. Gottlieb received more than $150,000 to advise Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a company whose two approved drugs are seen as breakthrough treatments for cystic fibrosis but carry list prices of more than $250,000 a year. He’s the acting chief executive of Cell Biotherapy, an early-stage cancer biotech firm that he helped found. He has served for years as a consultant to pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol-Myers Squibb and is paid by other companies for his expertise. Dr. Gottlieb plans to recuse himself for one year from any agency decisions involving about 20 health care companies he worked with, according to an ethics agreement made public Wednesday. But that is unlikely to mollify critics who argue that someone with such close industry relationships should not be in charge of an agency whose mission is to protect consumers and uphold safety standards for products from lipstick to lifesaving cancer therapies. “If you have a commissioner who is that conflicted, recusal is a tricky business,” said Susan F. Wood, who resigned as the director of the F.D.A.’s Office of Women’s Health in 2005 in protest over the agency’s decision to delay over-the-counter approval of the morning-after pill. Dr. Gottlieb’s nomination comes at a momentous time for the agency, which Mr. Trump has promised to significantly remake. The next commissioner will be charged with putting into practice a far-reaching law, passed in December, aimed at bringing drugs to market more quickly. Congress also must reauthorize a set of bills this year that determine how much the drug and medical device industry will pay in user fees, which fund more than half of the agency’s budget to review new drugs.

10,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief. Asif Mahmood was born in a small village in rural Pakistan. He came to the United States 26 years ago to study medicine, and is today a pulmonologist in Pasadena. At age 56, he has decided to run for lieutenant governor of California. “The divisive and hateful agenda of Donald Trump compels me to run,” Dr. Mahmood said Tuesday in an interview. “I am a proud Muslim. I am a Muslim immigrant. I am from the state of California. I am a triple threat to Donald Trump.” Dr. Mahmood will officially announce his first bid for public office Wednesday morning.

That said, there are already a number of Muslims in public office across the country, including two Muslims in Congress, according to Mohammed Nadeem, the executive director of the Muslim Observer, which tracks these kinds of elections. (And in Michigan, a Muslim man is running for governor.) Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the incumbent, is barred by term limits from seeking a third term; he is running for governor.

11,"SEOUL, South Korea — As President Trump struggles to devise a North Korea strategy, one country’s voice has been largely missing from public debate: South Korea’s. Yet South Koreans would bear the brunt of the retaliation should Mr. Trump opt for a “pre-emptive” strike against the North Korean regime. Long-term peace on the Korean Peninsula is impossible without Seoul’s input. South Korea’s lack of influence with the Trump administration was evident during Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s recent visit to Asia. He held considerably shorter meetings with the South Koreans than with officials in Tokyo, and he did not even dine with his counterparts in Seoul. The South Korean side claimed Mr. Tillerson was tired (giving rise to “stamina” jokes on Twitter). The secretary fired back that his South Korean hosts had never sent a dinner invitation. South Koreans are partly to blame for being marginalized. The country has been preoccupied since last year by a political scandal that embroiled President Park Geun-hye and ultimately led to her removal from office on March 10. The place-holder government of Park appointees maintains her hard-line posture toward North Korea but without legitimacy in the eyes of the public. South Korea’s political vacuum will come to an end when the country votes on May 9 for a new leader, who will take office immediately. The election will have far-reaching implications for the Korean Peninsula — and for Mr. Trump’s North Korea policy. The liberal opposition is widely expected to win, with the Democratic Party standard-bearer, Moon Jae-in, maintaining a comfortable lead in the polls. The conservatives are in disarray, having split into pro-Park and anti-Park parties; they have yet to find a presidential candidate who polls over 10 percent. South Korean elections are notoriously unpredictable, but public disgust with the impeached president is casting a pall over the conservative camp. North Korea policy is one of the sharpest points of divergence between liberals and conservatives in the South. The hard-line conservative approach of all sticks and no carrots was unpopular by the time Ms. Park took office in 2013. Early on, she appeared to be looking for middle ground: She advocated building trust with Pyongyang and did not make denuclearization a precondition for inter-Korean dialogue. But as time passed, it became clear that Ms. Park’s interest in improving relations was all talk. After North Korea’s fourth nuclear test in January 2016, she abruptly shifted back to harsh rhetoric and hard-line policies, most notably by shutting down the joint North-South industrial park at Kaesong.

12,"WASHINGTON — This year, America’s war in Afghanistan will pass a grim milestone as it surpasses the Civil War in duration, as measured against the final withdrawal of Union forces from the South. Only the conflict in Vietnam lasted longer. United States troops have been in Afghanistan since October 2001 as part of a force that peaked at nearly 140,000 troops (of which about 100,000 were American) and is estimated to have cost the taxpayers at least $783 billion. Despite this heavy expenditure, the United States commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., recently called for a modest troop increase to prevent a deteriorating stalemate. The fall of Sangin in Helmand Province to the Taliban this month is a tactical loss that may be reversed, but it certainly suggests the situation is getting worse. With the Trump administration’s plan to increase the military budget while slashing the diplomatic one, there is a risk that American policy toward Afghanistan will be defined in purely military terms. Absent from the current debate is a clear statement of our objectives — and a way to end the Afghan war while preserving the investment and the gains we have made, at the cost of some 2,350 American lives. It has always been clear to senior military officers like Gen. David H. Petraeus, who was the American commander in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011, as well as to diplomats like me, that the war could end only through a political settlement, a process through which the Afghan government and the Taliban would reconcile their differences in an agreement also acceptable to the international community. The challenges of bringing about such a reconciliation are formidable, but the basic outline of a deal is tantalizingly obvious. Despite more than 15 years of warfare, the United States has never had a fundamental quarrel with the Taliban per se; it was the group’s hosting of Al Qaeda that drove our intervention after the Sept. 11 attacks. For its part, the Taliban has never expressed any desire to impose its medieval ideology outside of Afghanistan, and certainly not in the United States. The core Afghan government requirements for a settlement are that the Taliban ceases violence, breaks with international terrorism and accepts the Afghan Constitution. The Taliban, for its part, insists that all foreign forces withdraw. No doubt, both sides have additional desiderata, but the basic positions do not seem unbridgeable. This is particularly the case now that the Islamic State has emerged in Afghanistan, in conflict with both the government and the Taliban.

13,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The college dropout phenomenon exacts a terrible price on American society. More than 25 percent of people in their 30s who have attended college at some point have no degree — neither a community-college degree nor a bachelor’s degree. They fare vastly worse in the job market than their counterparts who do graduate (despite all the overwrought commentary claiming that education is overrated). A typical college graduate working full-time earns 54 percent more than a full-time worker who attended some college but has no degree. And that statistic understates the gap, because college graduates are also much more likely to have full-time jobs. So how can the United States help more college students finish what they started? That question is the subject of a two-part Fixes column, by Tina Rosenberg, that she has just finished. Her first installment looked at the importance of small infusions of cash to lower-income students. Her latest piece examines the upside of inflexibility: “Colleges use different parts of the strategy and give it different names, although it often goes by ‘guided pathways,’” Rosenberg writes. “The underlying idea is to give students firm guidance in choosing the right courses, along with structured, clear course sequences that lead to graduation. Colleges also monitor students’ progress closely and intervene when they go off track.” One of her shining examples is at the City University of New York, which I’ve previously praised as an engine of economic mobility. Rosenberg’s two pieces address a topic of real importance. Elsewhere, Jonathan Chait of New York magazine explains that Trump’s climate policy will do a lot of damage to the planet but won’t stop the green-energy revolution. Sarah Jones of the New Republic makes a full-throated case for single-payer health care in the wake of Trumpcare’s implosion. As for the newfound claims by House Republicans that now they’re really going to repeal Obamacare: Color me skeptical. The same problems that kept them from passing a bill remain. Carl Hulse, The Times’s chief Washington correspondent, had a cleareyed column earlier this week on the larger issue.

He talked about the so-called mansion tax in at least five separate events in one month in 2015, attempting to create momentum in Albany that never materialized. He has pushed it at a dozen events since rekindling the idea during a January budget address, and with increasing tenacity in recent weeks, including while chomping pickles at a diner with three older constituents on Facebook Live and during a mass conference call on Monday. “If we speak loudly, Albany will listen,” he said during his State of the City address. It has not worked out that way. The State Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Republican, has called the idea a “non-starter.” Likewise, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has seemed uninterested in helping out Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. “That proposal was made in January,” the governor said on Monday. “It never went anywhere in January and it hasn’t gone anywhere since.” Nevertheless, Mr. de Blasio has persevered, eagerly playing the snowball to Albany’s hell. He has dismissed those who say it cannot get through the state capital, and compared it to universal prekindergarten, one of his signature initiatives as mayor, which initially met resistance in Albany. But whereas that effort ultimately succeeded, the main sticking point was in fact a new tax on high-income earners that Mr. de Blasio wanted to levy, to pay for it. The tax component quickly fell by the wayside, but not before the mayor’s stubborn insistence, still near the outset of his term, set him permanently on the wrong foot with Mr. Cuomo and Republicans in the State Senate.

15,"Another day and, for many, another worrisome news alert out of Washington — or two, or three. Travel bans. Policy reversals. Wire taps. In October, during the buildup to Election Day, we heard from therapists about how their patients were feeling fearful, angry and distrustful in reaction to the contentious presidential race. Now, these same therapists report that many of their patients are even more upset as they struggle to make sense of the direction in which the country is heading. And many can’t tear themselves away from the news. “So much is coming at us,” said Sue Elias, a psychotherapist in New York City. “There’s a chronic sense of anxiety among my patients that I have never seen before.” Indeed, Americans are reporting even higher levels of stress than they did before the election, according to a report from the American Psychological Association released in February. And like so many issues these days, the stress appears to be partisan. The report, called Stress in America: Coping with Change, was based on a Harris Poll of more than 3,500 American adults in August, with a follow-up of more than 1,000 men and women in January. While 26 percent of Republicans polled after the election said the political climate was a source of stress, 72 percent of Democrats said they felt that way. The report also found that 86 percent of adults constantly or often check their email, texts and social media accounts, and that those who are constant checkers are more likely to experience stress. The cycle of vigilance can be insidious. “The election results caused feelings of uncertainty,” which leads many people to check the news and search for information to help them cope, said Dr. Eric Hollander, a professor of psychiatry and the director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum program at Einstein — Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. If people see a tweet about wiretapping or deportations, for example, and try to look up news articles about it, what they find often “only heightens the worry and perpetuates the cycle,” he said.

17,"Updated, 10:13 a.m. Good morning on this brisk-to-brilliant Wednesday. Fineline Tattoo is one of the oldest continuously running tattoo shops in the city, but it used to be an underground operation. As recently as 1997, tattooing was illegal in most of New York City. In 1961, the Health Department said the art form was responsible for a hepatitis outbreak and banned it for nearly 40 years. But in the 1970s, Fineline Tattoo began operating out of the Lower East Side home of Mike Bakaty, a sculptor-turned-professional tattoo artist. His secret business at 295 Bowery, the building known as McGurk’s Suicide Hall, was one of the few tattoo parlors in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens or the Bronx. In 1997, just before the ban was lifted, the Bakaty family moved Fineline Tattoo to a storefront at First Avenue and First Street in the East Village — where it remains today. The walls inside the shop are covered in designs ranging from Mickey Mouse and Betty Boop to dragons, swords and snakes. The counters are neatly organized with spray bottles and tubes of colored ink. On one desk is a photograph of Mr. Bakaty’s son, Mehai, now 44, with James Gandolfini. Mehai Bekaty said the actor came in for a tattoo just months before “The Sopranos” star died. Mehai Bakaty, whose childhood home doubled as the shop, says he remembers doing chores in the studio to earn part of his allowance, and falling asleep to the sound of his father’s tattooing machine.

On Tuesday afternoon, President Trump went to the headquarters of the E.P.A. to sign an executive order on environmental regulations. That executive order directs the agency to begin the legal process of repealing and replacing the clean power plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s policies to fight global warming. On today’s episode: • President Obama’s policies on the environment spelled the end for the coal industry. Now President Trump is promising to restore thousands of coal jobs and do away with Obama’s legacy on climate change. We speak with Coral Davenport, who covers energy and the environment for the Times. • This afternoon Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, delivers a letter to the president of the European Council notifying him that after 44 years of membership, her country is leaving the E.U.

The president’s policy will help their industry, but market forces that favor rivals like natural gas and renewable energy may limit its effect.

Well, that was stupid. I apologize.” The original comment came during a segment on the network’s morning show, in which Mr. O’Reilly was shown observing a speech by Ms. Waters, a frequent critic of President Trump. When asked for his thoughts, Mr. O’Reilly said, “I didn’t hear a word she said. I was looking at the James Brown wig.” The comment was met with laughter off camera.

Tom Price left the House seat to become Mr. Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services, and we won’t know who will replace him until April 18 at the earliest. The district hasn’t voted for a Democrat in decades, but that could soon change. Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old Democrat and first-time candidate, has fared well in recent polls and has raised an astonishing $3 million in only a few months. Mr. Trump struggled to victory in this district, a well-educated suburban area north of Atlanta. He won by just 1.5 percentage points, down from Mitt Romney’s 23-point win in 2012. It would be a mistake to read too much into the result of this one election. Special elections tend to stand on their own, and there are reasons to think that Democrats have a better chance than the district’s voting in congressional races suggests. But at this point, it wouldn’t be shocking if Mr. Ossoff got the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff in June. The idea of a competitive race here would have come as a surprise to many just a few months ago. Mr. Price won re-election with a healthy 62 percent of the vote, which observers have held up as a stronger indicator of the district’s partisanship than Mr. Trump’s performance.

23,"Ivanka Trump, the elder daughter of President Trump, is becoming an official government employee, joining her husband, Jared Kushner, in serving as an unpaid adviser to her father in the White House. The announcement on Wednesday amounts to the formal recognition of the value Mr. Trump places on the judgment and loyalty of both his daughter and his son-in-law. While relying on family members for advice is hardly unusual for a president, giving them a formal role has few precedents. Ms. Trump, 35, will be an assistant to the president; Mr. Kushner, 36, has the title of senior adviser. When questions were raised about whether Mr. Kushner’s appointment violated federal anti-nepotism laws, the Justice Department wrote a memo in January concluding that the rules did not apply to the White House. Ms. Trump said last week that she planned on serving as an informal adviser to her father, and she already has an office in the West Wing — upstairs from her husband’s. She was also in the process of receiving government-issued security clearance and communications devices. But that plan had prompted criticism from ethics experts, who had said it would allow her to avoid financial disclosure rules. “This arrangement appears designed to allow Ms. Trump to avoid the ethics, conflict-of-interest and other rules that apply to White House employees,” Norman L. Eisen and Richard W. Painter, White House ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, wrote in a letter to Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel.

24,"HONOLULU — A federal judge in Hawaii decided Wednesday to extend his order blocking President Trump’s travel ban. The judge, Derrick Watson of Federal District Court, issued the longer-lasting hold on the ban just hours after hearing arguments. Hawaii says the policy discriminates against Muslims and hurts the state’s tourist-dependent economy. The implied message in the revised ban is like a “neon sign flashing ‘Muslim ban, Muslim ban,’” that the government didn’t bother to turn off, the state’s attorney general, Douglas Chin, told the judge. Extending the temporary order until the state’s lawsuit is resolved will ensure the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens across the U.S. are vindicated after “repeated stops and starts of the last two months,” the state has said. The government says the ban falls within the president’s power to protect national security. Hawaii has made only generalized concerns about its effect on students and tourism, a Department of Justice lawyer, Chad Readler, told the judge via telephone. The Trump administration had asked Judge Watson to narrow his ruling to cover only the part of Mr. Trump’s executive order that suspends new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. Mr. Readler said a freeze on the United States refugee program had no effect on Hawaii. Judge Watson rejected that argument, preventing the administration from halting the flow of refugees. Judge Watson said in court that the government only argued for that narrower interpretation after a federal judge in Maryland blocked the six-nation travel ban but said it was not clear that the refugee suspension was similarly motivated by religious bias. The judge noted that the government said 20 refugees were resettled in Hawaii since 2010. “Is this a mathematical exercise that 20 isn’t enough? ... What do I make of that?” the judge asked Mr. Readler. The government lawyer replied that 20 is simply a small number of refugees. “In whose judgment?” Judge Watson asked. Hawaii was the first state to sue over Mr. Trump’s revised ban. The imam of a Honolulu mosque joined the challenge, arguing that the ban would prevent his Syrian mother-in-law from visiting family in Hawaii. In his arguments, Mr. Chin quoted Mr. Trump’s comments that the revised travel ban is a “watered down” version of the original. “We cannot fault the president for being politically incorrect, but we do fault him for being constitutionally incorrect,” Mr. Chin said. Earlier this month, Judge Watson prevented the federal government from suspending new visas for people from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and freezing the nation’s refugee program. His ruling came just hours before the federal government planned to start enforcing Mr. Trump’s executive order. Mr. Trump called Judge Watson’s previous ruling an example of “unprecedented judicial overreach.” Hawaii’s ruling would not be directly affected by a decision siding with the federal government in the Maryland case, legal experts said. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit set a hearing for May 8 to consider the administration’s appeal.

25,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, moved late on Wednesday to reject the scientific conclusion of the agency’s own chemical safety experts who under the Obama administration recommended that one of the nation’s most widely used insecticides be permanently banned at farms nationwide because of the harm it potentially causes children and farm workers. The ruling by Mr. Pruitt, in one of his first formal actions as the nation’s top environmental official, rejected a petition filed a decade ago by two environmental groups that had asked that the agency ban all uses of chlorpyrifos. The chemical was banned in 2000 for use in most household settings, but still today is used at about 40,000 farms on about 50 different types of crops, ranging from almonds to apples. Late last year, and based in part on research conducted at Columbia University, E.P.A. scientists concluded that exposure to the chemical that has been in use since 1965 was potentially causing significant health consequences. They included learning and memory declines, particularly among farm workers and young children who may be exposed through drinking water and other sources. But Dow Chemical, which sells the product under the trade name Lorsban, along with farm groups that use it, had argued that the science demonstrating that chlorpyrifos caused such harm is inconclusive — especially when properly used to kill crop-spoiling insects. An E.P.A. scientific review panel made up of academic experts last July also had raised questions about some of the conclusions the chemical safety staff had reached. That led the staff to revise the way it had justified its findings of harm, although the agency employees as of late last year still concluded that the chemical should be banned. Mr. Pruitt, in an announcement issued Wednesday night, said the agency needed to study the science more.

26,"In Decatur, Ill., far from the coal mines of Appalachia, Caterpillar engineers are working on the future of mining: mammoth haul trucks that drive themselves. The trucks have no drivers, not even remote operators. Instead, the 850,000-pound vehicles rely on self-driving technology, the latest in an increasingly autonomous line of trucks and drills that are removing some of the human element from digging for coal. When President Trump moved on Tuesday to dismantle the Obama administration’s climate change efforts, he promised it would bring coal-mining jobs back to America. But the jobs he alluded to — hardy miners in mazelike tunnels with picks and shovels — have steadily become vestiges of the past. Pressured by cheap and abundant natural gas, coal is in a precipitous decline, now making up just a third of electricity generation in the United States. Renewables are fast becoming competitive with coal on price. Electricity sales are trending downward, and coal exports are falling. All the while, the coal industry has been replacing workers with machines and explosives. Energy and labor specialists say that no one — including Mr. Trump — can bring them all back. “People think of coal mining as some 1890s, colorful, populous frontier activity, but it’s much better to think of it as a high-tech industry with far fewer miners and more engineers and coders,” said Mark Muro, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program.

27,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The United States launched more airstrikes in Yemen this month than during all of last year. In Syria, it has airlifted local forces to front-line positions and has been accused of killing civilians in airstrikes. In Iraq, American troops and aircraft are central in supporting an urban offensive in Mosul, where airstrikes killed scores of people on March 17. Two months after the inauguration of President Trump, indications are mounting that the United States military is deepening its involvement in a string of complex wars in the Middle East that lack clear endgames. Rather than representing any formal new Trump doctrine on military action, however, American officials say that what is happening is a shift in military decision-making that began under President Barack Obama. On display are some of the first indications of how complicated military operations are continuing under a president who has vowed to make the military “fight to win.” In an interview on Wednesday, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of United States Central Command, said the new procedures made it easier for commanders in the field to call in airstrikes without waiting for permission from more senior officers. “We recognized the nature of the fight was going to change and that we had to ensure that authorities were down to the right level and that we empowered the on-scene commander,” General Votel said. He was speaking specifically about discussions that he said began in November about how the fights in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State were reaching critical phases in Mosul and Raqqa. Concerns about the recent accusations of civilian casualties are bringing some of these details to light. But some of the shifts have also involved small increases in the deployment and use of American forces or, in Yemen, resuming aid to allies that had previously been suspended.

28,"ANKARA, Turkey — He has already met the Mexican and Chinese presidents and hosted a conclave of 68 nations fighting the Islamic State, but no meeting in Rex W. Tillerson’s brief tenure as secretary of state will be as delicate as the one in Ankara on Thursday with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan is the leader of an important NATO ally and is crucial in the fight against the Islamic State, but he is also a prickly strongman whose campaign to change Turkey’s Constitution in a referendum has many worried that the country is on the precipice of authoritarianism. The referendum has resulted in the worst divide between Europe and Turkey in decades, with Mr. Erdogan accusing European leaders of Nazi-like tendencies after they refused to allow officials of his government to address pro-referendum rallies. Mr. Erdogan also has serious reservations about the American plan to attack the Syrian city of Raqqa, the declared capital of the Islamic State, and has demanded that the United States extradite a Pennsylvania cleric who the government says was the mastermind behind a failed coup attempt last July. Navigating these difficulties would test the most seasoned of diplomats. Mr. Tillerson, though, has had a rocky start. On a recent trip to Asia, he stumbled repeatedly — disputing a South Korean explanation for his dinner plans and allowing China to crow over his use of language that American diplomats had long eschewed. Mr. Tillerson’s aides insist that he is still finding his footing in a complicated job. But experts in the region say there is no room for mistakes in his discussions Thursday evening with Mr. Erdogan. “It’s hard to think of a more important or more challenging relationship,” said Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state who visited Turkey three times last year to keep the relationship from foundering.

But on Wednesday, the first lady stepped out of the shadows, speaking out on behalf of women who battle gender discrimination and violence around the world. “Wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them,” Mrs. Trump said at a ceremony at the State Department that honored 13 women who have faced rapists, acid-wielding attackers and the prejudiced courts that often protect them. Speaking softly but firmly, from a teleprompter, Mrs. Trump challenged the members of her audience to put themselves in the shoes of these women — victims of domestic abuse, gender bias, or violence — who fought laws and social norms that sought to perpetuate the injustice. “Ask yourself if you would have the fortitude of spirit, the courage of your convictions, and the enormous inner strength required to stand up and fight against such overwhelming odds,” Mrs. Trump said, gesturing to the women, from Yemen to Sri Lanka, arrayed behind her. “Together,” she said, “we must declare that the era of allowing the brutality against women and children is over, while affirming that the time for empowering women around the world is now.” It was a pointed message for Mrs. Trump to deliver given the tumultuous last weeks of the 2016 campaign, when Donald J.

31,"One of America’s greatest contributions to international peace resulted from a historic investment in foreign aid. After defeating Fascism in World War II, Washington channeled billions of dollars into the war-torn nations of Europe and Japan, helping transform them into economic success stories and vital democratic allies. That’s a lesson worth remembering as President Trump tries to slash the State Department and its foreign aid programs by about 30 percent in the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, while raising Pentagon spending by 10 percent. The cruelest cuts may be a reported $1 billion reduction for the United Nations’ peacekeeping operations and programs that care for needy children. Mr. Trump seems to assume that national greatness comes from the barrel of a gun — he wants to expand the fleet of Navy ships and the nuclear arsenal — rather than from a combination of military might and “soft power” tools. One such tool is the example America sets by adhering to constitutional principles, the rule of law and human rights. Others involve pursuing smart diplomatic engagement and initiatives, including nuclear agreements and disaster assistance for some of the poorest countries. The State Department and foreign aid have long been targets for budget cutters because many Americans don’t understand what these programs do. Polls show that Americans overestimate how much federal spending goes to these programs. The actual number for foreign aid is about 1 percent of the budget, or $36.6 billion in 2017. And some of that money is spent in the United States. Diplomacy doesn’t always prevent war, Syria being one example, but war becomes far more likely if there are not enough diplomats to work with other countries to resolve disagreements. Compelling examples of diplomacy working include the 2015 deal that is preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; the 1995 Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnia War; and the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Other examples include several treaties that committed America and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals significantly. American diplomats have strengthened alliances, built new partnerships with countries like Cuba and Myanmar, promoted democracy so that countries are less likely to go to war with one another and created jobs by helping to open overseas markets to American business.

32,"LONDON — A law put forward by the Hungarian government would force a university founded by the Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Soros to shut its doors, the school’s top official said on Wednesday. The move, according to observers, was the latest development in a crackdown on free expression and liberal values under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has embraced President Trump and vociferously denounced Mr. Soros, a billionaire who is a frequent target of attacks by the right-wing news media in both the United States and Europe. The school, the Central European University, opened in Mr. Soros’s native Budapest in 1991, not long after the fall of communism and the start of Hungary’s uneven transition to democracy. The school is known as a center for research in the social sciences, with programs led by internationally prominent educators. The university has also given a platform to dissident voices, particularly in the period since Mr. Orban, who helped popularize the term “illiberal democracy,” came to power in 2010. Proponents of illiberal democracy place majority rule over civil liberties and minority rights, and they say that financiers like Mr. Soros are part of an elite capitalist class that puts cosmopolitan values over national interests. The university’s president and rector, Michael Ignatieff, is a human rights scholar and a former leader of the Liberal Party in Canada.

Speaking at the Brookings Institution, which released a ranking of choice options in the country’s 100 largest school districts, Ms. DeVos made her case for choice policies that she said focused on the “individual child.” And she called for the rejection of an “us versus them mentality” when it comes to investing in programs, like charter schools and school vouchers, to which President Trump has proposed giving part of a $1.4 billion funding increase in the fiscal year that begins in October. “Our nation’s commitment is to provide a quality education to every child to serve the greater public, common good,” Ms. DeVos said in her address. “Accordingly, we must shift the paradigm to think about education funding as investments made in individual children, not in institutions or buildings.” While Ms. DeVos offered no new details about the Education Department’s budget — which in the president’s budget blueprint takes a $9 billion, or 13.5 percent, cut — she rejected the notion that money was a panacea for the challenges facing public schools. She resurrected a report released by the Education Department in the final days of President Barack Obama’s administration, which showed that a program that funneled $7 billion into the nation’s worst-performing schools had little to no effect on academic results. The report, which was issued in January and examined the impact of School Improvement Grants, found “no significant impacts” on “math or reading test scores, high school graduation or college enrollment of students.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-school-choice-voucher.html?searchResultPosition=68

Tillerson has decided to lift all human rights conditions on a major sale of F-16 fighter jets and other arms to Bahrain in an effort to end a rift between the United States and a critical Middle East ally, according to administration and congressional officials involved in the debate. Mr. Tillerson’s decision comes as the Trump administration looks to bolster Sunni Arab states in the Middle East and find new ways to confront Iran in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain is a key player in that effort, and home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which patrols the strategic waterway. But the decision to drop the human rights assurances as a condition of the sale is bound to be read by Saudi Arabia and other states in the region as a sign that the new administration plans to ease its demands to protect and respect political dissidents and protesters. The conditions on the sale of 19 new American fighter jets, worth $2.8 billion, had been imposed by the Obama administration amid continuing concerns about the tiny Sunni monarchy’s crackdown against majority Shiites. The State Department declined to comment on queries about Mr. Tillerson’s decision, which has been discussed at length with some members of Congress but not yet publicly announced. The State Department on Wednesday notified Congress of its intent to proceed with the sale without the conditions, according to Micah Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Congress now has two review periods to examine the sale and raise any objections.

The Life
By John A. Farrell
Illustrated. 737 pages. Doubleday. $35. While writing “Richard Nixon: The Life,” John A. Farrell could not possibly have known who would be president on the day his fine book was published. That it happens to be Donald J. Trump is, for him, an extraordinary stroke of luck. To read this biography with an eye only toward the parallels between the two presidents would be lazy and unfair, a disservice to Farrell’s nuanced scholarship. But the context here is unignorable. The similarities between Nixon and Trump leap off the page like crickets. There is, first and most superficially, their nonpresidential looks — Trump with his roosterly combover, Nixon with jowls so low they formed an A-frame with his nose. More substantively, there’s the matter of their Old Testament fury at the news media. (“The press is the enemy,” Nixon told his aides. “Write that on the blackboard 100 times and never forget it.”) What else? Their thin skin. Their skyscraping paranoia. Their cavernous memory for slights. It’s hard to think of two modern presidents with a more dire case of political hemophilia. Once wounded, these men never stop bleeding. Like Trump, Nixon was a monomaniac on the stump, obsessed with the enemies lurking within.

The only problem: The boom is apparent everywhere except in the economic data. It’s not that the economy is stalling — far from it. But with the first quarter ending Friday, growth in the first three months of the Trump administration is looking much the way it did under President Barack Obama. In fact, experts see the gross domestic product in the quarter coming in at only about 1 percent, on an annualized basis — less than half the pace in the second half of 2016, and a far cry from President Trump’s own 4 percent target. “There is a temporal disconnect,” said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “There has been an incredible rise in sentiment, but the proof is in the pudding later.” Ms. Zentner expects growth of 1 percent this quarter, and considers recent data “solid,” but added that the big gap between expectations and reality “creates discomfort for economists and monetary policy makers.” “The divergence is stunning,” she added, drawing a distinction between “soft data” like consumer confidence and “hard data” like retail sales.

But their display of collegiality seemed intended primarily as a contrast to the explosive and often bewildering statements in recent days from the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, whose perceived closeness with the Trump White House has raised doubts about his ability to conduct an impartial investigation. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M.

41,"WASHINGTON — At an unusual Supreme Court argument on Wednesday, the justices tried to sort out who was responsible for a notorious 1984 murder in Washington. The legal question in the case was whether the convictions of seven defendants should be set aside because prosecutors had withheld evidence about another suspect. But the argument barely touched on legal principles. It was instead dominated by an intense effort to reconstruct what happened more than three decades ago. Prosecutors had presented no physical evidence, relying on eyewitness testimony. It was enough to convict eight defendants, including one who has since died, of brutally assaulting and killing Catherine Fuller. Twenty-five years after the trial, in 2010, lawyers for the defendants sought to reopen the case, saying their convictions had been tainted by violations of Brady v. Maryland, a 1963 Supreme Court decision that required prosecutors to turn over favorable evidence to the defense. They said prosecutors had withheld several kinds of evidence, most notably about another suspect, James McMillan. Mr. McMillan had been seen near the scene of the crime. After Ms. Fuller’s murder but before the trial, Mr. McMillan was arrested and later convicted on charges of robbing and assaulting two other middle-age women in the neighborhood. (Later, Mr. McMillan was convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering a woman in 1992, a few blocks from the alley where Ms. Fuller was killed.) Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, told the justices that “the evidence of the third-party perpetrator that petitioners have now put before this court is weak and speculative.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/justices-dig-through-1984-murder-weighing-withheld-evidence.html?searchResultPosition=76

A room full of men is seen as commanding to some, so, as usual, Mr. Trump is telling those who love him what they want to hear, and in this case, showing them what they want to see. To his supporters, the homogeneous room is probably a comforting change from the more mixed Obama administration, and an affirmation that the powerful, take-charge persona they voted for is, in fact, in office right now.

TAKOMA PARK, MD. To the Editor: Jill Filipovic makes the point that the lack of diversity is a deliberate appeal to those who want to go back to a white male-dominated America. I submit that the strategy goes even deeper. I see this as an attempt to divide the Democratic Party by positioning the present political crisis as a war between women and men. My support for Bernie Sanders was criticized by female friends and allies, including my sisters, as anti-feminist. I have supported female candidates and women’s issues at every turn. Wars, a quasi-police state, global warming, and the attack on immigrant, minority and women’s rights affect men and women equally. Right-thinking women and men must remain united to stop this coup.

43,"Calling the recent surge in opioid-related overdoses one of “the biggest public health and law-enforcement crises of our time,” prosecutors in Brooklyn announced the indictment on Wednesday of 34 people charged with running a sprawling drug ring that sold a potent new designer narcotic never before seen in New York City — furanyl fentanyl. Furanyl fentanyl — or White China, as it is sometimes known — is a chemical analogue of fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that can be as much 50 times as powerful as heroin and has been blamed in some areas of the country for killing more people than heroin itself. Prosecutors said that the furanyl fentanyl seized in Wednesday’s case was produced in China, shipped to the United States by private mail and sold for as little as $7 to $10 per dose by a network of distributors in all five boroughs of New York. “These synthetics are lethal, they are cheap and they continue to flood into our streets,” Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, said at a news conference detailing the charges. Mr. Gonzalez added that the monthslong investigation of the drug ring, nicknamed Operation Hardball, turned up evidence that the traffickers were earning as much as $1 million a year. Though furanyl fentanyl was made illegal by the federal government in November, it is a new enough phenomenon that it has not yet been classified as a controlled substance under New York State law. As with K2, a synthetic form of marijuana that wreaked havoc across the city this summer, producers of fentanyl and its analogues can sometimes avoid prosecution by tweaking the chemical recipe of the drug to work around specific provisions of the law. In the 357-count indictment, the prosecutors in Brooklyn charged some of the defendants with the attempted sale of heroin, saying that many of the distributors and street-level dealers thought that they were selling heroin, not a knockoff. The indictment also accused members of the ring, including a supplier based in Phoenix, with selling heroin and cocaine as well. The charges came just two weeks after Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the city would spend as much as $38 million year on a comprehensive plan to stem the tide of opiate addiction, which police officials have said resulted last year in between 1,200 and 1,300 deaths — or nearly four times the number of murders in New York. Under the mayor’s plan, the city intends to pursue a broad array of initiatives, including expanding treatment for addicts, focusing on opioid addiction at city hospitals, aggressively prosecuting distributors of the drugs and handing out medication that can stop opiate overdoses to all 23,000 city patrol officers.

Mr. Trump wants to cut funding for Meals on Wheels and other social services, while pouring billions of new dollars into the military.

45,"LONDON — On a day that blended dull ritual with undeniable historical import, Britain formally began its departure from the European Union with the delivery of a letter to Brussels, followed by lofty words from Prime Minister Theresa May in Parliament. Two years of grinding divorce negotiations now begin, with the outcome unclear, except that the talks are certain to be contentious and spiteful — and that the only sure winners will be lawyers and trade negotiators. For the first time, the European bloc is losing a member, not to mention its second-largest economy. The multilateral architecture that has shaped the Western world since the aftermath of World War II has taken a severe blow, and as the letter was delivered on Wednesday, questions abounded about whether this pivot toward nationalism and self-interest represented the beginning of a more volatile global era. When Britons voted last June to leave the European Union, the champions of “Brexit” argued that the country, with its exit, was at the front edge of a larger populist wave. Months later, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States only deepened the feeling that an anti-establishment political contagion was sweeping across Western democracies, upending the established order. Britain, the argument went, would be a winner in this new era. Few people predicted the British exit, and fewer still predicted Mr. Trump’s victory. But few predicted where things stand now, either: The European Union, if still ailing and dysfunctional, is far from dead. Populist parties are sinking in the polls in Germany and underperformed in the Dutch elections this month.

46,"WASHINGTON — It began with evidence of a breach of the Democratic National Committee’s computers and has now evolved into a sprawling counterintelligence investigation to determine whether there was any coordination between members of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign staff and the Russian government, perhaps even influencing the 2016 election. When James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, went before Congress on March 20 and confirmed the existence of the Trump-Russia investigation, it echoed of the Cold War investigations in which the bureau and the C.I.A. searched for agents hidden in the government who had spied for Moscow. A look back at those Cold War cases may reveal lessons for today’s investigators. Above all, those past cases show it could take years before the new investigation uncovers any answers. Spy hunts usually begin with an unexplained incident. In the Trump-Russia case, there was the hacking of the D.N.C.’s computers. In 1985, there was an arrest on the streets of Moscow. In June 1985, Burton Gerber, the chief of the Soviet-East European division of the Central Intelligence Agency, was about to sit down to dinner at his home in Washington when he received devastating news. Paul Stombaugh, a C.I.A. case officer, had just been arrested by the K.G.B. in Moscow. Mr. Stombaugh had been caught while he was on a clandestine mission to meet the C.I.A.’s most important Russian spy, Adolf Tolkachev, a scientist at a secret military design facility who had been providing the Americans with top-secret information about Soviet weapons systems. Mr. Gerber knew that Mr. Stombaugh’s arrest meant that Mr. Tolkachev, an agent the C.I.A. had code-named GTVANQUISH, had certainly been arrested as well.

47,"On Tuesday afternoon, while most people were focused on the latest news from the House Intelligence Committee, the House quietly voted to undo rules that keep internet service providers — the companies like Comcast, Verizon and Charter that you pay for online access — from selling your personal information. The Senate already approved the bill, on a party-line vote, last week, which means that in the coming days President Trump will be able to sign legislation that will strike a significant blow against online privacy protection. The bill not only gives cable companies and wireless providers free rein to do what they like with your browsing history, shopping habits, your location and other information gleaned from your online activity, but it would also prevent the Federal Communications Commission from ever again establishing similar consumer privacy protections. The bill is an effort by the F.C.C.’s new Republican majority and congressional Republicans to overturn a simple but vitally important concept — namely that the information that goes over a network belongs to you as the consumer, not to the network hired to carry it. It’s an old idea: For decades, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, federal rules have protected the privacy of the information in a telephone call. In 2016, the F.C.C., which I led as chairman under President Barack Obama, extended those same protections to the internet. To my Democratic colleagues and me, the digital tracks that a consumer leaves when using a network are the property of that consumer. They contain private information about personal preferences, health problems and financial matters. Our Republican colleagues on the commission argued the data should be available for the network to sell. The commission vote was 3-2 in favor of consumers.

48,"Republicans just made clear how little they care about protecting the privacy of Americans by letting companies like Verizon and Comcast sell advertisers the internet browsing histories and other personal data of their customers without getting permission. The move could bolster the profits of the telecommunications industry by billions of dollars. Following a party-line vote in the Senate last week, the House approved a resolution on Tuesday that would overturn a broadband privacy regulation the Federal Communications Commission adopted in October. That rule requires cable and phone companies to obtain consent before using information like which websites people visited to show them customized ads and to build detailed profiles on them. The White House said on Tuesday that President Trump would sign the legislation, which would also prohibit the F.C.C. from adopting a similar policy in the future. Most Americans spend much of their lives online. They should be able to do so without fear that their internet service providers are logging their activities and selling the data. There is a long tradition of the government protecting such information. For example, the F.C.C. has long restricted what phone companies can do with call records. And in 1988 Congress prohibited video stores from disclosing the movies people rented. Republican lawmakers, like Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, say that the commission’s privacy rule is unfair because it applies only to broadband companies and not to internet businesses like Google and Facebook. This is highly disingenuous. Congress has only given the commission authority over telecommunications companies, so the F.C.C. couldn’t have come up with rules that applied to other businesses even if it wanted to. Telecom companies know a lot about what people do online because they are the gatekeepers through which people connect to the internet. And as people link household devices like thermostats, light bulbs and security cameras to the internet, these companies will have even more intimate knowledge about their customers. By comparison, people can more easily evade tracking by businesses like Google and Facebook by not using those services or by deleting the cookies those websites leave on their computers and phones. In the absence of strong privacy rules, people will have to rely on encryption to prevent service providers from tracking them. But broadband companies would still know what websites people visit. And the companies would be able to see all of the communications between users and websites that do not use encryption. Sophisticated users might increasingly rely on virtual private networks, which are used by corporations to let their employees log into secure systems remotely, and other tools to mask their activities, but most Americans are unlikely to be conversant with such tricks of the trade. Mr. Trump promised voters during the campaign that he would protect the working class. But now he and his party are moving quickly to do the bidding of a very different interest group: Big Telecom.

49,"CHICAGO — Donald J. Trump’s feelings about Chicago couldn’t have been clearer. He loved the place. It was 2004, and Mr. Trump, then a developer and reality show star, was waging a charm campaign here. He raved about Chicago’s “stunning” skyline and admired its architectural ingenuity as he proposed adding his own building to the mix. It was a “great city,” he said, right up there with his hometown, New York. Had Twitter existed at the time, Mr. Trump’s hashtag might have read #mykindoftown. Oh, how his views have changed. In recent months, Mr. Trump has repeatedly — obsessively, in the view of some — commented on Chicago’s street violence in interviews, debates and off-hour social media outbursts. “Chicago needs help!” he wrote on Twitter recently, after lamenting the city’s “carnage” in an earlier missive and vowing to “send in the feds” to save the day. On Tuesday, after meeting with police union leaders at the White House, Mr. Trump once again took note of this city’s violence, saying “I always ask, ‘What’s going on in Chicago?’” Politics could be partly to blame for Mr. Trump’s apparent change of heart. Chicago is Democratic to its core. It is where Barack Obama got his political start. And it is an easy foil when describing, as Mr. Trump does quite a bit, how dire urban America has become. But personal pique may also be an important factor when it comes to Mr. Trump’s relationship with the city. “It’s clear that he has a bone to pick with Chicago,” said Jesus G. Garcia, a Democratic Cook County commissioner. During Mr. Trump’s campaign, Chicago’s tight-knit, high-dollar Republican establishment showed tepid support, and he wound up canceling a rally here before he even arrived on stage, citing the raucous protesters who had gathered at the scene. But it may be the rejection he faced when he brought in his grand dream of putting up the world’s tallest skyscraper that stings most of all.

Just look at the facts. Trump took office promising to fix our trade imbalance with China, and what’s the first thing he did? He threw away a U.S.-designed free-trade deal with 11 other Pacific nations — a pact whose members make up 40 percent of global G.D.P. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was based largely on U.S. economic interests, benefiting our fastest-growing technologies and agribusinesses, and had more labor, environmental and human rights standards than any trade agreement ever. And it excluded China. It was our baby, shaping the future of trade in Asia. Imagine if Trump were negotiating with China now as not only the U.S. president but also as head of a 12-nation trading bloc based on our values and interests. That’s called l-e-v-e-r-a-g-e, and Trump just threw it away … because he promised to in the campaign — without, I’d bet, ever reading TPP. What a chump! I can still hear the clinking of champagne glasses in Beijing. Now more Asian nations are falling in line with China’s regional trading association — the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership — which has no serious environmental, intellectual property, human trafficking or labor standards like TPP.

This week, soon after social media went into a meltdown about United Airlines’ dress code for its “pass travelers” (employees and their dependents traveling free on a standby basis) and the fact that said dress code did not include leggings (a rule that does not, let us remember, apply to the ticket-buying public), Puma rode to the rescue of all leggings lovers by posting a special offer on Twitter: Present any United Airlines ticket and get 20 percent off all leggings at its stores in the United States. Quick! Run out and show your solidarity by shopping! And thus was the leggings movement commercialized. Can you blame them? Rebellion has long been made into merchandise. “I saw the story Monday morning, and didn’t think much of it,” said Adam Petrick, Puma’s global director of brand and marketing. “But then everyone was talking about it, and it seemed like we could have fun with it, and it was easy to get behind. We’re a sports brand, and come down clearly on the side that leggings are pants, and women of any age should be able to wear leggings any time they desire.” Except, of course, none of this is really about leggings. Leggings are the excuse — or the symbol. But to focus on them, which so much of the discussion has done since the news of the United ban broke, is to miss the point. The question at the heart of the issue is not whether leggings are appropriate for planes. The question is, as in all discussions of dress code: Who gets to decide? The individual or the group? The individual or the business? Do we all have the inalienable right to express ourselves with apparel? Because what United was saying with its dress code was: When you fly on our dime you are representing our brand, and our brand takes flying with a certain amount of formality, the way it used to be taken. And what everyone else was saying is: When I fly (or do anything else for that matter, presumably) I am representing me, and I get to wear what I want, when I want. That tension has always existed, but in the past, the employer has generally won — at least when an individual was acting under the aegis of a brand, or on its behalf. Last year, however, when another dress code brouhaha broke out — this one about a temporary worker in Britain who was sent home for refusing to wear high heels — Susan Scafidi, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York and the founder of the Fashion Law Institute, told me that the pendulum had begun to swing the other way.

57,"Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas vetoed a bill on Thursday that would have expanded Medicaid in his state, setting up a potential showdown next week with a Legislature that, while heavily Republican, has come to favor extending the largely free health coverage to as many as 180,000 additional poor adults. Although the bill was easily approved in both chambers of the Legislature, supporters would need to muster three additional votes in the House and two in the Senate to override the veto by Mr. Brownback, a conservative Republican. After the House briefly debated an override on Thursday, the measure was put aside, probably until at least next week. Supporters were hoping to mobilize hundreds of residents who would benefit from Medicaid expansion, as well as hospital executives, clergy members and others who back the measure, to lobby specific lawmakers over the weekend. “Our plan is to make sure their phones are ringing off the hook,” said David Jordan, executive director of Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, an advocacy group. Republican lawmakers in Kansas were initially solidly opposed to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. But many softened their positions over the last year or so, particularly influenced by the financial struggles of the state’s small rural hospitals. Momentum grew after several Democrats and moderate Republicans picked up legislative seats in the elections last fall, although the leaders of both legislative chambers remain opposed to any expansion. In his veto message, Mr. Brownback said the cost of expanding Medicaid would be “irresponsible and unsustainable,” citing other states where Medicaid enrollment grew far more than expected after they expanded the program. The expansion effort comes in the midst of a budget crisis that has roiled Kansas for years.

58,"SAN FRANCISCO — Palmer Luckey, a founder of the virtual-reality technology company Oculus, has left Facebook three years after the social network acquired his company for close to $3 billion. Mr. Luckey’s departure was announced two months after a trial in federal court over allegations that he and several colleagues had stolen trade secrets from a video-game publisher, ZeniMax Media, to create the Oculus technology. A jury found Facebook liable for $500 million in damages, in part for Mr. Luckey’s violation of a confidentiality agreement. “Palmer will be dearly missed,” Tera Randall, an Oculus spokeswoman, said in a statement. “His inventive spirit helped kick-start the modern VR revolution and helped build an industry.” Ms. Randall declined to disclose the terms of Mr. Luckey’s departure. The move adds another twist to Facebook’s bumpy foray into virtual-reality technology. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has bet big on virtual reality as part of the social network’s future, saying he envisioned social interactions between people will someday exist inside virtual worlds. Oculus, he has said, could be a catalyst for that. But from the start, Oculus has run into problems. Adoption of the Oculus technology and headsets has been slower than Facebook had anticipated. The selection of content made for VR headsets is still small, though growing. “These things end up being more complex than you think upfront,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in January while appearing in court for the ZeniMax trial. “If anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought upfront.” Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to spending more than $3 billion over the next decade to get virtual reality off the ground and into the mainstream. Mr. Luckey has had other stumbles. In 2016, it became public that he had donated $10,000 to Nimble America, a pro-Trump political organization that promoted far-right memes and slogans on social media sites like Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. He has since apologized for the impact his actions had on Oculus and its partners. Mr. Luckey did not immediately respond to a Facebook message requesting comment. In January, Facebook appointed a new leader, Hugo Barra, to head up the company’s virtual-reality efforts, including Oculus.

In this article, Didi Kirsten Tatlow, a Beijing-based Times correspondent, compares notes and guilt trips with Times reporters around the world who have moved with their families to smog-laden news hubs. Air matters. So when the conversation over a recent lunch in The Times’s Beijing bureau turned to the air pollution that regularly suffuses this city with chemicals and despondency, Ian Johnson, a China correspondent, took out his phone to check Air Matters, an app that measures air quality based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality Index, which scores the air from 0 to 500. Over 300 and the air is “hazardous.” It was at 169, “unhealthy” by American standards and several times the World Health Organization’s recommended daily level. Air quality has long been a serious problem here in Beijing — for citizens and The Times’s foreign correspondents alike. Now efforts to dial back air pollution worldwide are likely to take a hit: On Tuesday, less than a week after rolling back fuel-economy standards for the auto industry, President Trump announced an executive order reversing the rest of the Obama administration’s climate plan. If carried through, the order — which lifts American limits on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, the largest contributor of particulate pollution — flies in the face of the United States’ pledge under the Paris climate accord to cut its emissions.

61,"So what if President Trump wants to deport Big Bird? We’re struggling with terrorism, refugees, addiction, and grizzlies besieging schools. Isn’t it snobbish to fuss over Trump’s plans to eliminate all funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting? Let me argue the reverse: Perhaps Trump’s election is actually a reminder that we need the humanities more than ever to counter nationalism and demagoguery. Civilization is built not just on microchips, but also on arts, ideas and the humanities. And the arts are a bargain: The N.E.A. budget is $148 million a year, or less than 0.004 percent of the federal budget. The per-capita cost for Americans is roughly the cost of a postage stamp. The humanities may seem squishy and irrelevant. We have a new president who doesn’t read books and who celebrates raw power. It would be easy to interpret Trump as proof of the irrelevance of the humanities. Yet the humanities are far more powerful than most people believe. The world has been transformed over the last 250 years by what might be called a revolution of empathy driven by the humanities. Previously, almost everyone (except Quakers) accepted slavery and even genocide. Thomas Jefferson justified the “extermination” of Native Americans; whippings continued in American prisons in the 20th century; and at least 15,000 people turned up to watch the last public hanging in the United States, in 1936. What tamed us was, in part, books. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” famously contributed to the abolitionist movement, and “Black Beauty” helped change the way we treat animals. Steven Pinker of Harvard argues that a surge of literacy and an explosion of reading — novels in particular — “contributed to the humanitarian revolution,” by helping people see other viewpoints. There is also modern experimental evidence that reading literary fiction promotes empathy. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/president-trump-vs-big-bird.html?searchResultPosition=55
62,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has discovered that trying to work with Republicans, like trying to work on health care policy, is complicated. So with all his big campaign pledges in limbo following last week’s Obamacare fiasco, he reportedly is contemplating overtures to a party that actually wants to govern: the Democrats. This new tack comes, mind you, after Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for refusing to help him and House Speaker Paul Ryan eviscerate Obamacare. With zero support from Democrats, the pair had no margin for error as Republicans started to defect and were forced to pull their bill. Perhaps it’s beginning to dawn on the president that today’s Republican Party is designed for maximal obstruction and minimal constructive policy making. The rigidly doctrinaire Freedom Caucus essentially has veto power over White House initiatives, while moderates will jump ship if Mr. Trump concedes too much to right-wing purists. What’s more, Republicans are all over the map on the next big items on Mr. Trump’s agenda — tax reform and infrastructure. So even though Republicans control Congress and the White House, Washington’s new political math suggests that Mr. Trump may have no choice but to reach out to Democrats. If he could peel off several dozen moderate Democrats in the House and a handful in the Senate, he could neutralize the far right’s naysaying and give moderate Republicans a chance to vote for measures with broad, bipartisan support.

63,"WASHINGTON — A United States military spokesman said Thursday that Islamic State fighters had been herding local Iraqi residents into buildings in western Mosul, calculating that rising civilian casualties would restrain the United States from using airstrikes to help retake that half of the city. “What you see now is not the use of civilians as human shields,” said Col. Joseph E. Scrocca, a spokesman for the American-led task force that is battling the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “ISIS is smuggling civilians into buildings so we won’t see them and trying to bait the coalition to attack.” An episode this week in which Islamic State fighters forced civilians inside a building, killing one who resisted, was observed by American surveillance aircraft. Islamic State fighters then positioned themselves inside the same structure to fire on Iraqi forces, according to an account provided in a briefing for Pentagon reporters by Colonel Scrocca. No video of the episode was released on Thursday, but he said the video would soon be made public. The furor over the March 17 American airstrike that led to the collapse of a building in western Mosul, killing scores if not hundreds of Iraqi civilians, as well as Defense Department allegations that Islamic State fighters deliberately placed the civilians in harm’s way, have caused a change in American tactics. “It has caused some adjustments to our procedures,” Colonel Scrocca said, though he declined to say what specific changes had been made. What has not changed is the generals’ decision to give greater authority to American officers on the battlefield to call in airstrikes. That decision was taken after Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of the task force that is battling the Islamic State, was told by subordinates that it was taking too long to conduct airstrikes when Syrian fighters were battling to take the town of Manbij in the northern part of the country and Iraqi fighters were first starting to take Mosul. The new procedures also will apply to the efforts to retake Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s capital. “This is a discussion that started in a November time-frame, and we started to pursue this. We recognized what we were stepping into,” Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of the United States Central Command, said in an interview Wednesday. “It was actually implemented for eastern Mosul, the whole urban environment, and frankly, as we kind of get ready for Raqqa.

After a little more than two months in office, President Trump has raised doubts about his ability to deal with what the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously described as the “known unknowns” and the “unknown unknowns.” “President Trump seems to have no awareness whatsoever of what he does and does not know,” Steven Nadler, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, wrote me. “He is ignorant of his own ignorance.” During his first 63 days in office, Trump made 317 “false or misleading claims,” according to The Washington Post. The FBI, the Treasury Department and two congressional committees are probing whether Trump’s campaign aides and advisers — including Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn — were complicit in alleged Russian interference. Without an obvious mandate (as the world knows, he lost the popular vote by 2.87 million), Trump has proposed a profound retrenchment of domestic policy. His 2018 budget, the potential impact of which he does not seem to grasp, calls for cutting $54 billion from programs that pay for education, housing and child care assistance for low- and moderate-income families, protection against infectious diseases, enforcement of environmental, worker and consumer protection regulation, national parks and a host of other social programs. See the accompanying chart, which illustrates the depth of these changes.

Scores of departures by scientists and Silicon Valley technology experts who advised President Trump’s predecessor have all but wiped out the larger White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Mr. Trump has not yet named his top advisers on technology or science, and so far, has made just one hire: Michael Kratsios, the former chief of staff for Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley investor and one of the president’s wealthiest supporters, as the deputy chief technology officer. Neither Mr. Kratsios, who has a bachelor’s degree in political science from Princeton, nor anyone else still working in the science and technology office regularly participates in Mr. Trump’s daily briefings, as they did for President Barack Obama. “The impression this leaves is that Trump isn’t interested in science and that scientific matters are a low priority at the White House,” said Vinton G.

The dwindling of the White House science and technology staff for scientific research could have long-term consequences, Mr. Cerf said.

68,"LOS ANGELES — When “Zoot Suit” made its debut in New York in 1979, it was the first time a Chicano show had made it to Broadway. But the musical, by Luis Valdez, was a distinctly Los Angeles production: It was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving zoot-suit-wearing Mexican-American youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-Americans in summer 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group’s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the stage here for the first time since 1978. Tickets went on sale late last year and sold out quickly. The production has since been extended three times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and the enthusiasm demonstrate that the play touches a deep nerve in this city, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to find out what the play means to them. These interviews have been condensed and edited. Photographs by Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times When I first saw the movie in high school I felt really inspired. The pachucos loved the United States, but they did not want to give up their own culture. They created this subculture that was mixing all these backgrounds and creating this culture of resistance and their own identity. They were some of the first people who stood up for the Chicano community. When I wear a zoot suit I feel empowered, kind of like it’s a suit of armor. It’s not only honoring those in the past, but it makes you look sharp even though it doesn’t follow the norm of what a suit is supposed to look like.

73,"The Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearing for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was just plain embarrassing, and not only for the nominee. But let’s begin with him, skipping over his Republican enablers, who had nothing to do but lob softball questions and praise his answers. If Judge Gorsuch wasn’t the least forthcoming Supreme Court nominee ever to appear at a confirmation hearing, it’s hard to imagine one who could be less forthcoming while still breathing. More interesting and less predictable answers could have come from Siri on an iPhone. The previous contender for the title of least forthcoming was Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016 and whom Judge Gorsuch would replace. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and confirmed unanimously, then-Judge Scalia wouldn’t even tell the Judiciary Committee whether he supported Marbury v. Madison, the landmark 1803 decision in which the court under Chief Justice John Marshall established the principle that federal courts can invalidate unconstitutional statutes. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then a Republican and later a Democrat, was so irritated by the nominee’s performance that four years later, when President George H. W. Bush nominated David H. Souter to the court, Senator Specter announced in advance that he expected an answer to the Marbury question. “That was one of 2,000 questions that Justice Scalia refused to answer,” the senator explained, his annoyance still simmering, as he ushered Judge Souter into his inner office for a private meeting. The Marbury v. Madison answer must have been satisfactory, because the two emerged shortly thereafter with Senator Specter praising the nominee’s “first-rate legal mind.” I’ve described this episode, which I witnessed, at some length because I’m tired of hearing that the refusal to answer the Judiciary Committee’s substantive questions began with Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s hearing in 1993. In fact, then-Judge Ginsburg was forthright in her support of the right to abortion, calling it “essential to woman’s equality,” and she praised the 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey as having strengthened the right in some respects. So it remains a mystery to me why Justice Ginsburg is singled out as the model of a say-nothing stance toward a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. (Just as it was a mystery to me why liberals during the past several years persisted in calling on her, and not the male justices who are her near age-mates, to retire and open a spot for President Barack Obama to fill. Nothing to do with her sex, I’m sure.) In any event, all Judge Gorsuch had to say about the right to abortion — as well as about the 51-year-old constitutional right to use birth control — was that it was supported by precedent. In answer to a question from Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committee’s chairman, about what he had to say about Roe v. Wade, the nominee answered: “I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, was a precedent of the United States Supreme Court.” Elaborating ever so slightly, he went on to observe that the decision had been reaffirmed and that people relied on it. “So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the United States Supreme Court, worthy of treatment as precedent like any other.” Precedents, of course, receive all kinds of “treatment” at the hands of future courts, from a warm embrace to being whittled away to outright overruling. What kind of “treatment” Judge Gorsuch thinks the court’s abortion precedents deserve was left neatly unspecified.

Donald Trump must be absolutely exhausted. “… the White House has been hosting events all throughout March,” press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, launching into a list of activities that culminated Wednesday in a visit by the president to a special Women’s Empowerment Panel. The administration regarded this gathering as so important that it featured every single female cabinet member. Yes! All four! Actually, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao couldn’t come, so they substituted Seema Verma, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “My cabinet is full of really incredible women leaders,” the president said, looking at the quartet.

Besides Chao, the cabinet women include Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations, and Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration. While everybody wants to encourage small business and at least some of us want to encourage the U.N., neither of those would be regarded as exactly superpower positions.

Once in a while, I’ve tried to grab a feral kitten to bring it in for a short visit. Why I keep trying, I don’t know; no matter how much whitefish you leave on a napkin, nobody is fast enough to catch a feral cat. So you’ll understand why, a year and a half ago, I decided it would be a great idea to get her a robo cat. My college roommate had sent me a link about it, the Hasbro Joy for All Companion Pet. This is some cat. It opens its eyes when you pet it, it purrs, and if you pet it long enough, it will roll over on its back for a belly rub. The commercials alone could make you weep: Elderly men and women, often in wheelchairs, are presented with a Joy for All Companion cat. At the sound of its meows or the sight of it washing its face with its paw, their faces light up as if someone has thrown a switch. They scratch its little ears, they lock eyes with it and snuggle it to their chests, they beam. Cat available in orange, gray and creamy white, $99.99. I order that fluffy little sucker so fast my credit card smokes. I get it in orange because we had an excellent orange-yellow tomcat when I was growing up in the Catskills, a lascivious boulevardier named Peaches whose sorbet-colored progeny dotted the town. A week later, I trot into my mother’s room with the cat, eager to see her go moist-eyed and tender. It didn’t happen a lot when my brothers and I were growing up — or ever, actually — but after someone’s brain has been fried in a major stroke and they’re in a wheelchair, things change. “What the hell is that?” Ma says. Wait — this wasn’t how it went in the movie. “It’s a robot cat,” I say. “I got it to hang out with you.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/nyregion/loving-robo-cat-needs-home.html?searchResultPosition=41
76,"One recent morning, Nadia Lopez, a Brooklyn middle-school principal who became an internet celebrity two years ago — and as a result has been a guest of Ellen DeGeneres, Barack Obama and Drew Gilpin Faust, the president of Harvard, as well as an author — received a flood of text messages from family and friends who were outraged by an article in The Daily News titled “Brownsville Is Brooklyn’s Worst Neighborhood for Children.” For seven years, Ms. Lopez has run Mott Hall Bridges Academy in Brownsville to great acclaim, having gained national attention when the blog Humans of New York profiled a student who talked about what a profound influence she was. Part of the challenge of working in low-income urban communities is the fight against the perception that they are doomed and immiserating, an exercise that has required more energy in the age of President Trump, who has made use of the loaded term “inner city” to invoke the image of nightmare places where death always comes at gunpoint and schools are always synonymous with failure. The News’s article was pegged to a new report from the Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York, a nonprofit advocacy group whose purpose was to highlight both the deficits in Brownsville — its 40 percent poverty rate, nearly twice that of New York City on the whole, has remained unchanged during Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration — and its strengths, which are easy for outsiders to overlook. When I visited Ms. Lopez in her office to talk about what has changed in Brownsville and what hasn’t over the past several years, she spoke about how disheartening it was to see constant attacks in the news media, ones she believes were then internalized by children who would see themselves as hopeless and without value. Her mission involves a deft finesse between showing children the larger world of affluence — she takes students to stores and restaurants in Park Slope and Williamsburg so that they might know how the salumi half lives — and inculcating in them a sense of investment in their own neighborhood, so they might aspire to do well but ultimately return to the place they were brought up and improve it. “If kids have access and exposure they can change a trajectory,” she said, “but you can’t know what to ask for until you know what there is to want.” When Ms. Lopez takes the children through moneyed Brooklyn, they are consistently amazed that you can go to a store where the candy isn’t behind plexiglass and eat in restaurants where you sit down and the food is actually brought to you.

77,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles, and the photographer Melissa Lyttle. When “Zoot Suit” made its debut in New York in 1979, it was the first time a Chicano show had made it to Broadway. But the musical by Luis Valdez was a distinctly Los Angeles production: it was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving Mexican-American zoot-suit-wearing youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-Americans in the summer of 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group’s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the downtown stage for the first time since 1978. When tickets went on sale late last year, the production sold out quickly and has since been extended three separate times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and enthusiasm demonstrates how the play touches a deep nerve in Los Angeles, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to hear what the play means to them.

78,"AMHERST, Mass. — President Trump’s “skinny budget” might be a misnomer, because in foreign policy, at least, it is actually giving us fat nationalism. The biggest winners are the military, the Homeland Security Department and, of course, the wall. The biggest loser is the State Department and thus diplomacy. Mr. Trump is all about intimidating more and negotiating less. This is the hallmark of xenophobic nationalism. Mr. Trump is also blending xenophobic nationalism with protectionism. The jury is still out on how protectionist the Trump administration wants to be. But in relation to Latin America, even before revealing his budget, Mr. Trump already showed a clear preference for protectionism. He walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was as much about United States trade with Latin America’s rising Pacific economies as it was about trade with Asia. He has trashed Nafta, a trade agreement that is more important as a symbol of the reconciliation between the United States and Mexico than it is as a change in the economic fortune of the United States. His administration has expressed reservations about trade normalization with Cuba and the peace accord in Colombia, a nation with which the United States has a major trade agreement and a history of close cooperation. One problem with nationalist protectionism is that as an ideology, it is prone to double blindness: It is blind both to its exaggerations and to its consequences. Xenophobic nationalists exaggerate the extent to which the outside world takes advantage of the nation. The Chinese are manipulating their currency, Mexicans are taking jobs away, military allies are free-riding, and the rest of the world is misbehaving because it doesn’t fear you enough. And all of this happens “while we sit here like a bunch of dummies,” as Mr. Trump has tweeted. Nationalists thus exaggerate both the relative gains that others make at their expense, and the relative costs their own nations incur. They are blind to the concept of mutual gain; they see only abuse. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/the-blind-spots-in-trumps-foreign-policy.html?searchResultPosition=38
79,"Updated, 8:11 a.m. Good morning on this sort-of-sunny Thursday. What happens when you bring together 10 teenagers from poor communities and 10 police officers to try to get them to talk? Empathy ensues. “When the cops hear the kinds of things that these kids have gone through — a kid saying, ‘I hate cops because when I was 7 you barged into my house and you took my dad away and I never saw him again,’ cops have said to kids, ‘I don’t know how you live through this,’ ” said Lenora B. Fulani, a developmental psychologist who founded and runs Operation Conversation: Cops & Kids. Through theater and improvisation, the program aims to improve the often-contentious relationship between the police and youths from ages 15 to 21 in black and Latino communities. The empathy goes both ways, Dr. Fulani told us. “When I ask the cops what the hardest thing is about being a cop, the kids are really disturbed that the cops are not home for Christmas and that they’ve missed 10 holidays.” And just like that, Dr. Fulani said, snapping her fingers in the air, “the humanity surfaces on both sides. It’s very beautiful.” The program started after the deadly police shooting of Sean Bell in Queens in 2006. Today, 7,500 New York police officers have either participated in a private workshop or watched a public performance at venues including the Police Academy in Queens, the Apollo in Harlem and the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn.

80,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has relaxed some of the rules for preventing civilian casualties when the American military carries out counterterrorism strikes in Somalia, laying the groundwork for an escalating campaign against Islamist militants in the Horn of Africa. The decision, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations, gives commanders at the United States Africa Command greater latitude to carry out offensive airstrikes and raids by ground troops against militants with the Qaeda-linked Islamist group Shabab. That sets the stage for an intensified pace of combat there, while increasing the risk that American forces could kill civilians. Mr. Trump signed a directive on Wednesday declaring parts of Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” where war-zone targeting rules will apply for at least 180 days, the officials said. The New York Times reported the Pentagon’s request for the expanded targeting authority on March 12, and Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the top officer at Africa Command, publicly acknowledged that he was seeking it at a news conference last Friday. “It’s very important and very helpful for us to have little more flexibility, a little bit more timeliness, in terms of decision-making process,” General Waldhauser said. “It allows us to prosecute targets in a more rapid fashion.” In a statement issued several hours after The New York Times first published news of the directive, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged that Mr. Trump had approved the Pentagon’s proposal to expand its targeting authority “to defeat Al Shabab in Somalia” in partnership with African Union and Somali forces.

In an early morning Twitter attack, Mr. Trump singled out members of the House Freedom Caucus, which scuttled his health care overhaul last week. “The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast,” he wrote. “We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!” He continued on Twitter throughout the day, naming individual members of the caucus, likening them to Democrats and urging other Republicans to “fight them” in the 2018 midterm elections if they do not back his agenda. But the Republican upstarts hardly cowered in the face of Mr. Trump’s criticism. They struck back, some of them ridiculing the president, using his own taunting and confrontational social media style. “Stockholm Syndrome?” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia asked on Twitter, suggesting that the president had become captive to the Republican establishment he attacked during the campaign. “It’s a swamp not a hot tub. We both came here to drain it. #SwampCare polls 17%.

82,"When I decided to undergo a lumpectomy earlier this month after a diagnosis of D.C.I.S., I learned a new word that makes me grateful for my privileges but also worried about the privations of others. The word is lagniappe, a bonus, like the 13th doughnut in the purchased dozen. As I went through yet another operation, my way was eased by the kindness of friends and relatives. The greatest extravagance came from my daughters who gave me their precious time. The younger flew in from New York City, the older from Boston. They were my lagniappes, in a sense: a bonus beyond the gift of having a potential health crisis averted. At my age, 72, and with my history, eight years of ongoing treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, I knew that their presence would bolster me. At the hospital, I went straight to radiology in order to undergo what is called the Savi Scout procedure. A mammogram machine was used to locate the calcifications that were causing the concern and then a tiny reflective device was shot into that spot. The radiologist used a black marker to ink an X above the spot on my skin. Later, during the operation, a wand placed on the X would activate radarlike waves: Beeping would send my surgeon to the reflector’s location. It would be removed, the technician explained, along with the abnormal cells. Then I was taken to a preoperative cubicle where I met with the surgeon and the anesthesiologist. I remember being wheeled toward the operating room, positioning myself on a narrow table, and being informed that I was being given something for sedation. I awoke with the comforting awareness of many gifts: my daughters’ company and also the extraordinary expertise of radiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses; the astonishing technologies upon which they relied; my excellent insurance that would compensate them; and my ability to afford the extra services I needed to make the outpatient procedure as easy as possible, including a hired car and driver to take us home. During that ride, still logy from drugs, I received an email from a reader concerned that the Trump administration’s proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act would seriously limit the cancer screenings that Planned Parenthood provides. Federal money is already prohibited from being used to pay for abortions, but the proposal would have cut off more than $400 million in federal funding to Planned Parenthood for other services including birth control, cancer screenings and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.

83,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, who has called the North American Free Trade Agreement “the worst trade deal” ever signed by the United States, appears to have backed off his threat to abandon the deal and is instead proposing keeping major planks in place when he begins renegotiating it later this year. But Mr. Trump, eager to showcase his tough stance against unfair trade practices, plans to sign two executive orders on Friday that will lay the groundwork for new policies and stricter enforcement of trade laws. The president will order a 90-day study of abusive trade practices that contribute to the United States’ trade deficit. The Commerce Department and the United States trade representative will do a country-by-country, product-by-product accounting of the reasons for the imbalance. A second directive is aimed at increasing the collection of duties from countries whose companies American officials believe are selling products in the United States below their cost of production. Neither measure will have an immediate impact on trade policy or enforcement, but each could eventually lead to aggressive new measures. Both are aimed at showcasing Mr. Trump’s intent to fulfill his promises on trade. “These actions are designed to let the world know that this is another step in the president fulfilling his campaign promise,” said Wilbur L. Ross, the secretary of commerce. He said the findings would “form the basis for decision-making by the administration” on how to approach trade deficits in the future, including in a renegotiation of Nafta. “For the first time, we’re looking comprehensively at the source of what has been a large and persistent trade deficit that has contributed to job losses, the loss of our manufacturing base and other things,” said Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump’s National Trade Council.

84,"ATLANTA — For a year, it prompted boycotts, demonstrations and economic fallout that helped dethrone a sitting governor. In the end, in a strange and profoundly American collision of polarized politics, big-time sports, commerce and the culture wars, North Carolina’s notorious House Bill 2 was finally laid to rest on Thursday — though many were left wondering if some of its negative effects might linger. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed legislation repealing the law after it was approved by the Republican-controlled legislature. House Bill 2 had restricted the ability of municipalities to enact anti-discrimination policies and required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. In addition to repealing House Bill 2, the new law gives the General Assembly the sole power to regulate access to “multiple occupancy restrooms, showers or changing facilities.” It also creates a moratorium on local nondiscrimination ordinances through 2020. The compromise agreement came amid a looming threat that the N.C.A.A., which had already relocated a year’s worth of championship tournament games from the state, was planning to eliminate more, including future men’s Division I basketball tournaments. It was met with bitter criticism from gay rights groups, which said it was barely a repeal at all, and from conservatives, who said it backtracked on protecting public safety and traditional values. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Cooper said that the agreement would begin undoing the economic damage and that both sports events and economic development would begin coming back to the state. This week, The Associated Press calculated that North Carolina stood to lose more than $3.7 billion over the next dozen years if House Bill 2 were not repealed. “This is not a perfect deal and it is not my preferred solution; it stops short of many things we need to do as a state,” Mr. Cooper said. “In a perfect world, with a good General Assembly, we would have repealed HB2 fully today, and added full statewide protections for L.G.B.T.

Putin responded publicly on Thursday to the nationwide anticorruption demonstrations with a familiar message: après moi, le déluge. Speaking in the northern port of Arkhangelsk at an international forum on Arctic issues, Mr. Putin defended his record on fighting corruption and warned that such outbursts, if uncontained, could lead to chaos akin to that spawned by the Arab Spring uprisings. Mr. Putin did not mention Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader who called for the demonstrations and who would like to oppose the president in the March 2018 election. But Mr. Putin left little doubt to what, or to whom, he was referring when he called the marches part of a presidential campaign. After accusing unidentified “political forces” of using public concern about corruption to promote their own “selfish interests,” Mr. Putin said this would only end in chaos if allowed to continue. “We well know, and I want to direct your attention to the fact, that this instrument was used in the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring. We know very well what this led to, to what bloody events it led to in this region,” he said. “We likewise know very well that this was one of the inciting motives and pretexts for the coup d’état in Ukraine. We also know well into what chaos these events sunk our neighbor, Ukraine.” Presiding over what some critics portray as a Mafia-like government that has conferred vast riches on a select few friends and associates of the president, Mr. Putin presented himself as a stalwart corruption fighter.

The revelation on Thursday that White House officials disclosed the reports, which Mr. Nunes then discussed with Mr. Trump, is likely to fuel criticism that the intelligence chairman has been too eager to do the bidding of the Trump administration while his committee is supposed to be conducting an independent investigation of Russia’s meddling in the presidential election. It is the latest twist of a bizarre Washington drama that began after dark on March 21, when Mr. Nunes got a call from a person he has described only as a source. The call came as he was riding across town in an Uber car, and he quickly diverted to the White House.

The chain of events — and who helped provide the intelligence to Mr. Nunes — was detailed to The New York Times by four American officials. Since disclosing the existence of the intelligence reports, Mr. Nunes has refused to identify his sources, saying he needed to protect them so others would feel safe going to the committee with sensitive information. In his public comments, he has described his sources as whistle-blowers trying to expose wrongdoing at great risk to themselves.

87,"JERUSALEM — Israel’s government on Thursday approved the establishment of a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time in more than two decades, and also laid the groundwork for further expansion despite a request from President Trump to hold off on settlement activity. It was not immediately clear whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had received a green light from the White House for Thursday’s announcement. Mr. Trump’s public request to hold off on settlements came during a meeting between the two leaders at the White House last month, after a series of moves by the Israeli leader to approve thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank. In a carefully calibrated statement issued two weeks before the meeting, the White House said, “While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.” Previous administrations viewed the settlements as an obstacle to peace, and the Palestinians and much of the world consider them a violation of international law. But it was not immediately clear whether the approval of the new settlement was meant to be a provocative move to scuttle the prospect of a revival of peace talks. Mr. Netanyahu said he was following through on a pledge he made a few weeks ago to 40 settler families who were evacuated from the illegal Amona outpost in the West Bank. That outpost was removed by court order because it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. “I promised at the outset that we would build a new community,” Mr. Netanyahu said earlier Thursday. “I believe that I first gave that promise back in December, and we will uphold it today.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/middleeast/israeli-settlements-netanyahu.html?searchResultPosition=30

The only real question is how the Senate Democrats will express their opposition to the violation of longstanding norms and traditions by Republicans that led to his nomination. The most common options being discussed are a simple “no” vote by the full Democratic bloc or an effort to delay the vote by filibuster, which is expected to lead to a further degradation of Senate rules by the Republican majority. Perhaps a third option should be considered: a boycott of the vote by Senate Democrats. They should refuse to legitimize the confirmation process by taking part. The end result might be the same — a confirmation of Judge Gorsuch by the Republican majority — but the symbolism would be clear.

At the time of the Democratic Senate majority’s 2013 elimination of the filibuster for lower federal court judges and executive branch appointments, The Times, in an editorial titled “Democracy Returns to the Senate,” called the filibuster the Senate’s “most infuriating rule,” and lauded Democrats for the change: “That means a return to the democratic process of giving nominees an up-or-down vote, allowing them to be either confirmed or rejected by a simple majority.” An “infuriating rule” should not be deemed less so, and an undemocratic procedure should not be deemed less so, simply because Republicans now hold a majority in the Senate. The Times ended its 2017 editorial endorsing the filibuster of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination with “What goes around comes around.” Perhaps the 2013 editorial should have ended that way as well.

89,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, aided by Vice President Mike Pence and an ailing Georgia colleague who gingerly made his way to the Capitol with the aid of a wheelchair and a walker, voted Thursday to undo an Obama administration rule preventing states from blocking funding for family planning clinics that also provide abortions. The vote was one of a string of showdowns to reverse Obama-era regulations, but this one unfolded with all the drama of numerous past conflicts over abortion funding — with Mr. Pence casting the tiebreaking vote in his role as president of the Senate. “Today, Congress is sending a resolution to President Trump ensuring that states are not forced to fund America’s abortion giant, Planned Parenthood, with Title X tax dollars,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a prominent anti-abortion group. Taking money away from Planned Parenthood, the bill’s target, has been a longstanding goal of congressional Republicans, but earlier efforts were blocked by Democrats and President Barack Obama. Even with Republicans in full control of Washington, however, the process was not easy. The measure fell under a somewhat obscure and, until recently, rarely used Congressional Review Act that allows a new Congress to undo late actions of a previous presidential administration during the first few months of the year. It returns to the states the power to exclude health care centers that perform abortions from receiving Title X money set aside for family planning and related preventive health services for women. Title X grants cover contraception, as well as cancer and other disease screenings and treatments, but they cannot, under current federal law, be used to pay for abortion services.

In an early morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump lamented what a “shame” it is that “someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost.” Mr. Trump and some of his aides immediately pushed back against the book, “Fear: Trump in the White House,” written by the famed Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, when excerpts were released on Tuesday, a week before it officially goes on sale. The president, who regularly rails against news reports that are not flattering to him and calls them “fake news,” has raised the issue of changing libel laws in the past. In March 2017, the president made a similar appeal when he was unhappy with reporting in The New York Times. “Change libel laws?” he asked.

Tillerson showered praise on Turkey’s government on Thursday, despite what some international critics see as a slide toward authoritarianism, and in response he got an earful of grievances from Turkish officials. Mr. Tillerson’s visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital, was intended to reassure a NATO ally in the fight against the Islamic State and a regional bulwark against a resurgent Iran. Turkish officials have repeatedly protested United States support for and reliance on Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria at the same time the Turks are waging a campaign against Kurdish militants inside Turkey. Mr. Tillerson was vague on Thursday when discussing American support for the Kurds, saying only that there were “difficult choices that have to be made.” Standing beside Mr. Tillerson on Thursday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that Turkey expected the United States to cut off aid to Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State, and that American law enforcement should arrest a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania whom the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a coup attempt last July. “We are expecting better cooperation,” Mr. Cavusoglu said.

96,"Ivanka Trump will now have an official job at the White House. It’s an unpaid role as an adviser to her father, the president, but it comes with an office, a title and, presumably, an even higher perch from which to fashion herself as a crusader for working women. “Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties — they should be the norm,” she said at the Republican National Convention last summer. She has written a book, to be published in May, called “Women Who Work.” In her very own West Wing office she will shepherd policy related to “women in the workplace,” according to her lawyer. In April she’s headed to a summit meeting in Berlin on women in the work force. While Ms. Trump may want to be the new face of working motherhood, the reality of the policies she has devised for her father diverge starkly from her rhetoric. They offer very little to most parents, especially the ones who really need the support. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump unveiled his daughter’s plan for six weeks of paid leave for women who give birth. When pressed, Ms. Trump made it clear that her policy was tailored specifically for coping with childbirth and was not meant for new fathers or parents who adopt. It’s a plan that is likely to hurt all working women more than help them. Employers are already more hesitant to hire mothers than other candidates, male or female. Part of what they fear, fair or not, is investing in an employee who will then leave to care for her children for some unknown period, taking all her training and knowledge with her and requiring the company to spend resources hiring a replacement. Their anxiety will be amplified if women are afforded time off from work for a new child and men aren’t. If only mothers get a paid leave benefit when their family welcomes a new child, the stigma falls squarely on one gender.

97,"The Trump administration served notice on Thursday that its next move to deregulate broadband internet service companies would be to jettison the Obama administration’s net neutrality rules, which were intended to safeguard free expression online. The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet. Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation. In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had “reclassified them as common carriers.” Mr. Spicer said President Trump had “pledged to reverse this overreach.” The Obama-era rules, Mr. Spicer said, were an example of “bureaucrats in Washington” placing restrictions on one kind of company — internet service suppliers — and “picking winners and losers.” Telecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers.

98,"WASHINGTON — When Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, fresh off helping torpedo his party’s bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, showed up at the Berkeley County Republican meeting on Saturday, he was met with applause and praise in one of the most conservative corners of his district. So less than a week later, after President Trump on Thursday warned the Freedom Caucus that he would “fight them” when they face re-election next year, Mr. Sanford was hardly cowering in fear. Instead, he and other members of the Freedom Caucus returned fire. “Intimidation may work with some in the short term, but it never really works in the long run,” Mr. Sanford said, adding that Mr. Trump should interpret the recalcitrance of conservative lawmakers as an indication of a flawed bill: “What you can’t do is shoot messengers.” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia, another Freedom Caucus member, was even more blunt. “Stockholm Syndrome?” he asked on Twitter above a copy of Mr. Trump’s taunting post, suggesting the president had become captive to the Republican establishment he gleefully flayed during the campaign. Mr. Trump’s attack on fellow Republicans was only the latest and most high profile in the increasingly open warfare within the party that controls Washington but has struggled to gets its legislative agenda off the ground. When Mr. Trump and some Senate Republican suggested that the law should be repaired with the help of Democrats, it was the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who spoke out and discouraged the idea. That, in turn, led Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, to blast Mr. Ryan. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/donald-trump-freedom-caucus.html?searchResultPosition=19
99,"The scale of Syria’s refugee crisis is dizzying. As the war there stretches into a seventh year, more than five million citizens, nearly a quarter of Syria’s prewar population, have fled their country, seeking shelter mainly in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday. Five million people is roughly equal to the population of Norway. If nearly a quarter of the United States’ population left the country, it would be as if the combined populations of California, New York and Florida had disappeared. In addition, 6.3 million Syrians have been internally displaced by the war. Altogether, about half of all Syrians have been forced from their homes because of violence. With no end to the war in sight, Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, predicted that 480,000 more Syrians would become refugees in need of resettlement this year. That is as if the entire population of Sacramento abandoned the city — and the country — over the course of the next nine months. Since the conflict began in 2011, an estimated 400,000 people have been killed. The five million Syrians who escaped war, starvation and deprivation now live mostly in one of five countries, often in squalid camps teeming with people. The majority of those refugees, nearly three million, have sought shelter in Turkey. Turkey, a country of 75 million, has absorbed a contingent of refugees equal to 4 percent of its population. The country’s location on the doorstep of Europe has increased its leverage in negotiations with the West about the fate of refugee resettlement, but the sheer number of people has taxed the country’s resources. Since February alone, 47,000 Syrians have sought refuge in Turkey. Two million other refugees are scattered through Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Last year, the United Nations sought pledges to resettle 500,000 Syrians around the world. Since then, only half that many have been given homes. “We still have a long road to travel in expanding resettlement and the number and range of complementary pathways available for refugees,” Mr. Grandi said. “To meet this challenge, we not only need additional places, but also need to accelerate the implementation of existing pledges.” The United States previously pledged to make 64,000 places available for Syrians. But President Trump has sought to decrease the number of refugees entering the United States. In January, he signed an executive order barring all Syrian refugees from entering the country, but he was forced to replace it when federal courts blocked it. His second order is also tied up, working its way through the courts.

Mr. Cuomo said he and lawmakers had come to agreement on a wide array of subjects, including a plan for tuition-free college at state schools; expanded ride sharing to upstate; changes in workers’ compensation; opioid treatment; water infrastructure; and an extension of the so-called millionaire’s tax, something the governor has said is critical to funding his 2017 agenda.

102,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said he was considering “accelerating” the introduction of his $1 trillion infrastructure bill — but he pointedly refused to say whether he planned to include two major New York City transportation projects that his budget for next year would defund. Mr. Trump, speaking in a wide-ranging interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, described the infrastructure package as a high-value legislative sweetener that he could attach to a revived Affordable Care Act repeal bill or tax code overhaul to attract bipartisan support that thus far he had neither sought nor received. “Infrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill,” said Mr. Trump, who is in need of a legislative win after the humbling defeat of his health care bill last month. “Infrastructure is so popular with the Democrats and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too.” The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on middle- and upper-income real estate development, has proposed eliminating an Obama-era infrastructure program that would have funded long-delayed proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem. State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattan’s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012. As Mr. Trump discussed his plan, hundreds of thousands of commuters endured a third day of upheaval prompted by a minor derailment at Pennsylvania Station, another reminder of the decrepit, tenuous state of much of the region’s infrastructure and transit systems.

This fame and name recognition helped pave his way to the presidency.” “Rookie Biographies: President Donald Trump” (Scholastic Inc.) “In 1993, Trump married Marla Maples.

104,"On Nov. 10, Beth Sutinis sat at her desk in Brooklyn with a big task looming. As the executive editor for the children’s division of Time Inc. Books, she and her colleagues had worked through the fall to update their book “Presidents of the United States.” They added a spread about Barack Obama, another about the 2016 election and a third about Hillary Clinton, who polls had indicated would be elected the 45th president. In the days after the election, Ms. Sutinis scrambled to produce a profile of the person who was elected instead. “It was one of the harder things I have had to do in a long career of writing and editing nonfiction for kids,” she said. Presidential biographies are a staple of children’s book publishing, and of classrooms across the country. Nonfiction for children is a surging category, particularly in light of a Common Core mandate that schools put greater emphasis on it in their curriculum. Publishers like Penguin Young Readers, Scholastic and Time for Kids chronicle stories like the rise of Mr. Obama from Illinois state senator to president, or the political legacy of the Bush family, interspersing those accounts with facts about presidential history. The books hit bookshelves every four years, usually long before historians and writers of nonfiction for adults weigh in. But the story of Donald J. Trump posed a unique set of challenges. After an election cycle whose divisive effect on voters is still being felt, publishing books for classroom use has been unusually perilous. For Ms. Sutinis, the difficulty went beyond the time crunch to finding concise quotations from Mr. Trump’s campaign appearances that didn’t include contentious remarks. Ms. Sutinis’s updated edition outlines Mr. Trump’s business and television career and his campaign. “He made controversial remarks about several groups of people, including Latinos, Muslims, African-Americans and women,” the book reads. “This led many, including some Republican officials, to back away from him.” It goes on: “But Trump continued to receive wide support and thousands of people attended his rallies.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/donald-trump-childrens-books.html?searchResultPosition=69

A year and a half ago, he huddled with two friends in a Quebec maple sugar shack, discussing how to stop the spread of what they call “invasive political Islam” in Canada. They formed a group called La Meute, or Wolfpack, created a Facebook page and invited like-minded people to join. Within a month, they had 15,000 followers. Today, the number has surpassed 50,000, and the group is still attracting people. Now, Mr. Beaudry and his colleagues say they are shaping those followers into dues-paying members who will give the group financial muscle and, they hope, political clout. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has publicly opened Canada’s doors to refugees and presented a face of tolerance and inclusion in a world increasingly hostile to migration.

Nowhere has it galvanized such large numbers as in Quebec, where many people still refer to themselves as pure laine, or pure wool, direct descendants of the 17th-century settlers of New France. The most emotional response has focused on conservative Muslim immigrants, who perhaps present the greatest contrast to traditional European-based culture and the secularism that Quebec struggled hard to win from the Roman Catholic Church. The concerns are outsize by any measure. Muslims represent just 3 percent of Canada’s population, and while Islam is one of the fastest-growing religions in the country, Muslims will still account for less than 6 percent of the population in 2050, according to the Pew Research Center.

106,"WASHINGTON — The new bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act is dead, killed off by House Republicans who never actually read the legislation — because in fact, it never actually existed. Conservative groups moved quickly on Wednesday to shift the blame for the failure of a seven-year promise to repeal the law onto some not-as-conservative Republicans, after a small but powerful group of hard-line House conservatives failed again to come to a meeting of the minds with the Trump administration over how best to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature achievement. “The left wing among House Republicans doesn’t want to compromise or keep their pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare,” David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative free-market advocacy group, said in a statement. “They’ve rejected deals that would give Americans more choices for cheaper health insurance, and now they won’t even allow states the chance to scale back Obamacare’s costliest regulations.” The accusation — echoed by other conservatives — represents a remarkable turnaround in the blame game. The group and its supporters have opposed much of the major legislation considered by Congress in recent years. Last month, a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed to get enough support to bring it to a vote. About 30 of the most conservative members of the House rejected the bill as preserving too much of the existing law, but as they pressed to dismantle ever more provisions, they pushed away more moderate House Republicans who were leery of leaving 24 million more Americans without health insurance. The effort was left for dead, until Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump administration officials raced up to the Capitol this week to cobble together a new agreement with the most conservative Republicans, the House Freedom Caucus. The revived measure, stirring in its grave, was known informally on Capitol Hill as Zombie Trumpcare.

107,"The Trump administration’s decision to remove its chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, from the National Security Council’s principals committee, along with the deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland’s likely exile to Singapore, as the United States ambassador, seems to indicate that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, is finally getting a little hard-earned bureaucratic traction. Not so fast: Other signals suggest that President Trump’s national security team remains as weak and dysfunctional as ever. And while some people are crediting General McMaster with a big win, the reality is much different. Reportedly from the moment he hired General McMaster, President Trump gave him broad staffing freedom. Yet Ms. McFarland, whom General McMaster wanted out, remained in place for well over a month. More egregiously, in mid-March, General McMaster tried to fire Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council. Mr. Cohen-Watnick, a holdover from Michael Flynn’s aborted stint as national security adviser, complained to Mr. Bannon and Jared Kushner, who prevailed on Mr. Trump to have him reinstated. The idea that the 30-year-old Mr. Cohen-Watnick should be senior director for intelligence programs — a position held by senior career C.I.A. officers in the Obama administration and others — is dubious. Furthermore, General McMaster’s decision to get rid of Mr. Cohen-Watnick was well within his pay grade. And Mr. Trump’s countermanding an understandable and routine staffing decision not only reneged on his deal with General McMaster, it also segued to an episode of clear White House obstructionism. A few days after his reinstatement, Mr. Cohen-Watnick was one of three White House staffers who facilitated a briefing to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on the “incidental surveillance” of Trump campaign staff members, which Mr. Nunes used to distract news media and public attention from the committee’s investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the outcome of the presidential election. A little unpacking revealed how artlessly pretextual this distraction was: Mr. Nunes professed the need to learn new information about surveillance to warn the president, yet that very information was in the possession of the White House and accessible to Mr. Trump without Mr. Nunes’s intervention.

108,"BALTIMORE — A federal judge refused on Wednesday to delay a hearing on a proposed agreement to overhaul the Baltimore Police Department, calling the Trump administration’s request a “burden and inconvenience.” The Justice Department had asked for a delay earlier this week, saying it needed time to review the plan and determine whether the proposal, called a consent decree, would hinder efforts to fight violent crime in the city. Federal District Judge James K. Bredar said the hearing would go on as scheduled on Thursday. With hundreds of people expected to testify, the judge said that pushing back the hearing would be a “burden and inconvenience to the court, other parties and, most importantly, the public.” Judge Bredar noted that it was “highly unusual” that both the city and the Justice Department had requested the hearing to allow Baltimore residents to comment on the proposed consent decree. “The primary purpose of this hearing is to hear from the public,” he wrote. “It would be especially inappropriate to grant this late request for a delay when it would be the public who were most adversely affected by a postponement.” A Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, declined to comment. The Obama Justice Department opened an investigation into accusations of misconduct in the Baltimore Police Department in 2015, after the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who sustained a neck injury while in police custody, plunged the city into unrest. The department published a scathing report outlining widespread abuses, including excessive force, unlawful stops and discriminatory practices. Last month, dozens of organizations and about 50 people submitted 195 pages of written comments on the proposed agreement, which the city reached with the Justice Department during the last days of the Obama administration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo this week announcing his intention to review all existing consent agreements. The Justice Department’s request to postpone the hearing was met with fierce opposition from city officials, including Mayor Catherine E. Pugh and the police commissioner, Kevin Davis, both of whom vowed to press on with an overhaul of the Police Department regardless of what happens with the consent decree. But Commissioner Davis and Ms. Pugh emphasized that a court-enforced agreement would enable the department to put those changes in place.

Two days after a New Jersey Transit train derailed at Pennsylvania Station in New York on Monday, eight of the 21 tracks at the station, North America’s busiest, remained closed on Wednesday, prompting a third day of travel chaos across the region. Officials at Amtrak, which owns Penn Station, said they were working to repair damage caused by the derailment but warned that service might not be fully restored until Friday. Minor train derailments are not uncommon, but this one occurred at one of the worst possible spots: a switch point where multiple tracks connect and space for workers making repairs is tight. So far, the investigation into the derailment has focused on the condition of the tracks, rather than on human error or mechanical problems with the train, according to an official in New Jersey who was briefed on the inquiry but who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The infrastructure damage caused by the derailment was extensive, totaling more than $1 million, the official said.

The head of the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, last week denied the petition to outlaw chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often used on apples, oranges and other crops, even though the agency’s own safety experts concluded that the chemical should be outlawed. Mr. Pruitt did not present any new evidence that it is safe, and said the agency could not be forced to complete a review of chlorpyrifos until 2022, when there is a deadline for re-evaluating it. The E.P.A. had been under a court order to respond by the end of March to a 10-year-old petition to ban the chemical, originally filed in 2007 by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pesticide Action Network. The most recent E.P.A. analysis concluded that children were being exposed to up to 140 times the safe levels of the pesticide through food alone. An earlier report said drinking water can also be contaminated. “The science is clear that this chemical is dangerous,” said Erik Olson, senior attorney and director of the health program at N.R.D.C. “We are asking the court to step in to keep our children safe.” An E.P.A. report issued last November concluded the risks justified a complete ban on chlorpyrifos, citing studies on pregnant women and children done at Columbia University that found evidence of neurodevelopmental effects in children whose mothers were exposed to chlorpyrifos in pregnancy. Dow Chemical, which makes the product, has argued that the science is inconclusive. A review panel of scientists also raised questions about the methodology the agency had used, leading to revisions but not altering the recommendation for a ban.

112,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently ordered a review of federal agreements with a number of local law enforcement agencies aimed at reforming troubled departments. As a first step, the Justice Department on Monday asked a judge to delay a consent decree that would overhaul Baltimore’s police force. On its face, Mr. Sessions’s  order simply asks whether the consent decrees promote public safety, support officers, respect local control and are warranted. But underlying the order is the Trump administration’s belief that efforts to align police practices with the Constitution have compromised public safety and thrown police officers under the bus. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. Countless police chiefs and mayors are vocal about wanting federal reform or have emerged from the consent decree process remarking that their departments were the better for it. Mr. Sessions claims to want to revert to local control, but he should listen to local officials like Baltimore’s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, who called the Justice Department’s request to delay the reform agreement “a punch in the gut” and noted that “a consent decree will make the Baltimore police department better both with the crime fight and our community relationships.” No matter what review Mr. Sessions conducts, he cannot unilaterally undo these reform agreements. That’s because the district courts that oversee them will ultimately decide their fate. In addition, the reforms are negotiated with local elected officials and law enforcement leaders, with extensive input from grass-roots organizations, police unions, officers and civilians. Mr. Sessions can try to undermine them, but many of the reforms are durable. That’s good, because communities around the country need this work to continue. In cities like Ferguson, Mo., Chicago and Baltimore, federal reform addresses unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests, and excessive and retaliatory force. These problems erode trust between police departments and the communities they serve, trust that is essential to effective policing as well as officer and public safety.

114,"WASHINGTON — John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said Wednesday that it was doubtful that a wall along the full border with Mexico would ever be built, despite an oft-repeated campaign promise by President Trump. “It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,” Mr. Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee. Instead, Mr. Kelly said, the department will look to build physical barriers — including fencing and concrete walls — in places that make sense. He said that the department was still studying the best places to construct such barriers, and that he could not give an estimate of the cost. The first bids for prototypes of the border wall were due Tuesday. According to people briefed on the agency’s plan, the first new section of the wall will be built on a short strip of federally owned land in San Diego, where there is already fencing. Congress has not yet acted on the funding request for the wall, and it faces considerable opposition from Democrats and even some Republicans. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Congress probably would not grant the Trump administration’s request for additional money for the border wall this year, adding that it would most likely be included in the next fiscal year’s appropriation.

One by one, President Trump’s campaign promises seem to be less likely — or at least won’t happen on the timetable he anticipated. So, why are so many chief executives and investors still seemingly bullish about a Trumpian economy? The answer they consistently provide: regulations. Or the promise to get rid of them. But it is actually something else, something that seems vastly underappreciated, that is staring us right in the face: The people whom Mr. Trump has appointed to positions of power can wield significant influence over how business is conducted in America. And in many cases, they can do so unilaterally, without the approval of Congress. The presidency of Donald J. Trump — the wealthiest businessman to occupy the White House in recent memory — has ushered in a new paradigm, one in which business and government are married in a way never seen before. And the people whom Mr. Trump has appointed come from the most senior ranks of business, bringing with them a frame of reference that is almost strictly about profit and economic growth. It isn’t often said aloud, but the aristocracy that Mr. Trump has put in place may be more important than any rule written on paper. And while there are significant questions about whether their experience in business will translate in Washington — and to the Regular Joe who supported Mr. Trump — their focus on issues that relate to the economy and their reverence for increasing G.D.P. have lifted the spirits in corner offices across America. Whether the topic is trade, infrastructure or taxes, to the C.E.O. set, Mr. Trump speaks their language. “We are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads,” Mr. Trump declared on Tuesday in Washington to a group of chief executives representing companies like Citigroup, MasterCard and JetBlue.

117,"WASHINGTON — When North Korea launched a medium-range missile on Tuesday evening, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson issued a statement so cryptic that it left much of Washington confused. “North Korea launched yet another intermediate-range ballistic missile,” it began. “The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.” In fact, the Trump administration has said very little about North Korea, apart from some Twitter posts and Mr. Tillerson’s own statements in Seoul, South Korea, two weeks ago — when he said the United States would negotiate with North Korea only after it gave up its nuclear weapons and missiles. And that is unlikely to happen. A comprehensive policy review, ahead of the visit of China’s president, Xi Jinping, to the United States this week, came to an unsurprising conclusion: The administration would greatly intensify economic and military pressure on the North for the foreseeable future, and assure the Chinese that, once that pressure was in place, it would consider “engaging” the North Koreans. That is, the United States would negotiate with them, presumably before they have given up their nuclear weapons and missiles, despite Mr. Tillerson’s earlier statements. Mr. Tillerson has made clear he will be a secretary of few words, preferring to do his deals behind closed doors and open himself to as little probing of the strategy as possible. But in the absence of much public comment, American allies seem confused about the administration’s strategy of coercive diplomacy. It is unclear whether the goal is to force the North Koreans to surrender their arsenal, as Mr. Tillerson suggested, or just freeze missile and nuclear tests and open a negotiation. And many of those allies wonder how increasing pressure is likely to succeed when directed against a country that has survived financial cutoffs, trade sanctions and the presence of surrounding military forces for more than six decades.

118,"This article has been updated to reflect news developments. The word “filibuster” sounds silly, like the name of a pompous but ultimately well-meaning character in a Dickens novel. The phrase “nuclear option,” on the other hand, sounds terrifying. So now that the Republicans have used the nuclear option to kill the poor filibuster to clear the way for the elevation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, we can lose perspective. In truth, eliminating the filibuster is a minor change compared with the problem that such a move takes a step toward solving: the recent rise of a system based on supermajority rule rather than majority rule. Of course, the modern filibuster, which remains in effect for legislation, doesn’t require senators to give speeches through the night. It’s all very abstract; in the case of nonspending bills, the minority party simply let it be known that it has enough votes to block the legislation. In effect, the minority party now gets to decide when a bill should require 60 votes instead of 51. The switch to supermajority rule happened without a constitutional amendment, without a national debate, without its even becoming a major issue in a presidential campaign. Because it happened gradually, we didn’t fully appreciate: The 788 filibusters since 2007 — those were the “nuclear” moments. It’s also confusing that the Republicans are saying: Don’t worry. Although we’re ending the filibuster against Supreme Court nominees, we’ll still allow the procedure to block legislation. If anything, there’s more of a case for eliminating the filibuster for congressional bills than for the court. If a horrible justice gets on the court, he or she is there for life; if a destructive piece of legislation gets through, it can be repealed. I remember vividly when I first became aware that the “Schoolhouse Rock” version of how a bill becomes a law had quietly disappeared. I was covering Congress for Newsweek during the Clinton administration. The Democrats were pushing legislation to create a national service program, which had broad support.

119,"Think things are dire? So does Joshua Tillman, the songwriter who is releasing “Pure Comedy,” his third album as Father John Misty. The title of “Pure Comedy” is one of the album’s very few jokes, a bit of blunt irony for an all-too-persuasive set of songs envisioning global catastrophe as the inevitable result of human nature. Singing with earnest clarity, Father John Misty indicts selfishness, ignorance, distraction, vanity, politics, self-delusion, dogmatism, technocracy, God and, by no means least, himself. Midway through the album, like a roadblock, is “Leaving L.A.,” a plaintive 13-minute dirge with lyrics that accurately describe it as “some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe.” It’s morose, but also plush; Mr. Tillman croons those 10 verses atop soothing string-section arrangements. And the song grows into an acutely self-conscious, autobiographical portrait of where Mr. Tillman finds himself now, questioning his own role as a songwriter, careerist and maybe artist, or, as he sarcastically puts it, “Another white guy in 2017/Who takes himself so goddamn seriously.” The album is a self-questioning singer-songwriter’s reaction to the beginning of the Trump years, interrogating himself and his listeners about what culture can possibly accomplish. At a Father John Misty performance on July 23, the day after Mr. Trump’s dystopian convention speech accepting the Republican nomination, Mr. Tillman cut his set short and gave a harangue, complaining about entertainment “numbing” its consumers and ranting about how “stupidity just [expletive] runs the world.” On the album, he extrapolates further in “Total Entertainment Forever,” envisioning a world where the pleasures of virtual reality have entirely supplanted real life: Mr. Tillman has recorded extensively since 2003 as J. Tillman and has been in and out of bands, including a stint as the drummer in Fleet Foxes. He uses the Father John Misty name as both a mouthpiece and a persona, as a questionable character navigating an overripe, compromised world. The song that opened Father John Misty’s 2012 debut, “Fear Fun,” was “Funtimes in Babylon,” a sardonic embrace of Hollywood excess. Mr. Tillman had a strict religious upbringing that he broke away from, but he is still making moral arguments. Father John Misty is also a musical throwback. His bleak contemporary tidings arrive in rich, retro settings. The sound harks back to the late 1960s and early 1970s era of singer-songwriters, particularly those who were clustered around Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles and living a hippie dream of self-expression and self-indulgence, amid vintage guitars and well-equipped studio hideaways.

120,"An inappropriate touch. An insulting dismissal. A sexual ultimatum. A suggestion that a job is not fit for a woman. Droves of women have shared their own experiences with workplace sexual harassment on social media this week, spurred by claims against Bill O’Reilly, the Fox News host. The revelation that five women received settlements totaling $13 million after accusing him of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior has prompted more than 20 companies to pull advertising from his show, while others have called for his dismissal. The outpouring came six months after thousands of women posted accounts of being groped or assaulted in the wake of Donald J. Trump’s boasts on tape that he had forced himself on women. In each case, social media offered an outlet for women who said they had either been too afraid or too ashamed to describe their experiences publicly, or to report them in their workplaces for fear of retaliation. As reports circulated about the O’Reilly case, a hashtag, #droporeilly, was born, and it soon morphed into a meeting place for women to describe the professional mistreatment they said they had endured. One of those women, Kerri McKeand, 40, a paralegal from Chicago, offered her experience of working as an assistant to a project manager on the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago, about 10 years ago. When she was required to visit a construction site, she and a female colleague were asked to appear less feminine by taping down their breasts, not wearing makeup and hiding their hair with bandannas, she said in an interview on Wednesday. Ms. McKeand refused to comply with the restrictions, she said. During that visit, while on an elevator with men, she was sexually harassed, and a pornographic magazine was tossed at her feet, she said. She reported it to her boss who, according to Ms. McKeand, said, “I told you this would happen.” It was clear that “nothing would be done about it,” she added. “It was just kind of this accepted culture in this industry.” She said that those experiences had led her away from the construction field. Becoming a project manager seemed like the highest position a woman could attain, she said. Many other women shared similar experiences. Ms. McKeand said she was heartened by women’s willingness to share their stories on social media. “Silence is pervasive, and I think the more silent we are about it, the more it will continue,” she said. “It’s especially important for younger women to know that these things exist and to know what they can do when they are faced with these situations.” “I had no idea when I was younger of what sexual harassment was, what my rights were,” she added, citing an incident when she was 17, when her boss made her sit on his lap. “So hopefully this dialogue puts that in the forefront, so women can go into the work force having an idea of what’s acceptable and what’s not.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-women.html?searchResultPosition=85
121,"To the Editor: Re “Chemical Attack on Syrians Ignites World’s Outrage” (front page, April 5): The Obama administration responded to the 2013 use of chemical weapons weakly at first, only later ramping up its support of human rights even after the famous “red line” had been crossed. President Barack Obama learned that empty threats are ineffective, and that it is better to speak softly but carry a big stick, as reflected in the final years of his administration. President Trump should learn from Mr. Obama and act on the blatant violation of human rights and international law immediately. If not, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria will continue to see signs of weakness and respond only by continued, if not increased, use of chemical weapons. Furthermore, inaction would signal to President Vladimir Putin that the United States is unwilling to stand up for human rights or even the validity of international law, as he probably already suspects. This will inevitably lead to greater Russian influence and mischief in Syria and the Middle East. Appeasement is not the answer. The United States must maintain its global influence and cannot turn a blind eye to the immorality of chemical weapon use. Our response must demonstrate commitment to moral authority, universal human rights and a vigorous defense of liberal democratic values. PATRICK BRANDER NEWCOMBE

Mr. Xi is known to be an avid soccer fan, bent on transforming China into a great power in that egalitarian team sport, but the Chinese Communist Party maintains an ideological contempt for golf as a rich person’s game. That view, among others, places him at odds with President Trump, who owns more than a dozen golf courses and whose so-called Winter White House, the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., charges more than $200,000 for membership. However he spends his time at Mar-a-Lago, “it’s safe to say there’s not going to be any golf,” the White House said in a statement. Mr. Trump, who played 18 holes with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan during his visit in February, will have to find another way to build a warm rapport with his Chinese counterpart. Although as many as a million people in China, not necessarily part of the wealthy elite, play golf, the game has become a symbol of capitalist excesses and corruption in the eyes of the Communist Party. That view goes back to 1949, when Mao Zedong declared golf the “sport for millionaires.” Mr. Xi has led a crackdown on corruption, and golf has been depicted as a temptation that has led party officials astray. Dozens of courses across China have been shut in recent years, ostensibly to preserve water and arable lands. What might Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi do instead of playing golf in between discussions about trade or what to do about North Korea’s nuclear provocations? “It’s possible that they’ll walk around a bit, as the mood strikes,” the White House statement said, “but nothing formal or nothing involving golf clubs.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/world/asia/xi-jinping-golf-trump-mar-a-lago.html?searchResultPosition=97
126,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve expects to start reducing its huge investment holdings later this year, unwinding a giant program undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis to revive the economy. The holdings — which amount to more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage securities — are a legacy of the Fed’s campaign to help the economy recover from the depths of a recession. The Fed, increasingly confident that the American economy is “at or near maximum employment,” is beginning to loosen its grip on the economy, according to an official account that the Fed published Wednesday. Officials voted at the meeting in March to raise the Fed’s benchmark interest rate — the third time since the financial crisis — to a range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Since the meeting, Fed officials have said that it is on course to increase rates by at least an additional half a percentage point this year. Both the low rates and the investments were intended to support growth by encouraging risk-taking and borrowing by consumers and businesses. Now the Fed is gradually reducing that support. No decision was made about the timing or the details of any move to reduce the Fed’s holdings. The markets took the news with relative calm, suggesting that investors share the central bank’s assessment that the economy is getting closer to walking without crutches. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has traded in a narrow range since December, even as the Fed has raised rates twice. Indeed, some analysts said the Fed might need to take stronger steps to end its stimulus campaign. “Financial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways,” said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock’s U.S. multi-sector fixed income team.

Here’s what the available evidence, including a declassified four-page American intelligence report, tells us about the reliability of the Russian account. Russian officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, have publicly doubted whether a toxic attack even happened, and said that any chemical weapons in Syria belonged to insurgents fighting President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, not the government. The White House has asserted that the Assad government carried out the attack, and that the Russians tried to cover it up by spreading “false narratives.” There is no evidence that online video and photographs of the attack were fabricated, as Russia’s deputy envoy to the United Nations suggested last week. The images showed that scores of people, including children, died on April 4 in Khan Sheikhun, in northern Syria, suffering symptoms consistent with having breathed in some sort of nerve agent. On Tuesday, the Turkish health minister, Recep Akdag, confirmed a preliminary report that sarin had been used after an examination of the blood and urine of four victims who were evacuated from Syria to Turkey after the attack. Russian officials, citing their own monitoring systems, say a Syrian airstrike around noon on April 4 hit weapons-storage facilities on the eastern outskirts of Khan Sheikhun under the control of insurgents, including a “terrorist warehouse” where they were making “projectiles stuffed with chemical agents” to send to fighters in Iraq.

Ferguson was one of many predominantly black communities across the country that were under white control, and they strategized about ways to change that. But those hopes for sweeping increases in black political leadership have not come to fruition, a point driven home in the mayoral election this week. Although much of the activism today stems from the killing of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, voters here — at least the few who turned out — re-elected James Knowles III, a white Republican who has been the object of much scorn among those who believe the city has discriminated against black people. About 67 percent of the city’s 21,000 residents are black, and 29 percent are white, according to the 2010 census. Some activists are now assessing what is happening politically for black people and whether there needs to be a complete rethinking of how they engage with mainstream politics. “With all that’s happened within the past two years nationally, I think I am concerned,” said Allen Frimpong, an activist based in New York. “I would expect that folks would, at the very least, move to the polls, and that’s not happening.

His two days of talks at Mar-a-Lago with President Xi Jinping will test whether the two men — Mr. Trump an unpredictable novice, Mr. Xi a tightly scripted, experienced leader — can begin to effectively manage the world’s most significant bilateral relationship. By undoing American support for an international agreement on climate change, repudiating an Asia-oriented trade deal and calling for funding cuts for the United Nations, Mr. Trump has already ceded leadership in key areas to Mr. Xi, who is eager to expand Beijing’s role as an international power and has increasingly positioned his country as a competitor of the United States. It will be disastrous for America and the world if Mr. Trump continues on this disengagement path. Mr. Trump does seem to appreciate the threat from North Korea’s rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs, putting that matter at the top of his agenda. He could hardly avoid it, given the fact that the North conducted another missile test on Tuesday as Mr. Xi was en route to the United States. Mr. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he expects China, the North’s main supplier of food and fuel, to increase pressure beyond what it has been willing to do so far to force an end to the weapons programs. In an interview in The Financial Times on Monday, he was even more demanding, warning that the United States would take unilateral action to eliminate the nuclear threat if Beijing fails to act, presumably by curbing trade and assistance. Analysts say China may be willing to increase pressure somewhat on North Korea, but well short of causing the regime in Pyongyang to collapse. Most experts believe that the North will not abandon its nuclear program unless the leadership at the top changes. China opposes this because it fears a surge of refugees into its territory and wants to keep North Korea as a buffer against a potentially unified Korean Peninsula dominated by the American military.

In fact, the governor was far from where the chaos was unfolding, choosing to go to Atlantic City to celebrate the opening of a casino while travelers vented their frustration on social media, on radio call-in shows and on packed platforms. The derailment on Monday of a New Jersey Transit train did not just cripple New Jersey Transit; it also disrupted service on Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road, the two other rail systems that share Penn Station. But it has been riders of New Jersey Transit, the nation’s third-busiest railroad, who have endured the worst travel experiences. Along with anger, many riders said someone had to be responsible for the missed hours of work, the lost wages, the extra costs from extended day care, the wasted — and increasingly expensive — gas. And many of them set their sights on Mr. Christie. “He’s nowhere to be found, while literally hundreds of thousands of his constituents are struggling and businesses are losing money,” said Dave Geller, 44, who had to work from his home in Maplewood on Wednesday. “At some point the buck has to stop where?

They also know that in 2010, Mr. Christie scuttled plans for a new tunnel that had been scheduled to open next year. Mr. Christie’s commitment to public transit has been a recurring issue. Under his administration, the state subsidy to New Jersey Transit plummeted 90 percent. And for years, he had steadfastly refused to support an increase in the state’s gas tax to help finance the depleted transportation fund used to finance transit projects, relenting only late last year. However, he did sign a bill last month authorizing $400 million in spending on New Jersey transportation.

133,"WASHINGTON — One by one, the senators shuffled to the lectern on Wednesday, explaining themselves grimly, reflecting on the specter of mutually assured destruction and wondering aloud how the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch had delivered the institution to this moment. It was the eve of two seminal votes for the Capitol’s upper chamber: an expected Democratic filibuster of Judge Gorsuch on Thursday and a likely rule change pushed by Republicans — the so-called nuclear option — to bypass the filibuster and confirm President Trump’s selection with a simple majority vote. On a few points, at least, bipartisan consensus seemed to have congealed: This is terrible for the Senate. This is terrible for the country. And this is happening. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, spoke of the “further and perhaps irreparable damage it will do to the United States Senate.” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, suggested it was a trying time to be a lawmaker who prides herself “as one who believes in the traditions of the Senate.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=77

The visit to Excel Academy, an all-girls charter school, by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Queen Rania of Jordan and Melania Trump, the first lady, was meant to emphasize the Trump administration’s stance on school choice. But it was also part of a day of photo ops intended to cast a softer lens on a presidential administration grappling with several international crises, and provide another glimpse of a first lady whose sporadic appearances in Washington have revealed relatively little about her own leadership style. Earlier in the day, Mrs. Trump and Queen Rania stood behind President Trump and King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House. It was just one item on Wednesday’s agenda, which was also packed with a news conference to condemn a chemical attack in Syria and meetings to discuss brokering a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

135,"FRANKFURT — When Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, met with President Trump in Washington, she brought three executives with her, all heads of German manufacturing or engineering giants. Their message? Germany is not a threat to the United States. For decades, the United States has been a kind of second home to German carmakers, a place not only to sell vehicles but also to build them. German manufacturers employ thousands at plants across the United States, and produce finished products like cars, as well as parts and machinery, within the country for sale domestically or export abroad. But that the point — made during a session that included the chief executives of BMW, the carmaker; Siemens, the electronics and engineering company; and Schaeffler, a major supplier of parts for automotive engines, transmissions and chassis — needed to be made at all underlines growing concern in Berlin over hostility directed at German industry by the Trump administration. Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, has accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, even though German politicians and economists are among the staunchest critics of European Central Bank policies that have encouraged a weak euro. And the American president himself wondered aloud to a German newspaper in January why Americans buy lots of Mercedes cars while Germans hardly buy any Chevrolets. The anger from the Trump administration has been a rude shock, threatening the bedrock of Germany’s economy and leaving executives perplexed. Their quandary is one faced by business across Europe: Mr. Trump has questioned the assumptions that have underpinned trans-Atlantic commerce since the end of World War II, without making clear what could come instead. “I think there is a little bit lack of understanding,” Harald Krüger, the chief executive of BMW, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show in March, not long after Mr. Trump had attacked the company for building a plant in Mexico. “Maybe there hasn’t been enough data supplied before.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/dealbook/germany-us-trade-trump.html?searchResultPosition=110
136,"WASHINGTON — When Congress voted to overturn internet privacy rules last month, the swift action by Republican lawmakers sent a clear message: They were just getting started. The next target is net neutrality, which is the guarantee that all internet content is equally accessible. That could be followed by cuts in broadband subsidies for low-income households and a relaxation in rules preventing media consolidation in local markets. Republican regulators and lawmakers have been waiting for this moment. Coordinating across the government, they are putting several telecommunications and technology policies created during the Obama administration on the chopping block. Already, Ajit Pai, the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who was appointed to the agency by President Barack Obama and named to lead it by President Trump, has begun chipping away at the low-income broadband subsidy and net neutrality rules created by his Democratic predecessor. “There was a good bit of overreach by the past F.C.C. that caused a lot of confusion,” said Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who was vice chairwoman for President Trump’s transition. “We are going to have technology and telecommunications policy that is light touch.” In a major philosophical shift from the Obama administration, Republican leaders have said they will look for proof of harm before creating new regulations for telecom firms. They believe antitrust and consumer protection laws suffice for government oversight of the sector. “The F.C.C. needs a more evidence-based approach,” said Roslyn Layton, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who was on Mr. Trump’s F.C.C. transition team. “No one is writing in and asking for Title 2 reclassification of broadband.

The president declined to offer any details about potential action. But he said his horror at the images of “innocent children, innocent babies” choked by poison gas in a rebel-held area of Syria had caused him to reassess his approach. Only days after the White House declared it would be “silly” to persist in trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Trump said, “My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.” “It crossed a lot of lines for me,” the president declared at a news conference in the Rose Garden, referring to the “red line” that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had drawn before a 2013 poison-gas attack by Mr. Assad’s forces. Mr. Obama’s failure to strike Syria after that, Mr. Trump claimed, sowed the conditions for this new assault. The estimated death toll was reported to have exceeded 100. Syria was one of several places, along with North Korea and Iran, where Mr. Trump on Wednesday threatened a forceful American response. But in all these cases, he declined to disclose options, arguing that there was a need for surprise but stoking worries that his fledgling administration is not ready to deal with multiple threats across the Middle East and Asia. At the United Nations, Mr. Trump’s ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, warned that the United States might take unilateral action if the Security Council failed to respond to this latest atrocity in Syria. A shift in policy could include airstrikes, which were considered and ultimately rejected by Mr. Obama.

139,"Bull markets aren’t what they used to be, at least when it comes to New York’s economy. Although the stock market is surging and profits on Wall Street last year hit their highest level since 2012, the good times are not translating into jobs the way they did a decade ago, before the financial crisis and the Great Recession hit. Employment in the securities industry in New York City has risen for three straight years. But, at 177,000, there are still 10,000 fewer jobs in the sector than in 2008. And even if the stock market keeps rising and shares of behemoths like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to hit postcrisis highs, don’t expect a surge in hiring on the Street. “The securities industry is still a pretty important source of very highly paid, very highly skilled jobs, but it’s not really contributing to growth in the number of jobs,” said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. To be sure, financial services and banking remain a key part of the overall economy in the tristate area. The financial services and securities industry is the largest private-sector contributor to tax revenue in New York State. What economists call the ‘‘multiplier effect’’ is especially high for finance jobs, since annual bonuses for bankers end up in the pockets of people like contractors, gardeners, jewelers, car dealers and real estate brokers. What is more, Wall Street remains crucial for the region’s tax base, especially for New York State. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of Albany’s tax revenues last year, and about 7 percent of the city’s tax haul.

A leaked list of the Trump administration’s priority projects seemed to speak to the scope of the president’s ambitions: a high-speed rail line linking Houston and Dallas; a desalination plant in Orange County, Calif.; and improvements to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana, the longest continuous bridge over water in the world. Then came Mr. Trump’s budget proposal, which would slash the Department of Transportation’s spending by 13 percent, end subsidies for Amtrak’s long-distance trains and eliminate the Obama administration’s “Tiger” grant program, which has helped fund mass transit systems across the country. Among the potential victims of the president’s proposed cutbacks: Maryland’s long-awaited Purple Line, a planned 16-mile light rail system through the capital’s suburbs. Maryland had been just four days away from clinching some $900 million in federal aid in August when a federal judge ruled to temporarily invalidate environmental approvals for the project. But under President Trump’s plan, projects that don’t yet have complete federal funding agreements would be financed “by the localities that use and benefit from these localized projects.” Supporters of the project are devastated. “It was on the one-yard line,” said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association, a Washington-based advocacy group.

Sadly, drug resistance is causing us to lose our ability to treat these infections. We urgently need to develop next-generation diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics.

The former Massachusetts congressman says that President Trump is vowing to roll back financial regulations that even some of the biggest players in the banking industry have quietly come to tolerate. Many Americans — outside the financial industry — are not clamoring to scrap Dodd-Frank either, or even know what the law really does, said Mr. Frank, a Democrat who helped write it. So why is Mr. Trump adding Dodd-Frank to the long list of regulations he’s seeking to undo? “He has to denigrate everything the Democrats did,” says Mr. Frank, who retired from the House in 2013. “I think he has to say he inherited a mess. Well, he has to find a mess.” DealBook caught up with Mr. Frank last month as he was arriving in New York for a meeting at Signature Bank, a small lender, where he now serves on the board. Our conversation spanned a variety of issues that were addressed in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Regulation of derivatives was a major focus, owing to market-disrupting blowups like a trading scandal at JPMorgan Chase that came to be known as the “London Whale” episode, and the near-collapse of the insurance giant American International Group, or A.I.G., because of derivatives. We also talked about the political tug-of-war over a new consumer protection agency the law created called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as the C.F.P.B.  When President Trump signed an order in February to revisit financial regulation, including parts of Dodd-Frank, he said that the law had prevented a lot of his friends “that have nice businesses” from borrowing money.

143,"If your tax rate were lowered tomorrow, how would it affect your work habits? Maybe you would work harder — put in longer hours, take on special projects, do everything you can to get that next promotion. After all, lower taxes would mean you get to keep more of each dollar you earn. Or maybe you would work less. After all, if you are happy with your current standard of living, lower taxes would mean that you could maintain it while putting in fewer hours at the office. Who needs that promotion when you’re able to keep more of the money you already make? Or possibly you would work exactly the same amount, because life is too short to sit around making every decision based on what is in the tax code. That little mental exercise — and the fact that reasonable people may choose any of the options — helps explain why the Trump administration’s plans to induce stronger economic growth by cutting taxes won’t necessarily work. At the core of decades of Republican economic policy is a simple idea: Cutting taxes will unleash investments and lead to higher incomes, more jobs and more rapid growth. And there are historical episodes that would seem to support that idea, most notably when Ronald Reagan cut taxes in the early 1980s, and the economy boomed in the years that followed. But there’s considerably less evidence that this cause-and-effect applies at all times and at all places. George W. Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were followed by years of disappointing growth. Bill Clinton’s tax increases in 1993 were followed by a boom that surpassed the Reagan-era expansion.

Mr. Bharara, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was among 46 United States attorneys who were asked on March 10 to submit their resignations.

In truth, it may not make that much of a difference at all. In an unexpected way, it may well herald the beginning of a better era for the Senate. The Senate Republicans’ successful effort on Thursday to end the 60-vote threshold to proceed with confirmation of Supreme Court nominees was really only the final step in a process set in motion by Democrats in 2013, when they removed that threshold for other nominees. That set off a far bigger firestorm, and Republicans have now simply extended that precedent. Republicans are quick to point out — and many Democrats privately agree — that had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the White House last year and Democrats taken the Senate, a similar confrontation would have been likely in the other direction, and that Democrats might have needed to take the same step Republicans took to confirm any Supreme Court nominee Mrs. Clinton had chosen. Congress has already been dwelling in the rubble for a while.

152,"It’s going to take a lot of tape and scissors to piece together a leveraged buyout of Staples Inc. that works. Staples, the office-supplies chain, is reportedly in talks with private equity shops about a possible deal. According to Reuters Breakingviews calculations, however, the investment proposition looks shaky. Since a plan to merge with Office Depot was shot down by United States regulators last year, Staples has replaced its chief executive and renewed efforts to slash costs. Sales at its 1,500-plus stores in the United States and Canada fell 7 percent last year and now account for less than 40 percent of some $18 billion in revenue. The rest comes from online and business customers. The company’s clean balance sheet and about $900 million a year of operating cash flow make it a buyout candidate, on paper. A 30 percent premium to its undisturbed market value, before news reports about a possible sale, would make the price tag about $7.4 billion. Buyouts often rely on increasing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, but in this case merely stopping the decline would be an achievement. Most leveraged buyouts these days involve an equity check for about 40 percent of the value. Though it would amplify the risk, at just 30 percent, Staples’s debt would come in under four times its $1.3 billion of expected Ebitda. That’s practicable. Then assume the buyer could sell Staples again in five years at the same multiple of Ebitda as it paid, just shy of six times. The company’s dividends run around $300 million a year. Suppose generously that the new owner could squeeze out the same amount even after paying interest on $5 billion of debt. Tally it all up, and the internal rate of return would reach 14 percent. It’s decent, but falls short of the usual buyout target and would require exemplary execution in a tough business at a company that’s currently shrinking. Combining with Office Depot would transform the calculus. Staples once envisioned $1 billion a year of annual synergies, which would improve returns sharply. There’s a notion among deal makers that the Trump administration will ease up on competition reviews. The new president also wants to preserve American jobs, though. That makes a merger far-fetched — and may leave any Staples buyout plan strictly on the back of an envelope.

Since the election of President Trump, members of the artistic community have come together frequently for charity and protest concerts in New York City. “Dear America” is another fund-raising effort for organizations like Planned Parenthood and the Southern Poverty Law Center — but it might be one of the most diverse lineups for a benefit show staged in the still-young Trump administration. “Dear America” will feature appearances by the performance artist Amanda Palmer, the singer-songwriters Regina Spektor and Elvis Perkins, the opera singer Julia Bullock, and writers and thinkers like A. M. Homes and Anand Giridharadas.
212-353-1600, websterhall.com KAREN ELSON at Rough Trade NYC (April 7, 9 p.m.). To produce her 2010 debut album, “The Ghost Who Walks,” the British singer-songwriter and model Karen Elson teamed up with the rock star Jack White, who was her husband at the time. Accordingly, the album was adorned with hallmarks of Mr. White’s style; many of Ms. Elson’s tunes sounded like long-lost rockabilly songs played on a dusty Victrola. After divorcing Mr. White in 2013, Ms. Elson has continued to make music: The results, as heard on her second record, “Double Roses,” are strikingly bright, breezy and beautiful. She’s celebrating the arrival of the new material, out on Friday, with this intimate show.

The steep cost for admission might be worth it: Since James Murphy and his crew of disco-funk wizards reunited in 2016, after a five-year hiatus, they have proved themselves to be one of the best live bands in the country right now. This run of concerts is also a celebration of the opening of the new concert venue Brooklyn Steel.
bowerypresents.com NEW ORDER at Radio City Music Hall (April 13, 8 p.m.). After Ian Curtis, the frontman of the seminal British postpunk band Joy Division, died in 1980, his bandmates soldiered on with the new wave group New Order, which had a string of hits in the 1980s with songs like “Bizarre Love Triangle” and “Blue Monday.” The group underwent another reinvention of sorts two years ago, when it released its 10th studio album, “Music Complete,” without the help of New Order’s founding bassist, Peter Hook. Now, the band is returning to the United States for a limited run of shows, including top-billed slots at the Coachella music festival in Indio, Calif., this month. For this Radio City Music Hall concert, expect a set list that celebrates the group’s significant musical career, mixing Joy Division classics like “Love Will Tear Us Apart” with newer, club-ready bangers from its terrific latest record.

Since 1999, this Austin-based group has made wonderfully uplifting and tuneful instrumental music with an array of quirky instruments like vintage synthesizers and lo-fi drum machines. It’s the kind of material that would lend itself well to movie soundtracks, and in fact, the group has scored movies like the 2012 drama “Kid-Thing” and the coming comedy “Damsel,” a western starring Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. For this show, however, the Octopus Project will be showcasing songs from its new album, “Memory Mirror,” which deftly veers from dazzling Afro-pop guitar hooks to bizarre, psychedelic workouts.

154,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday night that the United States had carried out a missile strike in Syria in response to the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attack this week, which killed more than 80 civilians. “Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the air base in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched,” Mr. Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.” Mr. Trump — who was accompanied by senior advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist; Reince Priebus, his chief of staff; his daughter Ivanka Trump; and others — said his decision had been prompted in part by what he called the failures by the world community to respond effectively to the Syrian civil war. “Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically,” the president said, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen, and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.” The Pentagon announced that 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired at Al Shayrat airfield in Syria. The missiles were aimed at Syrian fighter jets, hardened aircraft shelters, radar equipment, ammunition bunkers, sites for storing fuel and air defense systems.

155,"The sign on the subway door says it plainly: “Riding or moving between cars is prohibited.” Generally, the sign is obeyed. But during an untamed time, not long ago, New Yorkers routinely slid open the doors at the ends of train cars and stood in the open space as the train hurtled through the tunnel. New Yorkers like the future president of the United States. “I understand the subway very well,” President Trump told The New York Times on Wednesday when quizzed about his knowledge of the city’s infrastructure. “I used to ride between the cars.” That was in his days at Kew-Forest School in Queens, Mr. Trump said, which were in the late 1950s. As the city and the subway system deteriorated in subsequent decades, riding between cars became part of the chaotic subterranean landscape: Trains were covered with graffiti and broke down often, passengers smoked cigarettes or worse, and doors between cars banged open and shut of their own accord, practically inviting trespass. “The people who ride our system now consider the ability to cross between cars their personal right,” a subway official wrote in 1983 to a federal safety board that was pressing the Transit Authority to outlaw crossing between cars when the trains were stopped. A seldom-enforced law against traveling between the cars of a moving train was already on the books. On an N train on Thursday, Ronald Dupree, a bouncer and car salesman who grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, recalled his childhood pastime fondly. “It was something to do — you’d feel the breeze,” Mr. Dupree, 46, said.

156,"Stephen K. Bannon, the architect of Donald Trump’s campaign and presidency, is a man with a lot of ideas. He believes that Western civilization is locked in an existential battle with the barbarians at the gates, that nationalists must wrest control from the aloof and corrupt globalist elite, and that America is a once great nation shackled by welfare for both the poor and the wealthy. It was a version of this narrative, market-tested on Breitbart News, that carried Mr. Trump to the presidency. One way to understand Trumpism is as applied Bannonism. The first few months of President Trump’s term have been an attempt to put all of that theory into practice, and by any reasonable standard, that attempt has failed. As it turns out, there’s a difference between spinning yarns and the careful needlework of piecing together policy and political coalitions. The travel ban was Mr. Bannon’s first high-profile defeat. The hastily written and sloppily executed executive order, intended to halt immigration and travel from seven Middle Eastern countries, was immediately met by widespread protests. Mr. Bannon attempted to spin this as a feature, not a bug, an attempt to provoke opposition from the right set of enemies, but even nominal allies recoiled from the ban’s capriciousness. Worse, the executive order was quickly halted by the courts, and even a revised version has not yet been able to pass muster with the judiciary. Mr. Bannon’s most recent defeat is his removal from the National Security Council. As with the travel ban, he and his allies attempted to cast this as part of the plan. In his telling, he had taken a place on the council only to undo the work of Susan Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser; his allies said he was there to monitor Michael Flynn, the first national security adviser under President Trump. With those tasks accomplished, his work on the council was done. These explanations were quickly countered by leaks that portrayed Mr. Bannon as the loser of an internal power struggle, a depiction implicitly confirmed by leaks from his own camp. The media has cultivated the reputation of Steve Bannon as chessmaster and puppeteer, both Rasputin and Svengali, a consigliere with a well-worn library card. “Saturday Night Live” even imagined him as the Grim Reaper. Mr. Bannon has cheerfully played along with this portrayal, likening himself to avatars of dark power like Darth Vader and Dick Cheney. But there was never much reason to believe Mr. Bannon has the political genius necessary to actually bring his ideas to life. It’s true that much of the ideological underpinning of Mr. Trump’s agenda comes from Mr. Bannon, and it’s also true that he has outsize influence with the president. But as accomplishments go, fomenting xenophobia and manipulating a famously mercurial political neophyte are thin evidence of genius.

157,"America stood still that day — Feb. 20, 1962 — as John Glenn, a Marine pilot, climbed into the Mercury capsule, named the Friendship 7, sitting on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral in Florida. In a flight that took about five hours, Mr. Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. In that short time, he became a hero to his generation and those that followed. After the flight, Mr. Glenn was honored by the White House, on Broadway and around country. He became a symbol of can-do spirit, lifting morale and restoring self-confidence at a time when many felt that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union. Mr. Glenn died Dec. 8 at age 95, and he was laid to rest Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery. His flag-draped coffin covered in plastic to protect it from the pouring rain, was carried to the grave site on a horse-drawn caisson. Mr. Glenn’s family scheduled the service on the date that would have been his 74th wedding anniversary. His widow, Annie Glenn, 97, attended the ceremony wearing a red dress; she held a single red rose as she sat in tent next to the couple’s two children, John David and Carolyn. She spoke with visible warmth to the Marine who presented her with the flag, and their faces nearly touched before she gave him a kiss. Six Marine pallbearers in dress uniforms carried Mr. Glenn’s coffin. A military trumpeter played taps, Marines fired three ceremonial rounds from their rifles and mourners recited the 23rd Psalm. No family member made remarks during the portion of the service that was streamed live online. Mr. Glenn returned to space in 1998 aboard the space shuttle Discovery, a mission that made him, at age 77, the oldest man in space. He had many accomplishments outside his career as an astronaut. He flew 149 missions as a Marine fighter pilot in World War II and Korea, broke the transcontinental air speed record, served for 24 years in the United States Senate, and founded the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State University. In his honor, President Trump issued a proclamation and ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half-staff Thursday. Tributes came from fellow astronauts. Robert Lightfoot, the acting administrator of NASA, said in a statement: Lawmakers, including Senator Rob Portman, of Mr. Glenn’s home state, Ohio, offered testimonials. The historic send-off from Scott Carpenter, that Mr. Glenn received more than 50 years ago as he left the launchpad at Cape Canaveral seems fitting: “Godspeed, John Glenn.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/john-glenn-arlington-national-cemetery.html?searchResultPosition=20

I woke up one day and was confronted by a mystery. In my closet. Suddenly, after almost five decades of short skirts — and a firm belief that long skirts were a relic of female oppression (all that material inhibiting movement) — I opened my closet door and discovered that over the last 12 months I had acquired not one but three long skirts and dresses. To wear during the day. How had this happened? Well, O.K., I know how it literally happened — I opened my wallet and paid — but how had it happened internally? What switch had been flipped in my head to alter the thinking of 48 years? Had I, after decades of fighting them, become a sucker for a trend? After all, as someone who spends a large part of her professional life immersed in the world of fashion fads, I generally try to avoid them for myself. Wearing blue when there is blue all over the runways, or florals, or what have you makes me feel like I’ve drunk too much of the Kool-Aid handed out during my twice-yearly perambulations to the shows. I tend to think it’s good to keep a respectable distance between what I wear and what I write. Yet clearly something was going on. And not just with me. Suddenly, everywhere I looked there were women wearing longer hemlines, longer sleeves and higher necklines: on the red carpet, in the White House, from the Upper East Side to Williamsburg to the SoHos in both London and New York. I went back through slide shows from the Oscars and street-style pictures. When two public figures as seemingly diametrically opposed as Rihanna and Melania Trump ended up on the same continuum (one that began with them in full pinup mode and ended with both in full cover), my critical hackles went up and the little hairs on the back of my neck started tingling.

159,"WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president, a finding that did not emerge publicly until after Mr. Trump’s victory months later, former government officials say. The briefings indicate that intelligence officials had evidence of Russia’s intentions to help Mr. Trump much earlier in the presidential campaign than previously thought. The briefings also reveal a critical split last summer between the C.I.A. and counterparts at the F.B.I., where a number of senior officials continued to believe through last fall that Russia’s cyberattacks were aimed primarily at disrupting America’s political system, and not at getting Mr. Trump elected, according to interviews. The former officials said that in late August — 10 weeks before the election — John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director, was so concerned about increasing evidence of Russia’s election meddling that he began a series of urgent, individual briefings for eight top members of Congress, some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break. It is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings. But with concerns growing both internally and publicly at the time about a significant Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee, the C.I.A. began seeing signs of possible connections to the Trump campaign, the officials said. By the campaign’s final weeks, Congress and the intelligence agencies were racing to understand the scope of the Russia threat. In an Aug. 25 briefing for Harry Reid, then the top Democrat in the Senate, Mr. Brennan indicated that Russia’s hackings appeared aimed at helping Mr. Trump win the November election, according to two former officials with knowledge of the briefing. The officials said Mr. Brennan also indicated that unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. The F.B.I. and two congressional committees are now investigating that claim, focusing on possible communications and financial dealings between Russian affiliates and a handful of former advisers to Mr. Trump. So far, no proof of collusion has emerged publicly. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/trump-russia-cia-john-brennan.html?searchResultPosition=18

Families sorted through plans for what to do in case one among them was swept up. Waves of panic have become familiar since Donald J. Trump, who has promised wide-scale deportations of illegal immigrants, became president. Federal agents have made scores of publicized arrests around the nation. As communities wrestle with the administration’s new policy, they face another challenge, too: distinguishing between verifiable reports of arrests and empty rumors driven by fear. In New York, there was talk of raids on trains headed to the Bronx and in Queens, and of checkpoints on Long Island — all later deemed false.

162,"SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter sued the federal government on Thursday to block the unmasking of an anonymous account that has posted messages critical of the Trump administration and has claimed to have ties to a government agency. The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past. Twitter disclosed in a federal court filing on Thursday that it had received a summons directing it to reveal the identity or identities of those behind @ALT_USCIS, one of several so-called alt-accounts run by people purporting to be current or former federal employees. The @ALT_USCIS account, which quickly gained tens of thousands of followers, has frequently criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies and enforcement actions. Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government’s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have “a grave chilling effect” on the speech of alt-accounts that voice resistance to government policies. “A time-honored tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,” Twitter said in its filing. “These First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life.” Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment.

This debut novel imagines the events that lead up to and follow the Second American Civil War at the turn of the 22nd century. Our critic Michiko Kakutani, with high praise rarely bestowed on a debut, calls it “a surprisingly powerful novel — one that creates as haunting a postapocalyptic universe as Cormac McCarthy did in ‘The Road’ (2006), and as devastating a look at the fallout that national events have on an American family as Philip Roth did in ‘The Plot Against America’ (2004).” SUNSHINE STATE: Essays, by Sarah Gerard.

Davis’s sweeping history of the Gulf of Mexico takes into account colorful nature, idiosyncratic human characters, economic development, and the ways in which artists and writers have seen the body of water. In his review, Dwight Garner calls it “a sensitive and sturdy work of environmental history.” RICHARD NIXON: The Life, by John A. Farrell. (Doubleday. $35.)

164,"WASHINGTON — Under intense pressure from President Trump, House Republicans took a small step Thursday to revive legislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, adding a $15 billion fund to help insurers pay claims for their sickest customers. Speaker Paul D. Ryan orchestrated a broad show of Republican support for the proposal, conceived as an amendment to the repeal bill that collapsed on the House floor two weeks ago. But Republicans said they still did not have enough votes to pass the bill, and with the House now on a two-week spring break, time is running out for their planned quick-strike repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Even so, Republicans said the amendment could help heal divisions in their conference and show progress to an impatient president, still smarting from a loss in his first showdown with Congress. By a party-line vote of 9 to 2, the House Rules Committee on Thursday gave its blessing to the proposal, devised by Representatives Gary Palmer of Alabama and David Schweikert of Arizona, both members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Mr. Palmer said the “risk-sharing program” would lower premiums by sparing insurers some costs. With lower prices, he said, more people would buy insurance. He estimated that it would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 1.2 million to 2.2 million. However, those gains would be dwarfed by other parts of the repeal bill, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says would result in 24 million more uninsured people compared with projections under current law.

165,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The diplomatic situation had been looking bright for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. With the help of Russia, he had consolidated his power, the rebels were on their heels and the United States had just declared that ousting him was not a priority. So why would Mr. Assad risk it all, outraging the world by attacking civilians with what Turkey now says was the nerve agent sarin, killing scores of people, many of them children? Why would he inflict the deadliest chemical strike since the 2013 attacks outside Damascus? Those attacks came close to bringing American military retaliation then. And in a stunningly swift reversal, Tuesday’s attack drew a response from President Trump: dozens of cruise missiles launched at a Syrian air base. One of the main defenses offered by Mr. Assad’s allies and supporters, in disputing that his forces carried out the strike on Tuesday, is that such an attack would be “a crazy move,” as one Iranian analyst, Mosib Na’imi, told the Russian state-run news site Sputnik. Yet, rather than an inexplicable act, analysts say, it is part of a carefully calculated strategy of escalating attacks against civilians. For years, at least since it began shelling neighborhoods with artillery in 2012, then bombing them from helicopters and later from jets, the Syrian government has adopted a policy of seeking total victory by making life as miserable as possible for anyone living in areas outside its control. Government forces have been herding defeated opponents from across the country into Idlib Province, where the chemical attack occurred. Starved and bombed out of their enclaves, they are bused under lopsided surrender deals to the province, where Qaeda-linked groups maintain a presence the Syrian military uses as an excuse to bomb without regard for the safety of civilians. Dr. Monzer Khalil, Idlib Province’s health director, said such extreme tactics aimed to demonstrate the government’s impunity and to demoralize its foes.

168,"Pepsi on Wednesday pulled a disastrous advertisement after it was met with widespread ridicule. Titled “Jump In,” the two-and-a-half minute spot was full of clumsy, glib references to police brutality and Black Lives Matter protests. Nearly every tone-deaf frame has become a mocking meme. And the commercial (Pepsi calls it a “short film”) drew the most intense disgust from the very people whose experiences it tried to reflect. But “Jump In” — which bizarrely ends with the model Kendall Jenner handing a police officer a Pepsi, inspiring smiles all around in a happy end to a demonstration that looked more like a street party the whole time — is not just a one-off misfire or an offensive aberration. Rather, it highlights deep structural problems and contradictions in the advertising industry, problems that run much deeper than this particular failure. I’m a white man who has worked in advertising for seven years, and while I’d like to say I’ve never been complicit in similar mistakes, I know I probably have. But my experience gives me some insight. In advertising, any attempts to tackle “big issues” (racism, sexism, domestic violence, climate change) must remain linked to a corporation’s need to push product. Branded content like “Jump In” seeks to provoke while still speaking to the broadest possible audience. Its goal is the sort of edginess that doesn’t alienate anyone. With that in mind — and without any specific knowledge about how “Jump In” came to be — I can imagine that it was born from some combination of good intentions, corporate hedging and a huge failure to grasp the limitations of advertising on the part of the people working for Pepsi’s in-house content agency. But the failings that made “Jump In” a disaster on nearly every level are hardly one-dimensional or confined to this brand or this particular campaign. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, there has been a rash of advertisements seeking to remind consumers of what really makes America great, or to push saccharine messages about the idea that by working together, we can fight evil and make the world a better place. “Jump In” stands out even in this group with its attempt to channel, if not appropriate, the highly specific contemporary notion of “wokeness” — which, loosely defined, refers to understanding of and commitment to addressing injustice.

169,"As Tesla shares surged past $300 this week and the company’s market value surpassed Ford’s, even its founder, Elon Musk, acknowledged on Twitter that the company was “absurdly overvalued if based on the past.” By “the past,” he presumably means old-fashioned valuation measures like price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios, the traditional benchmarks for evaluating stock prices. By those measures, Tesla — a company that lost $773 million last year — is indeed off the charts. Tesla’s market value of nearly $49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford, which earned nearly $11 billion in profit last year, but is within easy striking distance of General Motors, which earned $9.4 billion. In contrast to Tesla, Ford and G.M. shares have dropped recently on fears that auto sales have hit a cyclical peak. Ford and G.M. executives wouldn’t comment on Tesla’s stock surge, but it’s easy to imagine they’d be tearing their hair out in frustration. “It’s nuts,” Bruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing, said of Tesla’s stock price. “Investors believe it’s going to dominate a market that no company has ever dominated before.” But Tesla is not a stock, or a company, that is measured by the past, as Mr. Musk is well aware. He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent “risk-adjusted future cash flows” — and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful, self-driving electric vehicles powered by solar-fed batteries that are easy on the environment.

170,"MEXICO CITY — The United States invasion of Mexico in 1846 inflicted a painful wound that, in the 170 years that followed, turned into a scar. Donald Trump has torn it open again. Among the many lies that he has constructed, none is more ridiculous than his attempt to contradict history by presenting the United States as a victim of Mexico, a country that supposedly steals jobs, imposes onerous treaties and sends its “bad hombres” across the border. To confront this fake history, some Mexicans are proposing to remind Mr. Trump exactly what country was the first victim of American imperialism. They are calling for a lawsuit that would aim to nullify the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (signed on Feb. 2, 1848), in which Mexico — invaded by American soldiers, its capital occupied, its ports and customs stations seized — was forced to accept the American annexation of Texas and concede more than half the rest of Mexican territory, now including most of the states of Arizona, New Mexico and California. This effort is being led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, the elder statesman of the Mexican left. Mr. Cárdenas is convinced that the Mexican government — especially given the need to confront Mr. Trump’s aggression — has a solid legal case. In his opinion, the 1848 treaty violates essential international legal norms and a case can be brought before the International Court of Justice, proposing reparations and indemnification. And even if one admits the legal validity of much of the treaty, there are a number of crucial articles — such as those dealing with citizenship, property and the security of 100,000 Mexicans who remained on what became American territory — that have been ignored from the beginning. Such an effort faces formidable obstacles, though. A former Mexican secretary of foreign relations, Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor, the leading Mexican expert in international law, believes — “much to his regret,” he said — that Mr. Cárdenas’s initiative is not feasible. “In previous times, wars of conquest did not find the same moral and legal condemnation that is nowadays part and parcel of our system of law,” he told me. The treaty would have to be challenged under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, “for which it must be shown that the state did not expressly agree that the treaty is a valid instrument or that, by reasons of its own conduct, that state must be considered as not having acquiesced to the validity of the treaty.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/will-mexico-get-half-of-its-territory-back.html?searchResultPosition=53
171,"Two recent train derailments at Pennsylvania Station in New York that created major travel disruptions were caused by track defects, Amtrak officials said on Thursday, increasing concerns about the aging infrastructure at North America’s busiest train station. Officials also acknowledged that they had been aware of a defect on the tracks at the site of a derailment on Monday before it occurred, but did not recognize the urgency of the problem. The derailment of a New Jersey Transit train on Monday resulted in four days of extraordinary upheaval for hundreds of thousands of commuters across the region. Regular train service was scheduled to return to Penn Station on Friday morning, Amtrak officials said. The accident closed eight of Penn Station’s 21 tracks, causing a cascade of delays across the three railroads that share the station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road. The damage from the derailment required major repairs to the tracks, a complex labyrinth near the Hudson River tunnel. On Thursday, Amtrak took responsibility for the accident this week and for the derailment of one of its Acela trains on March 24. “Based on our recent investigations, we can confirm that problems with our tracks in Penn Station were a cause of both recent derailments,” said Charles W. Moorman, Amtrak’s chief executive. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/nyregion/penn-station-train-service.html?searchResultPosition=35

The miniskirts and Crayola colors of the 1960s, the power shoulders of the ’80s, the minimalism of the ’90s — all reached critical mass well into the midpoint of those eras, when whatever had been bubbling up in wardrobes and on sidewalks found its reflection in the wider world. Well, we have finally reached that stage in the 2010s. The tectonic plates of fashion have shifted. Look around. What do you see?

Young women who used to come in and buy Balmain’s nonexistent dresses are leaving with knee-length skirts with a sweater or blouse by Emilia Wickstead.” And speaking of Balmain — even that label offered long knits, long sleeves and long crocodile skins among the short-’n’-fringed styles in its last collection.

176,"In 1937, ascending leaders of the Third Reich hosted two art exhibitions in Munich. One, the “Great German Art Exhibition,” featured art Adolf Hitler deemed acceptable and reflective of an ideal Aryan society: representational, featuring blond people in heroic poses and pastoral landscapes of the German countryside. The other featured what Hitler and his followers referred to as “degenerate art”: work that was modern or abstract, and art produced by people disavowed by Nazis — Jewish people, Communists, or those suspected of being one or the other. The “degenerate art” was presented in chaos and disarray, accompanied by derogatory labels, graffiti and catalog entries describing “the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or pencil.” Hitler and those close to him strictly controlled how artists lived and worked in Nazi Germany, because they understood that art could play a key role in the rise or fall of their dictatorship and the realization of their vision for Germany’s future. Last month, the Trump administration proposed a national budget that includes the elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts. The NEA operates with a budget of about $150 million a year. As critics have observed, this amount is about 0.004 percent of the federal budget, making the move a fairly inefficient approach to trimming government spending. Many Americans have been protesting the cuts by pointing out the many ways that art enriches our lives — as they should. The arts bring us joy and entertainment; they can offer a reprieve from the trials of life or a way to understand them. But as Hitler understood, artists play a distinctive role in challenging authoritarianism. Art creates pathways for subversion, for political understanding and solidarity among coalition builders. Art teaches us that lives other than our own have value. Like the proverbial court jester who can openly mock the king in his own court, artists who occupy marginalized social positions can use their art to challenge structures of power in ways that would otherwise be dangerous or impossible. Authoritarian leaders throughout history have intuited this fact and have acted accordingly. The Stalinist government of the 1930s required art to meet strict criteria of style and content to ensure that it exclusively served the purposes of state leadership. In his memoir, the composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich writes that the Stalinist government systematically executed all of the Soviet Union’s Ukrainian folk poets. When Augusto Pinochet took power in Chile in 1973, muralists were arrested, tortured and exiled. Soon after the coup, the singer and theater artist Víctor Jara was killed, his body riddled with bullets and displayed publicly as a warning to others. In her book “Brazilian Art Under Dictatorship,” Claudia Calirman writes that the museum director Niomar Moniz Sodré Bittencourt had to hide works of art and advise artists to leave Brazil after authorities entered her museum, blocked the exhibition and demanded the work be dismantled because it contained dangerous images like a photograph of a member of the military falling off a motorcycle, which was seen as embarrassing to the police. Such extreme intervention may seem far removed from the United States today, until we consider episodes like the president’s public castigation of the “Hamilton” cast after it issued a fairly tame commentary directed at Mike Pence.

179,"One hundred years ago today, Congress voted to enter what was then the largest and bloodiest war in history. Four days earlier, President Woodrow Wilson had sought to unite a sharply divided populace with a stirring claim that the nation “is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.” The war lasted only another year and a half, but in that time, an astounding 117,000 American soldiers were killed and 202,000 wounded. Still, most Americans know little about why the United States fought in World War I, or why it mattered. The “Great War” that tore apart Europe and the Middle East and took the lives of over 17 million people worldwide lacks the high drama and moral gravity of the Civil War and World War II, in which the very survival of the nation seemed at stake. World War I is less easy to explain. America intervened nearly three years after it began, and the “doughboys,” as our troops were called, engaged in serious combat for only a few months. More Americans in uniform died away from the battlefield — thousands from the Spanish flu — than with weapons in hand. After victory was achieved, Wilson’s audacious hope of making a peace that would advance democracy and national self-determination blew up in his face when the Senate refused to ratify the treaty he had signed at the Palace of Versailles. But attention should be paid. America’s decision to join the Allies was a turning point in world history. It altered the fortunes of the war and the course of the 20th century — and not necessarily for the better. Its entry most likely foreclosed the possibility of a negotiated peace among belligerent powers that were exhausted from years mired in trench warfare. Although the American Expeditionary Force did not engage in combat for long, the looming threat of several million fresh troops led German generals to launch a last, desperate series of offensives. When that campaign collapsed, Germany’s defeat was inevitable. How would the war have ended if America had not intervened? The carnage might have continued for another year or two until citizens in the warring nations, who were already protesting the endless sacrifices required, forced their leaders to reach a settlement. If the Allies, led by France and Britain, had not won a total victory, there would have been no punitive peace treaty like that completed at Versailles, no stab-in-the-back allegations by resentful Germans, and thus no rise, much less triumph, of Hitler and the Nazis. The next world war, with its 50 million deaths, would probably not have occurred. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/should-america-have-entered-world-war-i.html?searchResultPosition=57
180,"As America’s population ages, opportunities for a secure retirement should increase. But the opposite is happening. And things are likely to get worse in the Trump years. A measure passed recently by congressional Republicans and awaiting President Trump’s all-but-certain signature will reverse a rule, passed in the last year of the Obama administration, allowing cities and counties to organize savings plans for private-sector workers who have no employer-provided retirement coverage. Another measure, blocking states from sponsoring similar retirement savings plans, was passed by the House in February. The Senate and Mr. Trump would be wise to let that measure die. If it is enacted, 13 million people — a sizable portion of the 55 million Americans who don’t have company retirement plans — would be denied access to payroll-deduction individual retirement accounts. People who already have retirement plans also have cause for worry. On Wednesday, the Labor Department carried out Mr. Trump’s directive to delay the April 10 effective date of a federal rule that requires financial advisers to put a client’s interest before their own when giving advice or selling investments related to 401(k) rollovers and other retirement transactions. The rule, known as the “best interest” or ""fiduciary” standard, would protect 401(k) savers from being steered into overly expensive strategies and products when they retire. All of these rules were carefully researched and written. All are much needed. And all are being tampered with for one reason only: The financial industry does not want them because it makes tens of billions of dollars a year under a status quo in which its products and practices are the only game in town for retirement savers. This means that what congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are doing is looking for ways to line Wall Street’s pockets with the retirement savings of working people. The result will be continuing hardship for retirees. The roughly one-half of private-sector workers who do not have retirement plans at work will rely on Social Security for between half to all of their income in retirement. But even those with retirement savings will be hard pressed. A recent paper by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College showed that pension wealth — from traditional pensions and 401(k)’s — remained basically flat for workers ages 51 to 56 from 1992 to 2010. (The figures may show improvement in the 2016 data, due out next year, but they are unlikely to buck a nearly 20-year trend.) The study also found that even as overall pension wealth held steady, the shift from traditional pensions to 401(k)’s left people worse off in retirement. Traditional pensions guarantee constant monthly payments for life; 401(k)’s can and do run out. In addition, the income generated by 401(k)’s varies with interest rates, which have been very low for very long.

185,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Thursday engineered a dramatic change in how the chamber confirms Supreme Court nominations, bypassing a Democratic blockade of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch in a move that will most likely reshape both the Senate and the court. After Democrats held together Thursday morning and filibustered President Trump’s nominee, Republicans voted to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority. In deploying this so-called nuclear option, lawmakers are fundamentally altering the way the Senate handles one of its most significant duties, further limiting the minority’s power in a chamber that was designed to be a slower and more deliberative body than the House. The move, once unthinkable among senators, is a testament to the creeping partisan rancor in recent years, after decades of at least relative bipartisanship on Supreme Court matters. Both parties have warned of sweeping effects on the court itself, predicting the elevation of more ideologically extreme judges now that only a majority is required for confirmation. Senate Democrats in 2013 first changed the rules of the Senate to block Republican filibusters of presidential nominees to lower courts and to government positions. But they left the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees untouched, an acknowledgment of the court’s exalted status. On Thursday, that last pillar was swept away on a party-line vote, with all 52 Republicans choosing to overrule Senate precedent and all 48 Democrats and liberal-leaning independents pushing to keep it.

The founding fathers believed in majority rule, with only a few exceptions. In his 1801 guide to Senate practices, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “The voice of the majority decides.” The exceptions, as spelled out in the Constitution, included removing someone from office, overriding a veto, ratifying a treaty and amending the Constitution itself. Passing a regular law wasn’t one of the exceptions. Nor was confirming a Supreme Court justice. Over time, however, the Senate changed its rules to give the minority party the power to block action so long as it had 34 votes. (The Senate changed the threshold to the current 41 votes in 1974.) So when you hear people — on both the left and right — decry the likely weakening of the filibuster this week, keep in mind that it has not been a permanent part of American democracy. For much of our history, majority rule was the norm, and supermajority rule was a rare exception. “The switch to supermajority rule,” Steven Waldman writes in an Op-Ed today, “happened without a constitutional amendment, without a national debate, without its even becoming a major issue in a presidential campaign.” It happened through a series of changes in Senate rules and norms, as Waldman explains.

The statement from Turkey, where many of the stricken Syrians were taken after the assault on Tuesday, was the most specific about the cause. “According to the results of preliminary tests,” the statement said, “patients were exposed to chemical material (Sarin).” Western countries have accused the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad of carrying out the chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province, which left scores dead and hundreds sickened in one of the worst atrocities so far in the six-year-old Syria war. The Syrian government has denied responsibility. Russia, its main ally, has accused Mr. Assad’s enemies of rushing to judgment and has threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council measure condemning the assault. The Turkish statement said the sarin conclusion had been based on autopsies on three victims performed at Turkey’s Adana Forensic Medicine Institution with the participation of representatives from the World Health Organization and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, a group based in The Hague that monitors compliance with the global treaty that bans such munitions.

In the meantime, tickets are still being honored across New Jersey Transit buses, light rail, PATH trains and the New York Waterway.)

At the time, New York was a city divided. “New Yorkers provided the strongest voices both for the rush to war, and the opposition,” said Thai Jones, a history professor and curator for American history at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University. Some of our cultural institutions promoted the war effort. The songwriters and music publishers of Tin Pan Alley cranked out tunes to show support, including the military ballad “Over There” by George M. Cohan. And New York illustrators created some of the most iconic propaganda posters, such as James Montgomery Flagg’s “I Want You for U.S. Army” recruiting poster.

The central bank is expected to pare the more than $4 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage securities it bought after the 2008 financial crisis to keep interest rates low and to help revive the economy. It has already started to slowly raise its benchmark interest rate. Fed officials think the economy is strong enough for it to gradually ease back on its support. Markets appear to agree. News that the central bank would reduce its investments was met with relative calm. Some analysts think the Fed needs to step back even further. “Financial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways,” said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock’s U.S. multi-sector fixed income team. Corporate chiefs in the United States have bemoaned for years the taxes that they would face if they brought home more than $2 trillion in cash kept overseas. They may soon stop complaining. President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are widely believed to be open to lowering taxes on funds that companies bring back. For lawmakers, the idea of a tide of funds coming home creates visions of infrastructure investment and job creation. But on Wall Street, it has set off hopes for another spending priority: mergers and acquisitions. And deals often lead to job losses.

193,"VENICE — Damien Hirst is staring into the eyes of a jade Buddha, its face seemingly abraded by the vestiges of time. “I think he looks damn good, considering he’s 2,000 years old,” he said, straining to keep a straight face. Nearby, the sculpture of a pharaoh fashioned from blue granite and displaying a gold nipple ring bears an uncanny resemblance to Pharrell Williams. Is the face really that of the singer? “You could say that,” Mr. Hirst responded. “It’s all about what you want to believe.” After years of uncharacteristic silence, this artist known for his love-it-or-hate-it artworks is orchestrating his own comeback. On a recent morning, dressed all in black, Mr. Hirst could be found in the soaring entrance of the Palazzo Grassi watching his crew put the finishing touches on an extravaganza worthy of Cecil B. DeMille — his first major show of new work in 10 years. Opening to the public on Sunday, April 9, and called “Treasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable,” it is an underwater fantasy, with sculptures like the Buddha and hundreds of other objects fashioned to look as though they were antiquities dredged up from the bottom of the sea. The works will fill the Palazzo Grassi and the Punta della Dogana, two museums run by François Pinault, the Parisian collector who is also the owner of Christie’s auction house. The show is widely seen as Mr. Hirst’s attempt, at 51, to kick-start his career, which has suffered since 2008, when the financial and art markets crashed. Tapping into the age-old romance of shipwrecks, he and his patron are embarking on a giant artistic and financial gamble. “Treasures” cost Mr. Hirst millions of dollars to produce and Mr. Pinault millions to present (exact figures were not disclosed by either man). Collectors who have been offered the works report that prices start around $500,000 apiece rising to upward of $5 million. With Damien Hirst’s market untested on such a grand scale, the question the art world is asking is, will he sink or swim in Venice? Francesco Bonami, a curator who organized a major exhibition of Mr. Hirst’s work in Doha, Qatar, four years ago, said the latest Hirst production “goes beyond good or bad,” adding: “In his bombastic, exaggerated way, Damien has created a narrative the likes of which the public has never seen.

To keep up, dozens of agents from New York and field offices across the country are being temporarily pulled off criminal investigations to serve two-week stints protecting members of the Trump family, including the first lady and the youngest son in Manhattan’s Trump Tower. Others, already assigned to the highly selective presidential protective division, had hoped for relief after a grueling election year. That hope has evaporated as they work more overtime hours and spend long stretches away from home because of the Trump family’s far-flung travel. And in Washington, agency leaders are already negotiating for tens of millions of dollars in supplemental funding to help offset the sky-high costs of securing Trump Tower and other high-profile family assets like Mar-a-Lago in Florida. It is a figure that will only continue to rise. “They are flat-out worn out,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

196,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Let’s turn it over to Brooks Barnes, our Hollywood reporter based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. LOS ANGELES — For the first time in a decade, Hollywood is facing the threat of a major strike. Writers, who power almost everything the movie and television factories make, want better pay and the shoring up of a faltering health care plan. Studios, while open to some raises, have so far proposed health care changes that many writers consider rollbacks. Should a walkout happen — with its contract expiring on May 1, the Writers Guild of America last week asked members to give it the authority to call a strike — Howard A. Rodman will be among those leading the charge. While not prone to public grandstanding, Mr. Rodman, president of the Writers Guild, West, is a behind-the-scenes firebrand. He was elected in 2015 after vowing to get tough with studios. Labor conflict is in his blood; his father, also a writer, was a combative guild figure. Speaking by phone, Mr. Rodman insisted that writers, despite a Netflix-fueled boom in television, were being left behind by the industry. TV seasons are shorter. Networks are showing fewer reruns, limiting residuals. Studios are also making fewer movies and cutting back on paying to polish scripts.

197,"BERLIN — In a way, Elke Büdenbender is the exact opposite of Melania Trump. Being married to Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the new German head of state, she has given up her job as a judge at the Berlin Administrative Court to fully devote her time to the job of first lady. Mrs. Trump, on the contrary, refuses to be first lady, in order to, well, to continue to do pretty much nothing. Still, however different the two women may be, Germany is having the same discussion as the United States: Are we still in for a first lady in the 21st century? Is a first housewife still an appropriate representative of the nation we are? And does she represent the nation we’d like to be? As for the nation we’d like to be, the German answer is quite simple: No, she does not. Most Germans like to think of women’s equality as a mission accomplished and would probably agree that the role model that lives on at the Schloss Bellevue, the president’s residence, has outlived its time. Germany has never had a female president, which may be why it has never modernized the roles of its first couple. At the Schloss Bellevue, the 1950s have survived, turning it into a museum of social history, a “Mad Men” caricature of the domestic, patriarchal past, just plusher and less cool, exuding the stale smell of a Sunday roast gone cold waiting for Daddy to return to the familial home. The German first lady, not unlike her American counterpart, is the woman “at his side,” as many media outlets like to put it. She is active, but in a way that postwar Germany would have approved of, too. Traditionally, she’s the patron of the Müttergenesungswerk, a charitable organization founded by Elly Heuss-Knapp, Germany’s first first lady, which is dedicated to the health of mothers. Horst Köhler, the president from 2004 to 2010, and his wife, Eva Luise, for example, started a foundation for rare diseases. The first lady is in charge of organizing the president’s New Year’s reception and other tasks that comply with traditional female role requirements such as caretaking, tending and accommodating. All of this is based on mere convention. The first lady has no constitutional role. The fact that she is acting as a state official equipped with an office, assistant and staffer could actually raise some difficult legal questions, as Sophie Schönberger, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Konstanz, recently noted in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, picking up on the question raised in the United States over whether Mrs. Trump should be paid. Or, as Norbert Lammert, president of the German Parliament, put it during Mr. Steinmeier’s inauguration, addressing Ms. Büdenbender: “Yours is an office which, according to our Constitution, doesn’t exist.” It’s as though he was trying to squeeze women’s history into one sentence: Women have always managed without holding an office, acted without recognition, worked without pay, existed outside the written.

199,"WASHINGTON — The continuing fallout from President Trump’s unsubstantiated wiretapping allegation cost him another ally on Thursday, as the embattled Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced he would step aside from his panel’s investigation into Russia’s efforts to disrupt last year’s election. The announcement from the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, came shortly before the House Committee on Ethics said he was under investigation because of public reports that he “may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information.” Mr. Nunes’s recusal from the Russia inquiry was a blow to Mr. Trump, who in less than three months in office has seen the imbroglio over Russia’s disruption campaign exact political damage on some of his closest advisers and most vigorous supporters. The furor over the contacts that some of the president’s aides had with Russian officials has already led to the firing of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, and the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from overseeing the F.B.I.’s inquiry into the Russian efforts. Now it has led to the recusal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation, and Mr. Trump faces the potential revival of that inquiry. The investigation had descended into a partisan sideshow in the two weeks since Mr. Nunes told reporters that Trump associates had been swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies during the transition, citing intelligence reports that were classified. He then rushed to the White House to brief Mr. Trump, prompting Democrats to argue that Mr. Nunes had proved himself far too close to the president to run an independent investigation. The criticism intensified last week when The New York Times revealed that the classified information about incidental surveillance cited by Mr. Nunes came from White House officials. White House officials had been seeking evidence to bolster a claim that Mr. Trump made March 4 on Twitter that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. Numerous current and former American officials — including James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director — have debunked the claim.

200,"WASHINGTON — A week ago, President Trump was accused of being a tool for the Russians, an unwitting agent of influence, so full of admiration that he defended President Vladimir V. Putin against critics who called him a killer. Now, Mr. Trump is in a diplomatic clash with Mr. Putin’s Russia, his administration accusing Moscow of trying to cover up a Syrian chemical weapons attack on civilians and his secretary of state delivering us-or-them ultimatums. Even in a presidency marked by unpredictability, the head-spinning shift from coziness to confrontation has left Washington and other capitals with a case of geopolitical whiplash. The prospects of improving Russian-American relations were already slim given the atmosphere of suspicion stemming from Kremlin meddling in last year’s election, but the détente once envisioned by Mr. Trump has instead deteriorated into the latest cold war. For Mr. Trump’s camp, the abrupt turnaround simply proved how false the conspiracy narrative was from the start. “If there was anything that Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie,” said Eric Trump, the president’s son. For some critics, it seemed to be a cynical way of distracting attention from the multiple investigations into possible contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russia even as Moscow was trying to help Mr. Trump win the presidency. Either way, it suggested that the relationship between the two powers could be volatile in the months to come, subject to the impulsive reactions of a president with no prior experience in foreign policy, the often strident responses of a Russian leader given to his own moments of pique and the clashing national interests of both countries in key areas around the world.

201,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber has lost a string of top managers in recent months as the ride-hailing company has dealt with scandals over its workplace culture and its executives’ behavior. That exodus is continuing with the exit of Rachel Whetstone, the company’s head of policy and communications. In an internal email to employees on Tuesday, Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, said Ms. Whetstone was leaving amicably and of her own volition. “Since joining in 2015, Rachel has blown us all away with her ability to get stuff done,” Mr. Kalanick wrote. In a statement, Ms. Whetstone said, “I joined Uber because I love the product — and that love is as strong today as it was when I booked my very first ride six years ago.” But internally, Mr. Kalanick and Ms. Whetstone had a complicated relationship, according to three current and former employees who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel matters. Mr. Kalanick and Ms. Whetstone are intense personalities and occasionally clashed over how to handle external communications, especially in times of crisis, these people said. Over the past few months, Ms. Whetstone has steered Uber through several firestorms. A grass-roots campaign urged people to delete the Uber app after the company was erroneously perceived to have capitalized on President Trump’s executive order to bar immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries. In addition, a former employee, in a public blog post, detailed a history of harassment at the hands of an Uber manager, prompting an internal investigation and questions over the company’s culture. Apart from Ms. Whetstone, other Uber executives have recently quit. Last month, Jeff Jones, a former Target executive, left Uber because of what he characterized as disagreements with leadership. Brian McClendon, a top engineering executive working on Uber’s mapping initiatives, also departed the company to return to his home state, Kansas, where he plans to explore politics. Ed Baker, from Uber’s growth and product team, exited in February, and Amit Singhal, a top engineering executive said to have failed to disclose a sexual harassment complaint against him at his former workplace, was asked to resign late that month. Ms. Whetstone, who led communications at Google for a decade before joining Uber in 2015, has not detailed her next move. In an email to colleagues, she said she was looking forward to time off with her family. Recode, a technology news site, earlier reported Ms. Whetstone’s departure.

202,"WICHITA, Kan. — Ron Estes, the Republican candidate for an empty House seat in Kansas, survived a surprisingly competitive race in a heavily conservative district on Tuesday. He defeated James Thompson, the Democratic candidate, in the first national test of the Republican Party’s electoral strength, in a contest that saw a late infusion of national support from Republicans nervous about the tumultuous political environment during President Trump’s initial months in office. Mr. Estes, 60, the state treasurer, overcame the challenge by Mr. Thompson, a Wichita civil rights lawyer, and won by a count of 53 percent of the vote to 46 percent, according to unofficial results, to fill the seat in the district that was vacated by Mike Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director. In a race more than a year before the midterm elections, Mr. Estes was initially expected to cruise to victory in a district that his party has held for more than two decades and that Mr. Trump won by 27 points. But after internal Republican polling last week revealed Mr. Estes’s lead was in only the single digits, the national party scrambled to rescue his campaign — and effectively conceded that even seats in the reddest corners of the United States are not safe at a time when Democrats are so energized against Mr. Trump. In his victory speech late Tuesday, Mr. Estes took aim at those who thought he might lose. “The pundits were talking about — this wasn’t a seat we were going to win,” Mr. Estes said before several hundred people in a hotel ballroom, “that we were going to lose a Republican seat, that it was a special election, that it was a chance for the Democrats, they were motivated, there was a lot of angst against the president. But we really showed the pundits tonight, didn’t we?” “We’re going to continue that process that started in November and make the changes in Washington,” he added. Mr. Estes said he hoped his victory would set the tone for the other special elections to replace members of Congress who took jobs with the Trump administration. But many officials in his party, who were up anxiously watching the returns late into the night on Tuesday, hope to avoid any more surprisingly stress-inducing races.

203,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, inspired by TV images of faraway suffering to launch missile strikes against Syria, may be about to discover a lesson that has confounded presidents for 25 years: American power can only do so much. That truth is also embedded in another set of disturbing images that Mr. Trump has not cited publicly: those from Nigeria’s conflict-torn northeast, where a very different crisis is drawing different American action toward different ends. Those two conflicts, in both their contrasts and commonalities, reveal something of the role that Mr. Trump has taken on and its limitation. Both are humanitarian disasters whose ground-level stories horrify and enrage. And they are both crises of a sort that the United States, since emerging from the Cold War as the world’s policeman, has repeatedly tried but often failed to resolve. The range of American intervention efforts, as well as their often modest success, can be seen in those two crises that Mr. Trump inherited: Syria, whose civil war has become a global issue, and Nigeria, where fighting with Boko Haram rebels has killed tens of thousands and displaced an estimated three million people. The two wars could hardly be more different, as are the American responses. Yet they may still share the fundamental dynamics that make conflict-driven crises so resistant to outside resolution.

205,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is poised to sell up to 12 light attack aircraft to Nigeria to support the country’s fight against the Boko Haram militant group, despite criticism from human rights organizations that the West African country has not done enough to stop the abuses and corruption that flourish in the military. The pending move is the third time in three years that the United States has moved toward selling the Super Tucano attack planes, a transaction that would require congressional approval. The Obama administration stopped one proposed sale on Jan. 17 just as it was about to be sent to Congress for approval, after a Nigerian fighter jet searching for Boko Haram members accidentally bombed a camp for displaced people, killing dozens of people and wounding more. But in a telephone conversation with President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria on Feb. 15, President Trump indicated that he would take another look at the proposed sale, administration officials said. “President Trump expressed support for the sale of aircraft from the United States to support Nigeria’s fight against Boko Haram,” the White House said in a statement after the call. Several officials from the State Department, the Pentagon and the White House said that the sale of the attack airplanes, valued at $600 million, would help the Nigerian Air Force battle the militant extremist group Boko Haram. The Super Tucano, a propeller-driven plane that is capable of reconnaissance and surveillance missions as well as attacks, is produced in part in Florida by Embraer of Brazil and the Sierra Nevada Corporation, a company in the United States. The potential for sales of American-made aircraft also played a part in Mr. Trump’s decision to move on the deal, one administration official said on Tuesday.

206,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday will lift the hiring freeze that it had imposed on the federal work force, even as it directs agencies to submit plans for personnel cuts and other restructuring moves to fit the budget blueprint released by President Trump last month. The new guidance, to be issued by the Office of Management and Budget, is the next step in fulfilling Mr. Trump’s ambition to reshape the federal bureaucracy into a lean, businesslike operation. It comes as many federal workers across Washington have feared that their jobs will be eliminated by the spending cuts that Mr. Trump has demanded. “This is a big part of draining the swamp,” Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said at a briefing on Tuesday afternoon. “This is a centerpiece to his campaign.” In January, Mr. Trump ordered an across-the-board employment freeze for the federal government, halting hiring for all new and existing positions except those in national security, public safety and the military. The administration is now making clear that it is not giving a green light for agencies to start hiring; instead, the White House is seeking long-term plans from each agency to, in most cases, prepare for cuts. The 2018 budget outline that Mr. Trump released last month called for a 10 percent increase in military spending to be paid for with deep cuts to the budgets of the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, Health and Human Services and other domestic programs.

207,"WASHINGTON — For most of last year, Donald J. Trump’s application to register trademarks for his brand of home accessories languished in a government office in Lima, Peru. But since Mr. Trump was elected in November, the pace has picked up. A six-month-old request to register his brand of sheets, duvets, towels and other goods, now selling briskly at a home goods store in Lima, overcame a crucial hurdle in late December. So did a second application to protect Mr. Trump’s brand of flatware that was filed after the election. Peruvian officials say they are treating Mr. Trump’s trademark applications like anyone else’s and are acting on them now simply because his business representatives have answered outstanding questions. They insist that Peru’s president, who met Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in late February, has no influence over their decisions. But to a team of constitutional lawyers and ethics lawyers, the pending Peruvian petitions are emblematic of the legal and moral perils in Mr. Trump’s continued ownership of his business empire. In a federal lawsuit that has set up a high-stakes legal battle with the Trump administration, they argue that the Constitution prohibits the president from accepting any economic benefit, including trademark approvals, from foreign governments. A review of 10 trademark databases shows that Mr. Trump’s enterprise, now run by his two adult sons, has 157 trademark applications pending in 36 countries. Registered trademarks are valuable financial assets, especially for a business like Mr. Trump’s, which is increasingly focused on marketing his name, not building hotels. When the Chinese granted Mr. Trump preliminary approval of 38 trademarks of his name, not long after he was sworn into office, “it was a gift,” said Peter J. Riebling, a trademark lawyer in Washington. “Getting the exclusive right to use that brand in China against everyone else in the world? It’s like waving a magic wand.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/us/politics/trump-trademark-ethics.html?searchResultPosition=101
208,"Representative Joe Wilson, the South Carolina Republican who gained a measure of infamy after shouting “you lie” at President Barack Obama during a joint session of Congress in 2009, had that memorable catchphrase hurled back at him by a group of his constituents at a town hall event on Monday. The audience at the event, held at Aiken Technical College in Graniteville, S.C., near the state’s western border, was antagonistic from the start, booing audibly as he stepped to the lectern. But the conflict between Mr. Wilson and the crowd came to a head toward the end of the 40-minute question-and-answer period, when he responded to a question about Mr. Obama’s health care law. After he said the law was delaying and denying health services to its intended recipients, the rest of his comments were drowned out, as the crowd began to chant “you lie” in unison. The cheer continued for about 20 seconds. A video of the event was posted on Facebook Live. Leacy Burke, a spokeswoman for Mr. Wilson, 69, said in an email on Tuesday that the chant stood as “less than a minute of a positive event that lasted nearly two hours where the congressman engaged with his constituents both in a town hall format and one on one after the official program ended.” But the chant was just one of many difficult stretches in what overall looked to be a tough evening for Mr. Wilson, appearing in a county that President Trump won handily in November.

209,"For nearly two hours on Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio parked himself at the far end of a large gathering room in Staten Island Borough Hall, shaking hands and hearing from Staten Islanders of all stripes. High school students with a solar-powered car. Two older women with concerns about parking. A man seeking city contracts for his business cleaning up abandoned homes. For Mr. de Blasio, the interactions were a chance to engage in the sort of one-on-one retail politics that he often shies away from, instead preferring to communicate with constituents at more of a distance, through large-scale town-hall meetings or weekly call-in radio appearances. He pulled in commissioners to join the conversations and stood flanked by half a dozen aides and security officers, sometimes more, nodding along with each anecdote. The gambit seemed to pay off for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who will be seeking re-election in November and is broadly disliked on Staten Island: There appeared to be no encounters with virulent opponents or testy exchanges with residents, even though the borough largely rejected his candidacy in 2013 and voted heavily for President Trump, a Republican. “I think it was really good; he’s a nice guy,” said Angelo Cardinale, a 17-year-old high school senior and driver of the solar-powered car that he and his club of tech-savvy teenagers parked in front of Borough Hall. The conversations — 26 in all, the mayor’s office said — came on Day 2 of what is to be a week of events on Staten Island. Mr. de Blasio and much of his staff moved their base of operations to the borough on Monday, and he plans to have similar weeklong stays in New York’s other boroughs before the end of the year.

212,"LOCKING UP OUR OWN
Crime and Punishment in Black America
By James Forman Jr.
Illustrated. 306 pages. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. $27. James Forman Jr. divides his superb and shattering first book, “Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,” into two parts: “Origins” and “Consequences.” But the temptation is to scribble in, before “Consequences,” a modifier: “Unforeseen.” That is truly what this book is about, and what makes it tragic to the bone: How people, acting with the finest of intentions and the largest of hearts, could create a problem even more grievous than the one they were trying to solve. Forman opens with a story from 1995, when, as a public defender in Washington, he unsuccessfully tried to keep a 15-year-old out of a juvenile detention center with a grim reputation. Looking around the courtroom, he realized that everyone associated with the case was African-American: the judge, the prosecutor, the bailiff. The arresting officer was black, as was the city’s police chief, its mayor and the majority of the city council that had written the stringent gun and drug laws his client had violated. “What was going on?” Forman asks. “How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?” This is the exceptionally delicate question that he tries to answer, with exemplary nuance, over the course of his book. His approach is compassionate. Seldom does he reprimand the actors in this story for the choices they made.

213,"WASHINGTON — Customs officers at the border and at airports almost doubled their searches of electronic devices of people entering the United States in the last six months, according to data released Tuesday by Customs and Border Protection. Despite the surge in searches — nearly 15,000 from October to March, compared with 8,383 in the same period in 2015 and ’16 — agency officials said the latest numbers represent less than one percent of the 189.6 million travelers that arrived in the United States in that period. “These searches, which affect fewer than one-hundredth of one percent of international travelers, have contributed to national security investigations, arrests for child pornography and evidence of human trafficking,” said John P. Wagner, a deputy assistant commissioner at Customs and Border Protection. Privacy activists say the searches are invasive and violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. But courts have long held that those protections do not apply at the border and at airports because of the government’s compelling interest in combating crime and terrorism. A 2014 Supreme Court ruling did say, however, that law enforcement needed to have a warrant to search electronic devices when a person was being arrested.

215,"Flying was once an adventure, more than just a way to get from here to there. But over the years, it has become something to dread. You wait in endless lines for the chance to be poked, patted, X-rayed, interrogated, generally insulted and, in the final indignity, separated by class as you, at last, board. And it can get worse from there. On Sunday security officials at Chicago’s O’Hare airport literally yanked a passenger off a United flight because the airline needed seats for its staff. That fiasco was captured on videos that set the internet ablaze with outrage, and could end up costing the airline future business. Clueless United dug itself in deeper after the story blew up. Its chief executive, Oscar Munoz, apologized on Monday for having to “re-accommodate these customers” but not for the manhandling of the passenger, a doctor who was bleeding from the mouth in the videos. Mr. Munoz made matters even worse by calling the doctor “disruptive and belligerent” because he had the temerity to object to his removal. Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Munoz saw the light (and the drop in his company’s stock price) and said “no one should ever be mistreated this way.” United’s mistreatment of the doctor was extreme, but inconveniencing customers is now standard airline operating procedure. This is an oligopolistic industry that has become increasingly callous toward customers as it rakes in billions in profits thanks to strong demand and low oil prices. In recent years, big airlines have squeezed seats in coach closer together, forcing average-size Americans to become intimately familiar with their knees. In addition to checked-bag fees, which have been standard on many airlines for years, more passengers are being required to pay extra for early boarding, more legroom and, in a recent insult, the right to stash bags in overhead bins. There is no mystery why air travel has gotten so ugly. Four large airlines — American, Southwest, Delta and United — commanded nearly 69 percent of the domestic air-travel market in 2016, up from about 60 percent in 2012, according to government data. Those numbers actually overstate how much competition there is. Many people have only one or two options when they fly because the big airlines have established virtual fortresses at their hub airports. United, American Airlines and three regional airlines affiliated with them served nearly 80 percent of passengers at O’Hare last year. Disgruntled travelers may howl on Twitter or send furious emails, but airline executives know their bottom lines are for the moment secure. It was not surprising that none of the Big Four made a list of the 10 best airlines in the world that TripAdvisor published on Monday based on passenger reviews. Two smaller companies did — JetBlue (No. 4) and Alaska Airlines (No. 9). ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/opinion/fear-of-flying-for-good-reason.html?searchResultPosition=102

217,"The Islamic State’s affiliate in Egypt is on the march. On Palm Sunday, a pair of bombs killed 45 people at church. This was the third major attack on Coptic churches in less than four months — and the first such attack recently in major Egyptian cities, which many people believed were more secure. These attacks follow after months of terrorism, and they could have been predicted: Just two months ago, the Sinai-based Islamic State affiliate issued a video promising that the group would target Copts in Egypt’s mainland. These attacks demonstrate that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s counterterrorism strategy is failing. Mr. Sisi claims that he is committed to fighting terrorism, but in reality his energy is directed toward his other enemies: secular activists, journalists, independent members of Parliament, businessmen and academics who oppose him, human rights organizations and peaceful dissident Islamist groups. In response to Sunday’s bombings, Mr. Sisi declared a three-month-long state of emergency. North Sinai province has been under emergency law since October 2014. But the deterioration in the security situation there over the past year is a reminder of how such policies fail. The fact of the matter is that the national emergency law will do little beyond giving legal cover to the brutal practices that have already been enforced for the past few years in flagrant violation of Egypt’s Constitution. (After all, Mr. Sisi has previously stated that the Constitution was written with “naïve intentions.”) North Sinai looks increasingly like Mosul, which until recently was the Islamic State’s de facto capital in Iraq. Earlier this year, Egyptian news media was full of images of desperate Christians being forced from their homes in Sinai by Islamic State militants in a scene reminiscent of the jihadist group’s takeover of Mosul in 2014. In al-Arish, North Sinai’s capital, the Islamic State has reportedly set up checkpoints to force female public servants to adhere to a strict Islamic dress code. Young men have reportedly been flogged in public squares for the “crime” of selling cigarettes. The situation has deteriorated precipitously. Bombings and assassinations of security forces in Sinai are now a regular occurrence. The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy found that the number of attacks in North Sinai has jumped from 143 in 2014 to 681 in 2016. And just as Mosul was a center for orchestrating suicide bombings in Baghdad, Sinai is now a potential hub for such attacks in mainland Egypt. Shortly after Mr. Sisi took control of Egypt in a coup in July 2013, he called on Egyptians to take to the streets to give him a mandate to fight terrorism. People complied, even though terrorist attacks at the time were limited and mostly directed against military targets in Sinai near the border with Gaza. However, Mr. Sisi capitalized on this popular support to push for his real agenda and move against young secular activists, peaceful Islamist dissidents and human rights organizations.

218,"Two weeks after President Trump’s inauguration, I joined The Times as a national education reporter. Mr. Trump’s administration did not waste any time before rolling out a proposal to expand access to private school vouchers, so I began researching them right away. The number of students using public dollars to attend private schools has more than doubled over the past decade, costing taxpayers some $2 billion annually. What I learned was that a lot of this growth is driven by new school choice programs that target disabled students. The largest is the John M. McKay voucher program in Florida, which serves more than 30,000 students and is the subject of my recent article. I also learned that private schools are not obligated under voucher laws in Florida and many other states to provide students with the full range of disability services that public schools are required to provide. I reached out to disability-rights organizations, which connected me with lawyers on the ground in Florida who specialize in representing children with special needs. I ended up speaking to more parents — always mothers, and usually mothers of sons on the autism spectrum — than I could include in the piece. Our conversations often lasted an hour or more; it felt as if these women were bursting to talk about the many challenges they’d had fighting on behalf of their children. But I had to tread carefully. In fact, the sensitivity of the reporting reminded me of work I had done in the past on adolescents caught up in the juvenile justice system: Parents asked for their children’s names not to appear, worrying that colleges or employers would judge them for common childhood behavioral issues. Still, the women wanted me to understand their children’s promise: Sure, he’d had behavioral meltdowns, but he was also reading ahead of grade level. And yes, he’d been suspended, but his teachers praised him, and he’d made lots of new friends. Although my piece was about private school vouchers, I found that many parents of students with disabilities choose vouchers only after having a deeply disappointing experience in the public education system. One mother told me about the day her autistic son came home with bruises after being physically restrained by staff. Several said their sons with behavioral challenges but typical intellectual abilities had been segregated, in classrooms away from the general-education population.

219,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson sought on Wednesday to isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for backing the Syrian government in the wake of its lethal chemical weapons attack on civilians, and worked to build international pressure on Moscow to change course. In Washington, Moscow and New York, the Trump administration publicly chastised Mr. Putin but privately worked to hash out increasingly bitter differences with him. At the same time, Mr. Trump embraced NATO — a military alliance he had previously derided as obsolete — as an effective and vital force for peace and security in a region where Russia has been an aggressive actor. During his presidential campaign, and in his early days in office, Mr. Trump’s approach to foreign policy included speaking warmly of Mr. Putin and the prospects of a United States alliance with Russia. He had also questioned the usefulness of NATO, and the concept of an alliance for common defense to counterbalance Moscow’s belligerence. In an interview that aired on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Putin was partly to blame for the conflict in Syria and denounced him for backing President Bashar al-Assad, whom he called an “animal.” Later at the White House, Mr. Trump said that Russia had likely known in advance of the Syrian government’s plan to unleash a nerve agent against its own people, and asserted that the United States’ relations with Moscow were at an “all-time low.” In Moscow, Mr. Tillerson came away from a two-hour meeting with Mr. Putin — the first such face-to-face session of the Trump administration — without reaching agreement on facts involving the chemical weapons assault in Syria or Russian interference in the American election. And sharply diverging from the meeting of the minds between the United States and Russia that Mr. Trump frequently aspired to when he was campaigning, there was no visible warming of the relationship. “There is a low level of trust between our countries,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V.

222,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — A gray mood has settled over conservative-leaning voters in some of the country’s most reliably Republican congressional districts, as the party’s stumbles in Washington demoralize them and leave lawmakers scrambling to energize would-be supporters in a series of off-year elections. While the next nationwide elections are not until 2018, Republicans have grown fearful that these voters are recoiling from what they see as lamentable conditions in Washington: a government entirely in Republican hands that has failed to deliver on fundamental goals like overhauling the health care system. Early missteps by President Trump and congressional leaders have weighed heavily on voters from the party’s more affluent wing, anchored in right-of-center suburbs around major cities in the South and Midwest. Never beloved in these precincts, Mr. Trump appears to be struggling to maintain support from certain voters who backed him last year mainly as a way of defeating Hillary Clinton. Interviews with Republican-leaning voters in four suburban districts — in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and New Jersey — revealed a sour outlook on the party. These voters, mainly white professionals, say they expected far more in the way of results by now, given the Republican grip on power in the capital. In opinion polls, they consistently give Mr. Trump mediocre approval ratings, even as he remains solidly popular with lower-income whites. In the past, first-term presidents have suffered grievous losses in midterm elections, when their party’s voters have stayed home while the opposition party has marched to the barricades. Former President Barack Obama saw Democrats lose 63 House seats in 2010 after Republicans and disaffected independents stampeded to the polls and grumbling Democrats did not. It is too early to say if the same dynamic is afflicting Mr. Trump. But already, Republicans have strained to prop up their candidates in a pair of special House elections in the areas around Atlanta and Wichita, Kan., both in districts that have voted overwhelmingly Republican in past congressional races.

So when it came to light last week that the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had ordered the United States Marshals Service to extend a full protective detail to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, for as much as $1 million a month, many people began to wonder about the protective pecking order in the Trump era. The answer, given the nature of the job, is difficult to know. Security forces are loath to discuss much about who they protect or what it costs, for fear, they say, of compromising their mission.

228,"Within 24 hours, President Trump repeated several false or misleading claims about wiretapping, Hillary Clinton and his own chief strategist. Responding to last week’s chemical attack in Syria and his subsequent strike on a Syrian air base, Mr. Trump characterized President Bashar al-Assad as “evil” in an interview with Fox Business Network that aired early Wednesday morning. He also again faulted President Barack Obama for not intervening in the Syrian conflict more aggressively. The comments contradicted Mr. Trump’s earlier, more dismissive attitude on chemical weapons. “Saddam Hussein throws a little gas, everyone goes crazy, ‘Oh, he’s using gas!’ ” he said at a July 2016 campaign rally. In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Trump repeatedly said that Mr. Obama should not attack Syria, and, after he was elected in November, he even questioned the incentive for intervening. FALSE. Mr. Trump has known Mr. Bannon, his chief strategist, since 2011, when Mr. Trump was considering a presidential run. David Bossie, a conservative activist who worked with Mr. Bannon on a series of films, made the introduction. “They definitely hit it off,” Mr. Bossie told Scott Shane of The New York Times in November. Mr. Bannon joked in August 2015 that he was Mr. Trump’s hidden “campaign manager,” and he hosted Mr. Trump on his radio show in November 2015.

229,"WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s grenade-lobbing pugilist of a chief strategist, has a fitting nickname for his West Wing office: “the war room.” But more and more, war is being waged on Mr. Bannon himself. And it is unclear how much longer he can survive in his job. His isolation inside the White House, after weeks of battle with senior aides aligned with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, appeared to grow even starker this week after Mr. Trump undercut Mr. Bannon in two interviews and played down his role in the Trump presidential campaign. “I am my own strategist,” Mr. Trump told the New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin in an interview on Tuesday, a pointed reference to what aides described as his growing irritation that Mr. Bannon’s allies are calling him the mastermind behind Mr. Trump’s victory and the torch bearer for the nationalist, conservative brand of populism that has defined his presidency. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Mr. Trump made clear Mr. Bannon’s subordinate role, calling him “a guy who works for me.” Amid the clashing egos, news media leaks and insinuations of disloyalty, the president was once again faced with having to defuse a personnel crisis that was, in part, a result of assembling a band of Washington outsiders to run his administration. And this time the crisis erupted, perhaps predictably, around the senior aide who most embodies that renegade, anti-establishment ethos: Mr. Bannon, the self-proclaimed deconstructor of the “administrative state” and field general in the war against the “opposition party” news media.

According to a new survey, one of the country’s most affordable places to live is in California — Fresno. Stay with me. The Central Valley’s biggest city has sometimes gotten a bad rap from outsiders. True, Fresno has issues: unemployment is high (about 10.5 percent), the summers are scorching hot and air pollution often gets nasty. But to many residents, the problems are no worse than those of other California cities. Fresnans talk about their city’s lively arts scene, fine state university and easygoing vibe.

United Airlines has security officers drag just one passenger off a plane, injuring him and leaving him dazed and confused, and suddenly everyone is upset. Susan Rice, former national security adviser for President Obama, announces that Syria gave up all its chemical weapons a few months before Bashar al-Assad’s regime kills scores of men, women and children with sarin gas, and people start questioning her veracity. Wells Fargo commits an enormous fraud, creating as many as two million unwanted accounts, and people want more of the company’s executives to be disciplined. Wasn’t it enough that Wells Fargo fired more than 5,000 of the low-level people who had been pushed to commit fraud by the company’s culture of pressure and ethical laxness? And poor Sean Spicer. O.K., so he denied a minor historical detail like the gassing of millions of Jews by the Nazis. It’s not like anyone else in the Trump administration has ever seemed oblivious to history, lied, insulted religious, ethnic or racial minorities or ignored the Holocaust before. Actually, all of these cases are part of a pattern. United, like the other increasingly monopolistic airlines, routinely overbooks flights, treats its passengers with contempt and inconveniences them unnecessarily. Wells Fargo is just another huge bank that has ripped off its ordinary customers and skirted or broken the law for decades, largely with impunity.

Putin of Russia for nearly two hours Wednesday, but the two men appeared unable to agree on the facts involving the deadly chemical weapons assault on Syrian civilians or Russian interference in the American election — much less move toward an improvement in basic relations. “There is a low level of trust between our countries,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, after the first face-to-face meetings between Russian leaders and a top emissary of the Trump administration. “The world’s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship,” Mr. Tillerson said. Both he and Mr. Lavrov said a range of issues were discussed — most notably the crises in Syria, North Korea and Ukraine — and that both sides had agreed to establish a working group to examine, as Mr. Lavrov said, “the irritants” in relations between the United States and Russia. Mr. Tillerson reiterated the American view that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia’s chief Middle East ally, was responsible for the chemical weapons assault in northern Syria on April 4 that left more than 80 people dead, sickened hundreds and outraged the world. Mr. Lavrov reiterated the Russian view that the facts about the chemical weapons attack had yet to be determined, and denounced what he described as the “media hysteria” surrounding the assault.

233,"When the world’s most powerful chief executive is renowned for never apologizing, it takes a special form of incompetence to be upstaged in the contrition department by President Trump’s White House. Somehow, against extraordinary odds, United Continental Holdings — an airline reliant on customer loyalty — managed this dunderheaded achievement. It took Oscar Munoz, the chief executive of the $22 billion company, more than a day, and the incineration of up to half a billion dollars of investor wealth, before he finally found the right words to respond to his company’s latest mistake. He revealed that the company enlisted airport security officers to forcibly remove a passenger from one of its planes after selling too many seats on the flight. Even the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, managed to apologize with greater finesse. In a press briefing on Tuesday he appeared to minimize the horrors of the Holocaust. From this, and United’s episode, there is a lesson to be gleaned by all businesses. The value of the humble apology is incalculable. Say sorry first, ask questions later. United is not the first enterprise to flub in penitence. Nor will it be the last. Recent corporate history is chockablock with attempts to regain the favor of customers. Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, was “deeply sorry” for the suffering that resulted from the car company’s ignition-switch fiasco. It helped that G.M. followed up by paying out $600 million to victims. Last month, Travis Kalanick, an Uber founder, expressed remorse for berating one of his drivers in a petulant exchange that, like tossing the United passenger from the plane, surfaced in a video that went viral. Mr. Kalanick even acknowledged with psychoanalytical flair that he needed help “and I intend to get it.” Mr. Munoz needed multiple attempts to make things right. He first stated that Sunday’s episode was “an upsetting event to all of us here at United.” That’s reminiscent of the sullen apology of Tony Hayward, then the BP chief executive, for the oil firm’s 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill in which he whined that he “would like his life back.” A subsequent message to United staff members seemed to suggest the passenger was at fault. By Wednesday morning, in an interview with ABC, Munoz managed to strike the right, penitential tone. An hour later, United stock regained half of its previous day’s losses. Having to say sorry isn’t hard. It should just come a lot more naturally in the executive suite.

235,"This season’s special congressional elections are being heralded as a test of whether newly energized Democrats will fare better with an unpopular Republican president. So far, the Democrats are passing the test. On Tuesday, Republicans won an unexpectedly close race in Kansas’ Fourth Congressional District. The Republican Ron Estes won by seven points over James Thompson, even though President Trump won the district by 27 points in November. No Democrat holds a House seat as Republican as this one, so it’s startling that the seat was even competitive. In general, it’s a mistake to read too much into a single special election. They are more prone to odd results. That’s because there’s less time for recruitment, fund-raising or even opposition research. There isn’t a national campaign going on at the same time. The turnout is often low and variable. But the Kansas result is not a great sign for the Republicans, and it’s hard to dismiss. Ultimately, special elections are still elections. They reflect the national political environment in nearly the same way as regularly scheduled contests. There just happen to be a few more outlying results. In theory, if you had enough special elections you could make a pretty good inference about the national political environment. There aren’t usually enough of them in a cycle to make such a conclusion, though. Instead, every special election provides a small and imperfect bit of information about the overall national picture.

236,"I was in the room when President Bill Clinton decided to reappoint Alan Greenspan, a lifelong Republican originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. A political adviser urged Mr. Clinton to choose an administration ally, but that was never seriously considered. The president’s choice was not determined by party, or politics or ideology. That’s how it has been for decades: Federal Reserve chairmen and governors have been selected based on their ability to serve the country. President Barack Obama reappointed George W. Bush’s nominee, Ben Bernanke, as chairman. President Reagan reappointed Jimmy Carter’s nominee, Paul Volcker. The Federal Reserve System was created by statute in 1913, but the independence of its monetary policy from congressional or presidential influence is not codified by law — and it wasn’t always inviolable. In recent years, so-called reforms have been proposed to subject Fed monetary policy to congressional review, but its independence has so far been preserved. For good reason: An independent Federal Reserve led by governors who are committed to pursuing its dual mandate of price stability and full employment, as well as effective regulation — and who make decisions based on facts and analysis — is critically important to our economy, the well-being of the people and the market credibility of Fed policy making. But that independence is about to be severely tested. Daniel K. Tarullo stepped down from the Federal Reserve Board last week, adding to the board’s two existing vacancies. Instead of remaining as governors, Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman, could step down when their terms expire next year. President Trump has already said that he will not reappoint Ms. Yellen as chairwoman because she’s not a Republican.

237,"The death of the judicial filibuster last week was overshadowed by Syrian airstrikes and White House turmoil, but the moment’s significance was also diminished by its inevitability. Senators made pious noises and partisans bemoaned the state of the republic, but the widespread Washington wisdom was that this was a fait accompli: After decades of “Butter Battle Book”-style escalations in the judicial wars, a minority veto was simply too antiquated, anachronistic and pre-ideological to survive. Maybe it could have persisted had Senate Democrats played a longer game, but only temporarily; however the Senate voted on Neil Gorsuch, the same forces that doomed Robert Bork and Merrick Garland would have doomed the filibuster hereafter. Given where we are now, that Beltway wisdom was probably correct. Whether we had to end up here, though, is a harder question. It’s possible that structural forces — the ideological sorting of the parties, the decay of the republic toward an executive-judicial diarchy — were always going to push the filibuster to extinction, no matter whether Bork was Borked or Garland pocket-vetoed. But if agency and contingency have a role in history, there is a crucial turning point that deserves to be remembered: the strange nomination and career of David Hackett Souter. Under our system, control of the Supreme Court functions as a somewhat delayed reward for winning ideological battles at the presidential level, and then as a check on the next ideological coalition as it’s taking power. Thus judicial appointees of the pre-New Deal era restrained Roosevelt’s liberalism for a time, and the judicial appointees from liberalism’s New Deal-Great Society heyday continued to advance liberal causes even as the Democratic coalition fell apart. In a similar way, the many Republican appointees from the long Reagan era, 1980-2008, should have constrained liberalism in our own era even as the Reagan coalition cracked and aged and failed. And to some extent they have: In the last eight years the Roberts court reshaped Obamacare even if it didn’t kill it, limited some of the Obama administration’s power grabs and advanced certain conservative goals left over from the Reagan years (on campaign finance and gun rights, notably). But on issues of burning concern to the Republican Party’s base — abortion above all, and then the gay-rights revolution and religious liberty — the court forged by Reagan and the Bushes has often been an enemy, not an ally, either consolidating social-liberal gains or advancing liberal causes even further. True, Anthony Kennedy sided with religious conservatives in the Hobby Lobby decision and on partial-birth abortion. But on the biggest cases — Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Lawrence v. Texas, Obergefell v. Hodges — and quite a few smaller ones, the post-Reagan Supreme Court has been an agent of social liberalism notwithstanding its many Republican-appointed members.

238,"The Trump foreign policy team has been all over the map on what to do next in Syria — topple the regime, intensify aid to rebels, respond to any new attacks on innocent civilians. But when pressed, there is one idea everyone on the team seems to agree on: “The defeat of ISIS,” as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson put it. Well, let me add to their confusion by asking just one question: Why? Why should our goal right now be to defeat the Islamic State in Syria? Of course, ISIS is detestable and needs to be eradicated. But is it really in our interest to be focusing solely on defeating ISIS in Syria right now? Let’s go through the logic: There are actually two ISIS manifestations. One is “virtual ISIS.” It is satanic, cruel and amorphous; it disseminates its ideology through the internet. It has adherents across Europe and the Muslim world. In my opinion, that ISIS is the primary threat to us, because it has found ways to deftly pump out Sunni jihadist ideology that inspires and gives permission to those Muslims on the fringes of society who feel humiliated — from London to Paris to Cairo — to recover their dignity via headline-grabbing murders of innocents. The other incarnation is “territorial ISIS.” It still controls pockets in western Iraq and larger sectors of Syria. Its goal is to defeat Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria — plus its Russian, Iranian and Hezbollah allies — and to defeat the pro-Iranian Shiite regime in Iraq, replacing both with a caliphate. Challenge No. 1: Not only will virtual ISIS, which has nodes all over the world, not go away even if territorial ISIS is defeated, I believe virtual ISIS will become yet more virulent to disguise the fact that it has lost the territorial caliphate to its archenemies: Shiite Iran, Hezbollah, pro-Shiite militias in Iraq, the pro-Shiite Assad regime in Damascus and Russia, not to mention America. Challenge No. 2: America’s goal in Syria is to create enough pressure on Assad, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah so they will negotiate a power-sharing accord with moderate Sunni Muslims that would also ease Assad out of power. One way to do that would be for NATO to create a no-fly safe zone around Idlib Province, where many of the anti-Assad rebels have gathered and where Assad recently dropped his poison gas on civilians. But Congress and the U.S. public are clearly wary of that. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/opinion/why-is-trump-fighting-isis-in-syria.html?searchResultPosition=90

241,"WASHINGTON — The choice by President Trump of a pro-immigration economist to lead his Council of Economic Advisers is stirring a backlash among his most ardent supporters, who worry it is an abandonment of the tough stance he took on the issue during the campaign and the latest in a string of broken promises. Mr. Trump had already disappointed some of his base supporters by intervening in Syria with a military strike last week and by delaying a tough stance on trade with China and Mexico. He expressed the idea via Twitter on Tuesday morning that he would be willing to offer the Chinese government a more favorable trade deal if it helped the United States with North Korea. Now there is growing unease that immigration is the next area where he will go soft. To these supporters, the appointment of Kevin A. Hassett, announced late last Friday afternoon, as Mr. Trump’s top White House economist is another sign that the president is succumbing to the swamp he promised to drain. Like most economists, Mr. Hassett believes that immigration spurs economic growth. At times he has pilloried Republicans for becoming the “Party of White,” arguing in 2010 that Republicans like then-Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona “have too often appeared hostile to immigrants.” In 2013, Mr. Hassett said the United States should double its intake of immigrants. Mr. Hassett, who currently works at the American Enterprise Institute, is a widely respected conservative economist who previously advised prominent Republicans like Senator John McCain and Mitt Romney. But for those who backed Mr. Trump because of his promises to build a wall and deport illegal immigrants, such notions are heresy.

Highly educated professionals tend to lean Democratic, even though Republican tax policies would probably leave more money in their pockets. Why do people vote against their economic interests? The answer, experts say, is partisanship. Party affiliation has become an all-encompassing identity that outweighs the details of specific policies. “Partisan identification is bigger than anything the party does,” said Frances Lee, a professor at the University of Maryland who wrote a book on partisan polarization. Rather, it stems from something much more fundamental: people’s idea of who they are. For American voters, party affiliation is a way to express a bundle of identities. “It more or less boils down to how you see the conflicts in American society, and which groups you see as representing you,” Ms. Lee said. “That often means race, and religion, and ethnicity — those are the social groups that underlie party identification.” That process is not necessarily conscious. “There’s sort of an embarrassment about being a partisan,” Ms. Lee said. “It’s seen as admitting to a bias.” That often leads people to say that they are independent, she said, but in fact most voters consistently lean toward one of the parties.

296 pp. Yale University Press. $26. At the start of the 2015 Henry L. Stimson Lectures at Yale, on which this book is based, Anne-Marie Slaughter, a distinguished political scientist, authority on international law and now president of the New America think tank, explained that the topic came to her while she was serving as director of policy planning at the State Department — in effect while she was practicing what she had preached in her academic career. The time-honored exercise of international politics as a “great game,” an endless competition for strategic advantage among sovereign and equal powers, was in urgent need of a radical update for a world in which networks spawned by the internet and social media, both benign and malignant, were shaping a far different global order. “The Chessboard and the Web” is meant as a guide for foreign policy in this new world. Whether in human interrelations or terrorism, efficient businesses or nefarious crime syndicates, government services or governments meddling in each other’s politics, Slaughter declares, we are at the dawn of a “Networked Age” when “all humanity is connected beneath the surface like the giant colonies of aspen trees in Colorado that are actually all one organism.” Yet foreign-policy makers, she argues, still play on the two-dimensional chessboard fashioned by the 17th-century Peace of Westphalia, partly because they lack the strategies for the web. The grand strategy she proposes is an international order based on three pillars: open society, open government and an open international system. Open versus closed, she declares, is the fault line of the digital age, the way capitalism versus Communism was in the last century. In the new order, in which competing states have been replaced by networks, openness means participation, transparency, autonomy and resistance to controls or limits on information.

247,"LONDON — The Daily Mail apologized to Melania Trump on Wednesday and agreed to pay damages to settle two lawsuits she had filed over an article last year asserting that the professional modeling agency she worked for in the 1990s had also been an escort service. “We accept that these allegations about Mrs. Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them,” a lawyer for the British newspaper told a judge, Andrew Nicol, at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. “We apologize to Mrs. Trump for any distress that our publication caused her. To settle Mrs. Trump’s two lawsuits against us, we have agreed to pay her damages and costs.” The terms of the settlement were not immediately disclosed. She had sought compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million, according to the filing. The Daily Mail published its article on Mrs. Trump on Aug. 20, 2016, quoting from a report in a magazine in Slovenia, where she was born, and a biography of her by a journalist, Bojan Pozar. In September, Mrs. Trump sued The Daily Mail in Montgomery County in Maryland, as well as in London, and the tabloid quickly published a retraction. After the Maryland court dismissed that case, saying it did not have jurisdiction, Mrs. Trump filed a new case in February, in New York.

248,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is partly to blame for the crisis in Syria and bears responsibility to help bring peace to the war-torn country, comments meant to increase pressure on the Kremlin as his secretary of state was in Moscow for a tense round of talks. “I really think there’s going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that peace happens, because frankly, if Russia didn’t go in and back this animal, we wouldn’t have a problem right now,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Putin’s support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “Putin is backing a person that’s truly an evil person, and I think it’s very bad for Russia, I think it’s very bad for mankind, it’s very bad for this world,” Mr. Trump added during an interview with Fox Business that aired Wednesday morning. His comments came as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was in Moscow for meetings with Russian leaders. Mr. Trump said his primary message to Russia was: “You should have peace in Syria; it’s enough.” Mr. Trump also recounted the scene at his Mar-a-Lago club last week after he gave the order for American forces to carry out the missile strike on a Syrian airfield that had launched Mr. Assad’s chemical attack, then boasted about it over chocolate cake to President Xi Jinping of China, who was at the Florida estate for a summit meeting. “I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you — this was during dessert,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ve just fired 59 missiles, all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable, from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which hit, amazing.

249,"Over the last year, the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton has hired the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the head of that agency’s enforcement unit and a prominent federal judge. That trend will continue on Thursday, when the firm’s white-collar defense group is expected to announce another acquisition from the government ranks: Winston Paes, a federal prosecutor who specializes in financial fraud. Mr. Paes, who prosecuted a number of Wall Street cases as head of the securities fraud section at the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn, will be counsel in Debevoise’s New York office, working alongside Mary Jo White, the former S.E.C. chairwoman; Andrew J. Ceresney, the agency’s enforcement chief; and John Gleeson, who spent over two decades as a federal judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Debevoise also has hired in its Washington office David A. O’Neil, the former acting head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, and Julie M. Riewe, a senior S.E.C. enforcement official. Although the job-hopping partly reflects an exodus of Obama administration officials to several prominent firms — and a homecoming for longtime Debevoise partners like Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney — the metaphorical revolving door between Debevoise and the government is spinning fast these days. Debevoise’s lock-step compensation system, which pays partners in a narrow range according to seniority rather than revenue generated, is attractive to government officials who often prefer to focus on clients and cases rather than the credit that individual lawyers receive. To critics, this revolving door fuels a perception of coziness between the defense bar and the prosecutors they face off against. But to the firms, it can be a selling point: Debevoise boasts that it employs 16 former federal prosecutors and is the only law firm with two former attorneys general. And although a recent report in The New York Law Journal revealed that the firm’s overall profit per partner dropped, the white-collar group was among the strongest performers. “When I was coming out of the government, I looked around, and I quickly decided that Debevoise had the breadth and depth of coverage in the white-collar area,” Mr. Ceresney said in an interview, adding that it was important to hire people with “broad experiences in all the relevant regulatory agencies” across state and federal governments.

250,"UNITED NATIONS — The United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, signaled on Wednesday morning that the Trump administration wanted to work with Russia to end the war in Syria. A few hours later, Ms. Haley drew a line in the diplomatic sand, forcing Russia to use its veto for an eighth time on a Syria resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The United States, France and Britain had sponsored a draft resolution that would have strengthened the ability of international investigators to look into the details of a chemical attack in Syria on April 4. The resolution won 10 votes, but Russia vetoed it. China abstained. After the vote, Ms. Haley said she regretted that Russia had chosen to use its veto power for the eighth time to back the Syrian government. “By its failure Russia will continue to be isolated,” she said. The measure condemned the chemical weapons attack, urged international investigators who were already authorized by the Security Council to look into it, and specifically reminded the Syrian government to cooperate, including by turning over all flight logs, flight plans and the names of commanders in charge of air operations on the day of the strike. Russia objected to the draft when it was first brought up last week, and on Wednesday it dismissed the resolution as a political tool. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said his government wanted what it called “an honest investigation.” Russia drafted an alternate resolution but did not put it up for a vote. The Russian deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, testily said that the resolution had “an anti-Syrian slant.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/world/middleeast/united-nations-resolution-syria-russia-united-states.html?searchResultPosition=55
251,"ALBANY — In his six-plus years as New York’s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo has slowly accumulated a national political portfolio peppered with popular, if niche, liberal causes: same-sex marriage, raising the minimum wage, and juvenile justice reform. In the last four months, however, Mr. Cuomo has seemed intent on expanding his appeal by pursuing initiatives aimed at a larger constituency of vital importance to his and his party’s long-term prospects: the middle class. Riding solid home-state approval ratings amid whispered national ambitions, Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat, has taken a deep plunge into the center of the pool in 2017, rolling out a “middle-class agenda” and a “middle-class recovery act,” promising to address “middle-class wages,” “middle-class anxiety” and “middle-class frustration.” There is perhaps no better illustration of Mr. Cuomo’s current focus than the so-called tuition-free college initiative he flaunted on Wednesday at LaGuardia Community College in Queens, standing alongside another centrist Democrat, Hillary Clinton, using his roots in the borough to amplify his connection to a tax bracket to which he does not personally belong. “When you grow up in Queens, you grow up middle class, you grow up part of a working family,” the governor said, standing at a lectern that had a sign reading “Tuition-Free College for the Middle Class.” “We’re not rich in Queens,” he said, “but that’s O.K., because we believe in the future.” Speculation about the future has recently been directed toward Mr. Cuomo, and the tuition plan and its target audience have only fueled speculation that the governor is angling not only for middle-class voters in Albany and Utica, but also for those in Ohio and Iowa in 2020.

253,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department obtained a secret court-approved wiretap last October on Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, based on evidence that he was operating as a Russian agent, a government official said Wednesday. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued the warrant, the official said, after investigators determined that Mr. Page was no longer part of the Trump campaign, which began distancing itself from him in early August. Mr. Page is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in a federal investigation. The Justice Department considered direct surveillance of anyone tied to a political campaign as a line it did not want to cross, the official added. But its decision to seek a wiretap once it was clear that Mr. Page had left the campaign was the latest indication that, as Mr. Trump built his insurgent run for the White House, the F.B.I. was deeply concerned about whether any of his associates were colluding with Russia. To obtain the warrant, the government needed to show probable cause that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of Russia. Investigators must first get approval from one of three senior officials at the Justice Department. Then, prosecutors take it to a surveillance court judge. And though the Trump administration has said Mr. Page was a bit player who had no access to the candidate, the wiretap shows the F.B.I. had strong evidence that a campaign adviser was operating on behalf of Moscow. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Page have called the investigation a “witch hunt” and said it was cooked up by their political rivals for speaking out against President Barack Obama’s policies. On Tuesday, Mr. Page said in an email that it “will be interesting to see what comes out when the unjustified basis for those FISA requests are more fully disclosed over time,” using shorthand for the court.

254,"MOSCOW — Vladimir V. Putin kept his guest, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, dangling all day. It was not clear until around 5 p.m., when Mr. Tillerson’s small motorcade eased out of the Ritz-Carlton in one of the fanciest parts of Moscow and slipped into Red Square that Russia’s president was willing to engage in his first face-to-face meeting with a senior member of President Trump’s administration, even one who is an old business partner who used to show up on behalf of Exxon Mobil. If a few weeks ago critics of the Trump administration feared that Mr. Tillerson would simply fold on the sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, they need not have worried. In a two-hour meeting, as later described in sketchy terms by Mr. Tillerson, they did not agree on much — certainly not on who was responsible for fatally poisoning Syrian civilians with the nerve agent sarin, or for the interference in the American elections last year and the European elections underway now. “We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of the greatest importance to both of us,” Mr. Tillerson said at a news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov. Mr. Tillerson went on to describe how the two countries were establishing “a working group to address smaller issues and make progress toward stabilizing the relationship,” a recognition of the fact that the big issues were so big that no working group would have the authority. Dangling meetings is an old technique for Mr. Putin, used to keep other leaders off balance and demonstrate his control. But when Mr. Putin and Mr. Tillerson did meet, it was clear that they not only have different world views, but that they have different views of the facts. And that made it difficult to achieve anything other than cosmetic accords on the issues over which the two nations, in a revival of Cold War rhetoric, have charged each other with lying about. For good measure, Mr. Lavrov offered a lengthy tutorial for Mr. Tillerson about all the examples of American-led regime change in the world — from Slobodan Milosevic to Saddam Hussein to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi — that went bad, suggesting it made no sense to add President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to the list.

255,"“I’m sorry.” Two simple words, not so simply said. On Wednesday, the public representatives of two embattled American institutions — United Airlines and the White House — found themselves on national television grappling with a delicate and increasingly common ritual of the corporate and political worlds: the public apology. Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive, recalled his “shame” upon seeing a cellphone video, shared by millions of people, of a paying passenger being violently evicted from one of his airline’s flights. Face taut, voice soft, Mr. Munoz’s televised prostration was a far cry from the robotic statement issued by United days earlier, expressing regret for “re-accommodating” a traveler. Around the same time, President Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, was denouncing himself as “reprehensible” for having favorably compared Hitler to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and referring to Nazi death camps as “Holocaust centers,” all while standing at the White House podium. The fine art of repentance is a skill taught in business schools and promoted by high-priced consultants. But all kinds of offenders in public life still seem to struggle with the execution. Corporations like BP and Wells Fargo have faced criticism for dawdling responses to cascading crises, while politicians from Bill Clinton to Anthony Weiner have had difficulty admitting to peccadilloes. The key to contrition, according to public-relations experts, is projecting sincerity, humanity, and a plain-spoken demeanor — the better to convince a cynical public. And in this age of whipsawing social media, you had better do it fast. “The head of United should never have been allowed to take three swings at correcting and apologizing for an incident that was on more social media than Kim and Kanye’s wedding,” said Mortimer Matz, a New York consultant who has guided decades’ worth of clients through crises small and large.

256,"WASHINGTON — President Trump made three startling economic policy reversals on Wednesday, stepping away from pledges he made as a candidate and even policies he supported only days ago. The shifts confounded many of Mr. Trump’s supporters and suggested that the moderate financiers he brought from Wall Street are eclipsing the White House populist wing led by Stephen K. Bannon, the political strategist who is increasingly being sidelined by the president. In a series of interviews, Mr. Trump said he no longer wanted to label China a currency manipulator — a week after telling The Financial Times that the Chinese were the “world champions” of currency manipulation. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the president said he no longer wanted to eliminate the Export-Import Bank. And he said that he might consider reappointing Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve when her term ends next year. Yet before the election, he regularly denounced China and said that Ms. Yellen should be “ashamed” of herself because of what he said was her political bias. Mr. Trump’s latest pronouncements suggest he is moving toward a more mainstream economic approach, although on other issues that he discussed on Wednesday, like a tax overhaul and health care, his policy and strategy appeared muddled.

Zeke Smith, familiar to viewers of the previous season, went blank. His eyes lost focus, and it seemed, for a moment, as if he were disassociating. The thing that he had wanted to avoid was now about to unfold, on national television. Mayhem ensued. Words like “deception” were thrown around. Repeatedly, Mr. Smith was accused of having misled his fellow tribe members because, yes, he was — or had been — trans. “Survivor” is a reality show, but the issues that Mr. Smith had to deal with — and its potential manipulation by the Jeff Varners of the world — are ones that many people, both trans and not, have had to confront: What private information is ours to keep? What aspects of our history do others have the right to know? Does knowledge of people’s sexual or gender history change the way we look at them? We are judged not only by the public selves we invent but also by the things we keep private. Often the contradiction between the two seems significant. The fact that Newt Gingrich was having an affair the whole time he was busy trying to impeach Bill Clinton for lying about having an affair called into question whether Mr. Gingrich was motivated by his dedication to the moral high ground or — you think? — the opportunity to drag his adversary down. We see this again and again, especially in the long list of anti-gay family-values Republicans who have later come out — sometimes voluntarily, and sometimes as a result of being busted. There have been more documented instances of Republican congressmen being arrested for solicitation in restrooms than transgender people.

New S.U.V.s dominated media previews on Wednesday at the New York International Auto Show, the latest sign that the shift away from traditional cars is more than a short-term trend. And the new vehicles are all about muscle. Ford Motor released a more powerful version of its extra-large Lincoln Navigator. There were high-octane offerings in the Jeep and Mercedes-Benz lines. And General Motors moved to cement its leadership in the category with a midsize model capable of towing a 20-foot speedboat. In short, with oil prices half what they were three years ago, and President Trump vowing to cut back on fuel-economy regulations, automakers are raising the stakes in the S.U.V. segment. “We don’t think that the rate of growth of S.U.V.s will necessarily continue, but we do believe the shift to them is permanent,” said Mike Manley, head of Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep division.

Even as the federal courts trip up President Trump’s ban on travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries and Congress signals it is in no rush to pay for a border wall, the administration is pushing the vast border enforcement network to begin choking off illegal immigration. Homeland Security’s plan to greatly expand its Border Patrol has been known for some time and includes adding about 5,000 agents, in part by allowing some applicants to skip the polygraph test that is required for all prospective hires. That proposal has been praised by Border Patrol agents, who say the polygraph is excessively difficult, and questioned by some experts, who say the test is needed to screen out drug cartel members and other problematic hires. The memo, which was first reported by The Washington Post, outlined several other ways in which the administration is considering relaxing hiring standards and stepping up recruitment. Beyond removing the polygraph hurdle, the memo discusses eliminating a part of the entrance exam that tests the Spanish language skills of prospective hires, explaining that “few applicants fail the entrance exam solely because of these tests.” New agents will still have to obtain “the appropriate level of proficiency in Spanish” to graduate from the academy, the memo says.

261,"“In its lifetime, the same building can meet Julius Caesar, Napoleon and Adolf Hitler,” James Crawford writes in “Fallen Glory: The Lives and Deaths of History’s Greatest Buildings.” “What human could claim the same?” Crawford’s book tells the stories of 21 great and influential sites — their conception, construction and destruction — from the Tower of Babel to the Bastille to the World Trade Center. In doing so, he tours much of world history, and attempts to look into the future as well. Below, Crawford tells us about the inspiration for the book, what he learned while writing it and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? JAMES CRAWFORD The inspiration came from a visit to the site of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete about eight years ago. I had studied the mythological history of the site — the labyrinth, the Minotaur, Theseus, Ariadne, Daedalus and Icarus — but was largely unaware of the early-20th-century story of Arthur Evans, the English antiquarian who partially reconstructed the ruins in reinforced concrete. I found exploring Knossos a confusing and at times surreal experience. You can’t help but try to spot where the rebuilding (and garish redecorating) stops and where the original remains actually begin. I was at first baffled and then intrigued by the eccentricity and audacity of Evans. Crete got under my skin, but no part of it more so than Knossos. The relatively recent intervention of a wealthy eccentric seemed such a deliciously bizarre episode in the “life” of a building. And it was this that got me thinking about the very idea of the lives — and indeed deaths — of buildings. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? CRAWFORD It’s difficult to know where to start with this. The book spans some 7,000 years of human history, moving from the birth of civilization up to the present day. But the stories of each of the individual buildings I write about also often span thousands and thousands of years. As a result, the research could become a rabbit hole, and I found myself doing massive chunks of reading around subjects as diverse and niche as the Marquis de Sade’s prison eating habits, the sex lives of Byzantine emperors, French New Wave filmmaking in Cold War East Germany, the opium-fuelled poetry of Chinese princes, viral social-media shaming in South Korea, and how to 3-D print a 2,000-year-old Syrian temple. A particular favorite was discovering that the Stasi held a file on Bruce Springsteen — which commented approvingly on his lyrics about working-class economic depression in America — and that they permitted him to play a concert to 300,000 people in East Germany, a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? CRAWFORD Time and again in my research I found structures with compelling narratives. This is what I had expected — or had certainly hoped for. What I hadn’t anticipated was the extent to which the lives and deaths of buildings, old and new, appeared to be having a profound impact on global politics and global culture today.

He also copyrighted and trademarked the three-and-a-half-ton sculpture that stands near Wall Street.

263,"Aug. 19 was an eventful day for Paul Manafort. That morning, he stepped down from guiding Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, after a brief tenure during which Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination, Democrats’ emails were hacked and the campaign’s contacts with Russia came under scrutiny. Dogged by revelations about past financial dealings in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort retreated from public view. But behind the scenes, he was busy with other matters. Papers were recorded that same day creating a shell company controlled by Mr. Manafort that soon received $13 million in loans from two businesses with ties to Mr. Trump, including one that partners with a Ukrainian-born billionaire and another led by a Trump economic adviser. They were among $20 million in loans secured by properties belonging to Mr. Manafort and his wife. The purpose of the loans is unstated in public records, although at least some of them appear to be part of an effort by Mr. Manafort to stave off a personal financial crisis stemming from failed investments with his son-in-law. The transactions raise a number of questions, including whether Mr. Manafort’s decision to turn to Trump-connected lenders was related to his role in the campaign, where he had agreed to serve for free. They also shine a light on the rich real estate portfolio that Mr. Manafort acquired during and after the years he worked in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort, often using shell companies, invested millions of dollars in various properties, including apartments and condos in New York, homes in Florida and Virginia and luxury houses in Los Angeles. Mr. Manafort’s ties to Ukraine and Russia have come under scrutiny as federal officials investigate Russian meddling in the American presidential election.

264,"Until a few days ago, Americans and the world had reason to think that the Trump administration’s policy toward Russia would involve cooperation and harmony and seek to reverse the acrimony and dysfunction that had come to characterize relations between the Kremlin and the Obama administration. During the campaign, Mr. Trump fawned over Russia’s assertively proud leader, Vladimir Putin, praising him for “doing a great job” and calling him a “stronger leader” than Barack Obama. As to policy, he seemed almost an apologist for Mr. Putin’s aggressive behavior in Syria, his annexation of Crimea and his transparent efforts to undermine the NATO alliance. Findings by the American intelligence community that Russia had intervened in the election on Mr. Trump’s behalf seemed further evidence of a bromance, if not something more sinister. Three months into the Trump presidency, Russia-American relations are as tense as ever, a casualty of Mr. Putin’s ruthless behavior and Mr. Trump’s changing views and whiplash approach to policy, infuriating Russians who had every reason to believe they would have a pal in the White House. While both men could end up losers, there is a greater chance that Mr. Trump, a foreign policy neophyte who has bungled his presidential debut, will find it hard to prevail over the nefarious ways of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent.

265,"WASHINGTON — The United States dropped the “mother of all bombs” — the most powerful conventional bomb in the American arsenal — on an Islamic State cave complex in Afghanistan on Thursday, the Pentagon said, unleashing a weapon so massive that it had to be dropped from the rear of a cargo plane. The strike was the first combat use of what is formally named the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast. President Trump has bestowed additional authority on the Pentagon in his first months in office, which the military has argued will help it defeat the Islamic State more speedily. Mr. Trump did not say whether he had personally approved Thursday’s mission. “What I do is I authorize my military,” Mr. Trump said after a meeting with emergency workers at the White House. He called the bombing “another very, very successful mission.” The Pentagon gave no casualty totals for the bombing, part of an intense air campaign against the militant group in Afghanistan. But in a separate announcement, the Pentagon said that an airstrike in Syria by the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State there had killed 18 Syrian fighters allied with the United States, raising concerns about whether the White House is applying any rigor to the process of approving airstrikes in hot spots from Afghanistan to Syria. The Syria strike — on Tuesday near the town of Tabqah, which Syrian fighters and American advisers are trying to capture — was the third American-led airstrike in a month that may have killed civilians or allies. Earlier bombing runs killed or wounded scores of civilians in a mosque complex in Syria and in a building in the west of Mosul, Iraq.

266,"WASHINGTON — As a candidate, President Trump disparaged NATO as a musty relic of old thinking, an alliance focused on long-gone adversaries rather than new-era threats, a burden that drained American resources on behalf of ungrateful partners who did not pay their share. In a word: “obsolete.” That was then. After 82 days in office, Mr. Trump officially pronounced NATO rehabilitated, taking credit for transforming it into a modern, cost-sharing, terrorism-fighting pillar of American and European security. “I said it was obsolete,” the president noted on Wednesday as he hosted NATO’s secretary general. “It’s no longer obsolete.” Never mind that the alliance has changed very little if at all in the last three months, and that whatever modest changes have been made were in train long before Mr. Trump entered the doorway of the White House. After weeks of being lobbied, cajoled and educated by the leaders of Britain and Germany, not to mention “my generals,” as he likes to call his national security team, Mr. Trump has found fresh virtue in a venerable organization. “Nothing has changed at NATO in the last 80 days,” said Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “It’s gratifying to see the president affirming that NATO is ‘no longer obsolete’ — it never was. Perhaps the one important thing that has changed in the last 80 days is that as president, Mr. Trump has come to appreciate the importance of this alliance and how it contributes to security and stability in Europe and beyond.” Mr. Trump’s about-face on NATO was only part of a day of flip flops at the White House. Within a matter of hours, the president determined that China is not a currency manipulator after all, embraced the Export-Import Bank that he once called unnecessary and suggested he might keep Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman he said he would replace after her term expired. Most striking, he pivoted 180 degrees on Russia, lashing it for supporting rogue nations after years of praising President Vladimir V. Putin. The Russia reversal and the NATO turnabout were inherently linked, of course. As Russia appears more ominous, NATO seems more necessary. But the shift in attitude also offered one of the starkest examples yet of Mr. Trump’s evolving views on domestic and foreign policy, as the first president ever elected without political or military experience settles into the role of commander in chief.

267,"Vilified by accusations of using a chemical bomb, Syria’s president intensified his counterpropaganda campaign on Thursday, suggesting that child actors had staged death scenes to malign him and that American warplanes had bombed a terrorist warehouse full of poison gases, killing hundreds of people. In his first interview since an April 4 attack on the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed over 80 people, sickened hundreds and outraged the world, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria not only repeated the government’s denials of responsibility but contended without evidence that the episode had been fabricated as a pretext for an American retaliatory missile strike. “We don’t know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhoun,” Mr. Assad told Agence France-Presse in the television interview from Damascus, which was recorded on Wednesday. “Were they dead at all?” The decision by the increasingly isolated Syrian president to give an interview to a Western news organization appeared to reflect a calculation that his best option, even in the face of incriminating evidence, was to repeatedly deny responsibility for the attack, one of the worst in the six-year-old Syrian war. Medical examiners in Turkey, where many of the Khan Sheikhoun victims were taken, have said that autopsies showed they had been attacked with sarin, a lethal nerve agent and a banned chemical weapon that Syria had claimed to have eradicated. In a further sign that sarin was used, the British delegation to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the global group that polices adherence to a treaty banning such munitions, said samples taken from the attack had tested positive for sarin, Reuters reported.

268,"WASHINGTON — President Trump signed legislation on Thursday aimed at cutting off federal funding to Planned Parenthood and other groups that perform abortions, a move cheered by conservatives who have clamored to impose curbs on reproductive rights. The measure nullifies a rule completed in the last days of the Obama administration that effectively barred state and local governments from withholding federal funding for family planning services related to contraception, sexually transmitted infections, fertility, pregnancy care, and breast and cervical cancer screening from qualified health providers — regardless of whether they also performed abortions. The new measure cleared Congress last month with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. The previous Department of Health and Human Services regulation, which took effect two days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, said that states and localities could not withhold money from a provider for any reason other than an inability to provide family planning services. Mr. Trump has shown ambivalence about Planned Parenthood, voicing support for its health-related services other than abortion, and his daughter Ivanka has urged him to tread carefully on the issue, concerned about the possible political repercussions of the Republican effort to defund the organization altogether. As a middle ground, Mr. Trump has proposed preserving federal funding for Planned Parenthood if it stops providing abortion services. The organization has said it will never accept such a deal. And federal law already prohibits government funding for abortion, except in cases of rape or incest, or to save a woman’s life.

It was also the headline in The New York Times at the top of Tuesday’s front page essay about London that generated a spirited trans-Atlantic discussion. The essay by Sarah Lyall, with striking visuals by Sergey Ponomarev, is the first in a series of articles examining how Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, could affect London. Ms. Lyall looked closely at the British capital: a teeming multicultural metropolis of 8.7 million people, with a Muslim mayor, where some native Britons no longer feel at home. London is a center of international culture and commerce whose resilience and openness became a symbol of postwar European unity. It’s expected that in two years it will no longer be a part of that European experiment. In Britain, and around the world, the response to the article was swift, if hardly unanimous. Readers, commentators in the British news media, members of Parliament and people across social media weighed in and continued to do so on Thursday. No matter how rapidly the media landscape is changing, headlines still matter. “Will London Fall?” clearly struck a nerve; some people reacted to the headline more than the article. Some viewed it as unduly inflammatory or sensationalistic. #WillLondonFall became a trending topic on British Twitter. Some thought it provoked unwanted memories of the much-maligned disaster movie, “London Has Fallen.” Others thought it was fine. Passionate responses poured in from a city that has survived fire, plague and the Blitz, among them: Not everyone was so high-minded. To some people on Twitter, London had already succumbed to immigration, globalization and more. Venom seeped through some Twitter feeds, reminiscent of the anger that surfaced during the vote, to the annoyance of some others.

270,"Peter A. Nadosy is a pillar of the Wall Street establishment — he spent 27 years at Morgan Stanley, rising to vice chairman. He served a stint managing the endowment at Harvard, his alma mater, and he’s also a life trustee and member of the investment committee at Amherst College. He’s on multiple boards of nonprofit institutions, including the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and St. Andrew’s Dune Church in Southampton, N.Y. He is, in short, about the last person you’d expect to throw his support behind an investment strategy that makes fossil-fuel divestment — something Mr. Nadosy opposes — look tame by comparison. Yet, as chairman of the Ford Foundation’s investment committee, which oversees the foundation’s $12 billion-plus endowment, he’s now in the vanguard of an approach to endowment management that breaks with generations of investment orthodoxy. Last week, the foundation announced that it would commit $1 billion to investments that “earn not only attractive financial returns but concrete social returns as well,” as it said in a news release. “When we first started talking about this nine months ago, I was very wary,” Mr. Nadosy told me. “I’m on 10 different boards and investment committees. It’s deeply ingrained that your goal is to maximize returns, because that’s how performance is measured.” “Everywhere I go, people want to know, ‘What quartile are you in?’” he added. “Like it or not, that’s the world we live in.” Earning high returns isn’t just a matter of bragging rights — endowment income supports the missions of nonprofit institutions, whether education, as with college and universities, or broader social programs, as at many private foundations. By law, tax-exempt foundations must spend at least 5 percent of their endowment every year on charitable purposes. In Ford’s case, that amounts to over $600 million.

274,"PHOENIX — An environmental group and an Arizona congressman have sued to block the construction of President Trump’s wall along the southern border, threatening to derail one of his marquee projects well before it gets off the ground. The Center for Biological Diversity and Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Natural Resources, claimed in a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday in Tucson that the Trump administration had failed to study the wall’s environmental impact before gearing up for its construction. Mr. Trump’s plan to strengthen the border includes the hiring of 5,000 Border Patrol agents, increasing by 25 percent the ranks of the largest law enforcement agency in the country. The lawsuit seeks to stop any work until the government agrees to analyze the impact of construction, noise, light and other changes to the landscape on rivers, plants and endangered species — including jaguars, Sonoran pronghorns and ocelots — and also on border residents. The suit appears to be the first legal action against the wall, but it is only one of the many challenges the project faces, including who will pay for it and what form it will take. An estimate by the Department of Homeland Security put the cost at nearly $22 billion. Mr. Trump’s budget sets aside $1.4 billion for the wall’s initial development. Included in the proposals turned in to the federal government last week were a wall of solar panels and another topped by a monorail.

276,"“Should You Dress for Resistance at New York Fashion Week?” So asked a headline in February on Vogue’s website, above the image of two young women in skinny black jeans holding Dior shopping bags and wearing T-shirts that declared: “We Should All Be Feminists.” Dressing for resistance did not, apparently, mean combat clothes in preparation for a possible Jared Kushner sighting; it meant wearing garments with unobjectionable slogans — and for some in the fashion world, even that seemed a step too far. One writer quoted in the accompanying article explained that she would channel strength, positive energy and a broader spirit of noncompliance through “offbeat bright colors, bold prints and my grandmother’s gold necklace.” The age of activism that Donald J. Trump’s presidency unleashed has given us, as its two most ubiquitous symbols of defiance, the pink knit hat that women around the world have embraced as a means of communicating their distaste for President Trump’s regressive views on women and a T-shirt blaring “Nasty Woman” — now available in a special $35 Earth Day edition — a subversion of the president’s remarks about Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Although a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of some of the shirts — there are many types and various purveyors — go to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, the whole gambit recalls a time when the relationship between politics and style seemed less preoccupied with telegraphing aphoristic opinions and more concerned with direct social and economic remediation for those left behind by American consumer culture. In 1966, a small store called Liberty House, with precisely this in mind, opened at 343¼ Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. Abbie Hoffman, through his involvement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, was the manager. Liberty House sold handbags, book bags, dresses, children’s clothes, pillows, quilts and other “crafts of freedom,” as they were known, produced by an outfit called the Poor People’s Corporation. The P.P.C. was founded by a young civil rights worker named Jesse Morris, who decided to open a chain of small cooperative factories in Mississippi to help provide incomes to poor black people who were not only beholden to the seasonal nature of farm work but also facing the threat of losing their jobs if their white employers discovered they had exercised their rights. “If you were in a car with a white person, if you were registering to vote, if a civil rights worker came to your place, then you would get a visitor the next day telling you that you had to leave the land you were sharecropping,” Doris Derby, the activist and photographer who moved from New York to Mississippi in the 1960s and became instrumental in the P.P.C., told me. “The idea was to give black people something beyond sharecropping.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/nyregion/liberty-house-closing-manhattan.html?searchResultPosition=13
277,"BEIJING — Amid sharply rising tensions over North Korea’s nuclear arms program, China said on Thursday that its trade with the country had expanded, even though it had complied with United Nations sanctions and stopped buying North Korean coal, a major source of hard currency for Pyongyang. China released the first-quarter trade data just days after President Trump urged its leader, Xi Jinping, to clamp down on trade with North Korea. The two leaders met at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last week. With signs indicating that North Korea could be planning a nuclear or missile test as early as Saturday, a United States Navy strike group led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson is steaming toward the Korean Peninsula in a show of force. But the Trump administration has indicated that economic pressure — particularly imposed by China, with which North Korea conducts almost 90 percent of its trade — is its preferred form of deterrence. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said in interviews that he had encouraged Mr. Xi to solve the North Korea problem, offering China a better trade deal if he did so. Recent satellite images indicate that North Korea may be preparing for an underground nuclear test, which would be its sixth in a decade. North Korea often conducts such tests on important anniversaries, and Saturday is the 105th anniversary of the birth of the country’s founder, Kim Il-sung.

278,"THE arrival of the “post-truth” political climate came as a shock to many Americans. But to the Christian writer Rachel Held Evans, charges of “fake news” are nothing new. “The deep distrust of the media, of scientific consensus — those were prevalent narratives growing up,” she told me. Although Ms. Evans, 35, no longer calls herself an evangelical, she attended Bryan College, an evangelical school in Dayton, Tenn. She was taught to distrust information coming from the scientific or media elite because these sources did not hold a “biblical worldview.” “It was presented as a cohesive worldview that you could maintain if you studied the Bible,” she told me. “Part of that was that climate change isn’t real, that evolution is a myth made up by scientists who hate God, and capitalism is God’s ideal for society.” Conservative evangelicals are not the only ones who think that an authority trusted by the other side is probably lying. But they believe that their own authority — the inerrant Bible — is both supernatural and scientifically sound, and this conviction gives that natural human aversion to unwelcome facts a special power on the right. This religious tradition of fact denial long predates the rise of the culture wars, social media or President Trump, but it has provoked deep conflict among evangelicals themselves. That innocuous phrase — “biblical worldview” or “Christian worldview” — is everywhere in the evangelical world. The radio show founded by Chuck Colson, “BreakPoint,” helps listeners “get informed and equipped to live out the Christian worldview.” Focus on the Family devotes a webpage to the implications of a worldview “based on the infallible Word of God.” Betsy DeVos’s supporters praised her as a “committed Christian living out a biblical worldview.” The phrase is not as straightforward as it seems. Ever since the scientific revolution, two compulsions have guided conservative Protestant intellectual life: the impulse to defend the Bible as a reliable scientific authority and the impulse to place the Bible beyond the claims of science entirely.

279,"UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Thursday to end its 13-year-long peacekeeping mission in Haiti, and replace its blue-helmeted soldiers with police officers. The mission, often a source of embarrassment to the world body, landed in Haiti in 2004, after a rebellion led to the removal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It became arguably best known for introducing a deadly cholera strain to the country — and then refusing for years to take responsibility for it. The cholera outbreak, which began in 2010, has killed at least 9,500 people so far and infected hundreds of thousands of Haitians. The United Nations apologized last year and proposed to compensate affected Haitians, but has yet to raise money for the effort. Of the $400 million that the United Nations says it needs, it has received $2.66 million, from only six countries — Britain, Chile, France, India, Liechtenstein and South Korea, according to data posted on its website. The mission has also recently been troubled by allegations of sexual abuse. A sex ring, operated by Sri Lankan soldiers who were posted there from 2004 to 2007, exploited at least nine children, according to an internal United Nations report, The Associated Press reported this week. The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, referred to the sexual abuse allegations in her brief remarks in the council chambers on Thursday. “The United States has made it clear to the U.N. and all troop-contributing countries that these abuses must stop,” she said. She did not address the cholera outbreak, nor how the United Nations can compensate survivors. The Haiti drawdown, which was recommended by the secretary general, António Guterres, comes amid pressure by President Trump’s administration to review each of the organization’s 16 peacekeeping missions. The United States is the United Nations’ largest financial contributor; it funds about 28 percent of the world body’s $7.87 billion budget, and Trump administration officials have said they want to bring that down to a maximum of 25 percent. The American contribution amounts to less than 0.1 percent of the federal budget. Missions in Ivory Coast and Liberia, which have shrunk significantly in recent years, are already scheduled to close gradually. The mission in Darfur is set to end as well. The mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo was the subject of intense negotiations recently, with the Security Council ultimately agreeing to pare it back by about 500 soldiers to a little over 16,000 troops. Ms. Haley had sought deeper cuts. In Haiti, the roughly 2,300 soldiers are scheduled to leave gradually by October. Seven United Nations police units will remain for an initial period of six months to train Haitian police officers. The decision to close the Haiti mission represented a rare moment of unity on the Security Council, with the world powers agreeing that the country had reached a new level of stability.

The strike, on Tuesday in Tabqah, Syria, was the third time in a month that American-led airstrikes may have killed civilians or allies, and it comes even as the Pentagon is investigating two previous airstrikes that killed or wounded scores of civilians in a mosque complex in Syria and in a building in the west of Mosul, Iraq. Tuesday’s strike was requested by coalition allies who were on the ground near Tabqah, the United States Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East, said in a statement. The fighters had called in the airstrikes and “identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position,” it said, using another name for the Islamic State. The Central Command statement said that the target location turned out to be a “fighting position” for the Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been fighting the Islamic State alongside the United States. It was unclear whether the strike came from an American warplane or one from the other coalition partners. “The coalition’s deepest condolences go out to the members of the S.D.F. and their families,” Central Command said in the statement, calling the episode “tragic.” Military officials said the cause is being investigated. As the American-led military campaigns against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have intensified in recent months, so, too, have reports of civilian casualties and, now, friendly fire. Military officials say that is to be expected as Iraqi forces try to retake Mosul in what is seen as the last big urban hurdle to defeating the extremist Sunni militant group in Iraq, and while forces allied with the United States are moving in on the group’s de facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria. President Trump has indicated that unlike President Barack Obama, who had his White House scrutinize many military operations, he will leave more operational decision-making to the Pentagon and to American commanders in the field. That move has been welcomed by many in the military, who often expressed frustration at what they saw as a cumbersome decision-making process in Mr. Obama’s White House.

Check on suicidal inmates every 15 minutes, and evaluate their mental health every day. Inform detainees, in languages they can understand, how to obtain medical care. In disciplinary hearings, provide a staff member who can advocate in English on the detainee’s behalf. But as the Trump administration seeks to quickly find jail space for its crackdown on illegal immigration, it is moving to curtail these rules as a way to entice more sheriffs and local officials to make their correctional facilities available. According to two Homeland Security officials who had knowledge of the plans but declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly, new jail contracts will contain a far less detailed set of regulations. They will make no mention of the need for translation services, for example. A current rule that detainees’ requests for medical care must be evaluated by a professional within 24 hours will be replaced by a requirement that the jails merely have procedures on providing medical care. The new contracts will require that the jails maintain policies for suicide prevention, solitary confinement and other concerns, but will not specify what those policies should contain. The changes, which will coincide with the closing of an office that develops regulations, will essentially hold these jails to the same standards they must follow for criminal inmates. That is a break from a long-held philosophy that people held on immigration violations, who are considered by law to be “civil” detainees, should be treated differently, and is in line with the president’s belief that the government should be tougher on unauthorized immigrants.

He was in New York at the invitation of the Ethics Center of Australia, at a cocktail party at the Library Hotel; the next morning he would give a talk on his views of President Trump, and how his actions may wind up intersecting with those of his old boss. While Mr. Dean was in town, the news of the day — with its talk of investigations and wiretaps — seemed an echo of the Watergate era. Amid investigations into the Trump administration’s ties to Russia, the president had accused his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of wiretapping the phones at Trump Tower. Surreptitious recording is something Mr. Dean knows all too well: Mr. Nixon taped 37 of their conversations in the White House. “That’s the silliness of Trump’s tweet saying Obama tapped him,” Mr. Dean said. “He could find that out within one phone call.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/style/john-dean-richard-nixon-watergate-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=45
285,"The Trump administration is hoping that its cruise missile strikes will solve a problem that has defied years of efforts: the willingness of the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, to use chemical weapons. But in a war with many dilemmas, this may be among the most intractable, analysts say. It is driven by Mr. Assad’s own grim strategy and the limitations of American power, but also something deeper: the fundamental nature of the Syrian conflict and of chemical weaponry. What follows are some of the forces prompting Mr. Assad to opt to use chemical weapons in Syria and why they are so resilient. Mr. Assad relies on airstrikes, backed by allied Russian forces, which have helped him turn the war’s tide. But his greatest weakness is manpower: His ground forces, eroded by years of fighting, are simply too few to hold, much less advance, every front line. Aaron Stein, who studies the Middle East and arms control at the Atlantic Council, a research group, said that for a leader like Mr. Assad, who appears unconcerned with civilian death, chemical weapons presented a way to solve his battlefield problems. “They are effective weapons,” he said, that were best suited to capitalize on Mr. Assad’s air power superiority and compensate for his manpower shortages.

286,"WASHINGTON — As we mark the centenary of the United States’ entry into World War I, I recall the words of a participant in the Versailles Treaty, which ended that conflict. “This isn’t a treaty of peace,” the American diplomat William Bullitt declared. “I can see at least 11 wars in it.” The world once again seems to be preparing for war: a wider conflict in Syria, greater friction with Russia and possible military action on the Korean Peninsula. In the event of war, the president of the United States has unrestricted powers to use nuclear weapons first. Concerns about the absence of checks and balances on the first use of nuclear weapons have spiked because of Donald J. Trump’s bellicose temperament and shallow understanding of nuclear flash points. These concerns have led some on Capitol Hill to introduce legislation that would prohibit the president from launching a nuclear first strike without a declaration of war by Congress. The intention is understandable, but this remedy is unworkable and unachievable. No president in the modern era has accepted the absolute requirement of congressional consent on war-making powers. Moreover, any scenario for the first use of nuclear weapons implies great urgency because, over time, America’s conventional military advantages would presumably suffice. A congressional debate authorizing first use would have to be very hurried, and this process could speed up hostile actions rather than slow them down. And when the executive branch has occasionally sought support for war-making powers, Congress has seen fit to provide that backing, rather than deny it. A far more realistic check on the first use of nuclear weapons by the United States can be found, oddly enough, in the case of a Soviet diesel submarine that was depth-charged to the surface during the most harrowing days of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Back then, diesel submarines had limited capabilities to remain submerged and to “phone home.” So the captain, second captain and deputy political officer on the B-59, a Foxtrot-class vessel, observed a compact in the event that they were unable to receive instructions from Moscow authorizing the use of a nuclear-armed torpedo on board. They agreed that to fire the torpedo against a surface ship, their vote had to be unanimous; if not, they would hold their fire.

Security Council resolution sponsored by the United States, Britain and France that would have condemned last week’s chemical attack in Syria. The vote reflected how President Trump’s plan to mend ties with Moscow has given way to acrimony. “We may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia,” Mr. Trump said, as he met NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, at the White House. Mr. Trump also said that NATO was “no longer obsolete.” Meanwhile in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin sat down with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for two hours yesterday evening, after keeping his guest dangling all day.

288,"When he was discussing military strategy or diplomacy, Gen. Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, liked to invoke what he called the Pottery Barn rule: “If you break it, you own it.” Well, the Republicans broke the Supreme Court confirmation process. Now they own the Supreme Court. What do I mean? After all, didn’t Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, confirmed last Friday by a vote of 54 to 45 and sworn in on Monday, simply replace another Republican-appointed justice, Antonin Scalia? If the Republicans own the court now, wasn’t that true before Justice Scalia died in February of last year? There’s a crucial difference. Justice Scalia reached the Supreme Court in 1986 by the normal route, events following one another in typical fashion. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger announced his retirement. President Ronald Reagan chose a sitting associate justice, William H. Rehnquist, to replace him, simultaneously naming then-Judge Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to the Rehnquist seat. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducted a confirmation hearing, and the full Senate confirmed Justice Scalia unanimously to the seat he went on to occupy for nearly 30 years. Contrast that route to the one that brought Justice Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. The Senate’s Republican majority engaged in a 10-month blockade of President Barack Obama’s nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the same appeals court where Justice Scalia served, based on the astonishing argument that despite having been twice elected by wide margins, President Obama wasn’t entitled to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that arose on his watch. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has boasted that keeping the seat open — and thus keeping the future of the Supreme Court alive in conservative voters’ minds as a concrete issue because of an actual vacancy — played a decisive role in Donald Trump’s election. “The single biggest issue in bringing the Republicans home in the end was the Supreme Court,” Senator McConnell gloated to The Washington Post in February. In other words, it was raw politics all the way down, without even a fig leaf of a nonpolitical rationale. I’m not naïve. All presidents yearn for a Supreme Court legacy, and many tell fibs about the nominees they choose. President Reagan presented Robert H. Bork as a “moderate.” He wasn’t. President George H. W. Bush described Clarence Thomas as the best-qualified person for the job. He wasn’t. That’s all just part of the game. Of course the Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process is political; how could it be otherwise? But the Republicans rewrote the rules well before their decision last week to abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court confirmation votes. Making an existing Supreme Court vacancy a highly visible part of an electoral strategy stamps the court as an electoral prize, pure and simple. In doing so, it places the court in a position of real institutional peril. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/opinion/the-broken-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=40
289,"BOSTON — After President Trump’s election, a wave of furious opposition erupted. It was an emotional mix of denial and anger, the first two stages of grief, and it wasn’t very effective. Yet increasingly that has matured into thoughtful efforts to channel the passion into a movement organized toward results. One example: the wave of phone calls to congressional offices that torpedoed the Republican “health care plan.” Yes, Trump opponents lost the election and we have to recognize that elections have consequences. But if “resistance” has a lefty ring to it, it can also be framed as a patriotic campaign to protect America from someone who we think would damage it. So what are the lessons from resistance movements around the world that have actually succeeded? I’ve been quizzing the experts, starting with Gene Sharp, a scholar here in Boston. Sharp’s works — now in at least 45 languages and available free online — helped the Baltic countries win freedom from Russia, later guided students in bringing democracy to Serbia, and deeply influenced the strategy of Arab Spring protesters. Sharp is THE expert on challenging authoritarians, and orders for his writings have surged since Trump’s election.

This year, the company that typically provides wooden eggs for the event resorted to Twitter to remind members of the Trump family that the deadline for orders was nearing. And the problems seem to have continued. Mr. Kimmel says he thinks he knows why: President Trump assumed the Easter Egg Roll “was a menu item at P. F. Chang’s.” Conan O’Brien piled on, too. Kids these days, they aim high. Too high sometimes, Jimmy Kimmel says.

Trump, who used to be a king of sex scandals, doesn’t have any presidential ones. When the day is done and the moon is high, our chief executive now appears to be moved mainly by the siren song of Fox and Twitter. But nobody’s forgotten those girl-grabbing tapes from the campaign. There’s also currently a grope-related lawsuit. And recently, his sympathetic take on Bill O’Reilly’s multiple sexual harassment problems. Plus, face it: These days we cannot possibly talk about anything without bringing up Donald Trump: chocolate cake, funny dog videos, Easter, professional wrestling, Millard Fillmore.… But first, Governor Bentley. Our story begins in 2014, when he was re-elected by a whopping margin, wearing the image of a kindly family man. However, during the march to victory, his wife recorded her husband having a conversation with campaign aide Rebekah Mason that centered heavily around feeling up Mason’s breasts. And his staff couldn’t help noticing that the governor started calling Mason “baby” during staff meetings. Lots and lots of incidents later, Mrs. Bentley filed for divorce after 50 years of marriage. She also gave investigators a ton of love texts — thanks to what appeared to be a certain technological ineptitude on the part of her husband. (They included the immortal “Bless our hearts.

s we took a seat in the back of the Commissary, a restaurant on the Sony Pictures Studios lot, Mike Judge pointed out a man seated two booths away. It was Tom Rothman, the chairman of Sony Pictures and former head of Fox’s film division, where he oversaw the rocky release of Judge’s 2006 film, “Idiocracy.” The movie imagined America 500 years in the future, populated and ruled by absolute morons, its infrastructure crumbling, its cities piled high with trash, everyone anesthetized by impossibly stupid television like the hit show “Ow! My Balls!” Though the film finished shooting in 2004, the studio mothballed it for more than a year. When “Idiocracy” was finally released, it wasn’t screened for critics or promoted in any other way — there wasn’t even a trailer — and it was shown in only seven cities, New York not among them. The studio, it seemed, was fulfilling the bare minimum of its contractual obligations, as if hoping that the movie would just go away. I asked Judge about a rumor that surrounds the film: that Fox spiked it because it lampooned so many of Fox’s advertisers, not to mention Fox News itself. (Its anchors, in the film, look as if they just walked in from a porn set.) Judge explained that, actually, the movie had tested abysmally with audiences. And because his first live-action film, “Office Space,” had become a hit despite initially bombing, Fox figured it might as well not bother with much marketing — that the movie would take off on its own or recoup its budget in the home-video market. But he’d heard the other version of the story too. As if on cue, Rothman approached our table, wearing glasses and a pinkish Oxford, carrying an antique lacrosse stick with a tennis ball in the basket, cradling it back and forth as he talked. He was with a friend named Lars Tiffany, who was wearing a Virginia Lacrosse shirt and, as a matter of fact, had recently been installed as the head coach of men’s lacrosse at the University of Virginia, and had taken his team to the studio to meet Rothman. “This is Mike Judge himself,” Rothman said to Tiffany. Then Judge introduced me to Rothman, explaining that I was from The Times: “Be careful what you say.” “You’re doing a profile of Mike?” Rothman asked, beaming with excitement, which seemed to be his default mode. “You can’t possibly do a profile of Mike without talking to me! About his [expletive] movie career! Goddamn right! ‘Office Space’! ‘Office Space’ and ‘Idiocracy’!” Judge, who speaks so softly I often found myself nudging my recorder closer to him, was beginning to tell Rothman that we had just been talking about “Idiocracy” when Rothman started up again. “O.K., so lemme just say, I’ll give you the simple answer: ‘Office Space’ is to his credit, and ‘Idiocracy’ is entirely my fault.” He turned to Judge. “Right?” “I agree,” Judge said. “He was [expletive] ahead of his time. As always. As always.” “I should’ve made it 10 years later and set in the present.” Rothman turned to me. “He had it. You’re gonna see it. How absolutely. Terri-fy-ingly. Prescient it is.” He was picking up momentum. “Right now? ‘Idiocracy’? One of the great documentaries of our era!” he said, physically punctuating his point in such a way that he managed to thump a diner sitting behind him with the lacrosse stick.

296,"In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Adam Kirsch and Liesl Schillinger discuss the art yielded by populist and elite mind-sets. Adam Kirsch The division between ‘real Americans’ and ‘coastal elites’ seems to be deepening into an abyss. The question of whether literature can, or ought to, appeal to a wide audience is one that tends to become urgent in times of political crisis. When a whole civilization is in danger, it is natural to feel that all hands are needed on deck, fighting in defense of cherished values. And how can an undemocratic art be enlisted in the cause of democracy? Isn’t it vital to appeal to the whole people, rather than just a few highbrows? No wonder these issues are beginning to be raised again in the age of Trump, as the division between “real Americans” and “coastal elites” seems to be deepening into an abyss. The last time this debate dominated American letters was the 1930s, when the Depression at home and the rise of fascism in Europe led most literary people to positions on the left. The question that divided them was whether political virtue meant writing about and for “the people” — as followers of the Popular Front, a Communist-inspired coalition of left groups, believed — or whether the most radical and progressive work was necessarily too difficult for mass consumption. The critic Lionel Trilling complained about the average liberal’s assumption that “wit, and flexibility of mind, and perception, and knowledge were to be equated with aristocracy and political reaction, while dullness and stupidity must naturally suggest a virtuous democracy.” The truth is, however, that few writers ever make a conscious choice between elitism and populism, difficulty and accessibility. Writers write as their minds and fates compel them to: Virginia Woolf could not have written a populist epic like “The Grapes of Wrath” any more than John Steinbeck could have written a modernist study like “To the Lighthouse.” The same holds true for writers who are classed as nonliterary, authors of genre best sellers. I would wager that even the most commercial writers seldom produce work cynically, according to a formula. Rather, they write as they can and must, and their talent happens to be of a kind that produces best sellers.

297,"Updated, 7:56 a.m. Good morning on this grade-A Thursday. With Hillary Clinton standing by his side yesterday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law a first-of-its-kind program providing free tuition to students at public colleges and universities in New York State. But it’s more complicated than it sounds, and it comes with caveats. We checked in with David W. Chen, a New York Times investigative reporter who has been covering the free-tuition plan, called the Excelsior Scholarship, to understand how it will work. How free is free tuition? It’s actually not. Excelsior would fill in the gaps of costs not covered by financial aid, Mr. Chen said. It would need to be added on top of other scholarships and grants to make college free. For students who are not receiving any other financial aid — those who are making too much money to qualify for need-based support — Excelsior would help even more. “It’s primarily aimed at middle-class families,” Mr. Chen said, “and the governor has been clear about that from the beginning.” How much would a family pay after the scholarship? The total cost — tuition, fees, and room and board — for four years at a State University of New York college is about $83,000 — roughly $21,000 per year or $10,000 per semester. This program would pay about $26,000. Families would still need to shoulder nearly $60,000 to send a student to college.

The political, social and even medical consequences of this recession have been duly noted, but even so the depths of its effects are only now becoming clear. One we’re still learning more about is how the rural, less populated regions of the country (known among demographers as nonmetropolitan counties), which already suffered from higher than average poverty rates, recovered from the recession at a far slower pace than more populous metropolitan counties. The fact that people living outside big cities were battered so acutely by the recession goes a long way toward explaining President Trump’s victory in the last election. In Luzerne County, in northeast Pennsylvania, population 316,383 and falling, the unemployment rate in February 2017 was 6.7 percent, substantially higher than it had been at the start of the recession (it was at 4.6 percent in October 2007).
