If we could gain a deeper sense of what it’s like to be somebody different from us — from a different part of the world, from the other side of the tracks, with a different skin color, religion or gender — would we become more generous, understanding or compassionate people? Can empathy help bridge the divides that fracture us as a nation and world? In this Text to Text, Jennifer Finney Boylan’s personal essay “Bring Moral Imagination Back in Style” and Nicholas Kristof’s Op-Ed “How Do We Increase Empathy?” take on those questions. Both pieces acknowledge that while learning to feel empathy may be challenging, it is a skill worth nurturing. _________ Background To become stronger, better, faster and more competitive athletes, we need to work out and practice. We need to exercise. We need to stretch, sweat and push our way out of our comfort zones to achieve a higher level of skill and performance. But what about the muscles needed to be an empathetically fit human being? How do we exercise those? And how do we create opportunities for greater compassion and empathy in our world?

1,"Seven environmental activists who climbed a crane near the White House early Wednesday morning in a protest against the policies of President Trump were arrested and charged, the police said on Thursday. The protesters, who volunteer for Greenpeace, began scaling the approximately 300-foot crane around 4 in the morning, and once they reached the top, unfurled a 70-by-35-foot banner embossed with a single word: “RESIST.” Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, the environmental advocacy organization, said the protesters were there “to resist the environmental, economic and racial injustice that Trump and his administration have already laid out and put into practice.” Mr. Nichols said they wanted to be sure that the banner would be visible from the White House. “Obviously, I have no idea if Trump has seen it, but that would be great if he did,” he said. In his first week in office, Mr. Trump’s administration instructed officials at the Environmental Protection Agency to freeze grants and contracts, and, according to Reuters, ordered the agency to remove the climate change page from its website. Mr. Trump has also resurrected the Keystone and Dakota Access pipeline projects that have been the subject of virulent protests by environmental activists. The Metropolitan Police Department said the protest led to street closings near the White House and snarled traffic. The seven protesters were arrested and charged with second-degree burglary, unlawful entry and destruction of property, according to a police statement, UPI reported. The crane, owned by Miller and Long D.C., is parked at a construction site three blocks north of the White House, Mr. Nichols said. The activists unfurled the banner about 9 a.m., he said. By 1 p.m., they began their descent, and reached ground after 10 p.m., when they were detained, the police said. The White House did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment. “I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist, I believe in it,” Mr. Trump said in a meeting with auto industry executives on Tuesday. “But it’s out of control.” Almost all mention of climate change has been removed from the White House website.

2,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday began a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ordering the immediate construction of a border wall with Mexico and aggressive efforts to find and deport unauthorized immigrants. He planned additional actions to cut back on legal immigration, including barring Syrian refugees from entering the United States. At the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Trump signed a pair of executive orders that paved the way for a border wall and called for a newly expanded force to sweep up immigrants who are in the country illegally. He revived programs that allow the federal government to work with local and state law enforcement agencies to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and to share information to help track and deport them. He also planned to clamp down on legal immigration in another action expected as early as Thursday. An eight-page draft of that executive order, obtained by The New York Times, would indefinitely block Syrian refugees from entering the United States and bar all refugees from the rest of the world for at least 120 days. When the refugee program resumes, it would be much smaller, with the total number of refugees resettled in the United States this year more than halved, to 50,000 from 110,000. It would also suspend any immigration for at least 30 days from a number of predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — while the government toughened its already stringent screening procedures to weed out potential terrorists. White House officials declined to comment on the coming plan, but in a wide-ranging interview that aired Wednesday on ABC, Mr. Trump acknowledged that it aimed to erect formidable barriers for those seeking refuge in the United States.

3,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing executive orders that would clear the way to drastically reduce the United States’ role in the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as begin a process to review and potentially abrogate certain forms of multilateral treaties. The first of the two draft orders, titled “Auditing and Reducing U.S. Funding of International Organizations” and obtained by The New York Times, calls for terminating funding for any United Nations agency or other international body that meets any one of several criteria. Those criteria include organizations that give full membership to the Palestinian Authority or Palestine Liberation Organization, or support programs that fund abortion or any activity that circumvents sanctions against Iran or North Korea. The draft order also calls for terminating funding for any organization that “is controlled or substantially influenced by any state that sponsors terrorism” or is blamed for the persecution of marginalized groups or any other systematic violation of human rights. The order calls for then enacting “at least a 40 percent overall decrease” in remaining United States funding toward international organizations. The order establishes a committee to recommend where those funding cuts should be made. It asks the committee to look specifically at United States funding for peacekeeping operations; the International Criminal Court; development aid to countries that “oppose important United States policies”; and the United Nations Population Fund, which oversees maternal and reproductive health programs.

6,"President Trump may stumble on an unexpected obstacle as he tries to build a wall along the Mexican border: Antonin Scalia. This may seem surprising, considering that Mr. Trump has called him a “great” justice. But in one of his last opinions, Justice Scalia supplied a powerful weapon to resist Mr. Trump’s plans for a border wall. Justice Scalia’s June 2015 opinion in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency may not seem helpful at first sight. It blocked an E.P.A. rule that would have limited mercury emissions from power plants. The Clean Air Act instructs the E.P.A. to issue “appropriate and necessary” regulations, and Justice Scalia said that language required the E.P.A. to consider the costs of its proposed rules, which it did not properly do. “No regulation is ‘appropriate’ if it does significantly more harm than good,” Justice Scalia wrote. And even though the final vote in the case was 5-4, all nine members of the court agreed that the E.P.A. could not ignore the costs of its actions when deciding whether or how stringently to regulate. Why is Justice Scalia’s opinion an obstacle to President Trump’s wall-building plans? Mr. Trump is reported to be planning to rely on a law called the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as a source of statutory authority for the wall — apparently to avoid asking Congress to pass a new statute, which could be filibustered by Senate Democrats. But the 2006 law authorizes the secretary of homeland security only to take actions to secure the border that are “necessary and appropriate.” These are the same words (in the opposite order) the Supreme Court interpreted in Michigan v. E.P.A. As Justice Scalia said, it would not be “appropriate” to “impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars” in benefits. President Trump’s proposed wall would certainly cost billions of dollars: He says $8 billion, while more realistic estimates put the price tag at $15 billion to $25 billion (and $500 million per year for upkeep).

8,"On the same day that the Trump Organization announced its appointment of two ethics monitors to advise on potential conflicts of interest, it faced a new ethical quandary: Is it right to double the price of the initiation fee at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump family’s private club in Florida, or would that be seen as cashing in on President Trump’s arrival in the White House? The question emerged after Bernd Lembcke, the managing director of the 118-room club in Palm Beach, Fla. — which Mr. Trump recently labeled the Winter White House — confirmed on Wednesday that the price of new memberships had increased to $200,000 from $100,000, and that applications had surged since Mr. Trump won the election in November. Mr. Lembcke’s acknowledgment came hours after the Trump Organization announced that it had named Bobby Burchfield, a longtime Republican Party lawyer and corporate litigator, as an “independent ethics adviser.” The Trump Organization pointed to the move as a sign of its commitment to addressing questions about potential conflicts of interest. “We take our role and the responsibility we have to our company, and our thousands of employees, very seriously,” Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said in a statement announcing the appointment of Mr. Burchfield. But Robert Weissman, the president of the government ethics watchdog group Public Citizen, said the selection of Mr. Burchfield and the decision to double the Mar-a-Lago initiation fee demonstrated that the Trump Organization was unprepared to confront the ethics challenges it now faces. “At the minimum, this creates the appearance of cashing in on the presidency and selling direct personal access to the president,” Mr. Weissman said of the new Mar-a-Lago fee. “It is unacceptable. And it demeans the office of the presidency.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/mar-a-lago-membership-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=81

10,"WASHINGTON — With Twitter posts, leaks and executive orders, President Trump is moving quickly to show he will make good on some of his key campaign pledges. Within a 24-hour period this week, he ordered or signaled significant new policies on border security, terrorism, crime and voting. But as Mr. Trump’s predecessor learned in 2009 when he ordered the military prison at Guantánamo Bay closed, implementing policy is not as easy as the stroke of a pen. Details to carry out security policies exceed Twitter’s 140-character limit and in some cases the public can only infer Mr. Trump’s plans. Here is what he has promised, and what authority he has to carry it out. No political promise came to symbolize Mr. Trump’s candidacy like his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The costs and logistical headaches of such a project — which would cut through private property — have always been daunting, but Mr. Trump’s supporters were unfazed: “Build the wall!” they chanted. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an order to build it and announced that work would begin immediately on a project that is estimated to cost more than $20 billion.

11,"WASHINGTON — It contained crossed-out phrases and typos. It said that the Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2011, rather than a decade earlier. It was clearly not meant for public consumption. But the draft of a Trump administration executive order that spilled into public view early Wednesday — a document that raised the prospect of reviving C.I.A. “black site” prisons like those where terrorism suspects were once detained and tortured — has the potential to further fracture a national security team already divided over one of the most controversial policies of the post-9/11 era. The White House disclaimed the document, which was leaked to The New York Times and other news organizations, but three administration officials said the White House had circulated it among National Security Council staff members for review on Tuesday morning. And many of its proposals — which also include halting transfers out of the Guantánamo Bay prison and sending new detainees there, which President Barack Obama refused to do — echo years of Republican national security policy and President Trump’s own speeches. But Mr. Trump’s most extreme campaign proposal for terrorism suspects — bringing back torture, which the draft order does not call for but hovers over in its direction to review reinstating a C.I.A. interrogation program — has been disavowed by senior members of his team, most notably Defense Secretary James N. Mattis. Mr. Mattis has long opposed some of the aggressive interrogation methods used during President George W. Bush’s administration, and in his recent confirmation hearing, he said that the military should use only interrogation methods contained in the Army Field Manuals. At a Democratic caucus retreat on Wednesday, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told colleagues that both Mr. Mattis and Mike Pompeo, the newly installed C.I.A. director, had told him they had no knowledge of the draft order before it became public, according to another senator present at the retreat.

12,"President Trump on Wednesday unveiled the first proposals to make good on his promise to make America impenetrable to unauthorized immigrants and intolerable for those who are already here. As expected, he promised to begin building a wall along the Mexican border, an enterprise that is far from certain because Congress would have to approve billions of dollars in funding. He also outlined a series of ominous regulatory changes aimed at drastically expanding the detention of immigrants who enter without permission. He is also seeking to turn more local police and corrections officials into enforcers of immigration law, while threatening to withhold funding from jurisdictions that have sensibly refused to assume that role. The steps outlined in two executive orders set the stage for incarcerating thousands of immigrants who do not represent a threat, for widespread civil rights violations and for racial profiling. At the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that immigration laws “will be enforced and enforced strongly.” Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant talk worked well on the campaign trail, as he convinced struggling Americans that foreigners were to blame for lost jobs and blighted communities. To carry out his promise of ramped-up immigration enforcement and border security, he will need to convince Congress and American taxpayers that spending billions to execute his plan is a worthy investment. As is so often the case with Mr. Trump, the facts are not on his side. Illegal immigration to the United States has been on a downward trend in recent years, even as spending on border security has soared. Between 1983 and 2006, an average of 1.2 million people a year were apprehended trying to enter the country unlawfully. In 2016, just over 415,000 were caught trying to enter; most were Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty. Meanwhile, border security funding has increased from $263 million in 1990 to $3.8 billion in 2015.

13,"Goldman Sachs has rewarded its departing president, Gary D. Cohn, with expedited access to cash and stock payments valued at nearly $300 million, and in doing so has tacitly encouraged another of its executives to accept an influential role in Washington. Late on Tuesday, Mr. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council advising President Trump, disclosed in a securities filing that he and his family members had received ownership that day of 940,908 shares of Goldman stock — a position valued at nearly $220 million. That award came in addition to a cash payout, announced the same day, amounting to about $65 million, leaving him with a total windfall of about $285 million. Given that Mr. Cohn, 56, is required to divest his Goldman shares under federal ethics laws, “we took these actions to enable him to comply with the conflict of interest rules, just as we have done for people in the de Blasio administration,” said Jake Siewert, a company spokesman, referring to the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. Under a standing policy, Mr. Siewert added, Goldman allows departing employees who are entering government service to keep their stock. In recent weeks, someone familiar with Mr. Cohn’s financial plans said, he made substantial donations to various charities in preparation for his new job, and he is poised to sell at least some of his Goldman shares. He is drawing no salary for his work at the White House, the person added. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Goldman’s acceleration of its usual curbs on the eligibility of Mr. Cohn’s stock for sale has revived a debate over whether veterans of the firm who enter public service receive special treatment from the firm — or whether the firm receives such treatment from former employees in government. Some experts on government ethics said Goldman’s treatment of Mr. Cohn smacked of favoritism. “They’re playing a game, and they’re playing a game to make this person feel beholden to Goldman Sachs,” said Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Painter was among lawyers who recently sued Mr. Trump, accusing him of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump called the suit meritless. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-gary-cohn-285-million-departure-package.html?searchResultPosition=86

15,"An autocratic leader has won the vote. He has charm, yes, and smarts of a kind, but also a cruel streak. Beatings are frequent, and assassination — foreign and domestic — has become commonplace. His cultural pronouncements have had a chilling effect on the arts, theater in particular. Take your seat for “Evening at the Talk House,” an ultra-dark comedy by the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn (“The Designated Mourner,” “Aunt Dan and Lemon”) for the New Group that begins performances at the Signature Center on Tuesday, Jan. 31. Though written years before Donald J. Trump announced his candidacy, and first produced in London in the fall of 2015, the play may strike some as oddly prescient. Set in the course of one night, it eavesdrops on several people who worked together on “Midnight in a Clearing With Moon and Stars,” a fictitious flop from a decade ago. They have gathered for a reunion at a rundown club. As they snack and sip and reminisce, they reveal the brutality of the world outside and the ways that artists can abet it, resist it and ignore it. The London production stoked controversy, with The Independent approvingly describing a “disturbing, balefully hilarious new play,” while many other critics attacked its tone, pace and politics. More than a year later, in the wake of Brexit and the presidential election, that controversy is likely to resonate anew. On the morning of President Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Shawn, who also appears in the play, the director Scott Elliott and the other members of the cast — Matthew Broderick, Jill Eikenberry, John Epperson, Larry Pine, Claudia Shear, Annapurna Sriram and Michael Tucker — gathered at a rehearsal space to discuss drama as protest and whether or not to invite the president. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  Is this a political play? MICHAEL TUCKER Yes. It’s other things, too. But it’s most certainly political.

16,"New Jersey wants a railroad tunnel under the Hudson River, California wants high-speed rail linking north and south, Florida wants improved seaports, and most everyone wants highways and bridges. President Trump and congressional Democrats have proposed trillion-dollar infrastructure spending sprees, and among their most ardent allies are the nation’s governors, Republicans and Democrats, who cite years of pent-up demand for fixing or expanding old assets and building new ones. “Every single governor in this nation has roads, bridges, tunnels and airports, and we want to work together, because we need to replace them, and we need to repair them,” Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a Democrat, said on Wednesday at a National Governors Association meeting in Washington. Last month, the Trump transition team asked the governors association to collect wish lists from the states, with an emphasis on “shovel ready” projects that are far enough along in engineering, approval and even construction to begin using the money quickly, and those that enhance national security and economic competitiveness, especially in manufacturing. The president has expressed a preference for partnerships between government and private industry, used in projects like toll roads that can attract private investors with a steady stream of revenue. Forty states and some territories have submitted lists, containing more than 300 projects, to the governors association. The group declined to make the lists public, but several states were willing to describe their submissions. The Trump team drafted a list, first reported by the McClatchy newspapers, of 50 big items that it planned to consider. Though preliminary, the list gives an idea of the scale and range of ideas the administration is looking for. It includes long-discussed projects like digging the Hudson tunnel, replacing or repairing dilapidated bridges and highways, replacing outdated river locks that hinder commercial barge traffic, fixing old dams, building rail lines and airports, and creating a satellite-guided air traffic control system. It also contains newer plans like modernizing the electricity grid and storing water underground in arid areas.

17,"WASHINGTON — On Monday, President Trump gathered House and Senate leaders in the State Dining Room for a get-to-know-you reception, served them tiny meatballs and pigs-in-a-blanket, and quickly launched into a story meant to illustrate what he believes to be rampant, unchecked voter fraud. Mr. Trump kicked off the meeting, participants said, by retelling his debunked claim that he would have won the popular vote if not for the three million to five million ballots cast by “illegals.” He followed it up with a Twitter post early Wednesday calling for a major investigation into voter fraud. When one of the Democrats protested, Mr. Trump said he was told a story by “the very famous golfer, Bernhard Langer,” whom he described as a friend, according to three staff members who were in the room for the meeting. In the emerging Trump era, the story was a memorable example, for the legislators and the country, of how an off-the-cuff yarn — unverifiable and of confusing origin — became a prime policy mover for a president whose fact-gathering owes more to the oral tradition than the written word. The three witnesses recalled Mr. Langer being the protagonist of the story, although a White House official claimed the president had been telling a story relayed to the golfer by one of Mr. Langer’s friends. The witnesses described the story this way: Mr. Langer, a 59-year-old native of Bavaria, Germany — a winner of the Masters twice and of more than 100 events on major professional golf tours around the world — was standing in line at a polling place near his home in Florida on Election Day, the president explained, when an official informed Mr. Langer he would not be able to vote.

20,"“La La Land” reigns triumphant, Mel Gibson’s arc of redemption is complete, Amy Adams’s snub has a silver lining, and, most notably of all, a record number of black artists — across multiple categories — received Oscar nominations this year. That, very roughly, is the lay of the land this awards season, now that the Oscar nominations have been announced. So let’s delve in, getting the biggest categories and surprises out of the way before heading to the broader story behind this year’s list of finalists. If it wasn’t official before — and it pretty much was — “La La Land” is poised to sail smoothly on to a best picture win, having nabbed 14 nominations, tying the previous record holders and best picture winners “All About Eve” (1950) and “Titanic” (1997). Emma Stone, a star of “La La Land,” has the edge for best actress; Casey Affleck appears on track for best actor for “Manchester by the Sea”; Mahershala Ali of “Moonlight” remains a favorite for the best supporting actor statuette; and the same goes for Viola Davis, for supporting actress for her role in “Fences.” In the category of best comeback, Mr. Gibson is the hands-down winner. Long on the outs in Hollywood for his drunken anti-Semitic and misogynist rants, Mr. Gibson, now sober (for 10 years, he says) and repentant, has found himself back in Tinseltown’s warm embrace: The World War II feature he directed, “Hacksaw Ridge,” landed six nominations, including one for best director. It could be argued that once you’re in Hollywood, you’re in, so long as you repent, which helps explain the woes of Nate Parker, whose ill-starred “The Birth of a Nation” was supposed to be his entry. Meanwhile, the best actress category, probably the most competitive of the season, held the biggest surprises and snubs. For reasons that remain inexplicable to the Bagger, Annette Bening failed to land a nomination for her nuanced, heartfelt performance in “20th Century Women.” But in a heartening turn, Ruth Negga did, for her lead role in “Loving,” the quiet, true-story film that was otherwise overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other prize givers, this year.

21,"LONDON — When Nicola Thorp reported to work awhile back as a temporary receptionist in the financial center here, she was shocked when her temp supervisor said her flat shoes were unacceptable. She would need to get herself shoes with heels at least two inches high. When she refused, she was sent home from the accounting firm PwC without pay. But that was not the end of it. Five months later, Ms. Thorp, an actress originally from the northern seaside city of Blackpool, started a petition calling for a law that would make sure no company could ever again demand that a woman wear heels to work. The petition garnered more than 150,000 signatures, helped spur a popular backlash — dozens of professional women posted photographs of themselves on Twitter defiantly wearing flats — and prompted an inquiry overseen by two parliamentary committees. On Wednesday, more than two years after Ms. Thorp, now 28, strode into that office in her chic but sensible black flats, the committees released a report concluding that Portico, the outsourcing firm that had insisted she wear high heels, had broken the law. It added that existing law needed to be toughened to overcome outmoded and sexist workplace codes. During the investigation, the committees received hundreds of complaints from women whose companies had demanded that they “dye their hair blonde,” “wear revealing outfits” or “constantly reapply makeup.” “Discriminatory dress codes remain widespread,” the report said. Ms. Thorp lauded the inquiry’s conclusion, saying it was all the more imperative in the Trump era, when men around the world had a role model in the White House who had boasted about behaving badly toward women.

But in an industry that lives and dies by the power (seen and unseen) of sums in all their varieties, that the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 20,000 on Wednesday was enough to give even the most hardened stock market watchers reason to smile. The Dow finished the day at 20,068.51. “It blows me away,” said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. “I can remember when people wondered if we would ever get through Dow 1,000. It’s amazing — we are up 20-fold in my career.” And that is a big deal, Mr. Paulsen explained, because it means that for all the worry and doubts that have sprung from the market collapses in 1987, 2000 and 2008, if investors just held to a core portfolio of large American stocks they would have done pretty well. Of course, the usual caveats apply. In percentage terms, the Dow going from 10,000 (which it hit in March 1999) to 20,000 is less meaningful than the journey from 1,000, which it reached in 1972. It is also true that the Dow represents just 30 companies — including stalwarts like Goldman Sachs, Apple and Walmart — compared with the 500 that make up the Standard & Poor’s index or the 2,000 of the Russell market tracker. And in today’s E.T.F.-driven marketplace, where indexes of every stripe are used to entice investors looking for cheap and predictable returns, the Dow as an index for exchange-traded funds has been more or less ignored, compared withfunds that follow the S.&P. 500 and Russell 2000.

24,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites. On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online. In a blog post, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense advertising network near the end of last year, after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from its online ad service. On the same day, Facebook introduced changes to its Trending Topics feature — a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information — to better promote reliable news articles. Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Google’s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebook’s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users. “We genuinely asked Google and Facebook for ‘moonshots,’” said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. “We appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, that’s hardly even running in place.” Google and Facebook have been in something of a no-win situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles.

26,"OTTAWA — If there is such a thing as unwelcome good news, President Trump may have handed some to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on Tuesday when he revived a cross-border oil pipeline project. The move is likely to complicate a delicate balancing act Mr. Trudeau has been trying to keep up: He has long maintained that Canada needs to develop its energy industry, but he also stands for aggressively cutting the country’s carbon emissions. The pipeline, known as Keystone XL, is meant to help carry crude oil from the oil sands of Alberta to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. The Obama administration blocked the project for environmental reasons — and in doing so, spared Mr. Trudeau from having to reckon with the consequences of building it. Now, Mr. Trump has put Keystone XL back on the table, and with it the prospect of significantly increased oil production and carbon emissions, upending Canada’s climate calculus. Mr. Trudeau has been trying to avoid taking the path of his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, whose energy policies as prime minister in the 1980s deeply soiled the family name among Albertans. The elder Mr. Trudeau imposed extra taxes and royalties along with price controls that angered the province’s oil industry. The younger Mr. Trudeau spoke up swiftly on Tuesday, welcoming Mr. Trump’s action. And the Canadian leader’s public support for the energy industry has helped him sell his national carbon-pricing program in the province — a program that polls strongly in areas away from the oil patch, especially Ontario and British Columbia. But now people on all sides are angry at him. Along with a decision in late November to approve two other pipeline projects, Mr. Trudeau’s welcome of the Keystone XL revival has alienated many environmentalists in Canada, and has also strained his relations with some indigenous communities affected by the pipelines. And hours after Mr. Trump’s move was announced, Mr. Trudeau found himself in a heated public exchange in Calgary, Alberta, with a supporter of the oil sands.

28,"President Trump has carried his Twitter habit into his presidency. He has also brought with him another tech habit that is causing concern. Mr. Trump has been using his old, unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week. The president’s desire to use his old, personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats. He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter, not to make calls. But it’s unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter requires a connection to the internet, which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like two-factor authentication — a password and a code texted to a phone, for example — are not in place. If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure Wi-Fi network, he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device. “The absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats,” said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee. “It would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted.” Among the concerns by security experts: ■ It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking. ■ The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured Wi-Fi and cellular networks, such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House. ■ Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone. ■ Stingray devices, a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement, can track a device’s location and other information. “There are a lot of questions, but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems — and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. The president’s use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state. In 2009, President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone; though he won, the use of a White House-issued secure device came with many rules. “As president, he is the biggest sitting target in the world,” said Kevin Bankston, the director of New America’s Open Technology Institute.

29,"Words matter. And from the moment he became president, Donald J. Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication. Words about the dishonest media, the end of Obamacare, the construction of that border wall with Mexico — this is an abbreviated list, and he hasn’t even completed his first week in office. Amid the verbal deluge, President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy. Not to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president’s assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally. But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it. This will be a recurring challenge, given President Trump’s habit of speaking in sales-pitch hyperbole and his tendency to deride any less-than-flattering report as “fake news.” The words needed to be exactly right. “And the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth,” said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. “They’re ‘baseless,’ they’re ‘bogus,’ they’re ‘lies,’ they’re ‘untruths.’” Rarely are these words, each with its own nuance, applied directly to something said by a president, though others have also dissembled (like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern). “This is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country,” said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “We have an administration that seems to be asserting a right to its own facts and doesn’t seem to be able to produce evidence to back those claims.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/business/media/donald-trump-lie-media.html?searchResultPosition=90

From some corners of the city, the post from Mr. Trump brought indignation. “He meant locking up more black and brown folks,” said Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, addressing the City Council here on Wednesday morning. “Just like Republicans, just like right-wingers have always done.” It brought provocations. “You want to send in the feds, that’s fine,” Ja’Mal Green, an activist on the South Side, said in an interview. “Send them in to investigate all the corruption in this city. Send federal dollars to put into economic development, to put into our schools.” And there was some confusion. “The statement is so broad,” Eddie Johnson, the police superintendent, told The Chicago Tribune. “I have no idea what he’s talking about.” Whatever Mr. Trump’s intention, his message put the city on the defensive once again for its escalating problem of gun violence, which has been mostly concentrated in neighborhoods on the West and South Sides. Just this month, 239 people were shot, 40 of them fatally, a police spokesman said Wednesday. In the same period last year, 227 people were shot, 33 fatally. In 2016, there were at least 762 homicides in Chicago, the highest number in two decades, though the per-capita murder rate remains lower than that of some other major cities, including Baltimore and St. Louis.

The foreboding title of Ann Greene Kelly’s fine solo show at Chapter NY, “May Not Be Private,” comes from a medical form. It inflects the display of four sculptures whose visible debts to Robert Gober’s surreal conflations of objects and Charles LeDray’s miniaturization of the everyday are balanced by the artist’s own strange sense of bricolage, scale and mordant allusion. Although she often includes elements made from scratch, Ms. Kelly works in the area of remade ready-mades, meshing intimations of the human body with objects that imply public space or invasive activities. Nodding to the show’s title, that body is not necessarily whole. The show’s best piece may be “Untitled (bricked chair with drain),” which features garden furniture covered and extended with small white bricks that conjure both patio and hospital. Overall, it calls to mind mangled limbs, a geriatric toilet and something used for torture or sex. “Untitled (trashed bed)” centers on a downsized mattress embedded with a carved-stone drain that is Gober-like — except for its beautifully fluted extension, which can evoke the futilely gripping fingers of someone being dragged out of bed by the feet. Elsewhere, some obviousness creeps in, as with an anti-monument formed by a statue atop a cast-aluminum laundry basket standing in for a disintegrating globe, despite the appeal of the doll-like, carved-alabaster statue itself. Even more simplistic is a relief of a female mannequin torso besieged by bricks. But the show is alive with sculptural inventiveness and material thought, including individualized concrete bases, and it’s enriched by a pair of large colored-pencil drawings in the gallery’s office.

President Obama had every right early in his final year of the presidency to put forth a Supreme Court nominee, picking a mainstream, centrist candidate to whom the Republicans would not even grant a hearing. Yet Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, is already giving up what shred of power the Democrats have by announcing that they will filibuster only nominees out of the legal mainstream, implying that Democrats will confirm a more mainstream Republican nominee. Safeguarding established rights and protections that a majority of Americans value is not playing tit for tat with nominations. It’s not petty.

33,"PHILADELPHIA — President Trump’s decision to build a wall along the length of the United States’ southern border with Mexico erupted into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, leading to the cancellation of a White House visit by Mexico’s president and sharply rising tensions over who would pay for the wall. With the conflict escalating, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a proposal by House Republicans that would impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that the proceeds would be used to pay for the border wall, estimated to cost as much as $20 billion. But a furious uproar prompted Mr. Spicer to temper his earlier remarks, saying the plan was simply “one idea” that might work to finance the wall. Mr. Spicer said it was not the job of the White House to “roll something out” on tax policy, while Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the administration was considering “a buffet of options.” If Mr. Trump does eventually announce his support for the tax plan, it could have a broad impact on the American economy, and its consumers and workers, by sharply increasing the prices of imported goods or reducing profits for the companies that produce them. Other nations could retaliate, prompting a trade war that could hit consumers around the globe. Retail businesses could see their tax bills surge, said David French of the National Retail Federation, who predicted that those costs would be passed on to consumers. He called the idea “very counter to the way consumers are feeling at the moment.” If nothing else, the rapid-fire developments showed Mr. Trump that international diplomacy and a top-to-bottom overhaul of the tax code would not be as easy as an announcement before a campaign microphone. The events unfolded after Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to strengthen the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border.

34,"President Trump will hardly be short of far-right cabinet members, including an education secretary who has called public schools a “dead end,” a labor secretary who has been cited for employment law violations and an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has sued his own department. But within the Trump team, the views of Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, his little-known choice to lead the important Office of Management and Budget, rank as among the most reactionary. Only slivers of this were visible in Mr. Mulvaney’s uneventful confirmation hearing on Tuesday. In fact, Mr. Mulvaney — a founding member of the Freedom Caucus with an almost perfect conservative voting record — spent his six-year congressional career leading the charge against federal spending and borrowing, voting against everything from Hurricane Sandy relief to reopening the government after the 2013 shutdown. His intransigence placed him well to the right of Republican leadership, including former Speaker John Boehner, whom he repeatedly opposed for — get this — being excessively soft on curbing disbursements from the federal purse. Not surprisingly, cutting deeply into core retirement and health care programs is at the top of his to-do list. “We have to end Medicare as we know it,” he said on Fox Business Network, soon after entering Congress in 2011. (Medicare enjoys support from 77 percent of Americans, according to a 2015 Kaiser Foundation poll.) While Mr. Mulvaney is not alone in his terrifying views, the difference between him and other members of his deeply conservative brigade is that he will likely soon have an unusual opportunity to cement them into place; O.M.B.

35,"WASHINGTON — Just days after President Trump spoke of a “running war’’ with the media, his chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, ratcheted up the attacks, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by the election outcome and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview on Wednesday. “I want you to quote this,” Mr. Bannon added. “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.” The scathing assessment — delivered by one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted and influential advisers, in the first days of his presidency — comes at a moment of high tension between the news media and the administration, with skirmishes over the size of Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowd and the president’s false claims that millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants swayed the popular vote against him. Mr. Bannon, who rarely grants interviews to journalists outside of Breitbart News, the provocative right-wing website he ran until August, was echoing comments by Mr. Trump last weekend, when the president said he was in “a running war” with the media and called journalists “among the most dishonest people on earth.” Mr. Bannon’s remarks added to the growing acrimony between the press and a president who made attacks on the media a rallying point of his election campaign. Among Mr. Trump’s advisers in the White House, Mr. Bannon is responsible for putting into action the nationalist vision that Mr. Trump channeled during the later months of the campaign, one that stemmed from Mr. Bannon himself. And in many ways Mr. Trump has acted on that vision during his first week in office — from the description of “American carnage” he laid out in his inauguration speech to a series of executive actions outlining policies on trade agreements, immigration and the building of a border wall.

36,"President Trump had yet to act on plans to stem the flow of refugees and Muslims into the United States, but the nearly 1,000 New Yorkers gathered in Washington Square Park on Wednesday evening wasted no time in protesting whatever was next. Earlier, Mr. Trump had issued executive orders to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico and to withhold federal money from so-called sanctuary cities, which do not cooperate with federal immigration officials in detaining undocumented immigrants who have been arrested on charges unrelated to their immigration status. The crowd made its displeasure on all fronts known: “No ban, no wall,” the protesters cried. And then they engaged in a call and response with an Arabic greeting: “Peace be unto you. And unto you, peace.” The instant opposition extended to New York’s City Hall and the chambers of the State Assembly in Albany. Assemblyman Francisco P. Moya, a Democrat of Queens, proposed a bill Wednesday night that would limit the state’s cooperation with the police in assisting immigration officers who did not have a judge’s warrant to detain immigrants accused of a crime. Among its many provisions, Mr. Trump’s order called for state and local law enforcement agencies to “perform the functions of an immigration officer” in detaining and potentially deporting undocumented immigrants. Mr. Moya’s bill, which had the backing of other Assembly members, would prohibit law enforcement agents from stopping, questioning, investigating or arresting an individual on the basis of a suspected immigration violation. “No state or local law enforcement agency, or agent thereof, shall perform the function of or be cross-designated as a federal immigration officer,” the bill states.

37,"Jack Ma’s Ant Financial has gotten itself an American colony. The $880 million purchase of the remittances firm MoneyGram in a deal announced on Thursday looks like a counterintuitive bet in a de-globalizing world for the Alibaba founder’s financial services arm. International payments are a tough business. But MoneyGram gives Ant a base with connections to many developing markets. Ant piggybacked off the growth of Alibaba, whose Alipay unit received commissions for each transaction it processed over the companies’ marketplaces. In turn, its payments and financial services division helped the Chinese firm expand its e-commerce business. Alipay’s immense popularity at home has allowed it to accumulate 450 million customers. While Ant has wished to expand internationally, complying with differing regulatory regimes and establishing relationships with all the entities in various nations’ payments chains is a complex process. So it initially limited itself to following Chinese tourists around the world, giving them an option to pay at merchants with Alipay. The company is now steadily scaling up its ambitions as it edges toward an initial public offering. Buying MoneyGram helps on a few fronts. The transfer business is less regulated, and it gives Ant a toehold in the developed American market. MoneyGram specializes in sending money from immigrants back to their home countries. Ant has been moving into developing economies as well, having recently made big investments in India and Thailand. Linking MoneyGram with these operations will be a natural step. Remittances have grown in tandem with emigration. Between 2005 and 2015, the global volume of such payments through so-called formal channels grew to $582 billion from $283 billion, according to research by Aite. MoneyGram and the larger Western Union dominate this market. However, digital upstarts like Azimo and PayPal’s Xoom are taking share, with cheaper and more convenient options. That may explain why Ant had to pay only about 12.5 times expected 2017 earnings for its purchase. Ant hopes its digital expertise will help it fend off these challengers. Dealing with regulators is another matter. The United States has steadily increased regulation of the transfer market over the last two decades. Western Union agreed just last week to pay a $586 million fine after admitting to aiding and abetting wire fraud. Ant’s future public owners had better hope Mr. Ma’s recent visit to Trump Tower gave the Chinese billionaire some assurance that the vise is finished tightening.

(Monica Ali reviews “Transit” on this week’s cover.) In both books we travel in Faye’s shoes, but we get to know her in untraditional ways, mostly through her conversations with, and observations of, other people. In a recent email interview, Cusk described the way the novels work as “a process of reverse exposition, where the meaning of oneself seems to have been transferred out into the world.” Faye’s interactions often occur with people she’s meeting for the first time or running into without warning: an ex-boyfriend she encounters on the street; a hair stylist; the moderator of a panel at a literary festival. “Faye’s interlocutors have a very specific function: They need to be readable surfaces rather than characters understood through prior knowledge,” Cusk said. “It can take me a while to find them, but I generally recognize them when I do.” Cusk still plans to end the series with the next novel. And though part of the books’ charm is the way they meander, she has her eye on a relatively pointed conclusion. “I’m writing the third novel at the moment, and I do feel compelled to bring the project to a resolution — to find the answers to my own questions, as it were,” she said. “The third novel interrogates the relationship between suffering and truth, and the notion that one might acquire honor through the experience of emotional pain.

Others give advice about how to build and maintain resistance movements.

Trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional Republicans treated his policy pronouncements — largely out of step with Republican dogma — as essentially a distraction. He would talk. They would drive the policies. But now, the question of whether congressional Republicans would change President Trump or Mr. Trump would change them has an early answer. Mr. Trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on Thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. Republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the Zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in Flint, Mich. They also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that Mr. Trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5,000 more border patrol agents. They have stayed oddly silent as Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from President Barack Obama. Once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, Republicans are now embracing Mr. Trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during Mr. Obama’s second term. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose own website this week still praised the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, now applauds Mr. Trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. Many Republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of Russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, Mr. Trump’s embrace of both. Even on the subject of Mr. Trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, Republicans have often demurred. “The notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

There was little hesitation on the media’s part to publish numerous articles about anything that had to do with Hillary Clinton’s email investigations no matter how unsubstantiated or trivial. Why was there not a similar zeal to reveal investigations with respect to Mr. Trump and his associates? BuzzFeed was not alleging that the information in the dossier was correct; it was reporting the existence of a document that our intelligence agencies thought was important enough that members of Congress as well as President Obama and then President-elect Trump needed to see it. My fear is that the current administration will have a chilling effect on the media. The courage of the media is what makes our democracy strong, and I applaud Ben Smith for his courage. We need a strong media now more than ever. JOAN STOLPEN Princeton, N.J. To the Editor: As someone who could not be more ideologically opposed to the new administration, I find Ben Smith’s justification for publishing the unverified dossier to be woefully insufficient. Since the White House has shown no qualms about creating and defending “alternative facts,” it’s more important than ever for media outlets to act with integrity, particularly those that earn their revenue via “clicks.” That BuzzFeed would choose to publish an unverified report — littered with amateurish errors and written by someone paid to dig up dirt — is at best a distraction and likely has caused real harm to principled journalists working to shed light on actual, proven concerns about the new president. YITZHAK BRONSTEIN Brooklyn To the Editor: Our current president was elected, in part, by people who genuinely believe that President Obama was a Constitution-wrecking Kenyan and Hillary Clinton trafficked in child sex, had people murdered and planned to ban guns, plus countless other patently deranged nontruths. For Ben Smith to pretend that fact-checking is the job of the reader controverts every tenet of journalism. The average reader doesn’t have the time, skills or temperament to fact-check. And critical thinking is clearly another casualty of our times. My first job in publishing was as a fact-checker. I know how hard a job it is, but it’s never been more important. Now isn’t the time to abandon principles. Reality always wins. CAROL KEELEY  Boulder, Colo.

44,"The dystopia described in George Orwell’s nearly 70-year-old novel “1984” suddenly feels all too familiar. A world in which Big Brother (or maybe the National Security Agency) is always listening in, and high-tech devices can eavesdrop in people’s homes. (Hey, Alexa, what’s up?) A world of endless war, where fear and hate are drummed up against foreigners, and movies show boatloads of refugees dying at sea. A world in which the government insists that reality is not “something objective, external, existing in its own right” — but rather, “whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.” “1984” shot to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-seller list this week, after Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to President Trump, described demonstrable falsehoods told by the White House press secretary Sean Spicer — regarding the size of inaugural crowds — as “alternative facts.” It was a phrase chillingly reminiscent, for many readers, of the Ministry of Truth’s efforts in “1984” at “reality control.” To Big Brother and the Party, Orwell wrote, “the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense.” Regardless of the facts, “Big Brother is omnipotent” and “the Party is infallible.” As the novel’s hero, Winston Smith, sees it, the Party “told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears,” and he vows, early in the book, to defend “the obvious” and “the true”: “The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall toward the earth’s center.” Freedom, he reminds himself, “is the freedom to say that two plus two make four,” even though the Party will force him to agree that “TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE” — not unlike the way Mr. Spicer tried to insist that Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd was “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration,” despite data and photographs to the contrary. In “1984,” Orwell created a harrowing picture of a dystopia named Oceania, where the government insists on defining its own reality and where propaganda permeates the lives of people too distracted by rubbishy tabloids (“containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology”) and sex-filled movies to care much about politics or history. News articles and books are rewritten by the Ministry of Truth and facts and dates grow blurry — the past is described as a benighted time that has given way to the Party’s efforts to make Oceania great again (never mind the evidence to the contrary, like grim living conditions and shortages of decent food and clothing). Not surprisingly, “1984” has found a nervous readership in today’s “post-truth” era. It’s an era in which misinformation and fake news have proliferated on the web; Russia is flooding the West with propaganda to affect elections and sow doubts about the democratic process; poisonous tensions among ethnic and religious groups are fanned by right-wing demagogues; and reporters scramble to sort out a cascade of lies and falsehoods told by President Trump and his aides — from false accusations that journalists had invented a rift between him and the intelligence community (when he had compared the intelligence agencies to Nazis) to debunked claims that millions of unauthorized immigrants robbed him of a popular-vote majority. Orwell had been thinking about the novel that would become “1984” as early as 1944, when he wrote a letter about Stalin and Hitler, and “the horrors of emotional nationalism and a tendency to disbelieve in the existence of objective truth because all the facts have to fit in with the words and prophecies of some infallible führer.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/books/why-1984-is-a-2017-must-read.html?searchResultPosition=20
45,"To the Editor: Re “Pledge to Find Election Fraud Few Say Exists” (front page, Jan. 26): Congressional Democrats should welcome with open arms Donald Trump’s call for a voter fraud investigation. True, the president’s view on the subject is delusional, but let the Justice Department once and for all officially determine that virtually no voter fraud exists. That would deprive Republican-controlled state governments from using that false rationale to justify ever more restrictive voter ID laws, which are, in truth, designed to disenfranchise minorities who historically tend to vote Democratic. PETER WORTMANN  New York To the Editor: President Trump is convinced, almost to the point of paranoia, that millions of people illegally voted against him in the presidential election, handing Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote. How does Mr. Trump know that most voted for Mrs. Clinton? Perhaps they favored Mr. Trump, and their illegal votes handed Mr. Trump his narrow Electoral College victory in key swing states. DOUGLAS F. CARLSON San Francisco To the Editor: President Trump has indicated that he will initiate an investigation on massive voter fraud. There are two possible conclusions for such an investigation: 1. There was no massive fraud. In that case our president has been involved once again in either delusion, falsehoods, alternative facts or flat-out lies. 2. There was massive fraud. There is no way to know for whom the fraudulent votes were cast. The November elections would need to be declared null and void and new elections called. CARLOS HOJVAT Arlington, Va.

46,"With a single memorandum, President Trump may well have made it harder for health workers around the world to fight cancer, H.I.V., Zika and Ebola. The memorandum, signed on Monday, reinstates and expands a policy barring health organizations abroad, many of which provide an array of services, from receiving federal funds if they even talk to women about abortion as a method of family planning. The so-called Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, and has since been supported by every Republican president and opposed by every Democratic one; Barack Obama renounced it in 2009. Mr. Trump has not only reinstated it but greatly broadened its impact. In the past, the policy has applied only to international family-planning funds, which currently total around $600 million. Mr. Trump’s memorandum, however, would apply the policy to “global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.” Although reproductive health groups are still studying the memorandum, this language would appear to apply to any international health funding, around $9 billion, used to fight malaria, H.I.V., Zika, Ebola and many other global health threats. This would seem to go well beyond family-planning aid from the Agency for International Development and the State Department, to also include money from all American governmental agencies and departments. Federal funding for abortions abroad has been banned since 1973, except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s life. Mr. Trump’s gag rule goes far beyond the 1973 ban to bar funding to all organizations that provide abortion or abortion referrals, even if they do so with their own funds and even if abortion is not the focus of their work. By cutting off family-planning funds to reproductive health care providers, the gag rule eliminated contraceptive and maternal health services to countless women around the world. After losing funding during the Bush administration, a group known as Family Health Options Kenya had to close six clinics, leaving 9,000 people with little access to health care.

47,"Will President Trump be able to make Mexico pay for his “big, beautiful wall”? Over the course of his campaign he offered a variety of ways to dip into pots of Mexican money. The latest, proposed on Thursday, was a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, which total roughly $300 billion in goods and services. Like other proposals Mr. Trump has floated — impounding remittances of Mexicans working in the United States, or charging Mexicans more for visas — it seems straightforward. But carrying it out would be another matter. For starters, a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement and most likely the rules of the World Trade Organization, which frowns on punitive levies imposed arbitrarily on imports from specific countries. (It is hard to tell from the tangle of announcements from Mr. Trump and his advisers whether they are planning a broad new tax regime that would affect all exports and imports. That, too, would most likely invite challenges at the W.T.O.) Mr. Trump, of course, has also talked about taking the United States out of the global trade accord. But that might seem a bit too drastic just to get Mexico to pay perhaps $20 billion for a wall. It is likely to impose enormous costs on the American and world economies, opening the door for a free-for-all trade war. But if the president did it anyway, the people paying the 20 percent tariff would not be Mexicans, but American consumers. That 2017 Ford Fusion built in Hermosillo, Mexico? It would no longer cost $22,610. It would cost $27,132. So what about the other ideas? The big one Mr. Trump mentioned early on is remittances. Mexico receives about $25 billion a year from Mexicans living abroad, mostly in the United States, in myriad transfers of a few hundred dollars apiece channeled primarily through services like Western Union and MoneyGram.

48,"“You must do something for the children of Syria,” reads the note, scrawled in pencil on white lined paper in childlike handwriting. Seven-year-old Bana al-Abed and her mother, Fatemah, posted an open letter to President Trump on Bana’s Twitter account on Wednesday, sharing the message with the hundreds of thousands of users who follow the account. The page-long letter asks the new president to “please save the children and people of Syria.” Bana first captured global attention when she and her mother created a Twitter account, @AlabedBana, that posted near-daily updates on their life in opposition-held Eastern Aleppo and condemned the government’s role in the violence. The photos and videos from inside the city offered a rare glimpse into life in a war zone, and revealed the struggles faced by a family under siege. Bana and her family are now living in Turkey, after fleeing Aleppo in December. Some, however, have questioned whether Bana actually wrote the Twitter posts herself and if the videos in which she speaks were rehearsed or altered. And supporters of the government of President Bashar al-Assad assailed her as a fraud and a propaganda tool. After her family’s arrival in Turkey, they visited President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara and she was photographed being hugged by Mr. Erdogan. Fatemah told The New York Times that her request to Mr. Trump was a simple one: “Look to the children in Syria like your children.” She said Bana regularly hears news about Mr. Trump and felt it was time to try to get his attention. “Donald Trump is now president. He can do something for the people, especially in conflict zones,” Fatemah said. “And all the world had their opinions about this. And this was our opinion, me and Bana.” Fatemah said the note was intended to urge Mr. Trump to change his stance on Syrian refugees. She wrote it ahead of an expected executive order that would cut the country’s refugee resettlement program and toughen immigration restrictions for people from a number of predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria. Despite Mr. Trump’s repeated remarks on tightening restrictions against Muslims entering the United States, Fatemah said she believed that someday his views may change. “Maybe he will change his mind, I don’t know,” Fatemah said. “But we will keep hoping.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/world/middleeast/bana-al-abed-donald-trump-syria-refugee.html?searchResultPosition=13

When a president demands an investigation of voter fraud, what could go wrong? Based on recent history, a lot. Little more than a decade ago, the Justice Department made investigating and prosecuting voter fraud a major priority. When top prosecutors failed to find the misconduct and refused to make partisan prosecutions, they were fired.

50,"The White House floated an idea on Thursday afternoon that, in initial reports, sounded like a major tariff on Mexican imports — something that would have gone a long way toward unwinding one of the United States’ deepest economic relationships. The reality of what Sean Spicer, the press secretary, suggested is a lot less dramatic. But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code — and how they’re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president’s audacious campaign promises. It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes, trade and diplomacy is in flux. Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump’s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico. A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick, Mr. Spicer said. That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters. Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers, create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border, and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer’s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation. He was pointing out that in an overhaul of taxes that House Republicans are considering, imports from all countries would be taxed at 20 percent while American exports would be tax free. It’s called border adjustment, and it would make the United States corporate tax code more closely resemble the value-added tax that is commonplace in other countries.

51,"LaGRANGE, Ga. — Some people here had never heard about the lynching of Austin Callaway — about how, almost 77 years ago, he was dragged out of a jail cell by a band of masked white men, then shot and left for dead. Some people never forgot. But on Thursday evening, the fatal cruelties inflicted upon Mr. Callaway — long obscured by time, fear, professional malfeasance and a reluctance to investigate the sins of the past — were acknowledged in this city of 31,000 people when LaGrange’s police chief, Louis M. Dekmar, who is white, issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching. “I sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin’s lynching, both through our action and our inaction,” Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally African-American church. “And for that, I’m profoundly sorry. It should never have happened.” He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department “be honest, decent, unbiased and ethical.” “In Austin’s case, and in many like his, those were not the police department values he experienced,” he said. The apology for the Sept. 8, 1940, killing is part of a renewed push across the American South to acknowledge the brutal mob violence that was used to enforce the system of racial segregation after Reconstruction: In a 2015 study, the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala., documented 4,075 of what it called the “racial terror lynchings” of blacks by white mobs in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950.

52,"“Rise,” a new Viceland series about resistance movements in indigenous communities, makes its debut on Friday with a ruinous timeliness. Its first two episodes constitute a feature-length documentary about the protests against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, and they build to the tearful celebrations when it was announced in December that alternative routes would be examined. The second episode ends on the voice of a newscaster wondering what the incoming administration of Donald J. Trump would do about the pipeline. But of course we already know: On Tuesday, President Trump signed an executive order telling the Army Corps of Engineers to review and approve the pipeline “in an expedited manner.” Whatever the future holds, watching “Rise” at this moment is a decidedly melancholy experience. Directed by Michelle Latimer (who is Métis and Algonquin) and reported by Sarain Fox (Anishinabe), both of Canadian indigenous descent, “Rise” is unabashedly on the side of the protesters it embeds with. Ms. Fox is on the scene in May 2016, long before the standoff became national news, when a handful of Sioux were warily eyeing the construction crews across the Missouri River. The episodes contain an absorbing and often artfully filmed account of the opponents’ occupation. The granting of a permit in July to tunnel under the Missouri spurs the growth of the protest camp (to an eventual 10,000 people, many of them nonnative), captured in Woodstock-like images of cars arriving in slow files. Early skirmishes between small groups of protesters and security guards with dogs give way to large-scale battles against uniformed police officers. Unarmed protesters fall to truncheons and rubber bullets. An eerie nighttime scene of water cannons being fired from armored vehicles looks like something out of “Apocalypse Now.” The filmmakers’ ambitions for the Standing Rock episodes were greater than just recounting the standoff, which could have been done quite dramatically in one hourlong episode, and probably should have been. The episodes’ two and a half hours are filled out with history lessons — broken treaties, unresolved land claims and the undeniable legacy of government-sponsored genocide — and discussions of reservation life focused mainly on the effects the Dakota oil boom has had on native women. These sequences are worthy, persuasive, poignant and, in comparison with the story of the protest, familiar and not exactly vital. Information about future installments of “Rise” is scarce. Perhaps the series was rushed on the air to capitalize on the news value of the Standing Rock segments, which were shown recently at the Sundance Film Festival. A third episode available for review takes Ms. Fox to Arizona, where Apache activists are fighting to keep Oak Flat, an area they consider sacred, from being destroyed by an open-pit copper mine. Here a small note of discord is allowed — Ms. Fox talks to a young tribe member who says that money from the mine might be worth more than pride on the destitute reservation.

53,"WASHINGTON — Sensing a political opportunity they have not had in more than a decade, social conservatives are preparing for a lengthy fight over abortion rights that promises to widen the culture war fissures that Republicans have tried for years to bridge. Two fights now loom in Washington that are galvanizing the right as it solidifies control of two branches of government and moves to dominate the third: an effort in Congress to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and President Trump’s forthcoming choice of a Supreme Court nominee. The choice for the court is likely to meet conservatives’ expectations. But fulfilling even a short-term goal of the anti-abortion movement, like defunding Planned Parenthood, will be a longer and more complicated process than it appears, setting up an early and potentially defining test for the new president. Mr. Trump, an eager if improbable combatant in the cause, made bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected and, in turn, won overwhelming support from religious conservatives. Yet those promises are now tangled in intraparty politics and, in some cases at least, will be blocked by Senate Democrats. They include laws that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and permanently prohibit all federal funding, including Medicaid, from paying for abortions. Cutting off Planned Parenthood is part of the larger and messier debate over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans so far have been unable to do. Even if the law is scrapped, there is no guarantee a Planned Parenthood funding ban could easily move forward, given that left-leaning women’s groups will bring intense pressure upon moderate Republicans to vote against it. On the other side of the spectrum among women’s groups is the Susan B. Anthony List, which has been lobbying to gut Planned Parenthood’s funding and is planning to target senators who may be wavering, especially in states where Mr. Trump won.

We are but one week into President Trump’s administration, and already it feels like we are living in “a dystopian nightmare” says the Times columnist Andrew Rosenthal, who spotted nearly omnipresent signs of bad news in President Trump’s efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border, restrict immigration (especially among Muslims), limit access to abortion, reverse course on the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines and reopen C.I.A. “black” sites and reconsider torture. Acknowledging that the week’s bad and most maddening news tend to swirl together, Mr. Rosenthal says that the most maddening thing about President Trump’s first days is the “utter contempt” he has for the public as evidenced by the “string of baldfaced lies” that issue from the White House, particularly from the president’s “propaganda officer,” Kellyanne Conway, and his press secretary, Sean Spicer. “Trump knows that he can say anything he wants, and the right wing media will validate it, and his base won’t challenge it.” (“Here’s a little prediction,” says Mr. Rosenthal. “If things go as badly as I fear they will, in a decade or so, there will be public opinion poll showing that Trump lost in 2016.”) The good news? The obvious good news came in the form of protests held all over the weekend, all over the world, which Mr. Rosenthal says can have a real impact.

And at New York City Ballet, none work harder than the dancers in its lowest rank, the corps de ballet.

But her work onstage did not even begin to capture the stamina required to be in the corps. Spending a week shadowing Ms. Kretzschmar was exhausting — she gave new meaning to the idea of being on your feet all day. Twelve-hour days at the David H.

The International Center of Photography did when it opened its doors in 1974 as a showcase for socially concerned photography, which encompassed photojournalism and so-called street photography. For over 40 years, the center has stayed on mission, even as the technology of picture-making has expanded, and the main street has become the internet. A new exhibition, “Perpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,” reflects those shifts. It’s as committedly topical as anything the center has done, with sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 election. At the same time, it looks different from shows past because digital media — smartphone videos, Twitter outtakes, Instagram feeds — outnumber photographic prints. The embrace of the digital was probably inevitable for the center, an institution that clearly doesn’t want to freeze into a yesterday-museum. But it necessitates a rethinking of old ideas. It requires seeing photography as part of a larger, amorphous category, one morally up for grabs, called visual culture. And it requires recognizing that in the digital present, visual culture does more than reflect reality: For better and for worse, it creates it. For the center, the transition has been bumpy. It started decisively with the 2016 exhibition “Public, Private, Secret,” the institution’s inaugural venture on the Bowery. Some people loathed the show, finding it a meanspirited mess that mixed too many media to no discernible end.

The sparring began Thursday morning when the president of Mexico announced on Twitter that he was canceling his meeting with Mr. Trump next week, rejecting the visit after the new American leader ordered the border wall between the two nations. Having called for dialogue in the face of Mr. Trump’s vows to build a wall during the American presidential campaign, President Enrique Peña Nieto ultimately bowed to public pressure in Mexico to respond more forcefully to his northern neighbor.

63,"Here is an unsolicited idea for Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, that with a little luck he will take to heart, assuming he wants to make his company relevant again: Kick President Donald J. Trump off Twitter. It is not that Mr. Trump appears to have violated any of Twitter’s terms of service, he probably hasn’t. It is not that he doesn’t deserve the same First Amendment protections to express himself as the rest of us, he does. It is not that he is not a popular and frequent user, he is. In fact, he has boffo ratings. Mr. Trump, who has referred to himself as the Ernest Hemingway of the 140-character medium, now has nearly 22 million followers, making him the 57th-most-followed person on Twitter, sandwiched between Conan O’Brien and the Real Madrid soccer team. (You wouldn’t know it, but Barack Obama is the third-most-followed person on Twitter, with 83.4 million followers, right after Justin Bieber.) No, the problem with Mr. Trump and Twitter is painfully obvious: He is reckless, cavalier, condescending, obnoxious, irresponsible and insulting, among other things. With almost any other Twitter user, such behavior could easily be ignored, and would be, making the tweeter in question quickly irrelevant. But, as we all know, Mr. Trump is not an ordinary Twitter user, a fact in which he clearly delights. As the 45th president of the United States, what he says and does on Twitter has enormous consequences. He cannot be ignored. He cannot be shunned. He cannot be publicly shamed. It has come to the point where his tweets have to be taken both literally and seriously. We are used to our presidents getting plenty of media attention on a daily basis, of course. That is a given and has been for decades. And that is as it should be. What our elected leaders say and do is important and newsworthy and deserve plenty of coverage. But Mr. Trump’s often inane tweets, coming deliberately as they do in the early morning hours, have had the unfortunate tendency of warping and dominating nearly every single news cycle, day after day.

66,"WASHINGTON — When President Obama relied heavily on executive orders to push through policies that had no chance in Congress, Republicans called him a dictator who abused his power and disregarded the Constitution. They even took him to court. “We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and laws without going through Congress,” Representative Paul D. Ryan, then the Budget Committee chairman, said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way. Now President Trump, at the start of his tenure, is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives, but to enact new federal policies covering immigration, health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate. And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress. The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach. Their rationale: Mr. Obama took executive action too far, stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda. “We’ve never been against executive action,” said Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, now the House speaker. “We’re against overreaching, illegal action.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-executive-orders.html?searchResultPosition=67

There is a high rate of orphans and a need for extended family for support. There are lots of women as the primary supporters of their children and their extended family. Their biggest need is full-spectrum reproductive health care, including contraceptive and sometimes abortion services, as well as full maternity care. One of the things that is a challenge in the system of reproductive health care is that for many people they don’t necessarily know that they need it until they are faced with an unplanned pregnancy. One of the biggest killers in sub-Saharan Africa is maternal mortality, and lots of these people don’t necessarily know that they need to protect themselves from that. So they aren’t necessarily seeking out contraceptive care until it’s too late — they have an unplanned pregnancy that might affect their life.

So when President Trump and his team began their White House tenure with two whoppers, doubling down on false claims about his inauguration crowd and illegal voting in the election, Republicans on Capitol Hill this week assumed their positions. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, chose to answer a question no one had asked, arguing that voter fraud “does occur” while declining to address Mr. Trump’s assertion that millions of fraudulent votes had cost him the popular vote. Speaker Paul D. Ryan allowed that he had seen no evidence of wide-scale fraud, before retreating into a familiar self-assessment (“I’m a policy guy”) to declare himself above the fray. Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, distinguished himself with the most adorable distraction: He cradled a Boston terrier puppy, stroking her chin, as he greeted reporters eager to ask about Mr. Trump this week in the basement of the Capitol. “Her name is Tilly,” he said, before politely shrugging off questions about Mr. Trump. The first several days of the Trump presidency have reinforced several core truths: He will continue to give voice to conspiracy theories and peddle misinformation. He will not stop obsessing over cosmetic displays of popularity, like crowd size and television ratings.

The meeting was an attempt to create a “European moment” ahead of a slate of Western European elections this year. Marine Le Pen, the president of France’s National Front party and the unofficial leader of the European radical right, declared: “In 2016, the Anglo-Saxon world woke up. In 2017, I am sure that it will be the year of the Continental peoples’ rising up.” On the podium, leaders of parties from Austria, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands tried to create an image of strength and unity, a political force on the brink of reshaping a continent. As Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, said with his characteristic drama (though ominously in German): “Yesterday a new America, today Koblenz and tomorrow a new Europe.” Social and traditional media were, as usual, eager to spread the right wing’s message, referring to a “Populist International” led by Mr. Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin. This united front, many liberals worry, constitutes an existential threat to the world order. Is this fear warranted? The idea of a Populist International, which really amounts to a “Nationalist International,” has long puzzled many analysts, who observe that nationalists, by definition, have a hard time working together. Skeptics seem to be proven right by post-World War II history, which shows a long trail of failed initiatives at nationalist collaboration. The clearest example of the disunity of today’s radical right can be found in the European Parliament, where right-wing parties have been trying to build a strong coalition since the late 1980s. These efforts have largely failed, as member parties got into fights over ideological, personal and strategic issues.

The Reagan-Bush-Bush version covered family planning programs. Trump’s targets global health in general. So when it comes to combating the Zika virus in South America, we’ll only be helping organizations that are willing to order their staffs never to bring up the fact that abortion exists.

The Times this week used the word “lie” in a front-page headline, and I agreed with that decision, but there’s a counterargument that lying requires an intention to deceive — and that Trump may actually believe his absurd falsehoods. So in 2017 we reach a mortifying moment for a great democracy: We must decide whether our 45th president is a liar or a crackpot. Yet the costliest presidential falsehoods and delusions are not the ones that people are talking about, such as those concerning the inauguration crowd or electoral fraud.

It followed the weekend’s stunning women’s marches: At least 3.2 million people apparently participated in all 50 states, amounting to 1 percent of the U.S. population. In a slap at all who marched, Trump this week signed an order that will cut off access to contraception to vast numbers of women, particularly in Africa. It will also curb access to cancer screenings and maybe even undermine vaccination campaigns and efforts against H.I.V. and the Zika virus. The upshot: Thousands of impoverished, vulnerable women will die.

To take it even further, it may be these seemingly smaller infractions that produce the greater injury because the implications are more profound. Trump does not simply have “a running war with the media,” as he so indecorously and disrespectfully spouted off while standing on the hallowed ground before the C.I.A. Memorial Wall. He is in fact having a running war with the truth itself. Donald Trump is a proven liar. He lies often and effortlessly. He lies about the profound and the trivial. He lies to avoid guilt and invite glory. He lies when his pride is injured and when his pomposity is challenged.

78,"Eradicating “radical Islamic terrorism” from the face of the earth has been President Trump’s mantra, first in the campaign, then in his Inaugural Address and remarks a day later to the C.I.A. No one would argue with fighting back against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and other terrorist groups that threaten the United States, Europe, the Middle East and beyond. For eight years, President Barack Obama did just that, using a multilayered approach that included launching thousands of air and drone strikes in at least a half dozen countries and killing countless militants, among them Osama bin Laden. While Mr. Obama made significant progress in degrading this threat — the Islamic State has lost considerable territory in both Iraq and Syria — he did not put an end to violent extremism. Mr. Trump is now pledging to do more and better. The problem is that his approach, as we know it, is more likely to further inflame anti-American sentiment around the world than to make the United States safer. Mr. Trump has not explained how he would destroy the terrorist danger. But his use of slogans like “radical Islam,” which echo the views of his closest advisers, implies a naïve reading of the threat from about 40,000 extremists, while demonizing and alienating many of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims. The emerging details suggest that Mr. Trump’s plans to eradicate violent extremists are not only at odds with Mr. Obama’s; they trample on American values and international law. It was reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump was planning to block Syrians and others from “terror prone” nations from entering the United States, at least temporarily, even though Washington already vets visitors from such countries. While people from Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq would be blocked by a monthlong ban, Mr. Trump appears, inexplicably, to be exempting Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, home of 15 of the 19 extremists who hijacked the planes on Sept. 11. Refugee admissions would be halted for 120 days while screening procedures are reviewed, with the number allowed in cut from 110,000 to 50,000. Another draft executive order would allow the C.I.A. to revive the once-secret program under which terrorism suspects were interrogated in “black site” prisons overseas, which were shut down by Mr. Obama in 2009. The order would also re-examine the use of torture, which was widely condemned in the Bush era and is opposed by Mr. Trump’s own defense secretary. Mr. Trump would also keep open the prison at Guantánamo Bay, which Mr. Obama tried to close, and reportedly is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood, which is involved in Muslim politics in a number of countries, as a terrorist organization. Some experts see the move as a chance for the Trump administration to limit Muslim political activity in the United States. But since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a NATO ally, sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood, such a step would further complicate that fraught alliance.

79,"DAKAR, Senegal — The clinic, tucked discreetly inside the student health center on the University of Dakar campus, prescribes birth control pills, hands out condoms and answers questions about sex that young women are nervous about asking in this conservative Muslim country. The clinic performs no abortions, nor does it discuss the procedure or give advice on where to get one. Senegal, by and large, outlaws abortion. But for other health services like getting contraceptives, said Anne Lancelot, the Sahel director at the organization that runs the clinic, “there is a very high demand.” Now, under a Reagan-era policy revived by President Trump, the clinic may no longer be able to count on aid money from the United States Agency for International Development, part of a ban on providing abortion counseling overseas that could curtail a broad range of health services, including those that go well beyond abortion. Known as the Mexico City policy — and by its critics as the global gag rule — the abortion policy prohibits organizations abroad from using American aid to talk about abortion as a method of family planning. Anti-abortion groups like the Family Research Council have welcomed Mr. Trump’s decision, saying it is consistent with “his campaign promise that he will protect taxpayers from having to pay for abortions.” Direct American aid to carry out abortions was already prohibited, but the rule Mr. Trump revived goes further. It requires not only hospitals or clinics to refrain from providing advice or information on the benefits and availability of abortion. It also requires any international organizations supporting those clinics to stop promoting abortion or advocating abortion rights anywhere in the world — even if they use non-American money to do so. Experts say the rule has cut American aid to groups offering a wide range of services, not just abortion, during previous Republican administrations that have adopted the policy.

82,"There isn’t any evidence to support President Trump’s assertion that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32,000 and 2.8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38,000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. “The high-end estimates are likely incorrect,” Jesse Richman, one of the co-authors of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump’s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It’s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there’s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study’s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don’t answer a question correctly — in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is self-administered. An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren’t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey.

83,"For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos, shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant. The approach involves generating stem cells from a patient’s skin, growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig, and then harvesting it for transplant into the patient’s body. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. The human-organ-growing pigs would be examples of chimeras, animals composed of two different genomes. They would be generated by implanting human stem cells into an early pig embryo, resulting in an animal composed of mixed pig and human cells. One team of biologists, led by Jun Wu and Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute, has shown for the first time that human stem cells can contribute to forming the tissues of a pig, despite the 90 million years of evolution between the two species. Another group, headed by Tomoyuki Yamaguchi and Hideyuki Sato of the University of Tokyo, and Hiromitsu Nakauchi of Stanford, has reversed diabetes in mice by inserting pancreas glands composed of mouse cells that were grown in a rat. The Salk team’s report is published in Thursday’s issue of Cell and the Stanford-Tokyo team’s in Wednesday’s issue of Nature. The two reports together establish the feasibility of trying to grow replacement human organs in animals, though such a goal is still far off.

84,"In the world according to President Trump, the United States and Britain are about to make their special relationship great again. Having cast off decades of global niceties — the United States by putting him in the White House, Britain by voting to leave the European Union — they can now forge a magnificent future. Mr. Trump is readying proof. As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday, he intends to begin discussions on a free-trade agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries. A trade agreement would make for useful political theater on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly as President Barack Obama had pointedly warned that a deal would not easily happen. But as a spur to economic expansion and hiring, a deal would almost certainly amount to very little. Until Britain actually leaves Europe — a step most likely at least two years away — it is legally barred from entering a trade agreement with any country. If a deal was quietly negotiated to take effect after Britain’s departure, its economic punch would probably be modest. Tariffs between the countries are already minimal, meaning there are relatively few trade impediments left to clear away. What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive: agriculture, government procurement and defense. Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of now-favored industries. American federal government contracts would attract keen interest from British defense and aerospace companies, especially as Mr. Trump has vowed to rebuild the military. But opening such business to foreign competitors in a trade agreement would directly collide with Mr. Trump’s “America First” mantra.

85,"The Trump administration has reversed the government’s position on a highly contentious energy project, issuing a permit for the Keystone XL, a pipeline that would link oil producers in Canada and North Dakota with refiners and export terminals on the Gulf Coast. A long battle may delay construction for months or even years. The pipeline has long been at the center of a struggle pitting environmentalists against advocates of energy independence and economic growth. President Barack Obama rejected the project in late 2015, saying it would be antithetical to the United States’ leadership in curbing reliance on carbon fuels. But even with an opening for the pipeline to go forward, the energy markets are starkly different from what they were eight years ago, when the Obama administration began considering the pipeline. When the project was conceived, the United States was struggling to lift domestic oil supplies and push down prices. The Keystone XL project was meant to supplement existing pipelines and increase Canada’s export potential. Since then, production has rebounded in the United States, and international oil markets are dealing with oversupply. Gasoline at the pump is cheap. As has been the case throughout the project’s history, however, economic forces alone will not determine its prospects. Political, commercial, environmental and even diplomatic factors will also play a role. Environmentalists filed a lawsuit in opposition within days after the permit was issued by the State Department, and landowners and other opponents are mobilizing in Nebraska for public hearings to be held this spring. The Nebraska Public Service Commission still must decide whether to grant the pipeline builder, TransCanada, approval to build the pipeline through the state.

86,"Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, knows exactly what’s at stake if President Trump shuts down an Obama administration program that has given work permits and protection from deportation to some 752,000 young undocumented immigrants. In 2012, in her previous job as secretary of Homeland Security, she signed the document — nothing more than a policy memo — that created the program. So when alarm spread among immigrants on college campuses following Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Napolitano moved quickly to determine what the California system could do to shelter its students if he carried through on his pledges to cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The university estimates that almost 3,800 among its 190,000 students are undocumented, many but not all with DACA. Ms. Napolitano, retaining her law enforcement instincts, does not mention the word “sanctuary” when describing what the university could offer. “Sanctuary is such a vague term, we don’t use it,” she said crisply. Instead, the university has published detailed principles of support for undocumented students, including assurances that campus police would not question students solely about their immigration status or join any cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities under the Trump administration. Through the Davis campus law school, the university is organizing legal help for students detained for deportation. Another worrisome prospect, Ms. Napolitano said, is that students could lose the permits that allow them to work. Undocumented students, including any losing DACA, will continue to pay in-state tuition and be eligible for state financial aid and for a revolving loan program funded, in part, by the university. “We want to do everything we can so students are safe on our campuses,” Ms. Napolitano said, “so they can focus on what they are there to do, which is to study.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/education/edlife/sanctuary-for-undocumented-students.html?searchResultPosition=49

Yet people ahead of him and behind him in line who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote, according to Mr. Trump, were permitted to cast provisional ballots.

88,"It is getting closer to midnight. On Thursday, the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster, moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour. It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb. Though scientists decide on the clock’s position, it is not a scientific instrument, or even a physical one. The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition, placing it at seven minutes to midnight. Since then, it has moved closer to midnight and farther away, depending on the board’s conclusions. Thursday’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson, the executive director and publisher of the bulletin. She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley, and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering. Dr. Bronson, in a post-announcement interview, explained why the board had included the 30-second mark in the measurement. She said that it was an attention-catching signal that was meant to acknowledge “what a dangerous moment we’re in, and how important it is for people to take note.” “We’re so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” she said. “Rather than create panic, we’re hoping that this drives action.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/doomsday-clock-countdown-2017.html?searchResultPosition=51
89,"President Trump lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes, the largest negative margin for anyone elected president in the modern era. But on Monday, during his first official meeting with congressional leaders, Mr. Trump insisted that he actually won the popular vote — once you subtract the three million to five million illegally cast ballots, all of which he says, were cast “for the other side.” Now he is calling for a major federal investigation into election fraud that, according to the White House press secretary, will focus on “urban areas” in “big states” that Mr. Trump lost, like California and New York. Here are the (non-alternative) facts: There were more than 135 million ballots cast in November. A careful review by The Washington Post documented a grand total of just four cases of voter fraud nationwide — including an Iowa woman who voted twice for Mr. Trump. And during the recount litigation in Michigan, the president’s own legal team told a court that “all available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.” But don’t take it from them. Just ask yourself if this story seems plausible: Sophisticated cheats committed widespread election fraud to the tune of five million votes and vanished without a trace. But they forgot to steal 80,000 votes in three states (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) that would have been decisive for Hillary Clinton. It’s as if the thieves from “Ocean’s Eleven” broke into Fort Knox, left behind the gold bars and took a stamp collection. So why would the president make this easily debunked claim that there was widespread voter fraud? First, he faces a legitimacy problem. I’m not talking about rigged or hacked voting machines. The Rust Belt recounts show only that our voting systems score high on integrity. Sure, voting machines can always use improvements, and meltdowns have happened (see Florida, 2000). But, despite unsubstantiated concerns raised by Jill Stein and others, there is no evidence of large-scale fraud or miscounting — certainly nothing that could tip multiple states by tens of thousands of votes. The truth is that Mr. Trump won critical battleground states and the Electoral College with 304 votes. And that’s why he’s the president. The Electoral College is the law of the land, but opinion polls over the last 15 years indicate that most Americans — about 60 percent — agree that it should be scrapped in favor of the popular vote. (The number of Americans in favor of keeping the Electoral College, however, did jump to about 47 percent shortly after Mr. Trump’s victory.)

92,"The actor and performance artist Shia LaBeouf was arrested early Thursday morning on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges while protesting President Trump at a livestream art installation in Queens. In videos online, Mr. LaBeouf — who has a history of provocative behavior and a record of arrests for minor offenses — expresses outrage, evidently aimed at Mr. Trump, and uses expletive-laden language to ask how the public can make it normal “to be a Nazi out here.” In one video, a small gathering of fellow protesters chants “He will not divide us” as the bearded Mr. LaBeouf speaks. A police officer approaches, and Mr. LaBeouf appears to get into a verbal altercation with him before the officer places him in handcuffs and escorts him out of the camera’s view. Mr. LaBeouf was arrested just after 12.30 a.m. and charged with misdemeanor assault and with harassment, according to Detective Adam Navarro of the New York City Police Department. He was issued a desk appearance ticket and instructed to come to court on April 4. He was not jailed. Detective Navarro said that the police were called after Mr. LaBeouf got into an argument with another man at the installation, pulled off the man’s scarf and, in the process, scratched his face. The man did not need to be hospitalized, the detective said. The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf’s latest art project, “He Will Not Divide Us,” a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner. On Inauguration Day, the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, and invited members of the public to repeat the words “he will not divide us” into the camera. The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words, 24/7, throughout Mr. Trump’s time in office. Representatives for Mr. LaBeouf did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday morning. The arrest is not Mr. LaBeouf’s first dust-up with the law: In 2014, while at a Broadway performance of the musical “Cabaret,” he was arrested and later charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. The actor first rose to prominence as a child performer on the Disney Channel television series “Even Stevens,” and in 2008 starred in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” More recently, he has drawn as much attention for his unusual art projects as for his acting. In November 2015, Mr. LaBeouf arranged a three-day marathon of all of his movies at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. The next month, he set up shop in an art gallery in Liverpool, England, asking people to call him and “touch his soul.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/arts/shia-labeouf-is-arrested-at-anti-trump-art-show-in-new-york.html?searchResultPosition=56

[ Read our review of “The Salesman” ] Mr. Trump said this week that he would issue an executive order to suspend immigration for at least 30 days for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It remains unclear how and whether the ban would take effect. Ms. Alidoosti made her intentions clear on her Twitter feed, writing: “Trump’s visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won’t attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest.” In an email interview, she said that she would not attend the Oscars ceremony on Feb. 26 even if it turned out the proposed ban did not affect her ability to get a visa. “I decided not to go even if I could, because it hurts me deeply to see ordinary people of my country being rejected for what might be their legal right to have access to their children abroad or to their school classes as students,” Ms. Alidoosti said. “The Salesman,” which the government of Iran approved for submission to the Academy Awards, is one of five films vying for best foreign language film. It is directed by Asghar Farhadi, whose “A Separation” won an Oscar for best foreign language film in 2012. “The Salesman” tells the story of a Tehran couple whose lives are irrevocably changed when they have to move apartments while starring in an amateur production of Arthur Miller’s “The Death of a Salesman.” Ms. Alidoosti said she had not discussed her decision with Mr. Farhadi and did not know who would represent the film at the ceremony. She said that the director had generally brought the lead actors of his films to foreign awards ceremonies, including to the Cannes Film Festival, where “The Salesman” received a strong critical reception last year. The actress noted that the United States did not have an embassy in Tehran and that Iranians often traveled to neighboring countries to secure visas. “Many people have urgent medical cases,” she said. “I’m sure all of them are not just going through the ordeal for a fun vacation; they might have a more serious case.” “I’m sure the United States has also benefited many times from Iranian immigrants and people who have worked there and served that country,” Ms. Alidoosti added. “So it’s not acceptable to me to respect a state that does not respect the people of my country.” A spokeswoman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

98,"LOS ANGELES — When “Zoot Suit” first opened at the Mark Taper Forum in 1978, little about the production screamed hit. Much of the cast had scant acting experience. The story itself was a Brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 Los Angeles; its climax involved a humiliating assault on a Latino man by racist United States servicemen. Just a decade earlier, its writer and director, Luis Valdez, was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the Central Valley in California. But audiences kept coming, and coming, selling out show after packed show. Fans came one week and returned with their families the next; Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead is said to have seen the play 22 times. After running for 11 months to sold-out audiences, first at the Taper and then at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, “Zoot Suit” moved to New York’s Winter Garden in 1979, where it became the first Chicano theatrical production on Broadway. Mr. Valdez then directed a feature-film version, which was released in 1982. “We had no idea any of this would happen, man,” he said. “It was like this huge explosion.” On Tuesday, Jan. 31, a revival of “Zoot Suit” begins its run at the Taper, kicking off the theater’s 50th-anniversary season. A fantastical reimagining of the so-called Sleepy Lagoon murder case, in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge, “Zoot Suit” features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids, lively swing tunes and family squabbles. The infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-American youths in the summer of 1943, figures in as well. Looming over it all is El Pachuco, a mythical trickster figure who can stop time and materialize wherever he pleases (think Prospero, but with a lot more panache), and “The Press,” a barking headline made flesh. The show is both a homecoming and a reunion. Four decades after its world premiere, Mr. Valdez, who is 76, is back as director. Daniel Valdez (Luis’s brother) and Rose Portillo, who in 1978 portrayed Henry Reyna and Della Barrios, the young lovers at the heart of the play, this time around play Henry’s parents. “I got kind of choked up the first time I heard those words all over again,” Daniel Valdez said. “Coming back to it is a little like coming home.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/theater/zoot-suit-a-pioneering-chicano-play-comes-full-circle.html?searchResultPosition=54
99,"In 2004, eight years after he’d sold CNN to Time Warner, Ted Turner, the network’s founder, sounded an alarm about the dangers of corporate ownership of news organizations. Mr. Turner wrote that in his day, “we put journalism first, and that’s how we built CNN into something the world wanted to watch.” In his view, “quarterly earnings obsessed” corporate owners would not have the same priorities because “the emphasis instantly shifts from taking risks to taking profits.” His warning is especially chilling today, when the integrity of the press matters more than ever. Unfortunately, in the past 20 months CNN’s management has let down its viewers and its journalists by sidelining the issues and real reporting in favor of pundits, prognostication and substance-free but entertaining TV “moments.” Still, I believe the network can again play an essential role. At its best, CNN is a journalistic enterprise with unparalleled reach and resources, connecting its viewers with people and conflicts half a mile or half a world away. That’s why I believe that as a condition of Time Warner’s bid to merge with AT&T, CNN should be sold to a new independent entity. This sale would also include CNN international, Headline News and its digital and related properties. Though AT&T has dismissed talk of a sale, one could be compelled by regulators. A consortium of concerned Americans — philanthropists, foundations, small-dollar donors — could fund a trust to operate an independent CNN dedicated to news in the public interest. Subscription fees from cable and other service providers, along with ad revenue, would allow the network to support itself. I became a devoted viewer of CNN in 1989, during its coverage of the standoff in Tiananmen Square. I remember my father telling me that the only reason the Chinese government didn’t massacre those kids right away was because CNN had cameras on the scene. From Tiananmen Square to the fall of the Berlin Wall, from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to Hurricane Katrina, CNN provided exhaustive live, on-the-ground reporting. Its saturation coverage has had such a profound impact that there’s even a term for it: “the CNN effect,” the power to shift policy and inspire empathy by keeping eyes on unfolding events.

102,"LOS ANGELES — A federal judge has dealt another blow to President Trump’s executive order barring some foreigners from coming into the United States, in a ruling that added to the confusion over the legality of the immigration measure. Using more sweeping language than previous court rulings, Judge André Birotte Jr. of United States District Court here issued a temporary restraining order on Tuesday evening requiring the government to allow in people with valid immigrant visas from the seven majority-Muslim countries Mr. Trump sought to block. The judge’s order affects only people who are seeking to live in the United States permanently and are taking the first steps to becoming a legal resident. This does not include tourists or students trying to enter the country. The order came in response to a complaint filed on behalf of 28 people from Yemen — United States citizens and their family members who had remained in Yemen but later received immigrant visas. The visa holders have been stuck in an airport in Djibouti since President Trump issued his executive order on Friday, according to the complaint. Like in other rulings in New York and Boston, Judge Birotte wrote that the plaintiffs would likely succeed in court on the merits and that they would also “likely suffer irreparable harm” without an injunction.

103,"WASHINGTON — For Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, the road to the Supreme Court ended in Altoona. This week’s high court runner-up — who helped pay for his education by driving a cab — drove east from his office in Pittsburgh shortly after noon on Tuesday, just as White House officials were whispering that he was heading toward Washington to an “Apprentice”-style finale with Judge Neil Gorsuch where President Trump would announce his first Supreme Court pick. At around 3 p.m., under the watchful eyes of a CNN camera crew, he stopped at a gas station in Altoona, then disappeared. The reason for his 100-mile trip — whether it was to visit an old friend or to try to make powerful new ones at the Trump White House — remains something of a mystery. Three administration officials who did not want to be identified said Judge Hardiman hit the road to Washington to help them maintain the illusion that the selection process was still competitive. Judge Hardiman did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday. His friends say he was simply visiting a colleague who lives in Altoona. The day began with a phone call from Don McGahn, the White House counsel, who informed Judge Hardiman that Mr. Trump’s pick would be Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, another conservative appeals court judge, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. But putting on a dignified East Room ceremony announcing Judge Gorsuch’s nomination was important for an administration struggling to recover from the self-inflicted wound of last Friday’s executive order barring migrants from seven Muslim nations, which has provoked a powerful bipartisan backlash. Getting the optics just right, people close to Mr. Trump said, was a priority. But by late Monday news media outlets were killing the buzz, and starting to report that Judge Gorsuch looked like a sure thing. Aides in the West Wing worried that interest in the prime-time announcement would quickly fade if the Gorsuch selection was known, and told reporters already staking out Judge Hardiman’s house that he was heading to Washington.

104,"WASHINGTON — Just five days after taking office, over dinner with his newly installed secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Trump was presented with the first of what will be many life-or-death decisions: whether to approve a commando raid that risked the lives of American Special Operations forces and foreign civilians alike. President Barack Obama’s national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack on a small, heavily guarded brick home of a senior Qaeda collaborator in a mountainous village in a remote part of central Yemen. But Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended. With two of his closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, joining the dinner at the White House along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., Mr. Trump approved sending in the Navy’s SEAL Team 6, hoping the raid early last Sunday would scoop up cellphones and laptop computers that could yield valuable clues about one of the world’s most dangerous terrorist groups. Vice President Mike Pence and Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, also attended the dinner. As it turned out, almost everything that could go wrong did. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid was returned home, the first military death on the new commander in chief’s watch. The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious 50-minute firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations — which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct — that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. The dead include, by the account of Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Mr. Trump on Sunday hailed his first counterterrorism operation as a success, claiming the commandos captured “important intelligence that will assist the U.S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.” A statement by the military’s Central Command on Wednesday night that acknowledged the likelihood of civilian casualties also said that the recovered materials had provided some initial information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. The statement did not provide details. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/middleeast/donald-trump-yemen-commando-raid-questions.html?searchResultPosition=96
105,"MIAMI — In a place that thinks of itself as the capital of Latin America, the Miami-Dade County mayor’s decision last week to jump out front and heed President Trump’s executive order demanding cooperation with immigration agents has set off consternation and protests. Residents have marched on County Hall and accused the mayor, Carlos Gimenez — a former Cuban refugee — of betraying a county that proudly boasts the second largest number of immigrants in the United States and was considered a sanctuary city. Making matters worse, they said, Mr. Gimenez, who feared losing federal grant money, was the first big-city mayor to do so. Protesters have vowed to pack the county commission meeting next week. “It’s embarrassing in this city of immigrants, in a multicultural, diverse place like this that our mayor is not taking a strong stance,” said Tomás Kennedy, 25, a college student from Argentina who became a United States citizen after being undocumented for 17 years, and who joined the latest protest Tuesday. “He is an immigrant himself. He came here fleeing political persecution from Cuba. He knows firsthand what immigrants and refugees contribute to this county.’’ Last Thursday, Mr. Gimenez directed county jails to “fully cooperate” with Mr. Trump’s directive. The order targeted what are known as sanctuary cities and counties, which generally do not comply with federal requests to detain undocumented immigrants who have been arrested on unrelated charges until immigration officers can get them. In response to Mr. Trump’s order, Mr. Gimenez directed county jails to detain people who were flagged by immigration authorities as possible illegal immigrants for 48 hours. Miami-Dade had all but stopped honoring these requests since 2014 after the county commission demanded that the federal government reimburse the county for added detention costs, which in 2012 reached $650,000. That 2014 shift away from honoring detainment requests landed the county on the Obama administration’s list of sanctuary cities, according to Mr. Gimenez. For the mayor, a Republican who said before the presidential election he would vote for Hillary Clinton, the move boiled down to a pocketbook issue — the potential loss of as much as $355 million a year in federal grant money. In his executive order, Mr. Trump threatened to withhold discretionary federal funds from cities that do not comply. Mr. Gimenez has disavowed the sanctuary city label, an amorphous, highly politicized term. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/miami-mayor-carlos-gimenez.html?searchResultPosition=97
106,"STARKVILLE, Miss. — Coming from an Iranian city of around 150,000 people, Amir Rezazadeh felt a little out of place when he arrived at Mississippi State University, more than 100 miles from any metropolitan area and deep in the heart of the Bible Belt. But he soon came to like the quiet surroundings, where there was little to distract him from his horticulture studies, and where there was already a group of Middle Eastern students and professors to make him feel welcome. Ignoring half-serious warnings that he could be converted, he even began spending time at the Baptist Student Union, where he honed his English, discussed Christianity and Islam, played games and watched movies, and forged friendships with some of the Mississippi-born students. That is why he was more than a little taken aback this past week when students told him to his face that they agreed with President Trump’s order to temporarily ban visa holders from Iran and six other countries from entering the United States. “Some people say directly to you that it’s a good order,” he said, “that our country should have this order to ban terrorists.” He finds their position especially hurtful, he said, in light of his fears of what the order might mean for him and his wife, and roughly 80 other students from the seven countries.

107,"As a candidate, President Trump spent contributors’ money for office space that he owned, stays at his resorts and food at his restaurants. He spent contributors’ money on Trump-branded wine and water. He displayed Trump merchandise at campaign events. Now he seems determined to milk the presidency, apparently synonymous with his brand in his eyes, for a fortune. “The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before,” Mr. Trump observed, with satisfaction, shortly after the election. Last week, an executive of the Trump Organization, Eric Danziger, said it would open Trump-branded hotels in the 26 largest metropolitan areas in the country, up from five. The business, he said, would focus its expansion domestically for “the next four or eight years.” The fee to join the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., which Mr. Trump calls the “Winter White House,” just doubled to $200,000. This news came less than a week after Mr. Trump and his inauguration committee hosted parties and other events at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, in the government-owned Old Post Office. Even his press secretary, Sean Spicer, has become a pitchman: “It’s an absolutely stunning hotel,” he said recently. “I encourage you to go there if you haven’t been by.” Self-dealing is such standard procedure for this White House that a cynic (or satirist) might say it’s time to give in and try to put Mr. Trump’s conflicts of interest to work for the public. Maybe if he had hotels in every nation, he’d have a financial interest in being less bellicose, and more supportive of the free flow of trade and of people, even if they happen to be Mexican or Muslim. But we really prefer the old-fashioned approach in which presidents put the public interest ahead of their own finances. Federal ethics officials have told Mr. Trump that he should divest his business interests to avoid allegations of bribery and to assure Americans that their needs are his only concern. Mr. Trump argues that he can put a “firewall” between his businesses and himself by having his eldest sons manage them. The president and the Trump Organization last week hired lawyers to keep an eye on the Trumps, a laughable ploy that doesn’t meet ethical or anti-corruption standards and constitutional requirements.

108,"WASHINGTON — It was at a campaign rally in August that President Trump most fully unveiled the dark vision of an America under siege by “radical Islam” that is now radically reshaping the policies of the United States. On a stage lined with American flags in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Trump, who months before had called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration, argued that the United States faced a threat on par with the greatest evils of the 20th century. The Islamic State was brutalizing the Middle East, and Muslim immigrants in the West were killing innocents at nightclubs, offices and churches, he said. Extreme measures were needed. “The hateful ideology of radical Islam,” he told supporters, must not be “allowed to reside or spread within our own communities.” Mr. Trump was echoing a strain of anti-Islamic theorizing familiar to anyone who has been immersed in security and counterterrorism debates over the last 20 years. He has embraced a deeply suspicious view of Islam that several of his aides have promoted, notably retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, now his national security adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist. This worldview borrows from the “clash of civilizations” thesis of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, and combines straightforward warnings about extremist violence with broad-brush critiques of Islam. It sometimes conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1.7 billion Muslims around the world. In its more extreme forms, this view promotes conspiracies about government infiltration and the danger that Shariah, the legal code of Islam, may take over in the United States.

The order applies to citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, prompting protests at airports across the country over the weekend as airlines and immigration agents scrambled to comply with the new directive. The American Airlines chief executive, Doug Parker, called the order “divisive” in an open letter to employees posted on the company’s website on Monday. Expedia is supporting a lawsuit filed by Washington State against the president’s order. The chief executive of TripAdvisor, Steve Kaufer, published an open letter on LinkedIn that criticized the policy, calling it “not only heartless and discriminatory, but also against the principles that make our country great.” Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, went further on Twitter, posting that the company will provide temporary free housing to refugees. A company spokesman said that Airbnb hosts may offer their rooms without charge or receive a subsidy from Airbnb. He added that the company was working on requests from people affected by the ban but did not provide more information. Of the seven nations singled out by the executive order, only Iran drew significant interest on the part of leisure travelers. Among North American travelers, trips to Iran with Intrepid Travel had grown 35 percent in the past year, on pace with Iceland, Japan and Sri Lanka, three other trending destinations. Cox & Kings said it had doubled its traffic to Iran in the past 12 months. Wilderness Travel went from offering one itinerary in 2016 to three in 2017.

110,"WASHINGTON — Anthony Scaramucci, an investment firm founder and a Republican donor, will not be taking a senior job at the White House as previously announced, a senior administration official said Wednesday. Mr. Scaramucci was informed on Wednesday by Reince Priebus, President Trump’s chief of staff, and by Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist, that he would not get the job as liaison to the business community. Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon, the official said, plan to find another role in the administration for Mr. Scaramucci in the future. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Scaramucci’s name had not officially been withdrawn. At issue is Mr. Scaramucci’s sale of his firm, SkyBridge Capital, to a division of HNA Group, a politically connected Chinese conglomerate that would become the firm’s majority owner. The sale has not been completed, and administration officials said the White House Counsel’s Office had predicted that it would take up to three months for Mr. Scaramucci to be cleared of potential ethics conflicts. The White House is operating without a functioning Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, which Mr. Scaramucci would have led. Part of the job is to help coordinate matters across government agencies, a pressing need as protests over the president’s immigration order sweep the country. The New York Times reported Tuesday that HNA Group has strong ties to China’s ruling Communist Party and an opaque ownership structure. China experts say leading Chinese firms like HNA are looking for avenues of influence in a White House that is already stoking tensions on trade and other issues. HNA, a financial behemoth whose interests range from aviation to supermarkets, has said that SkyBridge will give it a foothold in America’s asset management business. The $180 million deal could be finalized as late as the end of June. To avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Scaramucci had agreed to recuse himself from anything to do with SkyBridge and HNA. One ethics lawyer suggested that he could have steered clear of the entire financial services sector and still carried out his duties. “This does not seem to me to be a clear disqualifying factor,” said Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer for two years under President George W. Bush. “Another possibility is they decided not to keep him for a political reason and cited an ethics conflict as a cover.” This was not the first time that the Trump team has announced an appointment and later changed course. Mr. Trump’s choice for communications director backed out, as did a deputy National Security Council pick accused of plagiarism.

He added, “The Department of Veterans Affairs will not be privatized under my watch.” Dr. Shulkin, who is currently the department’s under secretary of health, was nominated as secretary of veterans affairs after a number of other candidates reportedly turned down Mr. Trump’s overtures. Before taking his current position in 2015, Dr. Shulkin helped lead several private health care systems, including Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Veterans groups and members of Congress have credited him with making real, if ponderous, progress in improving care in the veterans’ vast health system, which includes 1,234 clinics and hospitals. In his 18 months heading the system, Dr. Shulkin oversaw the hiring of more than 10,000 doctors and nurses, and authorized more than three million appointments with private providers. While many of Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks have led to a backlash from Democrats, Dr. Shulkin, the only Trump nominee who served in the Obama administration, has emerged as a consensus candidate.

The decision to forgo electronic counting is a stark response to warnings that outside actors, including Russia, might try to tamper with pivotal elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany — three major democracies in which establishment parties are facing pressure from right-wing populism of the kind that fueled Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump’s triumph in the United States election. “The cabinet cannot exclude the possibility that state actors might gain advantage from influencing political decision-making and public opinion in the Netherlands and might use means to try and achieve such influence,” Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said in a statement. “We’re talking about actors that both have the intention and ability to do this.” Parliament recently discussed the finding by intelligence agencies that the Russian government tried covertly to help Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump’s allegations — made without evidence — that millions of undocumented immigrants had cast ballots, costing him the popular vote. Ronald Van Raak, an opposition member for the Socialist Party, demanded guarantees from Mr. Plasterk that the Dutch elections, set for March 15, would not be hacked — and said that if the government could not provide such a guarantee, it should resort to paper ballots.

Their grass-roots organizations extend to precincts and parishes in all 50 states. And their causes span the full spectrum of issues that animate the right’s most devoted followers, meaning they don’t always see eye to eye. But on this they agree: They cannot take any chances that President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court is stopped. Right after the election — before some of them had ever even heard of Judge Neil M.

Mr. Trump’s final choice was almost a moot point. The groups drew up mock websites to promote the candidates they thought most likely to be picked, working from the list of 21 names Mr. Trump said comprised his finalists.

Dr. Bornstein, who spoke by telephone in four interviews over the past month, also said that Mr. Trump takes a daily baby aspirin to reduce the risk of a heart attack. Over all, he pronounced Mr. Trump healthy and his medical care “as exactly up to date.” Dr. Bornstein granted the interviews after The New York Times asked him to discuss his role in Mr. Trump’s care and to clarify and expand on earlier statements he made about his patient’s health during the presidential campaign. In recent decades, The Times has interviewed presidents, presidential candidates and their doctors about their health. At 70, Mr. Trump is the oldest person to become president.

In his ruling, the judge said that Mr. Trump, by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter — a process that could take years — had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees.

The prospect of traveling to the United States made me uneasy. I had heard stories of Syrians being singled out for interrogation at American airports. And I wasn’t certain I would be able to get travel documents and an American visa anyway: Because of my political activities, I am a man without a passport. But then, after President Trump signed an executive order barring even Syrians with valid passports and visas from the United States, I knew I wouldn’t be able to visit my American friends any time soon. Mr. Trump’s decision pronouncing Syrians dangerous and undesirable seemed quite similar to the way our own dictator, President Bashar al-Assad, has treated me and my countrymen. I have never had a passport. I was explicitly denied one by Mr. Assad’s regime because I am a writer who opposed his father and opposes him. In 1980, I was a 19-year-old student of medicine at the University of Aleppo when I joined the protests against the Hafez al-Assad regime. I was jailed along with hundreds of fellow left-wing students and activists. I spent 16 years in prison. After my release in 1996, I returned to Aleppo and my medical studies. After graduating in 2000, I decided not to practice medicine, moved to Damascus and worked as a writer. In March 2011, Syrians rose up against the Bashar al-Assad regime. I decided to write without any self-censorship in support of the revolution. The cost of writing with freedom was that I had to leave my home in Damascus, hide in myriad places across the country, and eventually seek refuge in Turkey. To live in exile without a passport or travel documents is to live with the knowledge of limited mobility in a world of militarized bureaucracy. The international disdain for Syrian refugees comes close to Mr. Assad’s approach to his ill-fated subjects. Most Syrians were never issued passports. For the Assad regime, passports are political and disciplinary tools. For Syrians, Mr. Trump is merely pushing to extremes a process that has been going on for years. The situation of the refugees, and the underprivileged in general, has been worsening everywhere for a generation. Syria exemplifies a greater global failure. The executive order barring Syrians and the citizens of six other countries was among Mr. Trump’s very first actions in the White House.

Three issues make chief executives bullish at present: the prospect of the corporate tax rate being cut to as low as 15 percent from 35 percent; the boost to the American economy from Mr. Trump’s promise to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure; and the belief that deregulation is in the cards. These ought to bolster output, spending, earnings and, as a result, the desire to strike deals. The chaos of the first two weeks of the Trump administration is starting to cast some doubts, however. For example, the president and Congress don’t see eye to eye on some of the more complex parts of tax reform. That could delay any proposal, perhaps into 2018, an election year. Mr. Trump’s immigration ban, his calls for border tariffs and his aggressive, off-the-cuff approach to international diplomacy also risk undermining the ebullience in corporate boardrooms. If Washington can’t get its better deals done, mergers and acquisitions bankers could very well miss out on theirs.

121,"For someone who promoted his management skills and campaigned as an “organizational genius,” as Anderson Cooper of CNN put it, it has been a rocky White House debut for Donald J. Trump, the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office. “Chaos” seems to be the word most often invoked, closely followed by “turmoil.” (One exception: the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, who said he preferred “action-packed.”) In less than two weeks, Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nation’s borders, alienated longtime allies, roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced. The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal bemoaned a refugee policy “so poorly explained and prepared for, that it has produced confusion and fear at airports, an immediate legal defeat, and political fury at home and abroad.” Even the top House Republican, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had released a statement praising the immigration order, later distanced himself, saying, “It’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout.” All new presidents undergo a learning curve. But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and, with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician, an administration that would function as a well-oiled machine.

122,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump told an audience of religious leaders on Thursday that he would ‘destroy’ the Johnson Amendment, he declared his intention to sign a bill that would fundamentally alter a major aspect of the church-state divide that has been a constant in American politics for generations. But what exactly is the Johnson Amendment? It is one of the brightest lines in the legal separation between religion and politics. Under the provision, which was made in 1954, tax-exempt entities like churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate. Specifically, ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. If they do, they risk losing their tax-exempt status. Considered uncontroversial at the time, it was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. Today, however, many Republicans want to repeal it. Back when Lyndon B. Johnson was a senator from Texas, he introduced the measure as an amendment to the tax code in 1954. Like many things Johnson did, the goal was to bludgeon a political opponent, in this case a rival in a primary who had the backing of nonprofit groups that were campaigning against him by suggesting he was a communist. Though there was no church involved, according to PolitiFact, churches were covered by the bill as well. Mr. Trump promised he would work to repeal the Johnson Amendment as part of his extensive outreach efforts to religious conservatives, a group that took a long time to warm to his candidacy. Eliminating the measure has been a goal of the right. Conservatives have argued that it violates the protections of free speech and free exercise that the First Amendment extends to houses of worship. Courts have not agreed. Speaking of the implications of a repeal last year, Jerry Falwell Jr., the prominent evangelical leader and Trump supporter, said it would “create a huge revolution for conservative Christians and for free speech.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/johnson-amendment-trump.html?searchResultPosition=53
123,"WASHINGTON — President Trump vowed on Thursday to overturn a law restricting political speech by tax-exempt churches, a potentially huge victory for the religious right and a gesture to evangelicals, a voting bloc he attracted to his campaign by promising to free up their pulpits. Mr. Trump said his administration would “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment, a 1954 law that prohibits churches from endorsing or opposing political candidates at the risk of losing their tax-exempt status. “Freedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is also a right under threat all around us,” Mr. Trump told religious leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast. “That is why I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.” Repealing the law would require approval by Congress, which could prove challenging given that Democrats, and even some Republicans, would resist what many view as an erosion of the separation between church and state. Still, Mr. Trump’s promise to repeal the law fulfills a campaign pledge — one that became a centerpiece of his effort to mollify the religious right, which was slow to warm to his insurgent candidacy. Eliminating the measure has been a goal of many social conservatives, who argue that it unfairly restricts clergy members from expressing themselves by endorsing, or speaking out against, political candidates. Many see government persecution in limits on their official religious activities at work, and complain that the Internal Revenue Service — an agency that the right views with a special ire — singles out churches dominated by Christian conservatives.

And while The New York Times Company recorded significant growth in subscriptions and promising increases in digital advertising, it nevertheless has not avoided the inevitable. The company said on Thursday that its print advertising revenue in 2016 fell 16 percent, driving a 9 percent drop in total advertising revenue. For the quarter, print advertising revenue declined 20 percent. The story on the digital side was positive, underscoring the diverging financial narratives for print and digital that have emerged at the company. Digital advertising revenue rose 6 percent last year, to $209 million. The Times Company added 514,000 net digital-only subscriptions for its news products during the year, bringing its total to 1.6 million. Buoyed by readers’ intense interest in the presidential election, the company added 276,000 net digital-only subscriptions to its news products in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined. Including print and crossword product subscriptions, The New York Times now has more than three million total paid subscribers, a milestone that aligns with the company’s commitment to a subscription-based revenue model that is less reliant on the advertising revenue derived from page views and clicks. As for many other legacy print companies trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world, these have been challenging times for The New York Times. Last month, The Times released an internal report that called for swift changes in the newsroom, including more staff training, a commitment to hiring journalists with wider-ranging skills and an elimination of duplicative layers of editing.

The interview, broadcast on Sunday, might have quietly faded into the forgotten quarters of the internet. But Breitbart News, the right-wing news network, picked it up Wednesday night, packaging the video clip with an article headlined “Matthew McConaughey to Hollywood: ‘Embrace’ Donald Trump.” The interview, on the BBC’s “The Andrew Marr Show,” was later covered by outlets including Vulture, Entertainment Weekly and the British newspaper The Independent. Overnight, searches for Mr. McConaughey and Mr. Trump rose on Google. The Breitbart site reports and aggregates politics and entertainment news, often injecting a conservative viewpoint, and it embraced Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. The network was formerly run by Stephen K. Bannon, who is now Mr. Trump’s chief political strategist. In response to a question from Mr. Marr about whether it was time for America’s cultural elite to give Mr. Trump “a break,” Mr. McConaughey said, “It’s a very dynamic and as divisive of an inauguration and time that we’ve ever had.” “At the same time,” he added, “it’s time for us to embrace, shake hands with this fact and be constructive with him over the next four years.” Mr. McConaughey had appeared on the program to promote his role in a new movie, “Gold.” Online, mentions of Mr. McConaughey increased rapidly early Thursday. They came in swift and conflicting. One Twitter user thanked the Oscar-winning actor. Another disagreed. Mr. McConaughey is one of the rare stars to speak in more amicable terms about the new president, who has drawn widespread scorn from late-night hosts, comedians and actors. At this year’s awards shows, celebrities including Meryl Streep and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have used their acceptance speeches to criticize the president for his policies and behavior. Last month, Nicole Kidman drew criticism after telling the BBC, “he’s now elected, and we as a country need to support whoever is the president because that’s what the country’s based on.” She later clarified that she had meant her comments as a general call in favor of democratic processes, rather than as an endorsement of Mr. Trump.

More than four decades ago California passed a landmark law protecting the state’s farmworkers from abuse and helping them to organize. But the recent resignation of the head of a board that oversees the implementation of the law highlights the extent to which organized labor among farmworkers has collapsed since the days of the pioneering labor leader Cesar Chavez. Chavez’s activism was instrumental in the creation of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, the passage of which Gov. Jerry Brown described as a major accomplishment of his first stint as governor. In his recent resignation letter, the head of the board, William B. Gould IV, described the law as “irrelevant to farmworkers.” He estimated that less than one percent of the agricultural work force is now represented by a union. As chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, Mr. Gould was charged with overseeing the certification process of union elections.

The unusually strong expression of humility, which came as the bank disclosed a quarterly loss of 1.9 billion euros, or $2 billion, reflected the tone that John Cryan, the chief executive, has tried to set since taking over in July 2015. His comments at a news conference signaled another step away from the aggressive risk-taking that was part of the lender’s attempt to keep pace with American investment banking titans like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Speaking slowly and with a grave demeanor, Mr. Cryan expressed “deep regret for what happened.” “We would like to apologize sincerely,” he said. “Serious errors were made.” Under Mr. Cryan’s leadership, Deutsche Bank has followed European rivals like Credit Suisse in scaling back operations on Wall Street. But Mr. Cryan said on Thursday that Deutsche Bank would nevertheless retain a strong presence in the United States. “We cannot be the international bank we need to be and want to be unless we can deal with the largest economy in the world,” he said. Deutsche Bank’s top managers will take “substantial” cuts in their bonuses for 2016, Mr. Cryan said, declining to give exact figures. It would be inappropriate, he added, for executives to receive large bonuses when the bank was not paying a dividend to shareholders and was laying off thousands of workers.

129,"WASHINGTON — History is full of examples of leaders using “us versus them” politics to paint a particular minority group as a threat to the majority’s safety, morals or culture. That history has scholars of authoritarianism unnerved by President Trump’s order to halt immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, temporarily suspend the United States refugee resettlement program, and indefinitely bar refugees from Syria. The new rules are in line with the ban on Muslim immigration that Mr. Trump proposed during the presidential campaign, though they do not bar all Muslims outright. Nevertheless, the scholars say there are worrying parallels between his ban and the behaviors of the governments they study. That kind of us-versus-them politics, they warn, can have harmful consequences not just for the specific groups that are targeted, but for political systems as a whole. The us-versus-them dynamic is “easy for many people to rally around,” said Jonathan D. Weiler, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina. Targeting feared or unpopular minorities is a way of “setting a boundary,” said Sheri E. Berman, a political scientist at Barnard College — a way to distinguish between “us” deserving of protection, and “them” who are a threat. There is always a segment in every population that is suspicious of outsiders and frightened of difference, said Marc J. Hetherington, a Vanderbilt University political scientist and an author, along with Mr. Weiler, of the book “Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics.” And many others who would ordinarily be more tolerant and open will turn against outsiders if they feel especially frightened — in times of war, for instance, or after a terrorist attack.

Trump managed to introduce Judge Neil Gorsuch to an audience of supporters without bragging about the size of the crowd. However, he did suggest he’s “studied” Gorsuch’s work. Since the judge does not have a history of either tweeting or writing about Donald Trump, serious presidential perusal seems highly unlikely. Gorsuch is what they call an originalist, a judicial breed that cynics define as people who believe that if the founding fathers were around today, they would be best friends and agree on everything. He’s extremely conservative. Colleagues say he’s pleasant and thoughtful, which will do you no good whatsoever if you’re worried about reproductive rights or federal regulation to reduce climate change. But it had the Republicans in Congress doing happy dances all over the Capitol. Really, they were afraid Trump was going to nominate Don King. Democrats, meanwhile, were bitterly remembering that last year Barack Obama had nominated an intelligent, well-spoken moderate moderate in the form of Judge Merrick Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn’t even hold a hearing. Now Trump was expecting them to roll out the welcome mat for his guy. What to do? The Democrats could filibuster, but then McConnell might try to change the rules so it would only take a simple majority to push a Supreme Court nominee through.

It’s a heinous crime that scars communities and blights growth, and it has provoked terrorized villages to rise up to chase out the extortionists. Now Mexico finds itself facing the biggest shakedown of all from north of the Rio Grande, as the United States president demands $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for a border wall. This is not meant to be a jokey comparison. President Trump’s insistence that he will force Mexico to pay is the definition of extortion: obtaining un-owed money through coercion. It is a dark moment in American foreign policy that has implications far beyond the southern border; it tells the world the United States no longer believes in fair play or the rule of law. Any officials involved in such a shakedown should search their conscience. We are only now looking at this policy properly because most of us believed it was bluster. The shout of “Who is going to pay for the wall?” was effective at rallies, but we thought we didn’t need to take Mr. Trump literally, especially with a suggestion as absurd as this. But he revealed his determination to carry it out with his tweet last Thursday: “If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.” This was no longer rhetoric to the fans but a direct challenge to another head of state, who had been scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington on Tuesday. The wall itself will be largely ineffective — most likely a fence that smugglers will climb over, tunnel under and drill through. If the United States wants to pour billions into such a structure, it can. But it is patently outrageous to force a neighboring country to pay for your own infrastructure. President Trump claims Mexico should pay because it has an annual trade surplus of $60 billion with the United States.

Polls confirm a steady leftward shift over recent decades in attitudes toward same-sex marriage, equality of the sexes and diversity in both education and the workplace. At the same time, liberal victory in the cultural revolution of the 1960s and ’70s, with its emphasis on so-called postmaterialist values — personal fulfillment, openness to new ideas and support for previously marginalized populations — had its costs, which political analysts have been reckoning. Those costs have become particularly evident in the eruption over the past year of the Brexit vote in Britain, the increasing power of anti-immigrant parties across Europe and the ascendance of right-wing populism in America. In an article to be published in the June issue of Perspectives on Politics, “Trump and the Xenophobic Populist Parties: The Silent Revolution in Reverse,” Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris put their case in blunt terms: “Postmaterialism,” they write, “eventually became its own gravedigger.” The rise of postmaterialism here and in Europe, Inglehart and Norris argue, As the Democratic Party in the United States and social democratic parties in Europe shifted their interest away from economic policies, hard-pressed members of the working and middle classes — suffering from stagnant or declining wages and lost jobs — led “a backlash against the cultural changes linked with the rise of Postmaterialist and Self-expression values,” Inglehart and Norris write. Forty years ago, “The Silent Revolution,” Inglehart’ s seminal 1977 book, argued that “when people grow up taking survival for granted it makes them more open to new ideas and more tolerant of outgroups.” In effect, postwar prosperity in America and in Western Europe allowed many voters to shift their political priorities from bread-and-butter issues to less materialistic concerns, “bringing greater emphasis on freedom of expression, environmental protection, gender equality, and tolerance of gays, handicapped people and foreigners.” Not everyone experienced this newfound economic security, however, and the number of those left behind has grown steadily. Those who do not experience the benefits of prosperity, Inglehart and Norris write, can see “others” — “an influx of foreigners,” for example, as the culprit causing their predicament: According to the two authors, In support of this argument, the authors point to 2016 exit poll data showing that Hillary Clinton won voters who said the economy was the most important issue by 11 points, 52-41, while Trump carried those who said immigration was the most important issue facing the country by nearly two to one, 64-33.

Nickelodeon has always had its share of magical kingdoms, but this Viacom-owned cable network has tended to leave the princess business to Disney. (And what a business it is, generating an estimated $5.5 billion a year in merchandise revenue alone.) But here comes “Nella the Princess Knight,” which Nickelodeon will introduce on Monday in a programming block for preschoolers. The self-designated Princess Police, mostly academics who use Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and their slender ilk to make points about their negative impact on young girls, have been a perennial thorn in Disney’s side, even as the company has introduced black and Latina royals, along with a preschool one, “Sofia the First.” Will Nickelodeon now find itself in a similar position? Maybe not. The self-empowered Nella pushes boundaries, at least for television aimed at 2-year-olds, in the areas of race and gender. She is biracial, with a black father and a white mother, a decision informed by Nickelodeon research indicating that most children under 12 will be nonwhite by 2020 and that already 17 percent are biracial. The character also mashes together traditional boy and girl gender norms. Nella may ride a unicorn with a pink mane (à la My Little Pony), but she does it while brandishing a sword and wearing knight gear, a bit like a preschool version of Brienne of Tarth from “Game of Thrones.” She is a girlie girl but does traditional boy activities (battling a dragon) and does not spend the majority of her time in a ball gown. Nickelodeon’s princess may strike some adults as subversive, particularly given the surge of conservatism that helped push Donald J. Trump into office. But children see mixed-race families and the blurring of gender lines as normal, said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon’s longtime chief. “Adults might say, ‘Oh, look — she’s biracial,’ but our viewers just say, ‘That looks like my friend,’” she said. “An older generation was taught tolerance, and this audience is demanding difference,” said Ms. Zarghami. She led Nickelodeon to ratings strength in 2016 among total viewers and children ages 2 to 11, even as competitors like Disney Channel and Cartoon Network recorded sharp year-on-year drops.

Roosevelt’s presidency in 1933, beginning with his speech on March 4 (the last time a swearing-in was held on that date). “The inaugural address was a Jacksonian speech, a fighting speech, implicit with criticism of the lack of leadership and the philosophy of government which the president imputed to his predecessor, who sat there listening,” Arthur Krock, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, wrote in his account. “ ‘Action’ was the promise of Mr. Roosevelt’s speech, and action was immediately forthcoming,” Mr. Krock stated. Before his second full day in office was over, President Roosevelt had suspended all banking transactions in the United States.

Mr. Kushner is the grandson of Holocaust survivors. His grandmother’s family in Poland fled the Nazis and she did not go to the United States till several years later because at the time admission was denied to most Jews. You correctly point out that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’s “silence now is alarming.” Mr. Kushner’s silence, and possible acquiescence, in this new policy, given his influence — he is supposed to be the “moderating” voice in the White House — is also troubling.

143,"This week, President Trump, in signing another in a seemingly endless parade of executive orders, vowed to “do a big number” on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 law enacted in response to the financial crisis. While doing so will require more than a presidential signature on a piece of paper, and we have yet to see what sort of working relationship the president will have with Congress, I take him at his word. So far, he seems quite determined to do exactly what he said he was going to do during the election campaign. I also think the effort to dismantle Dodd-Frank will start in earnest with the Orderly Liquidation Authority. This is the special bankruptcy procedure for large financial institutions. It was enacted to allow the “too big to fail” banks an avenue to do the latter, since they are still quite big. Other commentators have pointed to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making some of the speculative investments that led to the 2008-9 global economic crisis, as likely first targets. But the consumer bureau has strong defenders, including a United States senator, and dismantling Volcker would have really bad optics. The banks have already figured out several ways around the Volcker Rule — consider trading in distressed syndicated loans — and they may decide it is not worth the negative publicity that repeal would entail. But who is going to stand up for an obscure piece of insolvency law that is easily painted as a bailout tool? Moreover, because the Orderly Liquidation Authority includes a line of credit for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation when it conducts liquidations under the law, any changes to this provision of Dodd-Frank, known as Title II, can happen through the budget reconciliation process, which is entirely immune from filibusters. And once Title II is gone, other pieces of Dodd-Frank may follow.

Now, that status quo seems very long ago and the establishment is treading carefully, with even most hard-liners concerned that the smallest provocation could lead to military conflict. But some question how long their caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama had been brittle but stable. Tensions flared this week after Iran confirmed that it had conducted a missile test and the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Iran that it had been put “on notice.” On Thursday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, gave a mild rejoinder, saying, “It is a shame that the U.S. government, instead of thanking the Iranian nation for their continued fight against terrorism, keeps repeating unfounded claims and adopts unwise policies that are effectively helping terrorist groups.” Mr. Flynn also made clear that the challenge to Iran extended beyond the missile test, holding Tehran responsible for an attack on a Saudi warship by Houthi rebels in Yemen, who the United States says are supported by Iran. Iran denies that, but the remark was taken as a veiled warning about Iran’s support of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite militias in Iraq. “The Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk,” he said. Later, President Trump posted on Twitter that “Iran is rapidly taking over Iraq,” its neighbor, “while the U.S. squandered three trillion dollars there.

146,"BAGHDAD — The Trump administration amended its visa ban on Thursday to allow emigration by the families of Iraqi interpreters who served the United States government and military forces deployed in their country. The change, recommended by the Pentagon, eased some of the anger generated in Iraq by President Trump’s executive order imposing the ban, which has stoked anxiety and confusion around much of the world since it was issued last week. The order temporarily blocked all Syrian refugees from entering the United States and suspended visas for applicants from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq. It applied to holders of so-called Special Immigrant Visas issued to interpreters who worked for the United States during its 2003-11 occupation, often at great personal risk, and to their families. In a statement about the change sent to The New York Times, a United States Embassy official in Baghdad said, “The U.S. government has determined that it is in the national interest to allow Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (S.I.V.) holders to continue to travel to the United States.” Iraqis who have received the visas, the statement said, may use them, and the “U.S. Embassy in Baghdad will continue to process and issue S.I.V.s to applicants who are otherwise qualified.” For the family of a 37-year-old Iraqi who once worked as an interpreter for American forces, the news was a joyous surprise after nearly a week of upended travel plans. An embassy official called to inform family members that they were again permitted to fly to the United States. “I’m shocked all over again,” said the former interpreter, who asked to be identified only by his first name and an initial, Munther A., to protect relatives in Iraq.

147,"For a very long time, if you asked United States government officials their view on the value of the dollar, they would almost certainly decline to answer. “The currency is the purview of the Treasury secretary,” they’d say. If you asked the Treasury secretary his view of the dollar, the answer would be equally rote: “A strong dollar is in the interest of the United States.” Those words have been so standard that when Paul O’Neill deviated from it in an interview with a German newspaper in 2001, he caused a kerfuffle in global currency markets and quickly backtracked. The Trump administration looks to be taking a different approach. Officials, including the president himself, have been breaking tradition and talking about currency markets — and in many cases, suggesting that the dollar is too highly valued. But the Trump administration has also offered contradictory signals about just what it wants to see happen on currency markets, with tension building between the administration’s stated goals and the policies it says it advocates. Predicting the direction of currency policy in the Trump administration requires parsing the words and policy proposals that come from several different places. Both before and since the inauguration, Donald J. Trump has weighed in on currency issues more than any of his recent predecessors. “Our dollar is too strong,” he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in mid-January. “And our companies can’t compete” because the currency is too strong. “It’s killing us,” he said. Mr. Trump enlarged on this theme in comments this week at a meeting with pharmaceutical executives. “We know nothing about devaluation,” he said. “Every other country lives on devaluation. You look at what China’s doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years — they played the money market, they played the devaluation market, and we sit there like a bunch of dummies.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/upshot/should-dollar-rise-or-fall-the-trump-teams-message-is-garbled.html?searchResultPosition=39

Corruption is nothing new here, but the scale and implications of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) affair are staggering. It may be the world’s largest money-laundering scandal involving a sitting head of government. The case is being investigated by authorities in at least six foreign states, including the U.S. Justice Department. Yet there’s been no mutiny within Mr. Najib’s party, no vote of censure in Parliament, no mass protests. In both 2015 and 2016, tens of thousands of supporters of Bersih, an electoral-reform movement, took to the streets calling for Mr. Najib’s resignation. But the demonstrations don’t seem to have loosened his grip on his party, the United Malays National Organization, nor UMNO’s grip on Malaysia: UMNO has been governing the country in coalition governments for six decades. Mahathir Mohamad, a former prime minister and former mentor of Mr. Najib who recently left UMNO, blames the political stagnation on personal patronage — or what he calls “animal feed.” Others blame it on disarray within the opposition, an uneasy assemblage of parties representing different ethnic and religious interests. But both explanations place too much emphasis on agency among the elites and too little on structural causes. Mr. Najib remains in power because Malaysia has become an electoral one-party state and because UMNO has captured the Muslim-Malay majority by peddling communalism under the guise of promoting equality.

An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees’ lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers. Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act’s market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not? “We need some certainty around the rules,” said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system. “We have a few months, but we don’t have a lot of time,” he said. With the official end on Tuesday of what was supposed to be its final open enrollment season, the Affordable Care Act is looking more resilient than it seemed just a month ago.

151,"Until the Trump presidency became a reality, the main order of business in any review of “24: Legacy” would have been to assess whether the franchise is still viable without Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland’s memorable counterterrorism operative, as its lead character. Now, though, and especially given the events of the past week, it’s the show’s chosen villains, not its hero, who demand attention. That’s because a good number of them speak in foreign accents, and some embody President Trump’s bogyman of the moment, the radical Muslim terrorist. This round of “24” begins Sunday night on Fox after the biggest lead-in television can offer, the Super Bowl, and the first thing viewers will see is foreign terrorists ransacking a home whose owner, an Army Ranger, is tied to a chair and covered in blood. The intruders have already killed his wife and child. “This is for Sheik Bin-Khalid,” one of them says before shooting the ranger in the head. The premiere was filmed back when it seemed unlikely that Mr. Trump would be elected — it was screened in New York on Nov. 7 — but the opening moments play as if they were scripted to support the immigration restrictions he imposed last week. The series grows considerably more layered as it goes along, with the panoply of villains encompassing a variety of demographics, yet the choice of a bin Laden surrogate as the starting point is sure to reignite the debate over the demonization of Muslims that “24” has encountered before. The new hero is Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins of “Straight Outta Compton”), who led the squad of Rangers who killed Bin-Khalid, preventing a devastating attack on the United States. For their safety, the Rangers involved were given new identities and stress-free jobs, but Eric quickly discovers that all but he and Ben Grimes (Charlie Hofheimer), an unstable fellow, have been tracked down and killed. The men hunting the Rangers, we learn, are interested less in revenge than in something taken during the Bin-Khalid raid. The signature “24” format — each episode represents an hour in real time — is as pulse-pounding as ever. One ingredient that has more or less disappeared, at least in the first four episodes, is the use of torture as a reliable way to get information, a frequent target of “24” critics. But while Jack Bauer’s violent tactics were repellent, the inner darkness they suggested gave the character a certain complexity. He could show fatherly concern about his daughter one minute and draw blood from a bad guy the next. Eric Carter isn’t as complicated or, as a result, as memorable, at least in the early going, though, by the fourth hour, the character has begun to gain traction.

152,"BEIJING — President Trump’s combative phone call with Australia’s prime minister over a refugee agreement has set off a political storm in that country, one that threatens to weaken support for a seven-decade alliance with the United States just as many Australians say they want closer ties with China. Enthusiasm for the alliance in Australia, one of America’s closest partners, which hosts American spy facilities and rotations of American Marines, had already been under pressure from China, with which Australia conducts the most trade. Reports that Mr. Trump had scolded Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday, before abruptly ending the call, are likely to further undermine confidence in the United States, Australian analysts said. “Trump is needlessly damaging the deep trust that binds one of America’s closest alliances,” said Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University in Canberra. “China and those wishing to weaken the strongest alliance in the Pacific will see opportunity in this moment.” In less than two weeks in office, Mr. Trump’s actions have strained alliances and alienated potential partners of the United States, and his phone call with Mr. Turnbull seemed to be one more example, this time with a country that has fought on America’s side since World War I. His administration’s confrontational stance on Iran has undermined liberal voices in that country; his restrictions on immigration from some predominantly Muslim  countries have been widely criticized by allies; and his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal threatens to push countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, closer to China. Like many countries in the region, Australia depends on the United States for its security but looks to China for its economic well-being, and it does not want to choose definitively between the two as they wage a global contest for power.

That love of New Zealand might seem strange to people who have taken Mr. Trump’s promises to heart.

According to a statement issued this week by the White House, Mr. Trump will retain an executive order from 2014 that bars discrimination against LGBTQ people at companies that do business with the federal government. The order was one of several issued by President Obama to improve working conditions for people whose employers are federal contractors or subcontractors. As the nation’s chief executive, the president has both the duty and the prerogative to set rules for companies that contract with the government. Still, such orders often serve a political as well as a practical purpose. By establishing rules for companies that do business with the government, presidents communicate the standards they would like to see throughout the entire work force. Mr. Trump has sided with Mr. Obama — and with history and decency — by retaining the LGBTQ anti-discrimination order. But for his stance against discrimination to have broad impact, it needs to be paired with support for Mr. Obama’s other workplace protections. As early as this week, Congress will likely send Mr. Trump a fast-track bill to roll back final rules intended to implement the “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” executive order, signed by Mr. Obama in 2014. The order requires federal contractors to disclose their labor law violations when bidding for federal contracts to ensure that violations are resolved before government contracts are awarded. One provision in the order specifically protects workers who allege discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity or religion or harrassment of a sexual nature. It prohibits employers from requiring that such allegations be resolved in private arbitration. Rather, accusers would have the right to go to court to resolve their disputes. No president, no American, can claim to support the rights of others while closing the courthouse door to those whose rights have been violated. The bill to undo “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” deserves a veto. Signing it would undercut Mr. Trump’s own statements about defending American workers, in general, and LGBTQ rights, in particular.

Last month, the Department of Homeland Security, under the Obama administration, awarded $10 million in grants to more than two dozen community groups and cities for programs to counter recruitment efforts by terrorist and white supremacist groups. The group in Minnesota decided to reject the money after Trump administration officials were reported to be considering reshaping the program to target only Muslims. The effort, now known as Countering Violent Extremism, or C.V.E., would be renamed Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, Reuters reported on Thursday. That group, Ka Joog, which works with Somali youths in Minneapolis, said in a statement that its board had decided not to take the nearly $500,000 it was awarded last month because it believed that its efforts had “been hindered by the Trump administration to instill fear, uncertainty and anti-Muslim sentiments.” The Michigan group, Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities, in Dearborn, said it would also reject $500,000 in federal aid. Suehaila Amen, an executive board member, said that her group had already been discussing before the Reuters report came out whether to accept the grant, because some in the community see the hotly disputed program as a way to spy on Muslims. But the decision was sealed by Mr. Trump’s statements and actions, Ms. Amen said. “You’re talking about a president who has maligned the Muslims throughout the entire campaign,” she said. “We don’t feel like we need to compromise our integrity, transparency and integrity in the community for some money or funding.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/trump-muslim-groups-aid-extremism.html?searchResultPosition=21

163,"He has been praised as a visionary with a healthy ego. He describes himself as a lucky white male. Evan Spiegel, the 26-year-old chief executive of Snap, may be all these things, but one thing is certain — he has a singular approach to business. Snap’s initial public offering, one of the most eagerly anticipated this year, will vault Mr. Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, the co-founder of Snapchat, into the ranks of tech billionaires. It will also bring the company’s approach to business, often credited to Mr. Spiegel’s atypical way of seeing things, into the public eye. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, is expected this week to reveal the paperwork for its initial public offering, showing how it is doing as a business and whether the valuation it is reportedly seeking ($20 billion to $25 billion) is justified. The choice to go public is as much a sign of Mr. Spiegel’s unconventional approach as his original idea to focus on the “right now” with Snapchat when other social media were looking at people’s past. Even as other start-ups have opted to stay private for as long as possible, he has long maintained that a public offering was best for the company. Anthony Scaramucci will not be taking a senior job at the White House as previously announced. Reince Priebus, President Trump’s chief of staff, and Stephen K.

164,"BUDAPEST — When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last paid a visit to Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban was under siege for his autocratic style, Russia was isolated for its seizure of Crimea, and both men were called xenophobes for their hard-line stance on immigration. Two years later, as Mr. Putin landed on Thursday for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era, it was a different story. Both men feel vindicated. There is talk of lifting the economic sanctions placed on Russia for its land grab in Ukraine. Their brand of nationalism has moved from the fringe to the mainstream. There was a note of triumphalism, even a bit of swagger, in the air. “We all sense, it’s in the air, that the world is in the process of a substantial realignment,” Mr. Orban said in a news conference after Thursday’s meeting. “We believe this will create favorable conditions for stronger Russian-Hungarian relations.” Even so, beneath the triumph lies a strain of uneasiness. The visit is expected to be fairly low-key, an indication of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration, analysts say. President Trump’s intentions remain unclear, and the prospects of a grand bargain between Washington and the Kremlin are highly uncertain. In the meantime, leaders across Europe have been forced to recalculate the best way to balance pressures in the East and West. Nowhere is that challenge felt more keenly than in Central and Eastern Europe, historically torn between Russia and the West. That means European and global leaders are closely scrutinizing the visit. They are looking for hints of how aggressive Mr. Putin and populist leaders like Mr. Orban will be in capitalizing on this new international climate and on Mr. Trump’s stated desire for better relations with Moscow.

165,"The revelation by his longtime doctor that President Trump takes a medication to prevent hair loss has piqued curiosity about the drug. In an interview with The New York Times, the physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said that Mr. Trump takes finasteride, also marketed as Propecia. The drug, a one-a-day pill, is a popular treatment for so-called male-pattern hair loss, in which the hairline recedes and hair thins at the temples and crown, sometimes to the point of leaving just a horseshoe-shaped fringe around the sides and the back of the head. The culprit in this type of baldness is a male hormone, dihydrotestosterone or DHT. In some men, hair follicles are particularly sensitive to it, probably based on genetics. DHT forms when an enzyme converts testosterone into it; finasteride blocks the enzyme, lowering DHT levels. The drug is better at stopping hair loss than at bringing back what’s already gone. “I set expectations from the beginning, realistic expectations” about the drug, said Dr. Andrew Alexis, the chairman of the dermatology department at Mount Sinai St. Luke’s and Mount Sinai West in New York. “The thing I emphasize the most is stopping progression and preserving the hair you have. I think it’s very successful at doing that. “ Dr. Alexis is not involved with Mr. Trump’s care. Most men with this type of hair loss start treatment with a different drug, minoxidil, also sold as Rogaine, which is rubbed into the scalp, Dr. Alexis said. If they do not see enough of an effect, they can add finasteride. Many of his patients wind up using both drugs, Dr. Alexis said. The treatment works best on the top of the head, and not as well at the temples and the receding hairline. For both drugs, the effects on hair loss were discovered by accident, when patients were taking them for other reasons. Minoxidil, in pill form, was used to treat high blood pressure, and finasteride was prescribed for prostate enlargement. But balding patients noticed that some hair grew back. Finasteride can have side effects, including decreased sex drive, erectile problems and a decreased volume of ejaculate. But those reactions are not common, affecting less than 2 percent of the men in studies. Dr. Alexis said he warns patients about the potential problems, and that some men decline the drug as a result. But many decide to try it, and they generally stick with it, he said. The drug also carries a warning that men 55 and over who take it may have an increased risk of an aggressive type of prostate cancer. But the warning is based on studies of a dose five times higher than the dose used for hair loss. The higher dose is used to treat enlarged prostates. The risk, if any, for men taking the smaller dose is not known, Dr. Alexis said. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/health/donald-trump-hair-growth-drug-propecia.html?searchResultPosition=17
166,"The Justice Department this week rescinded the Obama administration’s policy of speeding up hearings and deportations of families and children seeking refuge in the United States, a move applauded by immigration advocates who had called the practice unfair and ineffective. The expedited hearings were started in 2014 to deal with increasing numbers of people fleeing Central America, in hopes of deterring additional migration. But the policy was largely viewed as a failure in that regard, as even more people from the region sought relief in the past two years than in 2014. The reversal this week was a rare occasion for advocates to cheer the Trump administration after two weeks of moves they decried. “This is a good thing,” said Bryan Johnson, an immigration lawyer in New York. “They are going back to common sense.” The reversal, explained in a memo from the country’s chief immigration judge, MaryBeth Keller, to judges nationwide, said the change would let the courts focus more on immigrants in detention centers who are awaiting deportation hearings, a costly population and a higher priority for the government. Families and children applying for asylum are usually not detained while their cases are being considered. Lauren Alder, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Justice Department that oversees the immigration courts, said the new policy reflected “the present state of the immigration system,” adding that changes in court practices “should not be interpreted as long-term solutions to fix the broken system, but are short-term solutions to manage the growing caseload.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/justice-department-deportation-trump.html?searchResultPosition=16
167,"Updated March 13, 2018: President Trump announced that he had ousted Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and intended to replace him with Mike Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director. Mr. Trump also named Gina Haspel as his choice to become the next C.I.A. director. WASHINGTON — As a clandestine officer at the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002, Gina Haspel oversaw the torture of a terrorism suspect and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting the brutal interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand. On Thursday, Ms. Haspel was named the deputy director of the C.I.A. The elevation of Ms. Haspel, a veteran widely respected among her colleagues, to the No. 2 job at the C.I.A. was a rare public signal of how, under the Trump administration, the agency is being led by officials who appear to take a far kinder view of one of its darker chapters than their immediate predecessors. Over the past eight years, C.I.A. leaders defended dozens of agency personnel who had taken part in the now-banned torture program, even as they vowed never to resume the same harsh interrogation methods. But President Trump has said repeatedly that he thinks torture works. And the new C.I.A. chief, Mike Pompeo, has said that waterboarding and other techniques do not even constitute torture, and praised as “patriots” those who used such methods in the early days of the fight against Al Qaeda. Ms. Haspel, who has spent most of her career undercover, would certainly fall within Mr. Pompeo’s description. She played a direct role in the C.I.A.’s “extraordinary rendition program,” under which captured militants were handed to foreign governments and held at secret facilities, where they were tortured by agency personnel.

Mr. Turnbull pressed Mr. Trump to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. The American president called it a “dumb deal.” But Mr. Trump’s brand of nationalism is likely to be better received elsewhere. Leaders in Egypt, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey are among those who hope for a U.S. less inclined to criticize their human rights records. • View of Islam influences policy.

169,"HOUSTON — The N.F.L. Players Association said Thursday that it was opposed to President Trump’s temporary ban on refugees and on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. “Our Muslim brothers in this league, we got their backs,” said Eric Winston, the union’s president. “These guys are players in the National Football League; their families are our families.” There are believed to be only a handful of Muslim players in the league. Mohamed Sanu, a wide receiver on the Atlanta Falcons who is Muslim, was one of the few players this week who expressed an opinion to reporters about the ban. “It’s a very tough situation, and I just pray that us as a country and a world can be united as one,” he said Monday. “It’s really hard for me to talk about this right now. It would take a lot of time, so I just want to focus on the game and focus on football.” The union’s opposition to the president’s executive order came a day after N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell would not clarify the league’s stance on the issue. “As commissioner of the N.F.L., I’m singularly focused on the Super Bowl right now,” Goodell said at a news conference on Wednesday. “As I said before, we have a unique position to have an event on Sunday that will bring the world together. They will have an opportunity to be entertained, to feel good about what we’re doing, and that’s something that we feel very proud of.” DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the players’ union, also addressed other player issues on Thursday. He said the players were not willing to trade a portion of their share of the league’s revenue in return for reducing the commissioner’s disciplinary powers. The union has fought the league several times in court to reverse the commissioner’s suspensions of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and other players. Smith said the union was also looking at the potential use of medical marijuana to assist players dealing with pain. “The time has come to look at it somewhat different,” he said, adding that 4,900 injuries were reported last season. “We want to look at the issue of pain comprehensively.” The N.F.L. opposes allowing players to use medical marijuana, though Goodell said Wednesday that he would look at the issue if it was part of a broader renegotiation of the league’s labor agreement.

170,"UNITED NATIONS — Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, condemned Russia on Thursday for its recent “aggressive actions” in eastern Ukraine. “We do want to better our relations with Russia,” Ms. Haley said during her first remarks to an open briefing of the United Nations Security Council. “However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.” She made it clear that American sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea would remain in place. During her Senate confirmation hearing last month, Ms. Haley also expressed support for continuing the sanctions and accused Russia of committing war crimes in the Syrian conflict. But her strong criticism of the government of President Vladimir V. Putin put her at odds with President Trump, who has expressed a desire for warmer relations with the Kremlin. Her Russian counterpart, Vitaly I. Churkin, told reporters after the meeting that it would be “frivolous” to speculate on whether the Trump administration would be friendlier than that of President Barack Obama. “I don’t want to make any predictions,” Mr. Churkin said. “My intention is to try to do my best to establish a good working relationship with the head of the new U.S. delegation.” “They’re just in their first few days,” he added. Mr. Churkin said he expected to meet with Ms. Haley on Friday. The conflict in eastern Ukraine escalated in recent days, after Mr. Trump spoke by phone on Saturday with Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump has said he admires. Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists of aggression. Mr. Putin, by contrast, blamed a financially struggling Ukraine, and its need for money from the international community, for the escalation. “The best way to get that,” Mr. Putin said Thursday on a visit to Budapest, “is to portray yourselves as victims of aggression.” The Ukrainian ambassador, Volodymyr Y. Yelchenko, who presides over Security Council deliberations this month, accused Russia of carrying out war crimes.

171,"BERKELEY, Calif. — What do you do as a reporter when a protest begins? You cover it. But what about when the man being protested is known for rhetoric that makes you nauseated? Or when you see a student get beaten up because he looked “like a Nazi”? How do you remain objective? Those were the questions that faced me when, as a reporter for the student newspaper at the University of California, Berkeley, I covered the protest on Wednesday  night at the college that turned violent, drawing national attention. I didn’t know what to think about it all, and truthfully, I still don’t. The protesters were demonstrating against a scheduled speech on campus by Milo Yiannopoulos, a Breitbart editor and right-wing provocateur, who had been invited by the Berkeley College Republicans. This was always going to be a controversial event. Mr. Yiannopoulos has been giving inflammatory speeches on a college tour meant to push back against what he sees as the stifling politically correct left. But his language has veered decidedly toward hate speech. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, for example, he singled out a transgender student for ridicule by name. Because of actions like that, many Berkeley students and more than 100 faculty members petitioned the university to block the event, but the chancellor, Nicholas Dirks, declined to do so, citing free speech. This, of course, raises questions about free speech: Is it free speech if it makes us feel unsafe in our own skin? On the other hand, what does this campus represent if it doesn’t respect the rights of people with whom many of us disagree?

It is meant to intercept North Korea’s medium-range missiles. “Were it not for the provocative behavior of North Korea, we would have no need for Thaad out here,” Mr. Mattis added. “There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about Thaad.” South Korea was a logical first stop for Mr. Mattis, who will also visit Japan on the trip.

The most recent one was a contentious phone call between Mr. Trump and the Australian prime minister, which was disclosed just as Mr. Mattis began his Asia trip.

The dozens arrested belong to what the Morton County Sheriff’s Department described in a statement as a “rogue group” that had set up camp on private property south of the Backwater Bridge, the site of previous standoffs between demonstrators and the police. After instructing the group to take down the camp, law enforcement officers advanced on the site around 3:30 p.m. local time and cleared the area within about a half-hour, according to the statement. “Regardless of this incident, it is our desire to continue the dialogue with tribal and camp leaders so that the camps continue to be cleaned and protesters leave prior to the flooding season,” the Morton County sheriff, Kyle Kirchmeier, said in a statement. Representatives of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe worked with officers to collect tepee hides left at the site, according to the department, which said it had made nearly 700 arrests during protests since Aug. 10. “We hope the arrestees are treated fairly and justly,” David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock reservation’s official tribal government, said in a statement.

The phone call last Saturday between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull turned contentious after the Australian leader pressed the president to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center.

177,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, at loggerheads with congressional Republicans over the best way to overhaul the tax code, may have come toward Capitol Hill on a key sticking point, the way imports should be taxed, after a meeting at the White House on Thursday, said Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Congressional Republicans are trying to nudge Mr. Trump away from one of his big campaign promises: a 35 percent tariff on any product made by an American company at an overseas factory, then imported into the United States market. Success in getting the president off that applause line will be critical to getting tax legislation passed in 2017 and fulfilling a central promise that Republicans have been making to voters for years. At the same time, both sides want to end what they see as a penalty on American exporters, who compete with overseas factories that can game the system for lower tax rates. “Like us, they’re just not satisfied with a tax code today that favors foreign products over U.S. products, and I think they are looking carefully at ending that ‘made in America’ export tax so that we can compete around the world,” Mr. Brady, Republican of Texas, said of the Trump administration. At the White House meeting, Mr. Brady was joined by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat, and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means. The conversation with Mr. Trump also focused on trade and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Brady’s plan would also essentially levy a 20 percent tax on all imports, to create revenue and spur domestic production and exports — a notion Mr. Trump has said is overly complicated. The prospect of such a sweeping change has stirred fears among big companies in the retail and energy sectors, which rely heavily on imports, and created a backlash that could scuttle plans to slash tax rates without adding to the deficit. The split within corporate America over the shape of a tax code rewrite was on display Thursday as Freedom Partners, an advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, called on Republicans to “scrap” the border tax idea, which it warned would mean higher prices for consumers. Also Thursday, a new business group, the American Made Coalition, began to rally support around the tax plan championed by Mr. Brady and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.

President Bill Clinton liked Indian food from the Bombay Club and the occasional run to McDonald’s. President Barack Obama spent eight years dining all over town, eating everything from upscale Italian at Fiola Mare to truffle macaroni and cheese at Equinox. President Trump, a culinary creature of habit and junk food aficionado, seems content, for now, to ensconce himself in the White House rather than partake of the dining options in increasingly foodie Washington. But in this overwhelmingly Democratic city, where even a local hoagie chain owner faced a storm of criticism for attending a meeting on small businesses with Mr. Trump at the White House, restaurateurs are hoping that Ivanka Trump, and not necessarily her father, turns up. “I can’t see him sitting down and having a bowl of gumbo,” said Gus DiMillo, whose restaurant group owns Acadiana, which specializes in Cajun-Creole fare. “I’m more curious about Ivanka.” A precisely put-together entrepreneur, mother of three and wife to Jared Kushner, a top White House adviser, Ms. Trump will most likely continue the work she did on the campaign trail to humanize her father and promote the family brand in Washington. But many residents are still smarting from the results of the election and wondering what will happen to an urban renaissance and an explosion of restaurants, bars and nightclubs that coincided with Mr. Obama’s time in office. Nicholas Stefanelli, the head chef and owner of Masseria, a restaurant frequently visited by the former first lady, Michelle Obama, said that Washington took on the characteristics of each administration in power — but that the Trumps would probably have to adapt to the dining and night-life culture of the city, not the other way around.

Amid a storm of protest, Mr. Trump on Thursday continued to stick by the ban as essential to the safety of the nation, saying that in the “coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty.” “We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values,” Mr. Trump said at the National Prayer Breakfast. Now, the Department of Homeland Security’s internal auditor has entered the fray. The office of the department’s inspector general announced late Wednesday that it would review how the agency carried out the executive order, which suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days and blocked for 90 days citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The auditor said the review was a response to requests from Congress, whistle-blowers and to complaints received on a hotline. In addition to reviewing how the Department of Homeland Security carried out the executive order, the inspector general’s office said it would review the agency’s adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct. The inspector general’s office, which did not say how long its review would take, said it could look into other issues as well. Following Mr. Trump’s order, the State Department went even further than prohibiting those outside the country from entering: It issued an internal memorandum revoking the visas of all nationals from those countries, without notifying them, even those who are legally studying, working and living in the United States.

181,"Thousands of Yemeni-Americans and their supporters rallied in Brooklyn on Thursday to denounce President Trump’s executive order on immigration, hours after hundreds of Yemeni-owned bodegas and grocery stores around New York closed to protest the order. Waving American and Yemeni flags and holding signs in English and Arabic, the demonstrators filled the plaza at Borough Hall. They gathered for the Islamic sunset prayer and listened intently as a series of public officials greeted them with the words “Assalamu alaikum” and condemned the president’s order, which temporarily bars citizens of Yemen and six other majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. “This order goes against everything we came here for and everything America stands for,” said Abdul Salam Mubaraz, a bodega owner who had closed his shop for the day and spoke from the stage. For people fleeing war-torn countries like Yemen, he said, the restrictions amounted to “having the door of freedom shut by President Trump.” Yemeni-owned bodegas are institutions in many New York neighborhoods, selling coffee and bagels, groceries, umbrellas and many other items. Organizers said several hundred had closed from noon to 8 p.m. on Thursday in protest, which Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, told the crowd, sent “a loud and clear message to America.” Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed support for the protesters on Twitter. “New York City’s bodega owners are bravely shutting their doors to oppose the president’s shameful executive order,” Mr. de Blasio wrote. “I stand with them.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/nyregion/new-yorks-yemeni-owned-bodegas-close-to-protest-trumps-immigration-ban.html?searchResultPosition=28
182,"President Trump just reiterated his campaign promise to “get rid of and totally destroy” the law prohibiting churches and other nonprofit tax-exempt institutions from endorsing political candidates. This change would be horrible for politics — and even worse for religion. The law, known as the Johnson Amendment, was written by Lyndon B. Johnson, then a senator from Texas, in 1954. It prohibits tax-exempt churches from endorsing political candidates. Mr. Trump on Thursday said repealing the rule would “allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,” adding, “Freedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is under serious threat.” Let’s start by clearing up two misunderstandings. The rule does not prevent churches — or other charities — from speaking freely. Religious leaders and churches have been weighing in on political issues for as long as there have been pulpits. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Jeremiah Wright and thousands of clergy on any given weekend have been energetic advocates of political or social causes. The rule does not even prohibit clergy from endorsing a candidate. Rather, it says that if a religious leader endorses a candidate, then his church cannot receive the significant benefit of tax exemption, and that people cannot, therefore, make a tax-deductible contribution to that church. Eliminating the endorsement rule would mean that your tax dollars would now indirectly subsidize a church’s support for a particular political candidate. For instance, conservative taxpayers would indirectly support the Rev. Al Sharpton if he decided to endorse a candidate — or the local mosque that wanted to endorse a candidate. And progressives would indirectly support churches that endorse candidates who are opposed to same-sex marriage. The conservatives clamoring for this change should think hard: They don’t like their tax dollars going to support groups that perform abortions. Do they really want to pay for churches that push pro-choice candidates? They fear and distrust Islam. Do they really want their hard-earned money to back the preferred political candidates of the local Islamic center?

183,"Republicans on Thursday took one of their first steps to officially dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations by easing restrictions on coal mining, bolstering an industry that President Trump has made a symbol of America’s neglected heartland. Using an obscure law that allows Congress to review regulations before they take effect, the Senate voted to reverse the Stream Protection Rule, which seeks to protect the nation’s waterways from debris generated by a practice called surface mining. The Interior Department had said the rule would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests by keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters. The Senate vote was 54 to 45, following a House vote for repeal on Wednesday. “Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams,” Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule, said on Wednesday. “Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business.” The Senate also moved to reverse a separate rule requiring publicly traded oil, gas and mineral companies to disclose payments to foreign governments for licenses or permits. The disclosure rule was aimed at curbing bribery and at helping resource-rich developing countries hold fossil-fuel companies, and their governments, accountable. After a procedural vote on Thursday, final Senate action to cancel the rule is expected Friday, with Mr. Trump’s signature to follow. The Trump administration, which has vowed to peel back regulations, is particularly close to the fossil fuel industry. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed President Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil.

184,"SAN FRANCISCO — Travis Kalanick needed everyone to take a deep breath. The chief executive of Uber was holding a regularly scheduled all-hands meeting on Tuesday at the ride-hailing company’s San Francisco headquarters when he faced an onslaught of questions from upset employees. Uber was under attack — unfairly, many staff members believed — after people accused the company of seeking to profit from giving rides to airport customers in New York during weekend protests against President Trump’s immigration order. But there was another matter disturbing the employees: Mr. Kalanick himself. He had joined Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council in December. After the immigration order against refugees and seven Muslim-majority countries, many staff members wondered why Mr. Kalanick was still willing to advise the president. “What would it take for you to quit the economic council?” at least two employees asked at the Tuesday meeting. On Thursday, Mr. Kalanick gave his answer, stepping down from Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,” Mr. Kalanick wrote in an email to employees obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Kalanick’s exit from the advisory council underscores the tricky calculus facing many Silicon Valley corporate chieftains who try to work with the new administration. On one hand, many tech executives have openly tried to engage with the president, a path that is typically good for business. Yet Mr. Trump’s immigration order has been so unpopular with so many tech workers — many of whom are immigrants themselves and who advocate globalization — that they are now exerting pressure on their chief executives to push back forcefully against the administration.

185,"Not long ago, many Republican officeholders had a simple answer when asked about the changing climate: What changing climate? But the public began to notice the heat waves and the torrential rains and the tidal flooding. So then we had the “I am not a scientist” phase, with one lawmaker after another fending off climate questions with that formula. That drew such ridicule that Republicans critical of climate science had to come up with a more nuanced answer. Several variations on the new approach were on display recently during confirmation hearings for some of President Trump’s cabinet nominees. “Science tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,” Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate committee. “The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.” Let us ponder the craftsmanship of that second sentence. “With precision” is the key phrase, of course, and it renders the statement almost axiomatically true. Do we have trouble taking the precise temperature of an entire planet and then divining, for a given period, exactly how much of the change in that temperature is caused by human activities?

We asked the Times reporter Jonathan Martin, who began covering then candidate Trump in the spring of 2015. President Donald J. Trump looks a lot like …candidate Donald J. Trump. There are the Twitter-borne insults, the constant staff leaks and backbiting and the exhausting whirlwind of controversy and chaos. If it is Wednesday, it must be contretemps with Iran.

Speaking of health, covering Mr. Trump is like practicing journalism on a treadmill. It can be difficult to keep up. This is all to say that what is striking about the early days of the Trump administration is how very little D.J.T., as his staff likes to call him, has changed since he became the most powerful man in the world. The presidency can be sobering: the nuclear codes, the intelligence briefings, the weight of history. But if entering the White House has changed Mr. Trump, he is not showing it. He is still mocking his rivals and the news media, he continues to propagate conspiracy theories such as the falsehood that there were millions of illegal votes in the election, and he still spends a good deal of time watching television news. He has made no adjustments in the way he refers to U.S. allies, including Mexico, now that he speaks for an entire nation. There is a reason that during the campaign, speculation from TV-bound pundits about a potential Trump “pivot” became a sort-of inside joke among the reporters covering the race: It was never going to happen.

He is no conservative, and says he is disappointed that the latest nominee to the court is from the White House of President Trump. Yet in the opinion pages of The New York Times on Tuesday, Katyal made a forceful case for Trump’s pick to the high court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Katyal called the nominee a man of principle who will uphold the rule of law, and “bring a sense of fairness and decency to the job, and a temperament that suits the nation’s highest court.” The author says he knows this because he has seen Gorsuch in action, both in court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve. What Katyal did not mention — and the Op-Ed page did not disclose in his bio — is that he has cases pending before the Supreme Court. Katyal was identified as a former solicitor general, a law professor at Georgetown University and a private litigator at the law firm Hogan Lovells. But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb, Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court. Some readers would have liked to know more about Katyal’s background. Here’s one email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands, N.J. I took this concern to both Op-Ed page and to Katyal himself. Jim Dao, the Op-Ed editor, said the editors had not been aware of Katyal’s cases before the court. Writers are required to disclose potential conflicts, he said, but the process got rushed in this case. “Editors do try to ask writers directly,” he said. “On tight deadlines — and the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline — the question doesn’t always get asked.

Stephen A. Feinberg, the founder, has held discussions with President Trump’s transition team about “a senior role,” according to a letter to Cerberus investors on Thursday that was reviewed by DealBook. The firm said that were he to take such a position, he would have to publicly disclose significant amounts of information about his finances. That could bring uncomfortable scrutiny upon Cerberus again. The $30 billion firm has been criticized for owning Remington, which made the rifle used in the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. After the shooting, Cerberus sought unsuccessfully to sell its interest in the gun maker, then offered its investors a way to cash out their stakes in the business. Cerberus said it had a succession plan in place if Mr. Feinberg were to leave, though it declined to elaborate. Mr. Feinberg, 56, has been a notable backer of Republican candidates and had served on Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council.

The Obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!” First, the “illegal immigrants” are in fact desperate people fleeing conflict whose status as refugees has in most cases been officially recognized. Second, as refugees, they have the right, under the Geneva Conventions, of which the United States is a signatory, to be treated “without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin.” Third, the “thousands” are in fact about 1,250 of the 2,500 men, women and children who, for more than three years now, have been marooned on two remote South Pacific islands, Manus and Nauru, in appalling conditions that have seen suicide, deaths through negligence, a killing, and relentless mental abuse. Fourth, this “dumb deal” reflects the pressing Australian interest in finding a way out of its predicament with the refugees and the American interest in strengthening its Australian alliance at a time when United States Marines are rotating through Darwin and China is flexing its muscles in the South China Sea. Fifth, diplomacy is about identifying shared interests; it stands no chance when the tweeted tantrums of a tempestuous president constitute Washington’s highest-level communications with a world held in America-first contempt. The notion must cross Tillerson’s mind that Trump’s inaccurate tweet is needless provocation of a friend; that simultaneously infuriating Asian and European allies may not be smart; and that his task will be a thankless one as Trump’s White House coterie hatches seat-of-the-pants policy and leaves his already restive State Department to deal with weighty issues in Luxembourg and the Solomon Islands. Let’s further imagine that all this passes through Tillerson’s head before he grabs the Washington Post and discovers that Trump has taken his Australia bashing further. He has hung up on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after telling him it’s his “worst call by far” with world leaders (behind Vladimir Putin, of course), and accused Turnbull of preparing to send the next “Boston bombers” America’s way. At which point Tillerson must really be wondering — as is the rest of the world after two weeks of fast-tracked chaos from Trump. The president wants to run the United States like his business, with scant accountability and contempt for rules. Fine, except that bankruptcy is the worst conceivable outcome for a business whereas nuclear war is the worst conceivable outcome for America and all of humanity. Trump is in way over his skis. From the pointless, counterproductive, prejudice-reeking temporary ban on immigration from seven mainly Muslim countries to a botched Navy SEAL raid on Al Qaeda in Yemen, the same traits of haste and imprudence have been apparent.

hen I first met Yang Jinkai, two days before he boarded a plane for America, the smog hanging over his industrial home city, Shenyang, had turned the sun into a ghostly orb. The 16-year-old paced around the family apartment as his mother labeled his suitcases and packed them with the comforts of home: quilted pajamas, chopsticks, instant noodles. She gestured toward a lone memento that would remain in his bedroom, a life-size needlepoint portrait of her only child, woven in shimmering gold thread. “I worked on that all year,” she said. “I knew this moment would come.” Yang had never traveled outside China. But he had already chosen a new first name for his life in America, Korbin (“That sounds American, right?”), and was daydreaming about the adventure ahead. “It will be magical,” he said. “I’ll make lots of American friends. I’d like to have an American girlfriend. Maybe” — he shot a glance at his father — “I’ll even get a gun.” Over the summer, Korbin had been working on his English by watching, perhaps too zealously, the American television series “Criminal Minds.” To help Korbin escape the competitive straitjacket of the Chinese education system, his father had paid nearly $40,000 to an education consultancy to get him enrolled in a public high school in Michigan. The Yang family’s ultimate goal was for Korbin to attend a top American university, and the name of his new high school, Oxford, only added to the allure. It didn’t matter that the place had no connection to the British university or that this Oxford was a small town north of Detroit. “My father,” Korbin said, “really likes the idea of an Oxford diploma.” Even as U.S.-China relations have slipped toward mutual antagonism, the flood of Chinese students coming to the United States has continued to rise. Roughly 370,000 students from the mainland are enrolled in American high schools and universities, six times more than a decade ago. Their financial impact — $11.4 billion was contributed to the American economy in 2015, according to the Department of Commerce — has turned education into one of America’s top “exports” to China. It is a strange historical moment when the elites of a rising power send their only sons and daughters, products of China’s former one-child policy, to the schools of a geopolitical rival. Yet the idea of a liberal Western education exerts an almost talismanic hold over China’s ruling classes. While the country’s educational emphasis on rote memorization churns out some of the world’s best test-takers, many Chinese families harbor worries that diverge sharply from those of the tiger parents of popular conception. They fret about the toll competition exacts from their coddled offspring; they wonder if their child’s creativity is being stifled. Even President Xi Jinping, who is presiding over a crackdown on Western influences in China’s schools, allowed his daughter to attend Harvard. According to a 2016 survey conducted by a Shanghai-based research firm, 83 percent of China’s millionaires are planning to send their children to school abroad. The average age, according to the poll, has dropped to 16 today from 18 in 2014 — the first time it has reached the high-school level.

193,"Shaun R. Harper has been at the center of the racial debate of the past year — first, as protests illuminated the concerns of students of color, then as the Trump triumph emboldened some to commit overt acts of bias, particularly against Latino and Muslim students. In his new book, “Race Matters in College,” due out in June from Johns Hopkins University Press, he provides a pathway for campuses struggling with these very issues. A leading scholar on racial equity in higher education, Dr. Harper will in July be leaving the University of Pennsylvania, where he founded and directed the Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education, and joining the University of Southern California, where he will teach and start up a similar center with big ambitions. One priority is a survey to assess the racial climate on the nation’s campuses. What is your reaction to the environment on campus following the Trump election and inauguration? The uptick in reports of racial bias reinforces my argument as to why it’s so important that colleges and universities be responsible for white students having access to a proper course of study in race. I was also struck by how many white people on college campuses were shocked to learn that there was so much racism in America. In fact, I use the election to address in my book why even the most educated white people were so naïve and blind to the realities of race. What prompted you to write your book? I saw this as an opportunity to help people understand that universities didn’t just all of a sudden become racist. They’ve been racist and exclusive from the start. I wanted to call attention to both the problems and the opportunities. When I say the opportunities, I mean the opportunity to actually force higher education institutions to follow through on their commitment to diversity. What makes you think universities breed racism? On most predominantly white campuses, people of color are overwhelmingly represented in food service, grounds keeping, custodial roles and fairly low-paid secretarial roles; and they are tragically underrepresented among tenured faculty members, deans, provosts and presidents, people who are in power. This sends a message to black and Latino students that they aren’t really valued. To their white counterparts, their expectation is that people of color work at the lowest levels of the organizations they lead. For example, the guys on the field are black men, but the coaches, commissioners and top executives at the N.C.A.A. are overwhelmingly white men. There is some real asymmetry there. If universities fail to address these issues in a meaningful way, what are the long-term effects? White people never thought before about their own underpreparation to even think about race, talk about race, and achieve racial equity. Companies and newsrooms say they want to achieve racial diversity but don’t know how. This is extremely consequential for our democracy. Our conversation about race in higher education has to start to include white people and pay some attention to their preparation, because otherwise, we’re going to continue to see an oversupply of white people in leadership positions in all sectors of our society and our economy. These are the people who will eventually shape public policies and teach future generations.

197,"WASHINGTON — This is a rare Supreme Court confirmation fight that will be more about the nominator than the nominee. In light of President Trump’s selection of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch just as the new president’s aggressive and contested use of executive power came into view, Democrats intend to aggressively question whether Judge Gorsuch will hold in check the man who seeks to elevate him to the nation’s most influential court. Democrats believe a unique sequence of events — issuing a constitutionally questionable executive order on Friday, firing an acting attorney general who refused to defend it on Monday and nominating a Supreme Court justice on Tuesday — places executive overreach and separation of powers squarely at the center of the confirmation debate. “His administration, at least at its outset, seems to have less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory, and is challenging the Constitution in unprecedented fashion,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said of Mr. Trump on Wednesday on the Senate floor. “There’s a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist.” Democrats will still meticulously pick through the record of Judge Gorsuch, who sits on the federal appeals court in Colorado, in search of disqualifying material, and they are already raising questions about what they see as business-friendly rulings. But it is easy to envision them pressing him directly on whether he found the recent executive order on immigration, and perhaps others, to be constitutional. The wrong answer for Democrats or a refusal to respond directly could then translate into a reason to oppose Mr. Gorsuch. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put it this way: The American people deserve a court that comprises those capable of “serving as an independent and vigilant check on the other branches of government.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-gorsuch-senate-democrats.html?searchResultPosition=71

By Min Jin Lee
490 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $27. Min Jin Lee’s stunning novel “Pachinko” — her second, after “Free Food for Millionaires” (2007) — announces its ambitions right from the opening sentence: “History has failed us, but no matter.” “Pachinko” chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family, first in Japanese-occupied Korea in the early 20th century, then in Japan itself from the years before World War II to the late 1980s. The novel opens with an arranged marriage in Yeongdo, a fishing village at the southern tip of Korea. That union produces a daughter, Sunja, who falls in love at 16 with a prominent (and married) mobster. After Sunja becomes pregnant, a local pastor offers her a chance to escape by marrying him and immigrating together to his brother’s house in an ethnic Korean neighborhood in Osaka. Together, they embark into the fraught unknown. Pachinko, the slot-machine-like game ubiquitous throughout Japan, unifies the central concerns of identity, homeland and belonging. For the ethnic Korean population in Japan, discriminated against and shut out of traditional occupations, pachinko parlors are the primary mode of finding work and accumulating wealth. Called Zainichi, or foreign residents, ethnic Koreans are required to reapply for alien registration cards every three years even if they were born in Japan, and are rarely granted passports, making overseas travel nearly impossible. From a young age, Sunja’s oldest son sees being Korean as “a dark, heavy rock”; his greatest, secret desire is to be Japanese. His younger brother, Mozasu, even after he accumulates great wealth through his pachinko parlors, confides to his closest Japanese friend: “In Seoul, people like me get called Japanese bastards, and in Japan, I’m just another dirty Korean no matter how much money I make or how nice I am.” Mozasu’s son, Solomon, learns this too quickly after graduating from an American university. He returns to Tokyo on an expat package with the Japanese branch of a British investment bank, then is fired once his ethnic Korean connections are no longer needed for a business deal. Still, Solomon is of a new, less wounded generation. He believes there are still good Japanese people and sees himself as Japanese, too, “even if the Japanese didn’t think so.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/books/review/pachinko-min-jin-lee.html?searchResultPosition=78
199,"LONDON — The European Union is accustomed to crises. But it is probably safe to say that none of the 28 leaders who are gathering in Malta on Friday expected the crisis that has overtaken the agenda: the United States of America. Like much of the world, the European Union is struggling to decipher a President Trump who seems every day to be picking a new fight with a new nation, whether friend or foe. Hopes among European leaders that Mr. Trump’s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating, replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement over how to proceed. If many foreign leaders expected a Trump administration to push to renegotiate trade deals, or take a tough line on immigration, few anticipated that he would become an equal opportunity offender. He has insulted or humiliated Mexico, Britain, Germany and Iraq; engaged in a war of words with China and Iran; and turned a routine phone call with the prime minister of Australia, a staunch ally, into a minor diplomatic crisis. With the possible exception of NATO, where he has softened his tone, Mr. Trump has expressed disdain for other multilateral institutions such as the European Union. His praise has been reserved for populists and strongmen, like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and, of course, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump is convinced that the United States has been played for a patsy by the rest of the world and is vowing to set things straight. “We’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually,” he said on Thursday at a prayer breakfast. “It’s not going to happen anymore.” Against this forbidding backdrop, some European leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that Mr. Trump may represent a truly dire challenge, one that threatens to upend not only the 70-year European project of integration and security, but just about everything they stand for, including liberal democracy itself.
