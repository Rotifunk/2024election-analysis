Can empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of another, help make us better people? Can it help make the world a better place? If we could gain a deeper sense of what it’s like to be somebody different from us — from a different part of the world, from the other side of the tracks, with a different skin color, religion or gender — would we become more generous, understanding or compassionate people? Can empathy help bridge the divides that fracture us as a nation and world? In this Text to Text, Jennifer Finney Boylan’s personal essay “Bring Moral Imagination Back in Style” and Nicholas Kristof’s Op-Ed “How Do We Increase Empathy?” take on those questions. Both pieces acknowledge that while learning to feel empathy may be challenging, it is a skill worth nurturing. _________ Background To become stronger, better, faster and more competitive athletes, we need to work out and practice. We need to exercise. We need to stretch, sweat and push our way out of our comfort zones to achieve a higher level of skill and performance. But what about the muscles needed to be an empathetically fit human being? How do we exercise those? And how do we create opportunities for greater compassion and empathy in our world? "
1,Greenpeace Activists Arrested After Hanging ‘Resist’ Banner in View of White House,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/greenpeace-resist-banner-protest-trump.html?searchResultPosition=109,2017/01/25,U.S.,"Seven environmental activists who climbed a crane near the White House early Wednesday morning in a protest against the policies of President Trump were arrested and charged, the police said on Thursday. The protesters, who volunteer for Greenpeace, began scaling the approximately 300-foot crane around 4 in the morning, and once they reached the top, unfurled a 70-by-35-foot banner embossed with a single word: “RESIST.” Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, the environmental advocacy organization, said the protesters were there “to resist the environmental, economic and racial injustice that Trump and his administration have already laid out and put into practice.” Mr. Nichols said they wanted to be sure that the banner would be visible from the White House. “Obviously, I have no idea if Trump has seen it, but that would be great if he did,” he said. In his first week in office, Mr. Trump’s administration instructed officials at the Environmental Protection Agency to freeze grants and contracts, and, according to Reuters, ordered the agency to remove the climate change page from its website. Mr. Trump has also resurrected the Keystone and Dakota Access pipeline projects that have been the subject of virulent protests by environmental activists. The Metropolitan Police Department said the protest led to street closings near the White House and snarled traffic. The seven protesters were arrested and charged with second-degree burglary, unlawful entry and destruction of property, according to a police statement, UPI reported. The crane, owned by Miller and Long D.C., is parked at a construction site three blocks north of the White House, Mr. Nichols said. The activists unfurled the banner about 9 a.m., he said. By 1 p.m., they began their descent, and reached ground after 10 p.m., when they were detained, the police said. The White House did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment. “I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist, I believe in it,” Mr. Trump said in a meeting with auto industry executives on Tuesday. “But it’s out of control.” Almost all mention of climate change has been removed from the White House website.

2,Trump Orders Mexican Border Wall to Be Built and Plans to Block Syrian Refugees,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/refugees-immigrants-wall-trump.html?searchResultPosition=108,2017/01/25,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday began a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ordering the immediate construction of a border wall with Mexico and aggressive efforts to find and deport unauthorized immigrants. He planned additional actions to cut back on legal immigration, including barring Syrian refugees from entering the United States. At the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Trump signed a pair of executive orders that paved the way for a border wall and called for a newly expanded force to sweep up immigrants who are in the country illegally. He revived programs that allow the federal government to work with local and state law enforcement agencies to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and to share information to help track and deport them. He also planned to clamp down on legal immigration in another action expected as early as Thursday. An eight-page draft of that executive order, obtained by The New York Times, would indefinitely block Syrian refugees from entering the United States and bar all refugees from the rest of the world for at least 120 days. When the refugee program resumes, it would be much smaller, with the total number of refugees resettled in the United States this year more than halved, to 50,000 from 110,000. It would also suspend any immigration for at least 30 days from a number of predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — while the government toughened its already stringent screening procedures to weed out potential terrorists. White House officials declined to comment on the coming plan, but in a wide-ranging interview that aired Wednesday on ABC, Mr. Trump acknowledged that it aimed to erect formidable barriers for those seeking refuge in the United States.

3,Trump Prepares Orders Aiming at Global Funding and Treaties,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/united-nations-trump-administration.html?searchResultPosition=107,2017/01/25,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing executive orders that would clear the way to drastically reduce the United States’ role in the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as begin a process to review and potentially abrogate certain forms of multilateral treaties. The first of the two draft orders, titled “Auditing and Reducing U.S. Funding of International Organizations” and obtained by The New York Times, calls for terminating funding for any United Nations agency or other international body that meets any one of several criteria. Those criteria include organizations that give full membership to the Palestinian Authority or Palestine Liberation Organization, or support programs that fund abortion or any activity that circumvents sanctions against Iran or North Korea. The draft order also calls for terminating funding for any organization that “is controlled or substantially influenced by any state that sponsors terrorism” or is blamed for the persecution of marginalized groups or any other systematic violation of human rights. The order calls for then enacting “at least a 40 percent overall decrease” in remaining United States funding toward international organizations. The order establishes a committee to recommend where those funding cuts should be made. It asks the committee to look specifically at United States funding for peacekeeping operations; the International Criminal Court; development aid to countries that “oppose important United States policies”; and the United Nations Population Fund, which oversees maternal and reproductive health programs.

6,How Antonin Scalia’s Ghost Could Block Donald Trump’s Wall,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/opinion/how-antonin-scalias-ghost-could-block-donald-trumps-wall.html?searchResultPosition=105,2017/01/25,OPINION,"President Trump may stumble on an unexpected obstacle as he tries to build a wall along the Mexican border: Antonin Scalia. This may seem surprising, considering that Mr. Trump has called him a “great” justice. But in one of his last opinions, Justice Scalia supplied a powerful weapon to resist Mr. Trump’s plans for a border wall. Justice Scalia’s June 2015 opinion in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency may not seem helpful at first sight. It blocked an E.P.A. rule that would have limited mercury emissions from power plants. The Clean Air Act instructs the E.P.A. to issue “appropriate and necessary” regulations, and Justice Scalia said that language required the E.P.A. to consider the costs of its proposed rules, which it did not properly do. “No regulation is ‘appropriate’ if it does significantly more harm than good,” Justice Scalia wrote. And even though the final vote in the case was 5-4, all nine members of the court agreed that the E.P.A. could not ignore the costs of its actions when deciding whether or how stringently to regulate. Why is Justice Scalia’s opinion an obstacle to President Trump’s wall-building plans? Mr. Trump is reported to be planning to rely on a law called the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as a source of statutory authority for the wall — apparently to avoid asking Congress to pass a new statute, which could be filibustered by Senate Democrats. But the 2006 law authorizes the secretary of homeland security only to take actions to secure the border that are “necessary and appropriate.” These are the same words (in the opposite order) the Supreme Court interpreted in Michigan v. E.P.A. As Justice Scalia said, it would not be “appropriate” to “impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars” in benefits. President Trump’s proposed wall would certainly cost billions of dollars: He says $8 billion, while more realistic estimates put the price tag at $15 billion to $25 billion (and $500 million per year for upkeep).

8,‘It Is Unacceptable’: Ethics Doubts Swirl as Trump Club Doubles Fee,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/mar-a-lago-membership-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=81,2017/01/25,POLITICS,"On the same day that the Trump Organization announced its appointment of two ethics monitors to advise on potential conflicts of interest, it faced a new ethical quandary: Is it right to double the price of the initiation fee at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump family’s private club in Florida, or would that be seen as cashing in on President Trump’s arrival in the White House? The question emerged after Bernd Lembcke, the managing director of the 118-room club in Palm Beach, Fla. — which Mr. Trump recently labeled the Winter White House — confirmed on Wednesday that the price of new memberships had increased to $200,000 from $100,000, and that applications had surged since Mr. Trump won the election in November. Mr. Lembcke’s acknowledgment came hours after the Trump Organization announced that it had named Bobby Burchfield, a longtime Republican Party lawyer and corporate litigator, as an “independent ethics adviser.” The Trump Organization pointed to the move as a sign of its commitment to addressing questions about potential conflicts of interest. “We take our role and the responsibility we have to our company, and our thousands of employees, very seriously,” Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said in a statement announcing the appointment of Mr. Burchfield. But Robert Weissman, the president of the government ethics watchdog group Public Citizen, said the selection of Mr. Burchfield and the decision to double the Mar-a-Lago initiation fee demonstrated that the Trump Organization was unprepared to confront the ethics challenges it now faces. “At the minimum, this creates the appearance of cashing in on the presidency and selling direct personal access to the president,” Mr. Weissman said of the new Mar-a-Lago fee. “It is unacceptable. And it demeans the office of the presidency.” "

Within a 24-hour period this week, he ordered or signaled significant new policies on border security, terrorism, crime and voting. But as Mr. Trump’s predecessor learned in 2009 when he ordered the military prison at Guantánamo Bay closed, implementing policy is not as easy as the stroke of a pen. Details to carry out security policies exceed Twitter’s 140-character limit and in some cases the public can only infer Mr. Trump’s plans. Here is what he has promised, and what authority he has to carry it out. No political promise came to symbolize Mr. Trump’s candidacy like his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The costs and logistical headaches of such a project — which would cut through private property — have always been daunting, but Mr. Trump’s supporters were unfazed: “Build the wall!” they chanted. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an order to build it and announced that work would begin immediately on a project that is estimated to cost more than $20 billion. "
11,Leaked Draft of Executive Order Could Revive C.I.A. Prisons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/executive-order-leaked-draft-national-security-trump-administration.html?searchResultPosition=84,2017/01/25,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — It contained crossed-out phrases and typos. It said that the Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2011, rather than a decade earlier. It was clearly not meant for public consumption. But the draft of a Trump administration executive order that spilled into public view early Wednesday — a document that raised the prospect of reviving C.I.A. “black site” prisons like those where terrorism suspects were once detained and tortured — has the potential to further fracture a national security team already divided over one of the most controversial policies of the post-9/11 era. The White House disclaimed the document, which was leaked to The New York Times and other news organizations, but three administration officials said the White House had circulated it among National Security Council staff members for review on Tuesday morning. And many of its proposals — which also include halting transfers out of the Guantánamo Bay prison and sending new detainees there, which President Barack Obama refused to do — echo years of Republican national security policy and President Trump’s own speeches. But Mr. Trump’s most extreme campaign proposal for terrorism suspects — bringing back torture, which the draft order does not call for but hovers over in its direction to review reinstating a C.I.A. interrogation program — has been disavowed by senior members of his team, most notably Defense Secretary James N. Mattis. Mr. Mattis has long opposed some of the aggressive interrogation methods used during President George W. Bush’s administration, and in his recent confirmation hearing, he said that the military should use only interrogation methods contained in the Army Field Manuals. At a Democratic caucus retreat on Wednesday, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told colleagues that both Mr. Mattis and Mike Pompeo, the newly installed C.I.A. director, had told him they had no knowledge of the draft order before it became public, according to another senator present at the retreat.

12,The Real Cost of Mr. Trump’s Wall,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/opinion/the-real-cost-of-mr-trumps-wall.html?searchResultPosition=85,2017/01/25,OPINION,"President Trump on Wednesday unveiled the first proposals to make good on his promise to make America impenetrable to unauthorized immigrants and intolerable for those who are already here. As expected, he promised to begin building a wall along the Mexican border, an enterprise that is far from certain because Congress would have to approve billions of dollars in funding. He also outlined a series of ominous regulatory changes aimed at drastically expanding the detention of immigrants who enter without permission. He is also seeking to turn more local police and corrections officials into enforcers of immigration law, while threatening to withhold funding from jurisdictions that have sensibly refused to assume that role. The steps outlined in two executive orders set the stage for incarcerating thousands of immigrants who do not represent a threat, for widespread civil rights violations and for racial profiling. At the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that immigration laws “will be enforced and enforced strongly.” Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant talk worked well on the campaign trail, as he convinced struggling Americans that foreigners were to blame for lost jobs and blighted communities. To carry out his promise of ramped-up immigration enforcement and border security, he will need to convince Congress and American taxpayers that spending billions to execute his plan is a worthy investment. As is so often the case with Mr. Trump, the facts are not on his side. Illegal immigration to the United States has been on a downward trend in recent years, even as spending on border security has soared. Between 1983 and 2006, an average of 1.2 million people a year were apprehended trying to enter the country unlawfully. In 2016, just over 415,000 were caught trying to enter; most were Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty. Meanwhile, border security funding has increased from $263 million in 1990 to $3.8 billion in 2015. "
13,Goldman’s $285 Million Package for Gary Cohn Is Questioned,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-gary-cohn-285-million-departure-package.html?searchResultPosition=86,2017/01/25,DEALBOOK,"Goldman Sachs has rewarded its departing president, Gary D. Cohn, with expedited access to cash and stock payments valued at nearly $300 million, and in doing so has tacitly encouraged another of its executives to accept an influential role in Washington. Late on Tuesday, Mr. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council advising President Trump, disclosed in a securities filing that he and his family members had received ownership that day of 940,908 shares of Goldman stock — a position valued at nearly $220 million. That award came in addition to a cash payout, announced the same day, amounting to about $65 million, leaving him with a total windfall of about $285 million. Given that Mr. Cohn, 56, is required to divest his Goldman shares under federal ethics laws, “we took these actions to enable him to comply with the conflict of interest rules, just as we have done for people in the de Blasio administration,” said Jake Siewert, a company spokesman, referring to the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. Under a standing policy, Mr. Siewert added, Goldman allows departing employees who are entering government service to keep their stock. In recent weeks, someone familiar with Mr. Cohn’s financial plans said, he made substantial donations to various charities in preparation for his new job, and he is poised to sell at least some of his Goldman shares. He is drawing no salary for his work at the White House, the person added. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Goldman’s acceleration of its usual curbs on the eligibility of Mr. Cohn’s stock for sale has revived a debate over whether veterans of the firm who enter public service receive special treatment from the firm — or whether the firm receives such treatment from former employees in government. Some experts on government ethics said Goldman’s treatment of Mr. Cohn smacked of favoritism. “They’re playing a game, and they’re playing a game to make this person feel beholden to Goldman Sachs,” said Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Painter was among lawyers who recently sued Mr. Trump, accusing him of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump called the suit meritless. "

He has charm, yes, and smarts of a kind, but also a cruel streak. Beatings are frequent, and assassination — foreign and domestic — has become commonplace. His cultural pronouncements have had a chilling effect on the arts, theater in particular. Take your seat for “Evening at the Talk House,” an ultra-dark comedy by the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn (“The Designated Mourner,” “Aunt Dan and Lemon”) for the New Group that begins performances at the Signature Center on Tuesday, Jan. 31. Though written years before Donald J. Trump announced his candidacy, and first produced in London in the fall of 2015, the play may strike some as oddly prescient. Set in the course of one night, it eavesdrops on several people who worked together on “Midnight in a Clearing With Moon and Stars,” a fictitious flop from a decade ago. They have gathered for a reunion at a rundown club. As they snack and sip and reminisce, they reveal the brutality of the world outside and the ways that artists can abet it, resist it and ignore it. The London production stoked controversy, with The Independent approvingly describing a “disturbing, balefully hilarious new play,” while many other critics attacked its tone, pace and politics. More than a year later, in the wake of Brexit and the presidential election, that controversy is likely to resonate anew. On the morning of President Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Shawn, who also appears in the play, the director Scott Elliott and the other members of the cast — Matthew Broderick, Jill Eikenberry, John Epperson, Larry Pine, Claudia Shear, Annapurna Sriram and Michael Tucker — gathered at a rehearsal space to discuss drama as protest and whether or not to invite the president. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  Is this a political play? MICHAEL TUCKER Yes. It’s other things, too. But it’s most certainly political. "
16,States Vie to Be Part of Trillion-Dollar Infrastructure Spending Sprees,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/donald-trump-infrastructure-spending-trillion-dollars-states.html?searchResultPosition=89,2017/01/25,U.S.,"New Jersey wants a railroad tunnel under the Hudson River, California wants high-speed rail linking north and south, Florida wants improved seaports, and most everyone wants highways and bridges. President Trump and congressional Democrats have proposed trillion-dollar infrastructure spending sprees, and among their most ardent allies are the nation’s governors, Republicans and Democrats, who cite years of pent-up demand for fixing or expanding old assets and building new ones. “Every single governor in this nation has roads, bridges, tunnels and airports, and we want to work together, because we need to replace them, and we need to repair them,” Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a Democrat, said on Wednesday at a National Governors Association meeting in Washington. Last month, the Trump transition team asked the governors association to collect wish lists from the states, with an emphasis on “shovel ready” projects that are far enough along in engineering, approval and even construction to begin using the money quickly, and those that enhance national security and economic competitiveness, especially in manufacturing. The president has expressed a preference for partnerships between government and private industry, used in projects like toll roads that can attract private investors with a steady stream of revenue. Forty states and some territories have submitted lists, containing more than 300 projects, to the governors association. The group declined to make the lists public, but several states were willing to describe their submissions. The Trump team drafted a list, first reported by the McClatchy newspapers, of 50 big items that it planned to consider. Though preliminary, the list gives an idea of the scale and range of ideas the administration is looking for. It includes long-discussed projects like digging the Hudson tunnel, replacing or repairing dilapidated bridges and highways, replacing outdated river locks that hinder commercial barge traffic, fixing old dams, building rail lines and airports, and creating a satellite-guided air traffic control system. It also contains newer plans like modernizing the electricity grid and storing water underground in arid areas. "
17,Trump’s Voter Fraud Example?

Mr. Trump kicked off the meeting, participants said, by retelling his debunked claim that he would have won the popular vote if not for the three million to five million ballots cast by “illegals.” He followed it up with a Twitter post early Wednesday calling for a major investigation into voter fraud. When one of the Democrats protested, Mr. Trump said he was told a story by “the very famous golfer, Bernhard Langer,” whom he described as a friend, according to three staff members who were in the room for the meeting. In the emerging Trump era, the story was a memorable example, for the legislators and the country, of how an off-the-cuff yarn — unverifiable and of confusing origin — became a prime policy mover for a president whose fact-gathering owes more to the oral tradition than the written word. The three witnesses recalled Mr. Langer being the protagonist of the story, although a White House official claimed the president had been telling a story relayed to the golfer by one of Mr. Langer’s friends. The witnesses described the story this way: Mr. Langer, a 59-year-old native of Bavaria, Germany — a winner of the Masters twice and of more than 100 events on major professional golf tours around the world — was standing in line at a polling place near his home in Florida on Election Day, the president explained, when an official informed Mr. Langer he would not be able to vote.

20,The Redemption Narrative in the 2017 Oscar Nominations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/movies/hollywood-oscars-la-la-land-diversity-redemption.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/01/25,MOVIES,"“La La Land” reigns triumphant, Mel Gibson’s arc of redemption is complete, Amy Adams’s snub has a silver lining, and, most notably of all, a record number of black artists — across multiple categories — received Oscar nominations this year. That, very roughly, is the lay of the land this awards season, now that the Oscar nominations have been announced. So let’s delve in, getting the biggest categories and surprises out of the way before heading to the broader story behind this year’s list of finalists. If it wasn’t official before — and it pretty much was — “La La Land” is poised to sail smoothly on to a best picture win, having nabbed 14 nominations, tying the previous record holders and best picture winners “All About Eve” (1950) and “Titanic” (1997). Emma Stone, a star of “La La Land,” has the edge for best actress; Casey Affleck appears on track for best actor for “Manchester by the Sea”; Mahershala Ali of “Moonlight” remains a favorite for the best supporting actor statuette; and the same goes for Viola Davis, for supporting actress for her role in “Fences.” In the category of best comeback, Mr. Gibson is the hands-down winner. Long on the outs in Hollywood for his drunken anti-Semitic and misogynist rants, Mr. Gibson, now sober (for 10 years, he says) and repentant, has found himself back in Tinseltown’s warm embrace: The World War II feature he directed, “Hacksaw Ridge,” landed six nominations, including one for best director. It could be argued that once you’re in Hollywood, you’re in, so long as you repent, which helps explain the woes of Nate Parker, whose ill-starred “The Birth of a Nation” was supposed to be his entry. Meanwhile, the best actress category, probably the most competitive of the season, held the biggest surprises and snubs. For reasons that remain inexplicable to the Bagger, Annette Bening failed to land a nomination for her nuanced, heartfelt performance in “20th Century Women.” But in a heartening turn, Ruth Negga did, for her lead role in “Loving,” the quiet, true-story film that was otherwise overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other prize givers, this year.

She would need to get herself shoes with heels at least two inches high. When she refused, she was sent home from the accounting firm PwC without pay. But that was not the end of it. Five months later, Ms. Thorp, an actress originally from the northern seaside city of Blackpool, started a petition calling for a law that would make sure no company could ever again demand that a woman wear heels to work. The petition garnered more than 150,000 signatures, helped spur a popular backlash — dozens of professional women posted photographs of themselves on Twitter defiantly wearing flats — and prompted an inquiry overseen by two parliamentary committees. On Wednesday, more than two years after Ms. Thorp, now 28, strode into that office in her chic but sensible black flats, the committees released a report concluding that Portico, the outsourcing firm that had insisted she wear high heels, had broken the law. It added that existing law needed to be toughened to overcome outmoded and sexist workplace codes. During the investigation, the committees received hundreds of complaints from women whose companies had demanded that they “dye their hair blonde,” “wear revealing outfits” or “constantly reapply makeup.” “Discriminatory dress codes remain widespread,” the report said. Ms. Thorp lauded the inquiry’s conclusion, saying it was all the more imperative in the Trump era, when men around the world had a role model in the White House who had boasted about behaving badly toward women.

But in an industry that lives and dies by the power (seen and unseen) of sums in all their varieties, that the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 20,000 on Wednesday was enough to give even the most hardened stock market watchers reason to smile. The Dow finished the day at 20,068.51. “It blows me away,” said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. “I can remember when people wondered if we would ever get through Dow 1,000. It’s amazing — we are up 20-fold in my career.” And that is a big deal, Mr. Paulsen explained, because it means that for all the worry and doubts that have sprung from the market collapses in 1987, 2000 and 2008, if investors just held to a core portfolio of large American stocks they would have done pretty well. Of course, the usual caveats apply. In percentage terms, the Dow going from 10,000 (which it hit in March 1999) to 20,000 is less meaningful than the journey from 1,000, which it reached in 1972. It is also true that the Dow represents just 30 companies — including stalwarts like Goldman Sachs, Apple and Walmart — compared with the 500 that make up the Standard & Poor’s index or the 2,000 of the Russell market tracker. And in today’s E.T.F.-driven marketplace, where indexes of every stripe are used to entice investors looking for cheap and predictable returns, the Dow as an index for exchange-traded funds has been more or less ignored, compared withfunds that follow the S.&P. 500 and Russell 2000.

24,"In Race Against Fake News, Google and Facebook Stroll to the Starting Line",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/technology/google-facebook-fake-news.html?searchResultPosition=95,2017/01/25,TECHNOLOGY,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites. On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online. In a blog post, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense advertising network near the end of last year, after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from its online ad service. On the same day, Facebook introduced changes to its Trending Topics feature — a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information — to better promote reliable news articles. Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Google’s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebook’s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users. “We genuinely asked Google and Facebook for ‘moonshots,’” said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. “We appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, that’s hardly even running in place.” Google and Facebook have been in something of a no-win situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles. "

The move is likely to complicate a delicate balancing act Mr. Trudeau has been trying to keep up: He has long maintained that Canada needs to develop its energy industry, but he also stands for aggressively cutting the country’s carbon emissions. The pipeline, known as Keystone XL, is meant to help carry crude oil from the oil sands of Alberta to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. The Obama administration blocked the project for environmental reasons — and in doing so, spared Mr. Trudeau from having to reckon with the consequences of building it. Now, Mr. Trump has put Keystone XL back on the table, and with it the prospect of significantly increased oil production and carbon emissions, upending Canada’s climate calculus. Mr. Trudeau has been trying to avoid taking the path of his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, whose energy policies as prime minister in the 1980s deeply soiled the family name among Albertans. The elder Mr. Trudeau imposed extra taxes and royalties along with price controls that angered the province’s oil industry. The younger Mr. Trudeau spoke up swiftly on Tuesday, welcoming Mr. Trump’s action. And the Canadian leader’s public support for the energy industry has helped him sell his national carbon-pricing program in the province — a program that polls strongly in areas away from the oil patch, especially Ontario and British Columbia. But now people on all sides are angry at him. Along with a decision in late November to approve two other pipeline projects, Mr. Trudeau’s welcome of the Keystone XL revival has alienated many environmentalists in Canada, and has also strained his relations with some indigenous communities affected by the pipelines. And hours after Mr. Trump’s move was announced, Mr. Trudeau found himself in a heated public exchange in Calgary, Alberta, with a supporter of the oil sands. "

28,That Old Phone Trump Uses for Twitter Could Be an Opening to Security Threats,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/technology/donald-trump-phone-social-media-security.html?searchResultPosition=91,2017/01/25,TECHNOLOGY,"President Trump has carried his Twitter habit into his presidency. He has also brought with him another tech habit that is causing concern. Mr. Trump has been using his old, unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week. The president’s desire to use his old, personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats. He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter, not to make calls. But it’s unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter requires a connection to the internet, which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like two-factor authentication — a password and a code texted to a phone, for example — are not in place. If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure Wi-Fi network, he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device. “The absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats,” said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee. “It would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted.” Among the concerns by security experts: ■ It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking. ■ The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured Wi-Fi and cellular networks, such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House. ■ Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone. ■ Stingray devices, a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement, can track a device’s location and other information. “There are a lot of questions, but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems — and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. The president’s use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state. In 2009, President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone; though he won, the use of a White House-issued secure device came with many rules. “As president, he is the biggest sitting target in the world,” said Kevin Bankston, the director of New America’s Open Technology Institute.

And from the moment he became president, Donald J. Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication. Words about the dishonest media, the end of Obamacare, the construction of that border wall with Mexico — this is an abbreviated list, and he hasn’t even completed his first week in office. Amid the verbal deluge, President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy. Not to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president’s assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally. But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it. This will be a recurring challenge, given President Trump’s habit of speaking in sales-pitch hyperbole and his tendency to deride any less-than-flattering report as “fake news.” The words needed to be exactly right. “And the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth,” said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. “They’re ‘baseless,’ they’re ‘bogus,’ they’re ‘lies,’ they’re ‘untruths.’” Rarely are these words, each with its own nuance, applied directly to something said by a president, though others have also dissembled (like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern). “This is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country,” said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “We have an administration that seems to be asserting a right to its own facts and doesn’t seem to be able to produce evidence to back those claims.” "

From some corners of the city, the post from Mr. Trump brought indignation. “He meant locking up more black and brown folks,” said Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, addressing the City Council here on Wednesday morning. “Just like Republicans, just like right-wingers have always done.” It brought provocations. “You want to send in the feds, that’s fine,” Ja’Mal Green, an activist on the South Side, said in an interview. “Send them in to investigate all the corruption in this city. Send federal dollars to put into economic development, to put into our schools.” And there was some confusion. “The statement is so broad,” Eddie Johnson, the police superintendent, told The Chicago Tribune. “I have no idea what he’s talking about.” Whatever Mr. Trump’s intention, his message put the city on the defensive once again for its escalating problem of gun violence, which has been mostly concentrated in neighborhoods on the West and South Sides. Just this month, 239 people were shot, 40 of them fatally, a police spokesman said Wednesday. In the same period last year, 227 people were shot, 33 fatally. In 2016, there were at least 762 homicides in Chicago, the highest number in two decades, though the per-capita murder rate remains lower than that of some other major cities, including Baltimore and St. Louis.

Chapter NY, 249 East Houston Street, Manhattan; 347-528-4397, chapter-ny.com. The foreboding title of Ann Greene Kelly’s fine solo show at Chapter NY, “May Not Be Private,” comes from a medical form. It inflects the display of four sculptures whose visible debts to Robert Gober’s surreal conflations of objects and Charles LeDray’s miniaturization of the everyday are balanced by the artist’s own strange sense of bricolage, scale and mordant allusion. Although she often includes elements made from scratch, Ms. Kelly works in the area of remade ready-mades, meshing intimations of the human body with objects that imply public space or invasive activities. Nodding to the show’s title, that body is not necessarily whole. The show’s best piece may be “Untitled (bricked chair with drain),” which features garden furniture covered and extended with small white bricks that conjure both patio and hospital. Overall, it calls to mind mangled limbs, a geriatric toilet and something used for torture or sex. “Untitled (trashed bed)” centers on a downsized mattress embedded with a carved-stone drain that is Gober-like — except for its beautifully fluted extension, which can evoke the futilely gripping fingers of someone being dragged out of bed by the feet. Elsewhere, some obviousness creeps in, as with an anti-monument formed by a statue atop a cast-aluminum laundry basket standing in for a disintegrating globe, despite the appeal of the doll-like, carved-alabaster statue itself. Even more simplistic is a relief of a female mannequin torso besieged by bricks. But the show is alive with sculptural inventiveness and material thought, including individualized concrete bases, and it’s enriched by a pair of large colored-pencil drawings in the gallery’s office. They illuminate the three-dimensional efforts while revealing another, full-blown aspect of Ms. Kelly’s impressive talent. ROBERTA SMITH Through Feb. 11.

President Obama had every right early in his final year of the presidency to put forth a Supreme Court nominee, picking a mainstream, centrist candidate to whom the Republicans would not even grant a hearing. Yet Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, is already giving up what shred of power the Democrats have by announcing that they will filibuster only nominees out of the legal mainstream, implying that Democrats will confirm a more mainstream Republican nominee. Safeguarding established rights and protections that a majority of Americans value is not playing tit for tat with nominations. It’s not petty.

33,Tax Plan Sows Confusion as Tensions With Mexico Soar,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/politics/mexico-wall-tax-trump.html?searchResultPosition=30,2017/01/26,POLITICS,"PHILADELPHIA — President Trump’s decision to build a wall along the length of the United States’ southern border with Mexico erupted into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, leading to the cancellation of a White House visit by Mexico’s president and sharply rising tensions over who would pay for the wall. With the conflict escalating, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a proposal by House Republicans that would impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that the proceeds would be used to pay for the border wall, estimated to cost as much as $20 billion. But a furious uproar prompted Mr. Spicer to temper his earlier remarks, saying the plan was simply “one idea” that might work to finance the wall. Mr. Spicer said it was not the job of the White House to “roll something out” on tax policy, while Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the administration was considering “a buffet of options.” If Mr. Trump does eventually announce his support for the tax plan, it could have a broad impact on the American economy, and its consumers and workers, by sharply increasing the prices of imported goods or reducing profits for the companies that produce them. Other nations could retaliate, prompting a trade war that could hit consumers around the globe. Retail businesses could see their tax bills surge, said David French of the National Retail Federation, who predicted that those costs would be passed on to consumers. He called the idea “very counter to the way consumers are feeling at the moment.” If nothing else, the rapid-fire developments showed Mr. Trump that international diplomacy and a top-to-bottom overhaul of the tax code would not be as easy as an announcement before a campaign microphone. The events unfolded after Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to strengthen the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border. "
34,An Extremist Holding the Purse Strings,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/an-extremist-holding-the-purse-strings.html?searchResultPosition=31,2017/01/26,OPINION,"President Trump will hardly be short of far-right cabinet members, including an education secretary who has called public schools a “dead end,” a labor secretary who has been cited for employment law violations and an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has sued his own department. But within the Trump team, the views of Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, his little-known choice to lead the important Office of Management and Budget, rank as among the most reactionary. Only slivers of this were visible in Mr. Mulvaney’s uneventful confirmation hearing on Tuesday. In fact, Mr. Mulvaney — a founding member of the Freedom Caucus with an almost perfect conservative voting record — spent his six-year congressional career leading the charge against federal spending and borrowing, voting against everything from Hurricane Sandy relief to reopening the government after the 2013 shutdown. His intransigence placed him well to the right of Republican leadership, including former Speaker John Boehner, whom he repeatedly opposed for — get this — being excessively soft on curbing disbursements from the federal purse. Not surprisingly, cutting deeply into core retirement and health care programs is at the top of his to-do list. “We have to end Medicare as we know it,” he said on Fox Business Network, soon after entering Congress in 2011. (Medicare enjoys support from 77 percent of Americans, according to a 2015 Kaiser Foundation poll.) While Mr. Mulvaney is not alone in his terrifying views, the difference between him and other members of his deeply conservative brigade is that he will likely soon have an unusual opportunity to cement them into place; O.M.B. (as it is universally known) is the control center for the administration’s fiscal policy. "
35,Trump Strategist Stephen Bannon Says Media Should ‘Keep Its Mouth Shut’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html?searchResultPosition=33,2017/01/26,MEDIA,"WASHINGTON — Just days after President Trump spoke of a “running war’’ with the media, his chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, ratcheted up the attacks, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by the election outcome and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview on Wednesday. “I want you to quote this,” Mr. Bannon added. “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.” The scathing assessment — delivered by one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted and influential advisers, in the first days of his presidency — comes at a moment of high tension between the news media and the administration, with skirmishes over the size of Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowd and the president’s false claims that millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants swayed the popular vote against him. Mr. Bannon, who rarely grants interviews to journalists outside of Breitbart News, the provocative right-wing website he ran until August, was echoing comments by Mr. Trump last weekend, when the president said he was in “a running war” with the media and called journalists “among the most dishonest people on earth.” Mr. Bannon’s remarks added to the growing acrimony between the press and a president who made attacks on the media a rallying point of his election campaign. Among Mr. Trump’s advisers in the White House, Mr. Bannon is responsible for putting into action the nationalist vision that Mr. Trump channeled during the later months of the campaign, one that stemmed from Mr. Bannon himself. And in many ways Mr. Trump has acted on that vision during his first week in office — from the description of “American carnage” he laid out in his inauguration speech to a series of executive actions outlining policies on trade agreements, immigration and the building of a border wall.

Earlier, Mr. Trump had issued executive orders to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico and to withhold federal money from so-called sanctuary cities, which do not cooperate with federal immigration officials in detaining undocumented immigrants who have been arrested on charges unrelated to their immigration status. The crowd made its displeasure on all fronts known: “No ban, no wall,” the protesters cried. And then they engaged in a call and response with an Arabic greeting: “Peace be unto you. And unto you, peace.” The instant opposition extended to New York’s City Hall and the chambers of the State Assembly in Albany. Assemblyman Francisco P. Moya, a Democrat of Queens, proposed a bill Wednesday night that would limit the state’s cooperation with the police in assisting immigration officers who did not have a judge’s warrant to detain immigrants accused of a crime. Among its many provisions, Mr. Trump’s order called for state and local law enforcement agencies to “perform the functions of an immigration officer” in detaining and potentially deporting undocumented immigrants. Mr. Moya’s bill, which had the backing of other Assembly members, would prohibit law enforcement agents from stopping, questioning, investigating or arresting an individual on the basis of a suspected immigration violation. “No state or local law enforcement agency, or agent thereof, shall perform the function of or be cross-designated as a federal immigration officer,” the bill states. A draft of Mr. Trump’s next order, which remained unsigned on Thursday, included an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and a temporary ban on immigrants coming from Muslim countries with known terrorist ties.

The $880 million purchase of the remittances firm MoneyGram in a deal announced on Thursday looks like a counterintuitive bet in a de-globalizing world for the Alibaba founder’s financial services arm. International payments are a tough business. But MoneyGram gives Ant a base with connections to many developing markets. Ant piggybacked off the growth of Alibaba, whose Alipay unit received commissions for each transaction it processed over the companies’ marketplaces. In turn, its payments and financial services division helped the Chinese firm expand its e-commerce business. Alipay’s immense popularity at home has allowed it to accumulate 450 million customers. While Ant has wished to expand internationally, complying with differing regulatory regimes and establishing relationships with all the entities in various nations’ payments chains is a complex process. So it initially limited itself to following Chinese tourists around the world, giving them an option to pay at merchants with Alipay. The company is now steadily scaling up its ambitions as it edges toward an initial public offering. Buying MoneyGram helps on a few fronts. The transfer business is less regulated, and it gives Ant a toehold in the developed American market. MoneyGram specializes in sending money from immigrants back to their home countries. Ant has been moving into developing economies as well, having recently made big investments in India and Thailand. Linking MoneyGram with these operations will be a natural step. Remittances have grown in tandem with emigration. Between 2005 and 2015, the global volume of such payments through so-called formal channels grew to $582 billion from $283 billion, according to research by Aite. MoneyGram and the larger Western Union dominate this market. However, digital upstarts like Azimo and PayPal’s Xoom are taking share, with cheaper and more convenient options. That may explain why Ant had to pay only about 12.5 times expected 2017 earnings for its purchase. Ant hopes its digital expertise will help it fend off these challengers. Dealing with regulators is another matter. The United States has steadily increased regulation of the transfer market over the last two decades. Western Union agreed just last week to pay a $586 million fine after admitting to aiding and abetting wire fraud. Ant’s future public owners had better hope Mr. Ma’s recent visit to Trump Tower gave the Chinese billionaire some assurance that the vise is finished tightening. "

Defense Secretary James Mattis travels to Asia next week to try to allay fears of wavering U.S. support in Japan and South Korea. Even Russia offered pushback, over the administration’s support for civilian safe zones in Syria. Mr. Trump’s impulsive style of action may appeal to his supporters, but some insiders worry about his penchant for picking fights and drifting off message. _____ • Abortion is one of the Trump administration’s focal points. Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the 44th annual March for Life in Washington today. Organizers have ramped up attendance efforts, not wanting to be embarrassed by a poorer turnout than the women’s marches last weekend that drew over a million people.

41,Faye Redux,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/books/review/rachel-cusk-talks-about-transit.html?searchResultPosition=39,2017/01/26,BOOK REVIEW,"Rachel Cusk’s new novel, “Transit,” is the second in a planned trilogy about a character named Faye. The first, “Outline,” was one of the Book Review’s 10 Best Books of 2015. (Monica Ali reviews “Transit” on this week’s cover.) In both books we travel in Faye’s shoes, but we get to know her in untraditional ways, mostly through her conversations with, and observations of, other people. In a recent email interview, Cusk described the way the novels work as “a process of reverse exposition, where the meaning of oneself seems to have been transferred out into the world.” Faye’s interactions often occur with people she’s meeting for the first time or running into without warning: an ex-boyfriend she encounters on the street; a hair stylist; the moderator of a panel at a literary festival. “Faye’s interlocutors have a very specific function: They need to be readable surfaces rather than characters understood through prior knowledge,” Cusk said. “It can take me a while to find them, but I generally recognize them when I do.” Cusk still plans to end the series with the next novel. And though part of the books’ charm is the way they meander, she has her eye on a relatively pointed conclusion. “I’m writing the third novel at the moment, and I do feel compelled to bring the project to a resolution — to find the answers to my own questions, as it were,” she said. “The third novel interrogates the relationship between suffering and truth, and the notion that one might acquire honor through the experience of emotional pain. It’ll be over when I’ve found out whether or not that’s the case!” Quotable “I’ve always seen children’s literature as a genre, not as a prescription for the age of the reader, the same way you don’t have to be a detective to read a mystery.” — Daniel Handler, a.k.a. Lemony Snicket, in an interview with Inverse Reading Up on Resistance “What We Do Now” is on a lot of people’s minds, and it’s the title of a new anthology published by Melville House. The collection features brief pieces by Elizabeth Warren, Gloria Steinem, Robert B. Reich and many others about how to fight for certain values during Donald Trump’s presidency. Things get off to a familiar start, with a brief essay by Bernie Sanders. “We need to create a financial system that works for ordinary Americans, not just those on top,” he writes. Others give advice about how to build and maintain resistance movements. The book’s general tone — dejected and alarmed, but hopeful about not becoming completely hopeless — is summed up in the last line of the piece by Dave Eggers that ends the collection: “Keep your eyes open, your hearts stout, and be ready for the fight.” "
42,Republicans Now Marching With Trump on Ideas They Had Opposed,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/politics/trump-republican-retreat.html?searchResultPosition=34,2017/01/26,POLITICS,"PHILADELPHIA — From the time Donald J. Trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional Republicans treated his policy pronouncements — largely out of step with Republican dogma — as essentially a distraction. He would talk. They would drive the policies. But now, the question of whether congressional Republicans would change President Trump or Mr. Trump would change them has an early answer. Mr. Trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on Thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. Republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the Zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in Flint, Mich. They also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that Mr. Trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5,000 more border patrol agents. They have stayed oddly silent as Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from President Barack Obama. Once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, Republicans are now embracing Mr. Trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during Mr. Obama’s second term. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose own website this week still praised the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, now applauds Mr. Trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. Many Republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of Russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, Mr. Trump’s embrace of both. Even on the subject of Mr. Trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, Republicans have often demurred. “The notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

43,Was BuzzFeed Right to Publish the Russia File on Trump?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/was-buzzfeed-right-to-publish-the-russia-file-on-trump.html?searchResultPosition=27,2017/01/26,OPINION,"To the Editor: Re “Why BuzzFeed Published the Dossier” (Op-Ed, Jan. 23), by Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed, defending his decision to publish the dossier on Donald Trump and Russia: I support Mr. Smith’s decision and am dismayed by the inaction of the media until now. There was little hesitation on the media’s part to publish numerous articles about anything that had to do with Hillary Clinton’s email investigations no matter how unsubstantiated or trivial. Why was there not a similar zeal to reveal investigations with respect to Mr. Trump and his associates? BuzzFeed was not alleging that the information in the dossier was correct; it was reporting the existence of a document that our intelligence agencies thought was important enough that members of Congress as well as President Obama and then President-elect Trump needed to see it. My fear is that the current administration will have a chilling effect on the media. The courage of the media is what makes our democracy strong, and I applaud Ben Smith for his courage. We need a strong media now more than ever. JOAN STOLPEN Princeton, N.J. To the Editor: As someone who could not be more ideologically opposed to the new administration, I find Ben Smith’s justification for publishing the unverified dossier to be woefully insufficient. Since the White House has shown no qualms about creating and defending “alternative facts,” it’s more important than ever for media outlets to act with integrity, particularly those that earn their revenue via “clicks.” That BuzzFeed would choose to publish an unverified report — littered with amateurish errors and written by someone paid to dig up dirt — is at best a distraction and likely has caused real harm to principled journalists working to shed light on actual, proven concerns about the new president. YITZHAK BRONSTEIN Brooklyn To the Editor: Our current president was elected, in part, by people who genuinely believe that President Obama was a Constitution-wrecking Kenyan and Hillary Clinton trafficked in child sex, had people murdered and planned to ban guns, plus countless other patently deranged nontruths. For Ben Smith to pretend that fact-checking is the job of the reader controverts every tenet of journalism. The average reader doesn’t have the time, skills or temperament to fact-check. And critical thinking is clearly another casualty of our times. My first job in publishing was as a fact-checker. I know how hard a job it is, but it’s never been more important. Now isn’t the time to abandon principles. Reality always wins. CAROL KEELEY  Boulder, Colo. "
44,Why ‘1984’ Is a 2017 Must-Read,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/books/why-1984-is-a-2017-must-read.html?searchResultPosition=20,2017/01/26,BOOKS,"The dystopia described in George Orwell’s nearly 70-year-old novel “1984” suddenly feels all too familiar. A world in which Big Brother (or maybe the National Security Agency) is always listening in, and high-tech devices can eavesdrop in people’s homes. (Hey, Alexa, what’s up?) A world of endless war, where fear and hate are drummed up against foreigners, and movies show boatloads of refugees dying at sea. A world in which the government insists that reality is not “something objective, external, existing in its own right” — but rather, “whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.” “1984” shot to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-seller list this week, after Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to President Trump, described demonstrable falsehoods told by the White House press secretary Sean Spicer — regarding the size of inaugural crowds — as “alternative facts.” It was a phrase chillingly reminiscent, for many readers, of the Ministry of Truth’s efforts in “1984” at “reality control.” To Big Brother and the Party, Orwell wrote, “the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense.” Regardless of the facts, “Big Brother is omnipotent” and “the Party is infallible.” As the novel’s hero, Winston Smith, sees it, the Party “told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears,” and he vows, early in the book, to defend “the obvious” and “the true”: “The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall toward the earth’s center.” Freedom, he reminds himself, “is the freedom to say that two plus two make four,” even though the Party will force him to agree that “TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE” — not unlike the way Mr. Spicer tried to insist that Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd was “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration,” despite data and photographs to the contrary. In “1984,” Orwell created a harrowing picture of a dystopia named Oceania, where the government insists on defining its own reality and where propaganda permeates the lives of people too distracted by rubbishy tabloids (“containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology”) and sex-filled movies to care much about politics or history. News articles and books are rewritten by the Ministry of Truth and facts and dates grow blurry — the past is described as a benighted time that has given way to the Party’s efforts to make Oceania great again (never mind the evidence to the contrary, like grim living conditions and shortages of decent food and clothing). Not surprisingly, “1984” has found a nervous readership in today’s “post-truth” era. It’s an era in which misinformation and fake news have proliferated on the web; Russia is flooding the West with propaganda to affect elections and sow doubts about the democratic process; poisonous tensions among ethnic and religious groups are fanned by right-wing demagogues; and reporters scramble to sort out a cascade of lies and falsehoods told by President Trump and his aides — from false accusations that journalists had invented a rift between him and the intelligence community (when he had compared the intelligence agencies to Nazis) to debunked claims that millions of unauthorized immigrants robbed him of a popular-vote majority. Orwell had been thinking about the novel that would become “1984” as early as 1944, when he wrote a letter about Stalin and Hitler, and “the horrors of emotional nationalism and a tendency to disbelieve in the existence of objective truth because all the facts have to fit in with the words and prophecies of some infallible führer.” "

True, the president’s view on the subject is delusional, but let the Justice Department once and for all officially determine that virtually no voter fraud exists. That would deprive Republican-controlled state governments from using that false rationale to justify ever more restrictive voter ID laws, which are, in truth, designed to disenfranchise minorities who historically tend to vote Democratic. PETER WORTMANN  New York To the Editor: President Trump is convinced, almost to the point of paranoia, that millions of people illegally voted against him in the presidential election, handing Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote. How does Mr. Trump know that most voted for Mrs. Clinton? Perhaps they favored Mr. Trump, and their illegal votes handed Mr. Trump his narrow Electoral College victory in key swing states. DOUGLAS F. CARLSON San Francisco To the Editor: President Trump has indicated that he will initiate an investigation on massive voter fraud. There are two possible conclusions for such an investigation: 1. There was no massive fraud. In that case our president has been involved once again in either delusion, falsehoods, alternative facts or flat-out lies. 2. There was massive fraud. There is no way to know for whom the fraudulent votes were cast. The November elections would need to be declared null and void and new elections called. CARLOS HOJVAT Arlington, Va. "
46,Mr. Trump’s ‘Gag Rule’ Will Harm Global Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/mr-trumps-gag-rule-will-harm-global-health.html?searchResultPosition=11,2017/01/26,OPINION,"With a single memorandum, President Trump may well have made it harder for health workers around the world to fight cancer, H.I.V., Zika and Ebola. The memorandum, signed on Monday, reinstates and expands a policy barring health organizations abroad, many of which provide an array of services, from receiving federal funds if they even talk to women about abortion as a method of family planning. The so-called Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, and has since been supported by every Republican president and opposed by every Democratic one; Barack Obama renounced it in 2009. Mr. Trump has not only reinstated it but greatly broadened its impact. In the past, the policy has applied only to international family-planning funds, which currently total around $600 million. Mr. Trump’s memorandum, however, would apply the policy to “global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.” Although reproductive health groups are still studying the memorandum, this language would appear to apply to any international health funding, around $9 billion, used to fight malaria, H.I.V., Zika, Ebola and many other global health threats. This would seem to go well beyond family-planning aid from the Agency for International Development and the State Department, to also include money from all American governmental agencies and departments. Federal funding for abortions abroad has been banned since 1973, except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s life. Mr. Trump’s gag rule goes far beyond the 1973 ban to bar funding to all organizations that provide abortion or abortion referrals, even if they do so with their own funds and even if abortion is not the focus of their work. By cutting off family-planning funds to reproductive health care providers, the gag rule eliminated contraceptive and maternal health services to countless women around the world. After losing funding during the Bush administration, a group known as Family Health Options Kenya had to close six clinics, leaving 9,000 people with little access to health care. "
47,"Making Mexico Pay for Border Wall: Ideas Abound, and So Do Obstacles",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/economy/mexico-pay-border-wall-trump.html?searchResultPosition=12,2017/01/26,ECONOMY,"Will President Trump be able to make Mexico pay for his “big, beautiful wall”? Over the course of his campaign he offered a variety of ways to dip into pots of Mexican money. The latest, proposed on Thursday, was a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, which total roughly $300 billion in goods and services. Like other proposals Mr. Trump has floated — impounding remittances of Mexicans working in the United States, or charging Mexicans more for visas — it seems straightforward. But carrying it out would be another matter. For starters, a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement and most likely the rules of the World Trade Organization, which frowns on punitive levies imposed arbitrarily on imports from specific countries. (It is hard to tell from the tangle of announcements from Mr. Trump and his advisers whether they are planning a broad new tax regime that would affect all exports and imports. That, too, would most likely invite challenges at the W.T.O.) Mr. Trump, of course, has also talked about taking the United States out of the global trade accord. But that might seem a bit too drastic just to get Mexico to pay perhaps $20 billion for a wall. It is likely to impose enormous costs on the American and world economies, opening the door for a free-for-all trade war. But if the president did it anyway, the people paying the 20 percent tariff would not be Mexicans, but American consumers. That 2017 Ford Fusion built in Hermosillo, Mexico? It would no longer cost $22,610. It would cost $27,132. So what about the other ideas? The big one Mr. Trump mentioned early on is remittances. Mexico receives about $25 billion a year from Mexicans living abroad, mostly in the United States, in myriad transfers of a few hundred dollars apiece channeled primarily through services like Western Union and MoneyGram.

Seven-year-old Bana al-Abed and her mother, Fatemah, posted an open letter to President Trump on Bana’s Twitter account on Wednesday, sharing the message with the hundreds of thousands of users who follow the account. The page-long letter asks the new president to “please save the children and people of Syria.” Bana first captured global attention when she and her mother created a Twitter account, @AlabedBana, that posted near-daily updates on their life in opposition-held Eastern Aleppo and condemned the government’s role in the violence. The photos and videos from inside the city offered a rare glimpse into life in a war zone, and revealed the struggles faced by a family under siege. Bana and her family are now living in Turkey, after fleeing Aleppo in December. Some, however, have questioned whether Bana actually wrote the Twitter posts herself and if the videos in which she speaks were rehearsed or altered. And supporters of the government of President Bashar al-Assad assailed her as a fraud and a propaganda tool. After her family’s arrival in Turkey, they visited President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara and she was photographed being hugged by Mr. Erdogan. Fatemah told The New York Times that her request to Mr. Trump was a simple one: “Look to the children in Syria like your children.” She said Bana regularly hears news about Mr. Trump and felt it was time to try to get his attention. “Donald Trump is now president. He can do something for the people, especially in conflict zones,” Fatemah said. “And all the world had their opinions about this. And this was our opinion, me and Bana.” Fatemah said the note was intended to urge Mr. Trump to change his stance on Syrian refugees. She wrote it ahead of an expected executive order that would cut the country’s refugee resettlement program and toughen immigration restrictions for people from a number of predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria. Despite Mr. Trump’s repeated remarks on tightening restrictions against Muslims entering the United States, Fatemah said she believed that someday his views may change. “Maybe he will change his mind, I don’t know,” Fatemah said. “But we will keep hoping.” "

On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump went further. When a president demands an investigation of voter fraud, what could go wrong? Based on recent history, a lot. Little more than a decade ago, the Justice Department made investigating and prosecuting voter fraud a major priority. When top prosecutors failed to find the misconduct and refused to make partisan prosecutions, they were fired. In the fallout, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was forced to resign in the biggest Justice Department scandal since Watergate. It seems like an odd bit of history to try to repeat — unless the goal is to clear the path for voter suppression. "

The reality of what Sean Spicer, the press secretary, suggested is a lot less dramatic. But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code — and how they’re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president’s audacious campaign promises. It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes, trade and diplomacy is in flux. Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump’s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico. A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick, Mr. Spicer said. That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters. Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers, create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border, and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer’s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation. He was pointing out that in an overhaul of taxes that House Republicans are considering, imports from all countries would be taxed at 20 percent while American exports would be tax free. It’s called border adjustment, and it would make the United States corporate tax code more closely resemble the value-added tax that is commonplace in other countries. "

Some people never forgot. But on Thursday evening, the fatal cruelties inflicted upon Mr. Callaway — long obscured by time, fear, professional malfeasance and a reluctance to investigate the sins of the past — were acknowledged in this city of 31,000 people when LaGrange’s police chief, Louis M. Dekmar, who is white, issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching. “I sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin’s lynching, both through our action and our inaction,” Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally African-American church. “And for that, I’m profoundly sorry. It should never have happened.” He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department “be honest, decent, unbiased and ethical.” “In Austin’s case, and in many like his, those were not the police department values he experienced,” he said. The apology for the Sept. 8, 1940, killing is part of a renewed push across the American South to acknowledge the brutal mob violence that was used to enforce the system of racial segregation after Reconstruction: In a 2015 study, the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala., documented 4,075 of what it called the “racial terror lynchings” of blacks by white mobs in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950.

Its first two episodes constitute a feature-length documentary about the protests against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, and they build to the tearful celebrations when it was announced in December that alternative routes would be examined. The second episode ends on the voice of a newscaster wondering what the incoming administration of Donald J. Trump would do about the pipeline. But of course we already know: On Tuesday, President Trump signed an executive order telling the Army Corps of Engineers to review and approve the pipeline “in an expedited manner.” Whatever the future holds, watching “Rise” at this moment is a decidedly melancholy experience. Directed by Michelle Latimer (who is Métis and Algonquin) and reported by Sarain Fox (Anishinabe), both of Canadian indigenous descent, “Rise” is unabashedly on the side of the protesters it embeds with. Ms. Fox is on the scene in May 2016, long before the standoff became national news, when a handful of Sioux were warily eyeing the construction crews across the Missouri River. The episodes contain an absorbing and often artfully filmed account of the opponents’ occupation. The granting of a permit in July to tunnel under the Missouri spurs the growth of the protest camp (to an eventual 10,000 people, many of them nonnative), captured in Woodstock-like images of cars arriving in slow files. Early skirmishes between small groups of protesters and security guards with dogs give way to large-scale battles against uniformed police officers. Unarmed protesters fall to truncheons and rubber bullets. An eerie nighttime scene of water cannons being fired from armored vehicles looks like something out of “Apocalypse Now.” The filmmakers’ ambitions for the Standing Rock episodes were greater than just recounting the standoff, which could have been done quite dramatically in one hourlong episode, and probably should have been. The episodes’ two and a half hours are filled out with history lessons — broken treaties, unresolved land claims and the undeniable legacy of government-sponsored genocide — and discussions of reservation life focused mainly on the effects the Dakota oil boom has had on native women. These sequences are worthy, persuasive, poignant and, in comparison with the story of the protest, familiar and not exactly vital. Information about future installments of “Rise” is scarce. Perhaps the series was rushed on the air to capitalize on the news value of the Standing Rock segments, which were shown recently at the Sundance Film Festival. A third episode available for review takes Ms. Fox to Arizona, where Apache activists are fighting to keep Oak Flat, an area they consider sacred, from being destroyed by an open-pit copper mine. Here a small note of discord is allowed — Ms. Fox talks to a young tribe member who says that money from the mine might be worth more than pride on the destitute reservation. "
53,"Trump on Their Side, Conservatives See Hope in Lengthy Abortion Fight",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/politics/democrats-republicans-planned-parenthood.html?searchResultPosition=17,2017/01/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Sensing a political opportunity they have not had in more than a decade, social conservatives are preparing for a lengthy fight over abortion rights that promises to widen the culture war fissures that Republicans have tried for years to bridge. Two fights now loom in Washington that are galvanizing the right as it solidifies control of two branches of government and moves to dominate the third: an effort in Congress to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and President Trump’s forthcoming choice of a Supreme Court nominee. The choice for the court is likely to meet conservatives’ expectations. But fulfilling even a short-term goal of the anti-abortion movement, like defunding Planned Parenthood, will be a longer and more complicated process than it appears, setting up an early and potentially defining test for the new president. Mr. Trump, an eager if improbable combatant in the cause, made bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected and, in turn, won overwhelming support from religious conservatives. Yet those promises are now tangled in intraparty politics and, in some cases at least, will be blocked by Senate Democrats. They include laws that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and permanently prohibit all federal funding, including Medicaid, from paying for abortions. Cutting off Planned Parenthood is part of the larger and messier debate over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans so far have been unable to do. Even if the law is scrapped, there is no guarantee a Planned Parenthood funding ban could easily move forward, given that left-leaning women’s groups will bring intense pressure upon moderate Republicans to vote against it. On the other side of the spectrum among women’s groups is the Susan B. Anthony List, which has been lobbying to gut Planned Parenthood’s funding and is planning to target senators who may be wavering, especially in states where Mr. Trump won. "

In this podcast, Andrew Rosenthal, a Times opinion columnist, talks about the news — the good, the bad and that which makes him mad. We are but one week into President Trump’s administration, and already it feels like we are living in “a dystopian nightmare” says the Times columnist Andrew Rosenthal, who spotted nearly omnipresent signs of bad news in President Trump’s efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border, restrict immigration (especially among Muslims), limit access to abortion, reverse course on the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines and reopen C.I.A. “black” sites and reconsider torture. Acknowledging that the week’s bad and most maddening news tend to swirl together, Mr. Rosenthal says that the most maddening thing about President Trump’s first days is the “utter contempt” he has for the public as evidenced by the “string of baldfaced lies” that issue from the White House, particularly from the president’s “propaganda officer,” Kellyanne Conway, and his press secretary, Sean Spicer. “Trump knows that he can say anything he wants, and the right wing media will validate it, and his base won’t challenge it.” (“Here’s a little prediction,” says Mr. Rosenthal. “If things go as badly as I fear they will, in a decade or so, there will be public opinion poll showing that Trump lost in 2016.”) The good news? The obvious good news came in the form of protests held all over the weekend, all over the world, which Mr. Rosenthal says can have a real impact. He also cites the announcement of Oscar nominations this week that, he says, suggest “the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has finally started recognizing there are African-Americans actors, directors, and producers in the United States.” That’s progress, he says, and is worth saluting.

And at New York City Ballet, none work harder than the dancers in its lowest rank, the corps de ballet. During the first week of the company’s winter season, Claire Kretzschmar, 24, a rising corps member, danced in all seven performances, appearing in five ballets, sometimes changing costumes at intermission to dance two roles in a night. But her work onstage did not even begin to capture the stamina required to be in the corps. Spending a week shadowing Ms. Kretzschmar was exhausting — she gave new meaning to the idea of being on your feet all day. Twelve-hour days at the David H. Koch Theater, the company’s Lincoln Center home, were hardly unusual: Company class each morning was followed by back-to-back-to-back rehearsals, with occasional breaks for costume fittings or physical therapy, and then by the hair-makeup-costume-dance routine of daily performances. This weekend will be even more frenetic. Ms. Kretzschmar will appear in seven ballets from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, when she faces a new test: taking on the title role of the Sleepwalker in George Balanchine’s eerie, proto-goth ballet “La Sonnambula.” Balanchine, one of ballet’s most important choreographers, was a founder of City Ballet, and remains its guiding spirit more than three decades after his death. Being in City Ballet’s corps is not like being a member of a chorus line, or a backup singer. The company promotes almost all of its stars, the principal dancers, from within. So while the corps is expected to be able to move in startling unison, like a school of fish, and to assemble in straight lines and keep all rippling swan arms parallel, its 54 members are also competing for bigger roles and promotions. “There is an element of competition, and people get different opportunities, but everybody just wants to do their best onstage, and everyone wants each other to just do their best onstage,” Ms. Kretzschmar said during a break between rehearsals last week. “We have all experienced so many extreme highs and lows that it’s almost that you have to bond with this group of people.” "

Yet San Francisco-based Rise Capital, founded by Nazar Yasin, a former director at Tiger Global Management, sees some of the next big internet companies coming from Latin America, in particular Brazil and Mexico. After investing in multiple countries in the region in recent years, Rise, for the first time, has backed an internet start-up in Colombia. The firm led a $5.2 million round, which closed this month, in OFI, an online office supplies company in Bogotá, both Mr. Yasin and Peter Ostroske, a co-founder of OFI and its chief executive, said in interviews. That stake comes on the heels of one that Rise made in Brazil. In December, it joined in a $10 million private investment raised by São Paulo-based InstaCarro, an online platform for selling automobiles. FJ Labs and Lumia Capital, both existing investors, led that round, InstaCarro’s chief executive, Diego Fischer, said in an interview, but Rise put in money for the first time. Mr. Yasin said Rise continued to see promising opportunities in the region and expected to make more investments this year despite some of its countries’ ailing economies and uncertainty stemming from President Trump’s policies. Mexico’s economy is likely to be affected by decisions made in Washington. And Brazil remains mired in major political and economic upheaval. The central bank of Brazil’s most recent weekly survey of economists estimated growth at a mere 0.5 percent this year. The International Monetary Fund is even less optimistic, forecasting 0.2 percent growth here. "

The International Center of Photography did when it opened its doors in 1974 as a showcase for socially concerned photography, which encompassed photojournalism and so-called street photography. For over 40 years, the center has stayed on mission, even as the technology of picture-making has expanded, and the main street has become the internet. A new exhibition, “Perpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,” reflects those shifts. It’s as committedly topical as anything the center has done, with sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 election. At the same time, it looks different from shows past because digital media — smartphone videos, Twitter outtakes, Instagram feeds — outnumber photographic prints. The embrace of the digital was probably inevitable for the center, an institution that clearly doesn’t want to freeze into a yesterday-museum. But it necessitates a rethinking of old ideas. It requires seeing photography as part of a larger, amorphous category, one morally up for grabs, called visual culture. And it requires recognizing that in the digital present, visual culture does more than reflect reality: For better and for worse, it creates it. For the center, the transition has been bumpy. It started decisively with the 2016 exhibition “Public, Private, Secret,” the institution’s inaugural venture on the Bowery. Some people loathed the show, finding it a meanspirited mess that mixed too many media to no discernible end. (For me, it captured the random, narcissistic viciousness of internet culture to a T, and gave it a history.) “Perpetual Revolution” is an improvement. "

But several studies, over many years, have concluded that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States. And experts say the available evidence does not support the idea that undocumented immigrants commit a disproportionate share of crime. “There’s no way I can mess with the numbers to get a different conclusion,” said Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, which advocates more liberal immigration laws. Mr. Trump often cites specific cases of undocumented immigrants committing or being charged with crimes, like the 2015 killing in San Francisco of Kathryn Steinle, whose accused killer had repeatedly been convicted of crimes and deported, yet slipped back into the United States. His executive order states that many people who enter the country illegally “present a significant threat to national security and public safety.” It directs the Department of Homeland Security to publish a weekly “comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.” "

Mr. Musk has pressed for a carbon tax to combat global warming, which Mr. Trump once dismissed as a Chinese hoax. The mere mention of a carbon tax inflames the old guard of the energy industry.

Trump’s decision to build a wall along the southern border escalated into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, with Mexico’s president publicly canceling a scheduled meeting at the White House and Mr. Trump firing back, accusing Mexico of burdening the United States with illegal immigrants, criminals and a trade deficit. Mr. Trump’s push to fulfill his campaign pledge and build a border wall brought to a head months of simmering tensions, culminating in a remarkable back-and-forth between the two leaders. By afternoon, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said the president would pay for the border wall by imposing a 20 percent tax on imports to the United States, which he said would raise billions of dollars. The sparring began Thursday morning when the president of Mexico announced on Twitter that he was canceling his meeting with Mr. Trump next week, rejecting the visit after the new American leader ordered the border wall between the two nations. Having called for dialogue in the face of Mr. Trump’s vows to build a wall during the American presidential campaign, President Enrique Peña Nieto ultimately bowed to public pressure in Mexico to respond more forcefully to his northern neighbor.

Trump off Twitter. It is not that Mr. Trump appears to have violated any of Twitter’s terms of service, he probably hasn’t. It is not that he doesn’t deserve the same First Amendment protections to express himself as the rest of us, he does. It is not that he is not a popular and frequent user, he is. In fact, he has boffo ratings. Mr. Trump, who has referred to himself as the Ernest Hemingway of the 140-character medium, now has nearly 22 million followers, making him the 57th-most-followed person on Twitter, sandwiched between Conan O’Brien and the Real Madrid soccer team. (You wouldn’t know it, but Barack Obama is the third-most-followed person on Twitter, with 83.4 million followers, right after Justin Bieber.) No, the problem with Mr. Trump and Twitter is painfully obvious: He is reckless, cavalier, condescending, obnoxious, irresponsible and insulting, among other things. With almost any other Twitter user, such behavior could easily be ignored, and would be, making the tweeter in question quickly irrelevant. But, as we all know, Mr. Trump is not an ordinary Twitter user, a fact in which he clearly delights. As the 45th president of the United States, what he says and does on Twitter has enormous consequences. He cannot be ignored. He cannot be shunned. He cannot be publicly shamed. It has come to the point where his tweets have to be taken both literally and seriously. We are used to our presidents getting plenty of media attention on a daily basis, of course. That is a given and has been for decades. And that is as it should be. What our elected leaders say and do is important and newsworthy and deserve plenty of coverage. But Mr. Trump’s often inane tweets, coming deliberately as they do in the early morning hours, have had the unfortunate tendency of warping and dominating nearly every single news cycle, day after day.

No plutocrat will enjoy it, however. This impressive penthouse aerie is hogged by five emergency generators. The window is already blocked by a bank of electrical switchgear. For the developers, giving up premium space to machinery is insurance against an ominous future: They want tenants in the towers’ 760 apartments to be able to live in their apartments for at least a week, no matter how high floodwaters may reach nor how long the power is out. “We said: ‘Water is going to come in here. What are we going to do about it?’” explained Simon Koster, a principal in the JDS Development Group, which is building the towers, known as the American Copper Buildings. JDS is in good company. Along coastlines and lake shores and riverfronts across the country, tenants and homeowners, regulators and planners, private developers and public institutions are embracing the accumulating evidence of climate change and fortifying buildings and infrastructure against rising sea levels and ever more intense storms.

Nomani, a self-described liberal feminist and Trump voter, who claimed to document the extensive financial ties Soros had to march partners. The conservative website Breitbart News tied the piece to The Times in a prominent headline. And the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer wrote about the piece under a headline that referred to Soros as an “International Jew.” Suddenly, The Times was a right-wing crowd pleaser. Only it wasn’t The Times that ran this article. It was published on a site affiliated with The Times — but completely distinct from the paper — called Women in the World. The site is part of an events organization founded by Tina Brown (of The Daily Beast and The New Yorker fame). The Times is a business investor in Women in the World and provides the website’s digital platform, but the two have separate editorial operations. None of that was apparent to many readers who wrote in, confused about whether the story was the work of The Times. Here’s one from Susan Kruglinski of New York: It’s easy to be confused. I was. At the top left corner of the website, for example, there is the familiar “T” logo of The New York Times, and the URL has “nytimes” in it.

They even took him to court. “We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and laws without going through Congress,” Representative Paul D. Ryan, then the Budget Committee chairman, said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way. Now President Trump, at the start of his tenure, is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives, but to enact new federal policies covering immigration, health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate. And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress. The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach. Their rationale: Mr. Obama took executive action too far, stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda. “We’ve never been against executive action,” said Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, now the House speaker. “We’re against overreaching, illegal action.” "

Caitlin Parks, a family planning fellow at Washington University in St. Louis, provides reproductive health services to women at clinics and a teaching hospital in western Kenya. Her clinics receive American funding, and she says that the ban, called by critics the global gag rule, could have a major impact on poor women and communities like the ones she serves. This Q. and A., which is based on an online response and phone interview, has been edited and condensed. Mostly impoverished, many with H.I.V. or other medical conditions that make pregnancy complicated or risky. Many of the women rely on agriculture and small plots of land for both their food and their income. This is an area that has a high rate of H.I.V. and has for many years, and so there is quite a large population of H.I.V. positive women and families that have been greatly affected by H.I.V. There is a high rate of orphans and a need for extended family for support. There are lots of women as the primary supporters of their children and their extended family. Their biggest need is full-spectrum reproductive health care, including contraceptive and sometimes abortion services, as well as full maternity care. One of the things that is a challenge in the system of reproductive health care is that for many people they don’t necessarily know that they need it until they are faced with an unplanned pregnancy. One of the biggest killers in sub-Saharan Africa is maternal mortality, and lots of these people don’t necessarily know that they need to protect themselves from that. So they aren’t necessarily seeking out contraceptive care until it’s too late — they have an unplanned pregnancy that might affect their life. "

So when President Trump and his team began their White House tenure with two whoppers, doubling down on false claims about his inauguration crowd and illegal voting in the election, Republicans on Capitol Hill this week assumed their positions. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, chose to answer a question no one had asked, arguing that voter fraud “does occur” while declining to address Mr. Trump’s assertion that millions of fraudulent votes had cost him the popular vote. Speaker Paul D. Ryan allowed that he had seen no evidence of wide-scale fraud, before retreating into a familiar self-assessment (“I’m a policy guy”) to declare himself above the fray. Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, distinguished himself with the most adorable distraction: He cradled a Boston terrier puppy, stroking her chin, as he greeted reporters eager to ask about Mr. Trump this week in the basement of the Capitol. “Her name is Tilly,” he said, before politely shrugging off questions about Mr. Trump. The first several days of the Trump presidency have reinforced several core truths: He will continue to give voice to conspiracy theories and peddle misinformation. He will not stop obsessing over cosmetic displays of popularity, like crowd size and television ratings. "

The meeting was an attempt to create a “European moment” ahead of a slate of Western European elections this year. Marine Le Pen, the president of France’s National Front party and the unofficial leader of the European radical right, declared: “In 2016, the Anglo-Saxon world woke up. In 2017, I am sure that it will be the year of the Continental peoples’ rising up.” On the podium, leaders of parties from Austria, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands tried to create an image of strength and unity, a political force on the brink of reshaping a continent. As Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, said with his characteristic drama (though ominously in German): “Yesterday a new America, today Koblenz and tomorrow a new Europe.” Social and traditional media were, as usual, eager to spread the right wing’s message, referring to a “Populist International” led by Mr. Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin. This united front, many liberals worry, constitutes an existential threat to the world order. Is this fear warranted? The idea of a Populist International, which really amounts to a “Nationalist International,” has long puzzled many analysts, who observe that nationalists, by definition, have a hard time working together. Skeptics seem to be proven right by post-World War II history, which shows a long trail of failed initiatives at nationalist collaboration. The clearest example of the disunity of today’s radical right can be found in the European Parliament, where right-wing parties have been trying to build a strong coalition since the late 1980s. These efforts have largely failed, as member parties got into fights over ideological, personal and strategic issues. "

So far, the parts of the job that have obsessed him most are crowd size and vote size. And yeah, the wall. But there has to be somebody behind the scenes deciding the non-ego questions. Pass the word that it’s Pence. The best early evidence is reproductive rights. Not an issue Trump seemed all that interested in during the campaign — you generally had to sort of poke him to bring it up. Yet one of the first things he did as president was to sign an order that will eliminate American aid to international health programs that provide information on abortion. Every Republican president since Ronald Reagan has issued the order, which is often referred to as the global gag rule. But Trump’s seems much worse. The Reagan-Bush-Bush version covered family planning programs. Trump’s targets global health in general. So when it comes to combating the Zika virus in South America, we’ll only be helping organizations that are willing to order their staffs never to bring up the fact that abortion exists. We’re talking about a potential loss of billions of dollars in American aid. I know some of you are having trouble giving the president credit for anything right now. But this doesn’t sound like him.

That debate has roiled the news world. The Times this week used the word “lie” in a front-page headline, and I agreed with that decision, but there’s a counterargument that lying requires an intention to deceive — and that Trump may actually believe his absurd falsehoods. So in 2017 we reach a mortifying moment for a great democracy: We must decide whether our 45th president is a liar or a crackpot. Yet the costliest presidential falsehoods and delusions are not the ones that people are talking about, such as those concerning the inauguration crowd or electoral fraud. The most horrific chicanery involves Trump’s new actions on women’s health that will cause deaths around the globe. It followed the weekend’s stunning women’s marches: At least 3.2 million people apparently participated in all 50 states, amounting to 1 percent of the U.S. population. In a slap at all who marched, Trump this week signed an order that will cut off access to contraception to vast numbers of women, particularly in Africa. It will also curb access to cancer screenings and maybe even undermine vaccination campaigns and efforts against H.I.V. and the Zika virus. The upshot: Thousands of impoverished, vulnerable women will die. Americans have focused on the executive actions about building a wall, or expediting oil pipelines, but nothing is more devastating than the edict on women’s health (signed in front of a group composed almost entirely of smiling men in suits).

These are lies; good old-fashioned lies, baldfaced and flat-out lies. Some have suggested that we in the media should focus a bit less on these lies — some of them issued in tweets and some in interviews or news conferences — and focus more on policies, particularly the ineptitude of the gathering cabinet and the raft of executive orders that Trump himself is signing. But I take the position that this is all worthy of coverage, that there are simply different kinds of news being unearthed about this administration that exist on different strata. To take it even further, it may be these seemingly smaller infractions that produce the greater injury because the implications are more profound. Trump does not simply have “a running war with the media,” as he so indecorously and disrespectfully spouted off while standing on the hallowed ground before the C.I.A. Memorial Wall. He is in fact having a running war with the truth itself. Donald Trump is a proven liar. He lies often and effortlessly. He lies about the profound and the trivial. He lies to avoid guilt and invite glory. He lies when his pride is injured and when his pomposity is challenged. Indeed, one of the greatest threats Trump poses is that he corrupts and corrodes the absoluteness of truth, facts and science. "

But for these viewers, there was an even bigger problem. The women’s march had drawn an estimated half-million people to Washington, and many more to simultaneous demonstrations around the country, dominating the nation’s news coverage just six days before abortion foes were holding their annual march. Since then, the organizers of that march have been telling their followers: You’d better turn out on Friday. This year’s anti-abortion march in Washington – the 44th annual March for Life — was expected to be a celebratory event at which abortion opponents could finally savor a few victories. The new president, Donald J. Trump, is already delivering on his promises to sign a slate of anti-abortion measures. He has promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion 44 years ago. And a Congress dominated by Republicans is poised to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. But a new sense of urgency, anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year’s event, with anti-abortion organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow. “We’re definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come,” said Amelia Irvine, president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington.

Ali Abdullah Ayoub of the Syrian Army visited this month. It is the battle cruiser Pyotr Velikiy — not Russia’s aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. OBITUARIES An obituary on Monday about the drummer Charles Bobo Shaw, using information from his family, misspelled the given name and misstated the surname of one of his daughters. She is Loreene Sebbane, not Lorene Sabbane Shaw. • An obituary on Wednesday about Anthony Colombo, the former vice president of the Italian-American Civil Rights League, misstated the middle initial of the automobile executive Lee Iacocca. He is Lee A., not Lee P. The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.

Here’s what you need to know to start your day in Europe: • President Trump is preparing a flurry of security actions that will reshape how the U.S. conducts itself at home and around the world. Among the president’s first moves is ordering the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico. His administration is also preparing executive orders that could drastically reduce the U.S. role in the United Nations and is considering resuming the C.I.A. “black site” detention program. Mr. Trump has shown in just days in office that he is like few if any occupants of the White House before him. The Times has more articles related to Mr. Trump than the briefing can highlight, so here’s our full coverage. _____ • A Times reporter was struck by the progress Somalia had made since his last visit to the capital, Mogadishu, several years ago.

78,‘I Think Islam Hates Us’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/i-think-islam-hates-us.html?searchResultPosition=72,2017/01/26,OPINION,"Eradicating “radical Islamic terrorism” from the face of the earth has been President Trump’s mantra, first in the campaign, then in his Inaugural Address and remarks a day later to the C.I.A. No one would argue with fighting back against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and other terrorist groups that threaten the United States, Europe, the Middle East and beyond. For eight years, President Barack Obama did just that, using a multilayered approach that included launching thousands of air and drone strikes in at least a half dozen countries and killing countless militants, among them Osama bin Laden. While Mr. Obama made significant progress in degrading this threat — the Islamic State has lost considerable territory in both Iraq and Syria — he did not put an end to violent extremism. Mr. Trump is now pledging to do more and better. The problem is that his approach, as we know it, is more likely to further inflame anti-American sentiment around the world than to make the United States safer. Mr. Trump has not explained how he would destroy the terrorist danger. But his use of slogans like “radical Islam,” which echo the views of his closest advisers, implies a naïve reading of the threat from about 40,000 extremists, while demonizing and alienating many of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims. The emerging details suggest that Mr. Trump’s plans to eradicate violent extremists are not only at odds with Mr. Obama’s; they trample on American values and international law. It was reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump was planning to block Syrians and others from “terror prone” nations from entering the United States, at least temporarily, even though Washington already vets visitors from such countries. While people from Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq would be blocked by a monthlong ban, Mr. Trump appears, inexplicably, to be exempting Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, home of 15 of the 19 extremists who hijacked the planes on Sept. 11. Refugee admissions would be halted for 120 days while screening procedures are reviewed, with the number allowed in cut from 110,000 to 50,000. Another draft executive order would allow the C.I.A. to revive the once-secret program under which terrorism suspects were interrogated in “black site” prisons overseas, which were shut down by Mr. Obama in 2009. The order would also re-examine the use of torture, which was widely condemned in the Bush era and is opposed by Mr. Trump’s own defense secretary. Mr. Trump would also keep open the prison at Guantánamo Bay, which Mr. Obama tried to close, and reportedly is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood, which is involved in Muslim politics in a number of countries, as a terrorist organization. Some experts see the move as a chance for the Trump administration to limit Muslim political activity in the United States. But since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a NATO ally, sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood, such a step would further complicate that fraught alliance. "
79,Clinics for World’s Vulnerable Brace for Trump’s Anti-Abortion Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/world/africa/clinics-health-care-cuts-abortion-trump.html?searchResultPosition=63,2017/01/26,AFRICA,"DAKAR, Senegal — The clinic, tucked discreetly inside the student health center on the University of Dakar campus, prescribes birth control pills, hands out condoms and answers questions about sex that young women are nervous about asking in this conservative Muslim country. The clinic performs no abortions, nor does it discuss the procedure or give advice on where to get one. Senegal, by and large, outlaws abortion. But for other health services like getting contraceptives, said Anne Lancelot, the Sahel director at the organization that runs the clinic, “there is a very high demand.” Now, under a Reagan-era policy revived by President Trump, the clinic may no longer be able to count on aid money from the United States Agency for International Development, part of a ban on providing abortion counseling overseas that could curtail a broad range of health services, including those that go well beyond abortion. Known as the Mexico City policy — and by its critics as the global gag rule — the abortion policy prohibits organizations abroad from using American aid to talk about abortion as a method of family planning. Anti-abortion groups like the Family Research Council have welcomed Mr. Trump’s decision, saying it is consistent with “his campaign promise that he will protect taxpayers from having to pay for abortions.” Direct American aid to carry out abortions was already prohibited, but the rule Mr. Trump revived goes further. It requires not only hospitals or clinics to refrain from providing advice or information on the benefits and availability of abortion. It also requires any international organizations supporting those clinics to stop promoting abortion or advocating abortion rights anywhere in the world — even if they use non-American money to do so. Experts say the rule has cut American aid to groups offering a wide range of services, not just abortion, during previous Republican administrations that have adopted the policy. "

But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32,000 and 2.8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38,000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. “The high-end estimates are likely incorrect,” Jesse Richman, one of the co-authors of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump’s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It’s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there’s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study’s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don’t answer a question correctly — in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is self-administered. An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren’t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey. "
83,New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html?searchResultPosition=45,2017/01/26,SCIENCE,"For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos, shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant. The approach involves generating stem cells from a patient’s skin, growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig, and then harvesting it for transplant into the patient’s body. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. The human-organ-growing pigs would be examples of chimeras, animals composed of two different genomes. They would be generated by implanting human stem cells into an early pig embryo, resulting in an animal composed of mixed pig and human cells. One team of biologists, led by Jun Wu and Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute, has shown for the first time that human stem cells can contribute to forming the tissues of a pig, despite the 90 million years of evolution between the two species. Another group, headed by Tomoyuki Yamaguchi and Hideyuki Sato of the University of Tokyo, and Hiromitsu Nakauchi of Stanford, has reversed diabetes in mice by inserting pancreas glands composed of mouse cells that were grown in a rat. The Salk team’s report is published in Thursday’s issue of Cell and the Stanford-Tokyo team’s in Wednesday’s issue of Nature. The two reports together establish the feasibility of trying to grow replacement human organs in animals, though such a goal is still far off. "

Having cast off decades of global niceties — the United States by putting him in the White House, Britain by voting to leave the European Union — they can now forge a magnificent future. Mr. Trump is readying proof. As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday, he intends to begin discussions on a free-trade agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries. A trade agreement would make for useful political theater on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly as President Barack Obama had pointedly warned that a deal would not easily happen. But as a spur to economic expansion and hiring, a deal would almost certainly amount to very little. Until Britain actually leaves Europe — a step most likely at least two years away — it is legally barred from entering a trade agreement with any country. If a deal was quietly negotiated to take effect after Britain’s departure, its economic punch would probably be modest. Tariffs between the countries are already minimal, meaning there are relatively few trade impediments left to clear away. What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive: agriculture, government procurement and defense. Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of now-favored industries. American federal government contracts would attract keen interest from British defense and aerospace companies, especially as Mr. Trump has vowed to rebuild the military. But opening such business to foreign competitors in a trade agreement would directly collide with Mr. Trump’s “America First” mantra. "

A long battle may delay construction for months or even years. The pipeline has long been at the center of a struggle pitting environmentalists against advocates of energy independence and economic growth. President Barack Obama rejected the project in late 2015, saying it would be antithetical to the United States’ leadership in curbing reliance on carbon fuels. But even with an opening for the pipeline to go forward, the energy markets are starkly different from what they were eight years ago, when the Obama administration began considering the pipeline. When the project was conceived, the United States was struggling to lift domestic oil supplies and push down prices. The Keystone XL project was meant to supplement existing pipelines and increase Canada’s export potential. Since then, production has rebounded in the United States, and international oil markets are dealing with oversupply. Gasoline at the pump is cheap. As has been the case throughout the project’s history, however, economic forces alone will not determine its prospects. Political, commercial, environmental and even diplomatic factors will also play a role. Environmentalists filed a lawsuit in opposition within days after the permit was issued by the State Department, and landowners and other opponents are mobilizing in Nebraska for public hearings to be held this spring. The Nebraska Public Service Commission still must decide whether to grant the pipeline builder, TransCanada, approval to build the pipeline through the state. "
86,Campuses Wary of Offering ‘Sanctuary’ to Undocumented Students,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/education/edlife/sanctuary-for-undocumented-students.html?searchResultPosition=49,2017/01/26,EDUCATION LIFE,"Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, knows exactly what’s at stake if President Trump shuts down an Obama administration program that has given work permits and protection from deportation to some 752,000 young undocumented immigrants. In 2012, in her previous job as secretary of Homeland Security, she signed the document — nothing more than a policy memo — that created the program. So when alarm spread among immigrants on college campuses following Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Napolitano moved quickly to determine what the California system could do to shelter its students if he carried through on his pledges to cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The university estimates that almost 3,800 among its 190,000 students are undocumented, many but not all with DACA. Ms. Napolitano, retaining her law enforcement instincts, does not mention the word “sanctuary” when describing what the university could offer. “Sanctuary is such a vague term, we don’t use it,” she said crisply. Instead, the university has published detailed principles of support for undocumented students, including assurances that campus police would not question students solely about their immigration status or join any cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities under the Trump administration. Through the Davis campus law school, the university is organizing legal help for students detained for deportation. Another worrisome prospect, Ms. Napolitano said, is that students could lose the permits that allow them to work. Undocumented students, including any losing DACA, will continue to pay in-state tuition and be eligible for state financial aid and for a revolving loan program funded, in part, by the university. “We want to do everything we can so students are safe on our campuses,” Ms. Napolitano said, “so they can focus on what they are there to do, which is to study.” "

You just never know what celebrity will suddenly be thrust into the spotlight by President Trump. But Bernhard Langer? Americans who don’t follow golf might not even know who he is. Mr. Langer was the subject of an anecdote told by Mr. Trump at a White House reception on Monday, according to several witnesses. It seems that Mr. Langer was standing in line to vote in Florida and was told he could not. Yet people ahead of him and behind him in line who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote, according to Mr. Trump, were permitted to cast provisional ballots. An incongruity in Mr. Trump’s tale is that Mr. Langer, though he lives in Florida, is a German citizen and cannot legally vote in the United States. Mr. Langer’s daughter Christina told The New York Times, “He is not a friend of President Trump’s, and I don’t know why he would talk about him.” Mr. Langer said on Thursday that he had merely heard the story from a friend and passed it on to someone who then relayed it to the White House, the Golf Channel reported.

On Thursday, the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster, moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour. It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb. Though scientists decide on the clock’s position, it is not a scientific instrument, or even a physical one. The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition, placing it at seven minutes to midnight. Since then, it has moved closer to midnight and farther away, depending on the board’s conclusions. Thursday’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson, the executive director and publisher of the bulletin. She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley, and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering. Dr. Bronson, in a post-announcement interview, explained why the board had included the 30-second mark in the measurement. She said that it was an attention-catching signal that was meant to acknowledge “what a dangerous moment we’re in, and how important it is for people to take note.” “We’re so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” she said. “Rather than create panic, we’re hoping that this drives action.” "

But on Monday, during his first official meeting with congressional leaders, Mr. Trump insisted that he actually won the popular vote — once you subtract the three million to five million illegally cast ballots, all of which he says, were cast “for the other side.” Now he is calling for a major federal investigation into election fraud that, according to the White House press secretary, will focus on “urban areas” in “big states” that Mr. Trump lost, like California and New York. Here are the (non-alternative) facts: There were more than 135 million ballots cast in November. A careful review by The Washington Post documented a grand total of just four cases of voter fraud nationwide — including an Iowa woman who voted twice for Mr. Trump. And during the recount litigation in Michigan, the president’s own legal team told a court that “all available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.” But don’t take it from them. Just ask yourself if this story seems plausible: Sophisticated cheats committed widespread election fraud to the tune of five million votes and vanished without a trace. But they forgot to steal 80,000 votes in three states (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) that would have been decisive for Hillary Clinton. It’s as if the thieves from “Ocean’s Eleven” broke into Fort Knox, left behind the gold bars and took a stamp collection. So why would the president make this easily debunked claim that there was widespread voter fraud? First, he faces a legitimacy problem. I’m not talking about rigged or hacked voting machines. The Rust Belt recounts show only that our voting systems score high on integrity. Sure, voting machines can always use improvements, and meltdowns have happened (see Florida, 2000). But, despite unsubstantiated concerns raised by Jill Stein and others, there is no evidence of large-scale fraud or miscounting — certainly nothing that could tip multiple states by tens of thousands of votes. The truth is that Mr. Trump won critical battleground states and the Electoral College with 304 votes. And that’s why he’s the president. The Electoral College is the law of the land, but opinion polls over the last 15 years indicate that most Americans — about 60 percent — agree that it should be scrapped in favor of the popular vote. (The number of Americans in favor of keeping the Electoral College, however, did jump to about 47 percent shortly after Mr. Trump’s victory.) "

Somewhere in America, Donald J. Trump has not yet replaced Barack Obama. Pete Souza’s candid photo of Mr. Obama, smiling joyfully, still greets visitors to the 16th-floor boardroom of The New York Times. Until this week, it occupied a place of honor on the credenza, standing apart from walls filled with autographed portraits of world leaders. That spot is now empty. Every president from Harry Truman forward, and several before him, has sent an autographed portrait to The Times or to members of the Ochs-Sulzberger family. Or both. “For Miss Iphigene Ochs, with regards of Theodore Roosevelt, August 1, 1902,” is one of them. (Miss Ochs married Arthur Hays Sulzberger in 1917. Their grandson Arthur is the current publisher and chairman.) In a tradition reaching back a few decades, the portrait of the incumbent president has been set off by itself on the credenza. Visitors might have been surprised to see George W. Bush or Bill Clinton in such a prominent spot at The Times, but our explanation was always the same: We honor the office even if we are quarreling fiercely with the occupant. "

In videos online, Mr. LaBeouf — who has a history of provocative behavior and a record of arrests for minor offenses — expresses outrage, evidently aimed at Mr. Trump, and uses expletive-laden language to ask how the public can make it normal “to be a Nazi out here.” In one video, a small gathering of fellow protesters chants “He will not divide us” as the bearded Mr. LaBeouf speaks. A police officer approaches, and Mr. LaBeouf appears to get into a verbal altercation with him before the officer places him in handcuffs and escorts him out of the camera’s view. Mr. LaBeouf was arrested just after 12.30 a.m. and charged with misdemeanor assault and with harassment, according to Detective Adam Navarro of the New York City Police Department. He was issued a desk appearance ticket and instructed to come to court on April 4. He was not jailed. Detective Navarro said that the police were called after Mr. LaBeouf got into an argument with another man at the installation, pulled off the man’s scarf and, in the process, scratched his face. The man did not need to be hospitalized, the detective said. The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf’s latest art project, “He Will Not Divide Us,” a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner. On Inauguration Day, the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, and invited members of the public to repeat the words “he will not divide us” into the camera. The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words, 24/7, throughout Mr. Trump’s time in office. Representatives for Mr. LaBeouf did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday morning. The arrest is not Mr. LaBeouf’s first dust-up with the law: In 2014, while at a Broadway performance of the musical “Cabaret,” he was arrested and later charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. The actor first rose to prominence as a child performer on the Disney Channel television series “Even Stevens,” and in 2008 starred in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” More recently, he has drawn as much attention for his unusual art projects as for his acting. In November 2015, Mr. LaBeouf arranged a three-day marathon of all of his movies at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. The next month, he set up shop in an art gallery in Liverpool, England, asking people to call him and “touch his soul.” "

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Let’s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. President Trump began rolling out his plans to aggressively transform the nation’s immigration laws on Wednesday, signing a pair of executive orders — one called for the start of construction of a wall along the border with Mexico and the other demanded holding back federal money from so-called sanctuary cities. And the reaction in California was swift: Elected Democractic officials from all over the state blasted the president’s orders. Just an hour after President Trump spoke at the Department of Homeland Security, State Senate Democrats held a news conference in Sacramento, announcing that they were prepared to take the fight over sanctuary cities to court. Earlier this month, the Democratic-led Legislature hired former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to represent them in any legal battle with the White House. They said Mr. Trump’s order violated the 10th Amendment by forcing local governments to enforce federal statutes. “These are spiteful and meanspirited directives that will only instill fear in the hearts of millions of people who pay taxes, contribute to the economy and our way of life,” Kevin de Leon, the Democratic leader of the State Senate, said.

I’m saying this b/c I know many ppl feel deep despair about climate, especially postelection. I struggle every day. You are not alone. How am I supposed to do my job — literally to chronicle planetary suicide — w/o experiencing deep existential despair myself?” These are perilous times for both the climate and those like Mr. Holthuas working on its behalf. The new Trump administration instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to remove its web page about climate change from the site. Scientists, archivists and journalists have been scrambling to preserve the valuable data the agency amassed, and the National Park Service is verging on revolt.

96,New York Today: The Year of the Rooster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/nyregion/new-york-today-the-year-of-the-rooster-chinese-lunar-new-year-parade.html?searchResultPosition=60,2017/01/26,NEW YORK,"Updated, 11:20 a.m. 早安。(Good morning.) Once upon a time, as one version of Chinese folklore goes, 12 animals competed in a big race across a river. The rat jumped on the back of the kindhearted ox, who saw no problem giving the little guy a lift from one riverbank to the other. But as they neared the finish line — ahead of the others — the rat jumped off the ox and snatched first place. The ox came in a close second. The Year of the Rat is, then, the first on the Chinese zodiac calendar, followed by the Year of the Ox, and so forth, based on the order in which the creatures finished the race. This Lunar New Year, a multiweek celebration that begins on Saturday, marks the Year of the Rooster. For thousands of years, as early as in the Zhou dynasty, roosters have been viewed “as in charge of time,” said Shenzhan Liao, the director of the school of Chinese studies at the China Institute, a cultural and education center in downtown Manhattan. “The rooster wakes up the day and is considered to be in charge of the light.” (The rooster, the 10th year of the zodiac, is also symbolic of hard work and diligence, she added — always the first one up, with energy to take on a new day. Perhaps we New Yorkers might actually be roosters in human bodies?) "
97,Star of Iranian Film Says She Will Boycott Oscars Over Trump’s Visa Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/movies/taraneh-alidoosti-boycott-oscars-trump-iranian-film.html?searchResultPosition=42,2017/01/26,MOVIES,"PARIS — The Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, a co-star of “The Salesman,” an Iranian film up for the foreign-language Academy Award, said Thursday that she would boycott the Oscars ceremony to protest President Trump’s announcement that he would issue a temporary ban on visas to citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. [ Read our review of “The Salesman” ] Mr. Trump said this week that he would issue an executive order to suspend immigration for at least 30 days for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It remains unclear how and whether the ban would take effect. Ms. Alidoosti made her intentions clear on her Twitter feed, writing: “Trump’s visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won’t attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest.” In an email interview, she said that she would not attend the Oscars ceremony on Feb. 26 even if it turned out the proposed ban did not affect her ability to get a visa. “I decided not to go even if I could, because it hurts me deeply to see ordinary people of my country being rejected for what might be their legal right to have access to their children abroad or to their school classes as students,” Ms. Alidoosti said. “The Salesman,” which the government of Iran approved for submission to the Academy Awards, is one of five films vying for best foreign language film. It is directed by Asghar Farhadi, whose “A Separation” won an Oscar for best foreign language film in 2012. “The Salesman” tells the story of a Tehran couple whose lives are irrevocably changed when they have to move apartments while starring in an amateur production of Arthur Miller’s “The Death of a Salesman.” Ms. Alidoosti said she had not discussed her decision with Mr. Farhadi and did not know who would represent the film at the ceremony. She said that the director had generally brought the lead actors of his films to foreign awards ceremonies, including to the Cannes Film Festival, where “The Salesman” received a strong critical reception last year. The actress noted that the United States did not have an embassy in Tehran and that Iranians often traveled to neighboring countries to secure visas. “Many people have urgent medical cases,” she said. “I’m sure all of them are not just going through the ordeal for a fun vacation; they might have a more serious case.” “I’m sure the United States has also benefited many times from Iranian immigrants and people who have worked there and served that country,” Ms. Alidoosti added. “So it’s not acceptable to me to respect a state that does not respect the people of my country.” A spokeswoman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

98,"‘Zoot Suit,’ a Pioneering Chicano Play, Comes Full Circle",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/theater/zoot-suit-a-pioneering-chicano-play-comes-full-circle.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/01/26,THEATER,"LOS ANGELES — When “Zoot Suit” first opened at the Mark Taper Forum in 1978, little about the production screamed hit. Much of the cast had scant acting experience. The story itself was a Brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 Los Angeles; its climax involved a humiliating assault on a Latino man by racist United States servicemen. Just a decade earlier, its writer and director, Luis Valdez, was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the Central Valley in California. But audiences kept coming, and coming, selling out show after packed show. Fans came one week and returned with their families the next; Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead is said to have seen the play 22 times. After running for 11 months to sold-out audiences, first at the Taper and then at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, “Zoot Suit” moved to New York’s Winter Garden in 1979, where it became the first Chicano theatrical production on Broadway. Mr. Valdez then directed a feature-film version, which was released in 1982. “We had no idea any of this would happen, man,” he said. “It was like this huge explosion.” On Tuesday, Jan. 31, a revival of “Zoot Suit” begins its run at the Taper, kicking off the theater’s 50th-anniversary season. A fantastical reimagining of the so-called Sleepy Lagoon murder case, in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge, “Zoot Suit” features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids, lively swing tunes and family squabbles. The infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-American youths in the summer of 1943, figures in as well. Looming over it all is El Pachuco, a mythical trickster figure who can stop time and materialize wherever he pleases (think Prospero, but with a lot more panache), and “The Press,” a barking headline made flesh. The show is both a homecoming and a reunion. Four decades after its world premiere, Mr. Valdez, who is 76, is back as director. Daniel Valdez (Luis’s brother) and Rose Portillo, who in 1978 portrayed Henry Reyna and Della Barrios, the young lovers at the heart of the play, this time around play Henry’s parents. “I got kind of choked up the first time I heard those words all over again,” Daniel Valdez said. “Coming back to it is a little like coming home.” "
99,How to Save CNN From Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/how-to-save-cnn-from-itself.html?searchResultPosition=73,2017/01/26,OPINION,"In 2004, eight years after he’d sold CNN to Time Warner, Ted Turner, the network’s founder, sounded an alarm about the dangers of corporate ownership of news organizations. Mr. Turner wrote that in his day, “we put journalism first, and that’s how we built CNN into something the world wanted to watch.” In his view, “quarterly earnings obsessed” corporate owners would not have the same priorities because “the emphasis instantly shifts from taking risks to taking profits.” His warning is especially chilling today, when the integrity of the press matters more than ever. Unfortunately, in the past 20 months CNN’s management has let down its viewers and its journalists by sidelining the issues and real reporting in favor of pundits, prognostication and substance-free but entertaining TV “moments.” Still, I believe the network can again play an essential role. At its best, CNN is a journalistic enterprise with unparalleled reach and resources, connecting its viewers with people and conflicts half a mile or half a world away. That’s why I believe that as a condition of Time Warner’s bid to merge with AT&T, CNN should be sold to a new independent entity. This sale would also include CNN international, Headline News and its digital and related properties. Though AT&T has dismissed talk of a sale, one could be compelled by regulators. A consortium of concerned Americans — philanthropists, foundations, small-dollar donors — could fund a trust to operate an independent CNN dedicated to news in the public interest. Subscription fees from cable and other service providers, along with ad revenue, would allow the network to support itself. I became a devoted viewer of CNN in 1989, during its coverage of the standoff in Tiananmen Square. I remember my father telling me that the only reason the Chinese government didn’t massacre those kids right away was because CNN had cameras on the scene. From Tiananmen Square to the fall of the Berlin Wall, from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to Hurricane Katrina, CNN provided exhaustive live, on-the-ground reporting. Its saturation coverage has had such a profound impact that there’s even a term for it: “the CNN effect,” the power to shift policy and inspire empathy by keeping eyes on unfolding events. "

The university announced the cancellation on Twitter around 6 p.m. local time, about an hour after a section of the campus erupted in protest. All buildings on campus were locked down for several hours, and the university police said on Twitter that students should leave the area because of the “violent demonstration.” The lockdown was lifted around 10:55 p.m. local time. Early Thursday morning, President Trump spoke out against the university for canceling the event. In an appearance on “Fox and Friends” on Thursday, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers, compared the protest to those that took place at airports across the country over the weekend in opposition to the president’s executive order on immigration.

102,Judge Orders U.S. to Let In Immigrant Visa Holders,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/california-judge-trump-immigrant-visa-holders.html?searchResultPosition=94,2017/02/01,POLITICS,"LOS ANGELES — A federal judge has dealt another blow to President Trump’s executive order barring some foreigners from coming into the United States, in a ruling that added to the confusion over the legality of the immigration measure. Using more sweeping language than previous court rulings, Judge André Birotte Jr. of United States District Court here issued a temporary restraining order on Tuesday evening requiring the government to allow in people with valid immigrant visas from the seven majority-Muslim countries Mr. Trump sought to block. The judge’s order affects only people who are seeking to live in the United States permanently and are taking the first steps to becoming a legal resident. This does not include tourists or students trying to enter the country. The order came in response to a complaint filed on behalf of 28 people from Yemen — United States citizens and their family members who had remained in Yemen but later received immigrant visas. The visa holders have been stuck in an airport in Djibouti since President Trump issued his executive order on Friday, according to the complaint. Like in other rulings in New York and Boston, Judge Birotte wrote that the plaintiffs would likely succeed in court on the merits and that they would also “likely suffer irreparable harm” without an injunction. Yemen is currently embroiled in a civil war with civilians in danger. "
103,"Runner-Up Didn’t Make It to Supreme Court, but He Did Get to Altoona",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/supreme-court-runner-up-thomas-hardiman.html?searchResultPosition=95,2017/02/01,U.S.,"WASHINGTON — For Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, the road to the Supreme Court ended in Altoona. This week’s high court runner-up — who helped pay for his education by driving a cab — drove east from his office in Pittsburgh shortly after noon on Tuesday, just as White House officials were whispering that he was heading toward Washington to an “Apprentice”-style finale with Judge Neil Gorsuch where President Trump would announce his first Supreme Court pick. At around 3 p.m., under the watchful eyes of a CNN camera crew, he stopped at a gas station in Altoona, then disappeared. The reason for his 100-mile trip — whether it was to visit an old friend or to try to make powerful new ones at the Trump White House — remains something of a mystery. Three administration officials who did not want to be identified said Judge Hardiman hit the road to Washington to help them maintain the illusion that the selection process was still competitive. Judge Hardiman did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday. His friends say he was simply visiting a colleague who lives in Altoona. The day began with a phone call from Don McGahn, the White House counsel, who informed Judge Hardiman that Mr. Trump’s pick would be Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, another conservative appeals court judge, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. But putting on a dignified East Room ceremony announcing Judge Gorsuch’s nomination was important for an administration struggling to recover from the self-inflicted wound of last Friday’s executive order barring migrants from seven Muslim nations, which has provoked a powerful bipartisan backlash. Getting the optics just right, people close to Mr. Trump said, was a priority. But by late Monday news media outlets were killing the buzz, and starting to report that Judge Gorsuch looked like a sure thing. Aides in the West Wing worried that interest in the prime-time announcement would quickly fade if the Gorsuch selection was known, and told reporters already staking out Judge Hardiman’s house that he was heading to Washington.

104,Raid in Yemen: Risky From the Start and Costly in the End,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/middleeast/donald-trump-yemen-commando-raid-questions.html?searchResultPosition=96,2017/02/01,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — Just five days after taking office, over dinner with his newly installed secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Trump was presented with the first of what will be many life-or-death decisions: whether to approve a commando raid that risked the lives of American Special Operations forces and foreign civilians alike. President Barack Obama’s national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack on a small, heavily guarded brick home of a senior Qaeda collaborator in a mountainous village in a remote part of central Yemen. But Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended. With two of his closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, joining the dinner at the White House along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., Mr. Trump approved sending in the Navy’s SEAL Team 6, hoping the raid early last Sunday would scoop up cellphones and laptop computers that could yield valuable clues about one of the world’s most dangerous terrorist groups. Vice President Mike Pence and Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, also attended the dinner. As it turned out, almost everything that could go wrong did. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid was returned home, the first military death on the new commander in chief’s watch. The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious 50-minute firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations — which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct — that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. The dead include, by the account of Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Mr. Trump on Sunday hailed his first counterterrorism operation as a success, claiming the commandos captured “important intelligence that will assist the U.S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.” A statement by the military’s Central Command on Wednesday night that acknowledged the likelihood of civilian casualties also said that the recovered materials had provided some initial information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. The statement did not provide details. "
105,Protesters Vow Defiance After Miami Heeds Immigration Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/miami-mayor-carlos-gimenez.html?searchResultPosition=97,2017/02/01,U.S.,"MIAMI — In a place that thinks of itself as the capital of Latin America, the Miami-Dade County mayor’s decision last week to jump out front and heed President Trump’s executive order demanding cooperation with immigration agents has set off consternation and protests. Residents have marched on County Hall and accused the mayor, Carlos Gimenez — a former Cuban refugee — of betraying a county that proudly boasts the second largest number of immigrants in the United States and was considered a sanctuary city. Making matters worse, they said, Mr. Gimenez, who feared losing federal grant money, was the first big-city mayor to do so. Protesters have vowed to pack the county commission meeting next week. “It’s embarrassing in this city of immigrants, in a multicultural, diverse place like this that our mayor is not taking a strong stance,” said Tomás Kennedy, 25, a college student from Argentina who became a United States citizen after being undocumented for 17 years, and who joined the latest protest Tuesday. “He is an immigrant himself. He came here fleeing political persecution from Cuba. He knows firsthand what immigrants and refugees contribute to this county.’’ Last Thursday, Mr. Gimenez directed county jails to “fully cooperate” with Mr. Trump’s directive. The order targeted what are known as sanctuary cities and counties, which generally do not comply with federal requests to detain undocumented immigrants who have been arrested on unrelated charges until immigration officers can get them. In response to Mr. Trump’s order, Mr. Gimenez directed county jails to detain people who were flagged by immigration authorities as possible illegal immigrants for 48 hours. Miami-Dade had all but stopped honoring these requests since 2014 after the county commission demanded that the federal government reimburse the county for added detention costs, which in 2012 reached $650,000. That 2014 shift away from honoring detainment requests landed the county on the Obama administration’s list of sanctuary cities, according to Mr. Gimenez. For the mayor, a Republican who said before the presidential election he would vote for Hillary Clinton, the move boiled down to a pocketbook issue — the potential loss of as much as $355 million a year in federal grant money. In his executive order, Mr. Trump threatened to withhold discretionary federal funds from cities that do not comply. Mr. Gimenez has disavowed the sanctuary city label, an amorphous, highly politicized term. "
106,"After Visa Ban, Hints of Hidden Tension on Mississippi Campus",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/mississippi-state-trump-visa-ban.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/02/01,U.S.,"STARKVILLE, Miss. — Coming from an Iranian city of around 150,000 people, Amir Rezazadeh felt a little out of place when he arrived at Mississippi State University, more than 100 miles from any metropolitan area and deep in the heart of the Bible Belt. But he soon came to like the quiet surroundings, where there was little to distract him from his horticulture studies, and where there was already a group of Middle Eastern students and professors to make him feel welcome. Ignoring half-serious warnings that he could be converted, he even began spending time at the Baptist Student Union, where he honed his English, discussed Christianity and Islam, played games and watched movies, and forged friendships with some of the Mississippi-born students. That is why he was more than a little taken aback this past week when students told him to his face that they agreed with President Trump’s order to temporarily ban visa holders from Iran and six other countries from entering the United States. “Some people say directly to you that it’s a good order,” he said, “that our country should have this order to ban terrorists.” He finds their position especially hurtful, he said, in light of his fears of what the order might mean for him and his wife, and roughly 80 other students from the seven countries.

107,White House Inc.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/opinion/white-house-inc.html?searchResultPosition=100,2017/02/01,OPINION,"As a candidate, President Trump spent contributors’ money for office space that he owned, stays at his resorts and food at his restaurants. He spent contributors’ money on Trump-branded wine and water. He displayed Trump merchandise at campaign events. Now he seems determined to milk the presidency, apparently synonymous with his brand in his eyes, for a fortune. “The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before,” Mr. Trump observed, with satisfaction, shortly after the election. Last week, an executive of the Trump Organization, Eric Danziger, said it would open Trump-branded hotels in the 26 largest metropolitan areas in the country, up from five. The business, he said, would focus its expansion domestically for “the next four or eight years.” The fee to join the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., which Mr. Trump calls the “Winter White House,” just doubled to $200,000. This news came less than a week after Mr. Trump and his inauguration committee hosted parties and other events at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, in the government-owned Old Post Office. Even his press secretary, Sean Spicer, has become a pitchman: “It’s an absolutely stunning hotel,” he said recently. “I encourage you to go there if you haven’t been by.” Self-dealing is such standard procedure for this White House that a cynic (or satirist) might say it’s time to give in and try to put Mr. Trump’s conflicts of interest to work for the public. Maybe if he had hotels in every nation, he’d have a financial interest in being less bellicose, and more supportive of the free flow of trade and of people, even if they happen to be Mexican or Muslim. But we really prefer the old-fashioned approach in which presidents put the public interest ahead of their own finances. Federal ethics officials have told Mr. Trump that he should divest his business interests to avoid allegations of bribery and to assure Americans that their needs are his only concern. Mr. Trump argues that he can put a “firewall” between his businesses and himself by having his eldest sons manage them. The president and the Trump Organization last week hired lawyers to keep an eye on the Trumps, a laughable ploy that doesn’t meet ethical or anti-corruption standards and constitutional requirements.

108,Trump Pushes Dark View of Islam to Center of U.S. Policy-Making,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/donald-trump-islam.html?searchResultPosition=101,2017/02/01,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — It was at a campaign rally in August that President Trump most fully unveiled the dark vision of an America under siege by “radical Islam” that is now radically reshaping the policies of the United States. On a stage lined with American flags in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Trump, who months before had called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration, argued that the United States faced a threat on par with the greatest evils of the 20th century. The Islamic State was brutalizing the Middle East, and Muslim immigrants in the West were killing innocents at nightclubs, offices and churches, he said. Extreme measures were needed. “The hateful ideology of radical Islam,” he told supporters, must not be “allowed to reside or spread within our own communities.” Mr. Trump was echoing a strain of anti-Islamic theorizing familiar to anyone who has been immersed in security and counterterrorism debates over the last 20 years. He has embraced a deeply suspicious view of Islam that several of his aides have promoted, notably retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, now his national security adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist. This worldview borrows from the “clash of civilizations” thesis of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, and combines straightforward warnings about extremist violence with broad-brush critiques of Islam. It sometimes conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1.7 billion Muslims around the world. In its more extreme forms, this view promotes conspiracies about government infiltration and the danger that Shariah, the legal code of Islam, may take over in the United States. "

The order applies to citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, prompting protests at airports across the country over the weekend as airlines and immigration agents scrambled to comply with the new directive. The American Airlines chief executive, Doug Parker, called the order “divisive” in an open letter to employees posted on the company’s website on Monday. Expedia is supporting a lawsuit filed by Washington State against the president’s order. The chief executive of TripAdvisor, Steve Kaufer, published an open letter on LinkedIn that criticized the policy, calling it “not only heartless and discriminatory, but also against the principles that make our country great.” Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, went further on Twitter, posting that the company will provide temporary free housing to refugees. A company spokesman said that Airbnb hosts may offer their rooms without charge or receive a subsidy from Airbnb. He added that the company was working on requests from people affected by the ban but did not provide more information. Of the seven nations singled out by the executive order, only Iran drew significant interest on the part of leisure travelers. Among North American travelers, trips to Iran with Intrepid Travel had grown 35 percent in the past year, on pace with Iceland, Japan and Sri Lanka, three other trending destinations. Cox & Kings said it had doubled its traffic to Iran in the past 12 months. Wilderness Travel went from offering one itinerary in 2016 to three in 2017. The founder of Abercrombie & Kent, Geoffrey Kent, singled out Iran as a top destination in 2017. "

Mr. Scaramucci was informed on Wednesday by Reince Priebus, President Trump’s chief of staff, and by Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist, that he would not get the job as liaison to the business community. Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon, the official said, plan to find another role in the administration for Mr. Scaramucci in the future. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Scaramucci’s name had not officially been withdrawn. At issue is Mr. Scaramucci’s sale of his firm, SkyBridge Capital, to a division of HNA Group, a politically connected Chinese conglomerate that would become the firm’s majority owner. The sale has not been completed, and administration officials said the White House Counsel’s Office had predicted that it would take up to three months for Mr. Scaramucci to be cleared of potential ethics conflicts. The White House is operating without a functioning Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, which Mr. Scaramucci would have led. Part of the job is to help coordinate matters across government agencies, a pressing need as protests over the president’s immigration order sweep the country. The New York Times reported Tuesday that HNA Group has strong ties to China’s ruling Communist Party and an opaque ownership structure. China experts say leading Chinese firms like HNA are looking for avenues of influence in a White House that is already stoking tensions on trade and other issues. HNA, a financial behemoth whose interests range from aviation to supermarkets, has said that SkyBridge will give it a foothold in America’s asset management business. The $180 million deal could be finalized as late as the end of June. To avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Scaramucci had agreed to recuse himself from anything to do with SkyBridge and HNA. One ethics lawyer suggested that he could have steered clear of the entire financial services sector and still carried out his duties. “This does not seem to me to be a clear disqualifying factor,” said Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer for two years under President George W. Bush. “Another possibility is they decided not to keep him for a political reason and cited an ethics conflict as a cover.” This was not the first time that the Trump team has announced an appointment and later changed course. Mr. Trump’s choice for communications director backed out, as did a deputy National Security Council pick accused of plagiarism. "

Shulkin, vowed at his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday to reform — but not privatize — veterans’ health care, potentially putting him at odds with Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to allow all veterans to choose private health care. “V.A. is a unique national resource that is worth saving,” Dr. Shulkin told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. He added, “The Department of Veterans Affairs will not be privatized under my watch.” Dr. Shulkin, who is currently the department’s under secretary of health, was nominated as secretary of veterans affairs after a number of other candidates reportedly turned down Mr. Trump’s overtures. Before taking his current position in 2015, Dr. Shulkin helped lead several private health care systems, including Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Veterans groups and members of Congress have credited him with making real, if ponderous, progress in improving care in the veterans’ vast health system, which includes 1,234 clinics and hospitals. In his 18 months heading the system, Dr. Shulkin oversaw the hiring of more than 10,000 doctors and nurses, and authorized more than three million appointments with private providers. While many of Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks have led to a backlash from Democrats, Dr. Shulkin, the only Trump nominee who served in the Obama administration, has emerged as a consensus candidate.

The decision to forgo electronic counting is a stark response to warnings that outside actors, including Russia, might try to tamper with pivotal elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany — three major democracies in which establishment parties are facing pressure from right-wing populism of the kind that fueled Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump’s triumph in the United States election. “The cabinet cannot exclude the possibility that state actors might gain advantage from influencing political decision-making and public opinion in the Netherlands and might use means to try and achieve such influence,” Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said in a statement. “We’re talking about actors that both have the intention and ability to do this.” Parliament recently discussed the finding by intelligence agencies that the Russian government tried covertly to help Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump’s allegations — made without evidence — that millions of undocumented immigrants had cast ballots, costing him the popular vote. Ronald Van Raak, an opposition member for the Socialist Party, demanded guarantees from Mr. Plasterk that the Dutch elections, set for March 15, would not be hacked — and said that if the government could not provide such a guarantee, it should resort to paper ballots. In a report on Monday, the broadcaster RTL concluded that the Dutch election would be “easy to hack,” citing interviews with experts and an in-depth investigation of the vote-tallying software the nation has used since 2009.

Similarly, mayors have typically grinned through the jokey banter of the weigh-in before the Nathan’s hot-dog-eating contest, a ceremony held at City Hall since the 1990s. But as he enters his fourth year in office, facing re-election in the fall, Mayor Bill de Blasio has seemed to declare an unofficial end to the most pompous of rites. He did not attend the Groundhog Day ceremony on Thursday, the second straight year he has missed the event. (Chuck did not see its shadow on Thursday morning, meaning spring is coming early. But Punxsutawney Phil did.) Likewise, he has not attended the Nathan’s weigh-in since 2014, his first year in office and the last time it was held at City Hall. (It now takes place at Brooklyn Borough Hall.) And even the most venerable of New York City events, the New Year’s Eve ball drop, has suffered the mayor’s lack of enthusiasm for acting as a city booster. "

This week, those two cultural phenomena — politics and football — are coming together again in an extraordinary, and for the league, uncomfortable way on the country’s biggest sports stage. The Super Bowl, scheduled for Sunday night in Houston, is infused with national politics like never before. Fox’s pregame telecast will include an interview of President Trump by Bill O’Reilly. The owner, coach and star player of one team, the highly successful New England Patriots, are friends of the president’s. Last Sunday, hundreds of people opposed to the president’s immigration policy protested at the convention center where the N.F.L. is holding many of its events for fans. The next day, many players on the Falcons and Patriots — including Mohamed Sanu, who is Muslim — were peppered with questions about their thoughts on the president and his temporary ban on refugees from some Muslim-majority countries. The political overlay made the league so uneasy, apparently, that it omitted any references to the president from the dozens of official transcripts of interviews with players on Monday. "
115,Conservative Groups Unify to Push Neil Gorsuch’s Confirmation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-conservative-confirmation.html?searchResultPosition=108,2017/02/01,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — They are three dozen of the best-financed, most battle-hardened players in the conservative movement — among them, the Koch network, the National Rifle Association and leading evangelical and anti-abortion groups. Their grass-roots organizations extend to precincts and parishes in all 50 states. And their causes span the full spectrum of issues that animate the right’s most devoted followers, meaning they don’t always see eye to eye. But on this they agree: They cannot take any chances that President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court is stopped. Right after the election — before some of them had ever even heard of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the federal judge Mr. Trump named on Tuesday to fill the high court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia — conservative groups banded together in what they expect to be a multimillion-dollar campaign to fight what they say could become the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle since Justice Clarence Thomas’s in 1991. Mr. Trump’s final choice was almost a moot point. The groups drew up mock websites to promote the candidates they thought most likely to be picked, working from the list of 21 names Mr. Trump said comprised his finalists. They started planning megachurch gatherings and produced television commercials that would be ready to ship out as soon as the nominee was known. And on Tuesday night, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, one of the three dozen groups involved, pushed the button to print 1.8 million postcards that will go out to supporters in a dozen states that were carried by Mr. Trump but have Democratic senators. The design and messaging — “Emergency Call to Action!” — were already set. All the group needed to do was to plug in Judge Gorsuch’s name and picture into the blank spaces on its template. "

Kicking off the session in the White House’s Roosevelt Room, Mr. Trump promised to “honor the tremendous history of the African-Americans throughout our country.” A full transcript of the president’s remarks was provided by the White House. The president mentioned the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. early in his remarks, saying that his “incredible example is unique in American history.” He then quickly turned to an earlier grievance, what he called “fake news,” citing the mistaken and quickly corrected pool report that Dr. King’s bust had been removed from the Oval Office, a topic that received considerable attention in the days after the inauguration. Mr. Trump told the group: Mr. Trump, who was seated next to his Housing and Urban Development Secretary nominee, Ben Carson, also made a special mention of Frederick Douglass, which caused critics to conclude that he believed the iconic abolitionist, writer and speaker was still alive. Douglass died in 1895. Mr. Trump spoke of him in the present tense: The president also repeated claims that American communities are not safe: Recent F.B.I. data indicates that crime rates have been dropping for decades, despite a slight uptick in violent crimes in 2015 that was mostly concentrated in urban areas, including Chicago, which Mr. Trump referred to as “totally out of control.” Mr. Trump also took the opportunity to call the news media “the opposition party,” something his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, had said in an interview with The Times. "

Bornstein, said in a series of recent interviews. The other drugs are antibiotics to control rosacea, a common skin problem, and a statin for elevated blood cholesterol and lipids. Dr. Bornstein, who spoke by telephone in four interviews over the past month, also said that Mr. Trump takes a daily baby aspirin to reduce the risk of a heart attack. Over all, he pronounced Mr. Trump healthy and his medical care “as exactly up to date.” Dr. Bornstein granted the interviews after The New York Times asked him to discuss his role in Mr. Trump’s care and to clarify and expand on earlier statements he made about his patient’s health during the presidential campaign. In recent decades, The Times has interviewed presidents, presidential candidates and their doctors about their health. At 70, Mr. Trump is the oldest person to become president. White House officials declined to comment on Wednesday night on the information provided by Dr. Bornstein, and would not say whether he was still Mr. Trump’s physician. The disclosure that Mr. Trump uses a prostate-related drug to maintain growth of his scalp hair, which has not been publicly known, appears to solve a riddle of why Mr. Trump has a very low level of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a marker for prostate cancer. Mr. Trump takes a small dose of the drug, finasteride, which lowers PSA levels. Finasteride is marketed as Propecia to treat male-pattern baldness. "

In his ruling, the judge said that Mr. Trump, by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter — a process that could take years — had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees. Instead, the money was withheld. The decision is the first court judgment against a company owned by Mr. Trump since he became president last month, and underscores that while Mr. Trump has stepped away from the operations of his company, he is certain to remain dogged by legal controversies connected to his business. At his new hotel in Washington, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract. The two men backed out of the Trump International Hotel development in 2015 after Mr. Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Separately, the federal government owns the building that houses the hotel, and some legal experts have said that Mr. Trump may be in violation of his lease, which appears to prohibit federal elected officials from leasing the building. And last month, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan contending that Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments.

119,How ISIS Benefits From Trump’s Ban on Syrians,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/how-isis-benefits-from-trumps-ban-on-syrians.html?searchResultPosition=58,2017/02/02,OPINION,"ISTANBUL — Some American friends wanted me to visit in the summer to speak about a book of my essays on Syria and the Syrian revolution that is about to be published. The prospect of traveling to the United States made me uneasy. I had heard stories of Syrians being singled out for interrogation at American airports. And I wasn’t certain I would be able to get travel documents and an American visa anyway: Because of my political activities, I am a man without a passport. But then, after President Trump signed an executive order barring even Syrians with valid passports and visas from the United States, I knew I wouldn’t be able to visit my American friends any time soon. Mr. Trump’s decision pronouncing Syrians dangerous and undesirable seemed quite similar to the way our own dictator, President Bashar al-Assad, has treated me and my countrymen. I have never had a passport. I was explicitly denied one by Mr. Assad’s regime because I am a writer who opposed his father and opposes him. In 1980, I was a 19-year-old student of medicine at the University of Aleppo when I joined the protests against the Hafez al-Assad regime. I was jailed along with hundreds of fellow left-wing students and activists. I spent 16 years in prison. After my release in 1996, I returned to Aleppo and my medical studies. After graduating in 2000, I decided not to practice medicine, moved to Damascus and worked as a writer. In March 2011, Syrians rose up against the Bashar al-Assad regime. I decided to write without any self-censorship in support of the revolution. The cost of writing with freedom was that I had to leave my home in Damascus, hide in myriad places across the country, and eventually seek refuge in Turkey. To live in exile without a passport or travel documents is to live with the knowledge of limited mobility in a world of militarized bureaucracy. The international disdain for Syrian refugees comes close to Mr. Assad’s approach to his ill-fated subjects. Most Syrians were never issued passports. For the Assad regime, passports are political and disciplinary tools. For Syrians, Mr. Trump is merely pushing to extremes a process that has been going on for years. The situation of the refugees, and the underprivileged in general, has been worsening everywhere for a generation. Syria exemplifies a greater global failure. The executive order barring Syrians and the citizens of six other countries was among Mr. Trump’s very first actions in the White House. Many of the objectives of the first week of his reign — setting the stage to build a wall on the Mexico border, and cutting federal funds to environmental research and programs involving abortion — are aimed at the vulnerable and the poor. It reveals a lot about the social and political outlook of his administration. "

Evercore, Greenhill and Lazard, which reported estimates-beating earnings on Thursday, proved their resilience last year by weathering a choppy environment better than most big bank rivals. Continued success, though, requires confident clients. And they are looking for President Trump and Congress to ensure that happens. The next few months should be relatively strong as financial advisers work through deals already announced in recent months and chief executives consider acting after the bounce in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index since the election. That should help fees stay around the decent levels of the second half of 2016 rather than dipping back to the more disappointing first half of the year. The poor start last year contributed to annual mergers and acquisitions revenue dropping at all the American mega-banks except Morgan Stanley. Lazard’s advisory top line picked up almost 2 percent, while Evercore’s and Greenhill’s both jumped by more than 25 percent. Three issues make chief executives bullish at present: the prospect of the corporate tax rate being cut to as low as 15 percent from 35 percent; the boost to the American economy from Mr. Trump’s promise to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure; and the belief that deregulation is in the cards. These ought to bolster output, spending, earnings and, as a result, the desire to strike deals. The chaos of the first two weeks of the Trump administration is starting to cast some doubts, however. For example, the president and Congress don’t see eye to eye on some of the more complex parts of tax reform. That could delay any proposal, perhaps into 2018, an election year. Mr. Trump’s immigration ban, his calls for border tariffs and his aggressive, off-the-cuff approach to international diplomacy also risk undermining the ebullience in corporate boardrooms. If Washington can’t get its better deals done, mergers and acquisitions bankers could very well miss out on theirs. "

Trump, the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office. “Chaos” seems to be the word most often invoked, closely followed by “turmoil.” (One exception: the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, who said he preferred “action-packed.”) In less than two weeks, Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nation’s borders, alienated longtime allies, roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced. The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal bemoaned a refugee policy “so poorly explained and prepared for, that it has produced confusion and fear at airports, an immediate legal defeat, and political fury at home and abroad.” Even the top House Republican, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had released a statement praising the immigration order, later distanced himself, saying, “It’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout.” All new presidents undergo a learning curve. But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and, with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician, an administration that would function as a well-oiled machine. "
122,"The Johnson Amendment, Which Trump Vows to ‘Destroy,’ Explained",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/johnson-amendment-trump.html?searchResultPosition=53,2017/02/02,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump told an audience of religious leaders on Thursday that he would ‘destroy’ the Johnson Amendment, he declared his intention to sign a bill that would fundamentally alter a major aspect of the church-state divide that has been a constant in American politics for generations. But what exactly is the Johnson Amendment? It is one of the brightest lines in the legal separation between religion and politics. Under the provision, which was made in 1954, tax-exempt entities like churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate. Specifically, ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. If they do, they risk losing their tax-exempt status. Considered uncontroversial at the time, it was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. Today, however, many Republicans want to repeal it. Back when Lyndon B. Johnson was a senator from Texas, he introduced the measure as an amendment to the tax code in 1954. Like many things Johnson did, the goal was to bludgeon a political opponent, in this case a rival in a primary who had the backing of nonprofit groups that were campaigning against him by suggesting he was a communist. Though there was no church involved, according to PolitiFact, churches were covered by the bill as well. Mr. Trump promised he would work to repeal the Johnson Amendment as part of his extensive outreach efforts to religious conservatives, a group that took a long time to warm to his candidacy. Eliminating the measure has been a goal of the right. Conservatives have argued that it violates the protections of free speech and free exercise that the First Amendment extends to houses of worship. Courts have not agreed. Speaking of the implications of a repeal last year, Jerry Falwell Jr., the prominent evangelical leader and Trump supporter, said it would “create a huge revolution for conservative Christians and for free speech.” "
123,Trump Vows to ‘Destroy’ Law Banning Political Endorsements by Churches,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/trump-johnson-amendment-political-activity-churches.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/02/02,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump vowed on Thursday to overturn a law restricting political speech by tax-exempt churches, a potentially huge victory for the religious right and a gesture to evangelicals, a voting bloc he attracted to his campaign by promising to free up their pulpits. Mr. Trump said his administration would “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment, a 1954 law that prohibits churches from endorsing or opposing political candidates at the risk of losing their tax-exempt status. “Freedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is also a right under threat all around us,” Mr. Trump told religious leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast. “That is why I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.” Repealing the law would require approval by Congress, which could prove challenging given that Democrats, and even some Republicans, would resist what many view as an erosion of the separation between church and state. Still, Mr. Trump’s promise to repeal the law fulfills a campaign pledge — one that became a centerpiece of his effort to mollify the religious right, which was slow to warm to his insurgent candidacy. Eliminating the measure has been a goal of many social conservatives, who argue that it unfairly restricts clergy members from expressing themselves by endorsing, or speaking out against, political candidates. Many see government persecution in limits on their official religious activities at work, and complain that the Internal Revenue Service — an agency that the right views with a special ire — singles out churches dominated by Christian conservatives.

124,New York Times Co.’s Decline in Print Advertising Tempered by Digital Gains,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/business/media/new-york-times-q4-earnings.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/02/02,MEDIA,"Precipitous declines in print advertising rocked the newspaper industry last year. And while The New York Times Company recorded significant growth in subscriptions and promising increases in digital advertising, it nevertheless has not avoided the inevitable. The company said on Thursday that its print advertising revenue in 2016 fell 16 percent, driving a 9 percent drop in total advertising revenue. For the quarter, print advertising revenue declined 20 percent. The story on the digital side was positive, underscoring the diverging financial narratives for print and digital that have emerged at the company. Digital advertising revenue rose 6 percent last year, to $209 million. The Times Company added 514,000 net digital-only subscriptions for its news products during the year, bringing its total to 1.6 million. Buoyed by readers’ intense interest in the presidential election, the company added 276,000 net digital-only subscriptions to its news products in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined. Including print and crossword product subscriptions, The New York Times now has more than three million total paid subscribers, a milestone that aligns with the company’s commitment to a subscription-based revenue model that is less reliant on the advertising revenue derived from page views and clicks. As for many other legacy print companies trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world, these have been challenging times for The New York Times. Last month, The Times released an internal report that called for swift changes in the newsroom, including more staff training, a commitment to hiring journalists with wider-ranging skills and an elimination of duplicative layers of editing.

The interview, broadcast on Sunday, might have quietly faded into the forgotten quarters of the internet. But Breitbart News, the right-wing news network, picked it up Wednesday night, packaging the video clip with an article headlined “Matthew McConaughey to Hollywood: ‘Embrace’ Donald Trump.” The interview, on the BBC’s “The Andrew Marr Show,” was later covered by outlets including Vulture, Entertainment Weekly and the British newspaper The Independent. Overnight, searches for Mr. McConaughey and Mr. Trump rose on Google. The Breitbart site reports and aggregates politics and entertainment news, often injecting a conservative viewpoint, and it embraced Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. The network was formerly run by Stephen K. Bannon, who is now Mr. Trump’s chief political strategist. In response to a question from Mr. Marr about whether it was time for America’s cultural elite to give Mr. Trump “a break,” Mr. McConaughey said, “It’s a very dynamic and as divisive of an inauguration and time that we’ve ever had.” “At the same time,” he added, “it’s time for us to embrace, shake hands with this fact and be constructive with him over the next four years.” Mr. McConaughey had appeared on the program to promote his role in a new movie, “Gold.” Online, mentions of Mr. McConaughey increased rapidly early Thursday. They came in swift and conflicting. One Twitter user thanked the Oscar-winning actor. Another disagreed. Mr. McConaughey is one of the rare stars to speak in more amicable terms about the new president, who has drawn widespread scorn from late-night hosts, comedians and actors. At this year’s awards shows, celebrities including Meryl Streep and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have used their acceptance speeches to criticize the president for his policies and behavior. Last month, Nicole Kidman drew criticism after telling the BBC, “he’s now elected, and we as a country need to support whoever is the president because that’s what the country’s based on.” She later clarified that she had meant her comments as a general call in favor of democratic processes, rather than as an endorsement of Mr. Trump.

More than four decades ago California passed a landmark law protecting the state’s farmworkers from abuse and helping them to organize. But the recent resignation of the head of a board that oversees the implementation of the law highlights the extent to which organized labor among farmworkers has collapsed since the days of the pioneering labor leader Cesar Chavez. Chavez’s activism was instrumental in the creation of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, the passage of which Gov. Jerry Brown described as a major accomplishment of his first stint as governor. In his recent resignation letter, the head of the board, William B. Gould IV, described the law as “irrelevant to farmworkers.” He estimated that less than one percent of the agricultural work force is now represented by a union. As chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, Mr. Gould was charged with overseeing the certification process of union elections. Yet Mr. Gould said virtually no workers came to the board during his tenure. "

The unusually strong expression of humility, which came as the bank disclosed a quarterly loss of 1.9 billion euros, or $2 billion, reflected the tone that John Cryan, the chief executive, has tried to set since taking over in July 2015. His comments at a news conference signaled another step away from the aggressive risk-taking that was part of the lender’s attempt to keep pace with American investment banking titans like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Speaking slowly and with a grave demeanor, Mr. Cryan expressed “deep regret for what happened.” “We would like to apologize sincerely,” he said. “Serious errors were made.” Under Mr. Cryan’s leadership, Deutsche Bank has followed European rivals like Credit Suisse in scaling back operations on Wall Street. But Mr. Cryan said on Thursday that Deutsche Bank would nevertheless retain a strong presence in the United States. “We cannot be the international bank we need to be and want to be unless we can deal with the largest economy in the world,” he said. Deutsche Bank’s top managers will take “substantial” cuts in their bonuses for 2016, Mr. Cryan said, declining to give exact figures. It would be inappropriate, he added, for executives to receive large bonuses when the bank was not paying a dividend to shareholders and was laying off thousands of workers. The €1.9 billion loss in the last three months of 2016 compared to a loss of €2.1 billion during the quarter a year earlier. "
129,The Travel Ban and an Authoritarian ‘Ladder of Violence’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/middleeast/donald-trump-authoritarian-interpreter-deportation.html?searchResultPosition=86,2017/02/02,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — History is full of examples of leaders using “us versus them” politics to paint a particular minority group as a threat to the majority’s safety, morals or culture. That history has scholars of authoritarianism unnerved by President Trump’s order to halt immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, temporarily suspend the United States refugee resettlement program, and indefinitely bar refugees from Syria. The new rules are in line with the ban on Muslim immigration that Mr. Trump proposed during the presidential campaign, though they do not bar all Muslims outright. Nevertheless, the scholars say there are worrying parallels between his ban and the behaviors of the governments they study. That kind of us-versus-them politics, they warn, can have harmful consequences not just for the specific groups that are targeted, but for political systems as a whole. The us-versus-them dynamic is “easy for many people to rally around,” said Jonathan D. Weiler, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina. Targeting feared or unpopular minorities is a way of “setting a boundary,” said Sheri E. Berman, a political scientist at Barnard College — a way to distinguish between “us” deserving of protection, and “them” who are a threat. There is always a segment in every population that is suspicious of outsiders and frightened of difference, said Marc J. Hetherington, a Vanderbilt University political scientist and an author, along with Mr. Weiler, of the book “Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics.” And many others who would ordinarily be more tolerant and open will turn against outsiders if they feel especially frightened — in times of war, for instance, or after a terrorist attack.

And the way Trump announced it. “How normal!” enthused a CNN commentator. Yes! Trump managed to introduce Judge Neil Gorsuch to an audience of supporters without bragging about the size of the crowd. However, he did suggest he’s “studied” Gorsuch’s work. Since the judge does not have a history of either tweeting or writing about Donald Trump, serious presidential perusal seems highly unlikely. Gorsuch is what they call an originalist, a judicial breed that cynics define as people who believe that if the founding fathers were around today, they would be best friends and agree on everything. He’s extremely conservative. Colleagues say he’s pleasant and thoughtful, which will do you no good whatsoever if you’re worried about reproductive rights or federal regulation to reduce climate change. But it had the Republicans in Congress doing happy dances all over the Capitol. Really, they were afraid Trump was going to nominate Don King. Democrats, meanwhile, were bitterly remembering that last year Barack Obama had nominated an intelligent, well-spoken moderate moderate in the form of Judge Merrick Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn’t even hold a hearing. Now Trump was expecting them to roll out the welcome mat for his guy. What to do? The Democrats could filibuster, but then McConnell might try to change the rules so it would only take a simple majority to push a Supreme Court nominee through. This is known as the “nuclear option,” a colorful but rather unnerving nickname now that we’ve got President Trump speaking so enthusiastically about going nuclear. "

So let’s take our own advice: We Americans should now condemn our own extremist. In that spirit, I hereby apologize to Muslims. The mindlessness and heartlessness of the travel ban should humiliate us, not you. Understand this: President Trump is not America! I apologize to Nadia Murad, the brave young Yazidi woman from Iraq who was made a sex slave — but since escaping, has campaigned around the world against ISIS and sexual slavery. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, yet is now barred from the United States. I apologize to Edna Adan, a heroic Somali woman who has battled for decades for women’s health and led the fight against female genital mutilation. Edna speaks at American universities, champions girls’ education and defies extremists — and she’s one of those inspiring me to do the same. I don’t want to take Trump-as-an-extremist too far: He’s not beheading anyone, and the security challenge is real. Nobody has a problem with improving safety, and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both oversaw improvements in vetting. Yet Trump tackled the issue in a way that bolsters the ISIS narrative and thus makes us less safe. "

Pundits have been applauding like a pod of trained seals in the hours since the announcement, gushing about how brilliant Donald Trump’s rollout of Gorsuch was, how immensely qualified he is and how difficult it would be for Democrats to block his nomination if they chose to do so. Let’s tackle each of these individually, but let’s do so under the umbrella of this ultimatum that I believe the liberal base is sending to the Democratic Party: Fight this, tooth and nail. Never give up and never give in. This seat on the Supreme Court was stolen from Barack Obama when Republicans refused to even hold hearings for his nominee, and the election was stolen from the American public by maleficent figures, foul of motive and moving in shadows. This nominee is the fruit of a poison tree and no amount of educational pedigree or persuasive elocution can cleanse him of that contamination. If Trump can impose a Muslim ban until we “figure out what the hell is going on” with national security threats, we can withhold approval of his Supreme Court nominee until we “figure out what the hell is going on” with threats to our national elections.

133,Trump’s Mexican Shakedown,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/trumps-mexican-shakedown.html?searchResultPosition=82,2017/02/02,OPINION,"MEXICO CITY — In Mexico’s so-called drug war, cartel gunmen have often used their violent power to demand money from innocent people. It’s a heinous crime that scars communities and blights growth, and it has provoked terrorized villages to rise up to chase out the extortionists. Now Mexico finds itself facing the biggest shakedown of all from north of the Rio Grande, as the United States president demands $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for a border wall. This is not meant to be a jokey comparison. President Trump’s insistence that he will force Mexico to pay is the definition of extortion: obtaining un-owed money through coercion. It is a dark moment in American foreign policy that has implications far beyond the southern border; it tells the world the United States no longer believes in fair play or the rule of law. Any officials involved in such a shakedown should search their conscience. We are only now looking at this policy properly because most of us believed it was bluster. The shout of “Who is going to pay for the wall?” was effective at rallies, but we thought we didn’t need to take Mr. Trump literally, especially with a suggestion as absurd as this. But he revealed his determination to carry it out with his tweet last Thursday: “If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.” This was no longer rhetoric to the fans but a direct challenge to another head of state, who had been scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington on Tuesday. The wall itself will be largely ineffective — most likely a fence that smugglers will climb over, tunnel under and drill through. If the United States wants to pour billions into such a structure, it can. But it is patently outrageous to force a neighboring country to pay for your own infrastructure. President Trump claims Mexico should pay because it has an annual trade surplus of $60 billion with the United States. "
134,The Peculiar Populism of Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/the-peculiar-populism-of-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=81,2017/02/02,OPINION,"All wars have unintended consequences, including culture wars. A look at contemporary television and film demonstrates that in one sense social and cultural liberalism have won the day. Polls confirm a steady leftward shift over recent decades in attitudes toward same-sex marriage, equality of the sexes and diversity in both education and the workplace. At the same time, liberal victory in the cultural revolution of the 1960s and ’70s, with its emphasis on so-called postmaterialist values — personal fulfillment, openness to new ideas and support for previously marginalized populations — had its costs, which political analysts have been reckoning. Those costs have become particularly evident in the eruption over the past year of the Brexit vote in Britain, the increasing power of anti-immigrant parties across Europe and the ascendance of right-wing populism in America. In an article to be published in the June issue of Perspectives on Politics, “Trump and the Xenophobic Populist Parties: The Silent Revolution in Reverse,” Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris put their case in blunt terms: “Postmaterialism,” they write, “eventually became its own gravedigger.” The rise of postmaterialism here and in Europe, Inglehart and Norris argue, As the Democratic Party in the United States and social democratic parties in Europe shifted their interest away from economic policies, hard-pressed members of the working and middle classes — suffering from stagnant or declining wages and lost jobs — led “a backlash against the cultural changes linked with the rise of Postmaterialist and Self-expression values,” Inglehart and Norris write. Forty years ago, “The Silent Revolution,” Inglehart’ s seminal 1977 book, argued that “when people grow up taking survival for granted it makes them more open to new ideas and more tolerant of outgroups.” In effect, postwar prosperity in America and in Western Europe allowed many voters to shift their political priorities from bread-and-butter issues to less materialistic concerns, “bringing greater emphasis on freedom of expression, environmental protection, gender equality, and tolerance of gays, handicapped people and foreigners.” Not everyone experienced this newfound economic security, however, and the number of those left behind has grown steadily. Those who do not experience the benefits of prosperity, Inglehart and Norris write, can see “others” — “an influx of foreigners,” for example, as the culprit causing their predicament: According to the two authors, In support of this argument, the authors point to 2016 exit poll data showing that Hillary Clinton won voters who said the economy was the most important issue by 11 points, 52-41, while Trump carried those who said immigration was the most important issue facing the country by nearly two to one, 64-33.

Nickelodeon has always had its share of magical kingdoms, but this Viacom-owned cable network has tended to leave the princess business to Disney. (And what a business it is, generating an estimated $5.5 billion a year in merchandise revenue alone.) But here comes “Nella the Princess Knight,” which Nickelodeon will introduce on Monday in a programming block for preschoolers. The self-designated Princess Police, mostly academics who use Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and their slender ilk to make points about their negative impact on young girls, have been a perennial thorn in Disney’s side, even as the company has introduced black and Latina royals, along with a preschool one, “Sofia the First.” Will Nickelodeon now find itself in a similar position? Maybe not. The self-empowered Nella pushes boundaries, at least for television aimed at 2-year-olds, in the areas of race and gender. She is biracial, with a black father and a white mother, a decision informed by Nickelodeon research indicating that most children under 12 will be nonwhite by 2020 and that already 17 percent are biracial. The character also mashes together traditional boy and girl gender norms. Nella may ride a unicorn with a pink mane (à la My Little Pony), but she does it while brandishing a sword and wearing knight gear, a bit like a preschool version of Brienne of Tarth from “Game of Thrones.” She is a girlie girl but does traditional boy activities (battling a dragon) and does not spend the majority of her time in a ball gown. Nickelodeon’s princess may strike some adults as subversive, particularly given the surge of conservatism that helped push Donald J. Trump into office. But children see mixed-race families and the blurring of gender lines as normal, said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon’s longtime chief. “Adults might say, ‘Oh, look — she’s biracial,’ but our viewers just say, ‘That looks like my friend,’” she said. “An older generation was taught tolerance, and this audience is demanding difference,” said Ms. Zarghami. She led Nickelodeon to ratings strength in 2016 among total viewers and children ages 2 to 11, even as competitors like Disney Channel and Cartoon Network recorded sharp year-on-year drops. (According to Nielsen, Disney still has a big lead among viewers 6 to 14.) She added, “This series seems to be taking on a life of its own, which is incredibly exciting.” "

The 11-0 vote sends the nomination to the full Senate, where Mr. Pruitt will most likely be approved next week. The move was one of several to break the logjam on Mr. Trump’s incoming team. Party line votes in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Budget Committee also advanced the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be the White House budget director, despite deep concerns among Democrats — and some Republicans — over his tightfisted spending record. Senators on Thursday teed up what could be a week of rapid-fire confirmations, taking procedural votes to move forward with the nominations of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general, Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be secretary of health and human services, and Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. Those confirmation votes are expected to come early next week, after a white-knuckled vote on the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be education secretary. With two Republican senators opposing Ms. DeVos, her confirmation hangs by a single vote. In a procedural quirk, Mr. Sessions’s confirmation vote is scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he can vote “yes” before he leaves the Senate. Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Pruitt also appeared headed for confirmation next week. Democrats and environmental groups have waged a fierce campaign against the confirmation of Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who has led or taken part in 14 lawsuits aimed at blocking E.P.A. regulations, including Obama administration policies trying to tackle climate change.

Tumultuous? Definitely. Busiest? That depends. President Trump certainly stirred a whirlwind in his first 10 days. But it wasn’t unprecedented. Take a look at the front pages from the first 10 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency in 1933, beginning with his speech on March 4 (the last time a swearing-in was held on that date). “The inaugural address was a Jacksonian speech, a fighting speech, implicit with criticism of the lack of leadership and the philosophy of government which the president imputed to his predecessor, who sat there listening,” Arthur Krock, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, wrote in his account. “ ‘Action’ was the promise of Mr. Roosevelt’s speech, and action was immediately forthcoming,” Mr. Krock stated. Before his second full day in office was over, President Roosevelt had suspended all banking transactions in the United States. The goal was to stanch the hoarding of currency and gold by anxious depositors. Runs on the nation’s banks had pushed them into or near collapse. History calls it a “bank holiday.” That makes it sound cheerful. No confetti was involved. "

To be clear, this is actually happening. The fireworks began on Thursday morning, when Mr. Trump used the typically solemn occasion of the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington to needle Mr. Schwarzenegger as “a total disaster” on “The New Celebrity Apprentice,” the latest incarnation of the NBC reality franchise that catapulted Mr. Trump to national stardom. “They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out,” Mr. Trump said, as Mark Burnett, the “Apprentice” creator who has become an active champion of Christian causes, listened a few feet away. “The ratings went right down the tubes,” Mr. Trump continued. “Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again.

To add further insult, Mr. Trump apparently hung up abruptly. Apart from Britain, the United States has no stronger ally than Australia. While Mr. Trump’s knowledge of world affairs is reportedly scant, he should realize that our two countries have stood side by side in major conflicts for over 100 years. If Mr. Trump continues to display rude, arrogant and boorish behavior toward friendly countries like Australia, one wonders where our “special” relationship will be in 12 months.

But in a news conference to discuss Sunday’s halftime show, Lady Gaga, one of the most outspoken pop stars and a vocal critic of the president, remained coy when asked if her performance would include any strong political statements. “The only statements that I’ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I’ve been consistently making throughout my career,” Lady Gaga said. “I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality, and that the spirit of this country is one of love and compassion and kindness. My performance will uphold those philosophies.” She also did not divulge any details about what songs she would perform, what outfits she would wear, or if the bee emoji that she recently posted in a comment on Instagram was an indication that Beyoncé would be involved in her performance. But she did suggest the show would be one for her legions of fans who represent the margins of society. “That kid that couldn’t get a seat at the cool kids’ table, and that kid that was kicked out of the house because his mom and dad didn’t accept him for who he was?” Lady Gaga said. “That kid is going to have the stage for 13 minutes.

While doing so will require more than a presidential signature on a piece of paper, and we have yet to see what sort of working relationship the president will have with Congress, I take him at his word. So far, he seems quite determined to do exactly what he said he was going to do during the election campaign. I also think the effort to dismantle Dodd-Frank will start in earnest with the Orderly Liquidation Authority. This is the special bankruptcy procedure for large financial institutions. It was enacted to allow the “too big to fail” banks an avenue to do the latter, since they are still quite big. Other commentators have pointed to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making some of the speculative investments that led to the 2008-9 global economic crisis, as likely first targets. But the consumer bureau has strong defenders, including a United States senator, and dismantling Volcker would have really bad optics. The banks have already figured out several ways around the Volcker Rule — consider trading in distressed syndicated loans — and they may decide it is not worth the negative publicity that repeal would entail. But who is going to stand up for an obscure piece of insolvency law that is easily painted as a bailout tool? Moreover, because the Orderly Liquidation Authority includes a line of credit for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation when it conducts liquidations under the law, any changes to this provision of Dodd-Frank, known as Title II, can happen through the budget reconciliation process, which is entirely immune from filibusters. And once Title II is gone, other pieces of Dodd-Frank may follow. "

Now, that status quo seems very long ago and the establishment is treading carefully, with even most hard-liners concerned that the smallest provocation could lead to military conflict. But some question how long their caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama had been brittle but stable. Tensions flared this week after Iran confirmed that it had conducted a missile test and the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Iran that it had been put “on notice.” On Thursday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, gave a mild rejoinder, saying, “It is a shame that the U.S. government, instead of thanking the Iranian nation for their continued fight against terrorism, keeps repeating unfounded claims and adopts unwise policies that are effectively helping terrorist groups.” Mr. Flynn also made clear that the challenge to Iran extended beyond the missile test, holding Tehran responsible for an attack on a Saudi warship by Houthi rebels in Yemen, who the United States says are supported by Iran. Iran denies that, but the remark was taken as a veiled warning about Iran’s support of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite militias in Iraq. “The Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk,” he said. Later, President Trump posted on Twitter that “Iran is rapidly taking over Iraq,” its neighbor, “while the U.S. squandered three trillion dollars there. Obviously long ago.” "

The change, recommended by the Pentagon, eased some of the anger generated in Iraq by President Trump’s executive order imposing the ban, which has stoked anxiety and confusion around much of the world since it was issued last week. The order temporarily blocked all Syrian refugees from entering the United States and suspended visas for applicants from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq. It applied to holders of so-called Special Immigrant Visas issued to interpreters who worked for the United States during its 2003-11 occupation, often at great personal risk, and to their families. In a statement about the change sent to The New York Times, a United States Embassy official in Baghdad said, “The U.S. government has determined that it is in the national interest to allow Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (S.I.V.) holders to continue to travel to the United States.” Iraqis who have received the visas, the statement said, may use them, and the “U.S. Embassy in Baghdad will continue to process and issue S.I.V.s to applicants who are otherwise qualified.” For the family of a 37-year-old Iraqi who once worked as an interpreter for American forces, the news was a joyous surprise after nearly a week of upended travel plans. An embassy official called to inform family members that they were again permitted to fly to the United States. “I’m shocked all over again,” said the former interpreter, who asked to be identified only by his first name and an initial, Munther A., to protect relatives in Iraq.

If you asked the Treasury secretary his view of the dollar, the answer would be equally rote: “A strong dollar is in the interest of the United States.” Those words have been so standard that when Paul O’Neill deviated from it in an interview with a German newspaper in 2001, he caused a kerfuffle in global currency markets and quickly backtracked. The Trump administration looks to be taking a different approach. Officials, including the president himself, have been breaking tradition and talking about currency markets — and in many cases, suggesting that the dollar is too highly valued. But the Trump administration has also offered contradictory signals about just what it wants to see happen on currency markets, with tension building between the administration’s stated goals and the policies it says it advocates. Predicting the direction of currency policy in the Trump administration requires parsing the words and policy proposals that come from several different places. Both before and since the inauguration, Donald J. Trump has weighed in on currency issues more than any of his recent predecessors. “Our dollar is too strong,” he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in mid-January. “And our companies can’t compete” because the currency is too strong. “It’s killing us,” he said. Mr. Trump enlarged on this theme in comments this week at a meeting with pharmaceutical executives. “We know nothing about devaluation,” he said. “Every other country lives on devaluation. You look at what China’s doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years — they played the money market, they played the devaluation market, and we sit there like a bunch of dummies.” "

How does Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia stay in power despite allegations that he embezzled $1 billion from a sovereign wealth fund? Corruption is nothing new here, but the scale and implications of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) affair are staggering. It may be the world’s largest money-laundering scandal involving a sitting head of government. The case is being investigated by authorities in at least six foreign states, including the U.S. Justice Department. Yet there’s been no mutiny within Mr. Najib’s party, no vote of censure in Parliament, no mass protests. In both 2015 and 2016, tens of thousands of supporters of Bersih, an electoral-reform movement, took to the streets calling for Mr. Najib’s resignation. But the demonstrations don’t seem to have loosened his grip on his party, the United Malays National Organization, nor UMNO’s grip on Malaysia: UMNO has been governing the country in coalition governments for six decades. Mahathir Mohamad, a former prime minister and former mentor of Mr. Najib who recently left UMNO, blames the political stagnation on personal patronage — or what he calls “animal feed.” Others blame it on disarray within the opposition, an uneasy assemblage of parties representing different ethnic and religious interests. But both explanations place too much emphasis on agency among the elites and too little on structural causes. Mr. Najib remains in power because Malaysia has become an electoral one-party state and because UMNO has captured the Muslim-Malay majority by peddling communalism under the guise of promoting equality. The opposition has yet to find an alternative model on which to build a sustainable coalition for change. "

An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees’ lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers. Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act’s market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not? “We need some certainty around the rules,” said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system. “We have a few months, but we don’t have a lot of time,” he said. With the official end on Tuesday of what was supposed to be its final open enrollment season, the Affordable Care Act is looking more resilient than it seemed just a month ago. It will still be several days before final enrollment figures are released, and although a surge of last-minute signups failed to have materialize amid talk of repeal, early indications did not point to a collapse.

This round of “24” begins Sunday night on Fox after the biggest lead-in television can offer, the Super Bowl, and the first thing viewers will see is foreign terrorists ransacking a home whose owner, an Army Ranger, is tied to a chair and covered in blood. The intruders have already killed his wife and child. “This is for Sheik Bin-Khalid,” one of them says before shooting the ranger in the head. The premiere was filmed back when it seemed unlikely that Mr. Trump would be elected — it was screened in New York on Nov. 7 — but the opening moments play as if they were scripted to support the immigration restrictions he imposed last week. The series grows considerably more layered as it goes along, with the panoply of villains encompassing a variety of demographics, yet the choice of a bin Laden surrogate as the starting point is sure to reignite the debate over the demonization of Muslims that “24” has encountered before. The new hero is Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins of “Straight Outta Compton”), who led the squad of Rangers who killed Bin-Khalid, preventing a devastating attack on the United States. For their safety, the Rangers involved were given new identities and stress-free jobs, but Eric quickly discovers that all but he and Ben Grimes (Charlie Hofheimer), an unstable fellow, have been tracked down and killed. The men hunting the Rangers, we learn, are interested less in revenge than in something taken during the Bin-Khalid raid. The signature “24” format — each episode represents an hour in real time — is as pulse-pounding as ever. One ingredient that has more or less disappeared, at least in the first four episodes, is the use of torture as a reliable way to get information, a frequent target of “24” critics. But while Jack Bauer’s violent tactics were repellent, the inner darkness they suggested gave the character a certain complexity. He could show fatherly concern about his daughter one minute and draw blood from a bad guy the next. Eric Carter isn’t as complicated or, as a result, as memorable, at least in the early going, though, by the fourth hour, the character has begun to gain traction. "
152,Trump’s Harsh Talk With Malcolm Turnbull of Australia Strains Another Alliance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/australia/donald-trump-malcolm-turnbull-refugees.html?searchResultPosition=44,2017/02/02,AUSTRALIA,"BEIJING — President Trump’s combative phone call with Australia’s prime minister over a refugee agreement has set off a political storm in that country, one that threatens to weaken support for a seven-decade alliance with the United States just as many Australians say they want closer ties with China. Enthusiasm for the alliance in Australia, one of America’s closest partners, which hosts American spy facilities and rotations of American Marines, had already been under pressure from China, with which Australia conducts the most trade. Reports that Mr. Trump had scolded Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday, before abruptly ending the call, are likely to further undermine confidence in the United States, Australian analysts said. “Trump is needlessly damaging the deep trust that binds one of America’s closest alliances,” said Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University in Canberra. “China and those wishing to weaken the strongest alliance in the Pacific will see opportunity in this moment.” In less than two weeks in office, Mr. Trump’s actions have strained alliances and alienated potential partners of the United States, and his phone call with Mr. Turnbull seemed to be one more example, this time with a country that has fought on America’s side since World War I. His administration’s confrontational stance on Iran has undermined liberal voices in that country; his restrictions on immigration from some predominantly Muslim  countries have been widely criticized by allies; and his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal threatens to push countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, closer to China. Like many countries in the region, Australia depends on the United States for its security but looks to China for its economic well-being, and it does not want to choose definitively between the two as they wage a global contest for power.

153,Daily Report: Peter Thiel and the Love of Several Countries,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/technology/daily-report-peter-thiel-and-the-love-of-several-countries.html?searchResultPosition=45,2017/02/02,TECHNOLOGY,"For such an influential venture capitalist, Peter Thiel managed to stay under the radar for a long time. In “The Social Network,” the notably fictional film account of Facebook’s early days, the Thiel character was simply a friendly man who handed Mark Zuckerberg a check that got the company rolling. In real life, he was a well-known but rarely heard-from member of the so-called PayPal mafia — that crew of young entrepreneurs who became Silicon Valley power brokers. In fact, his base of power wasn’t even in Silicon Valley. He kept offices in the quiet of San Francisco’s Presidio, an idyllic former Army base overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. But last year, the world got to know who Peter Thiel is. First, there was the revelation that he was the financial backer behind the ruinous lawsuit Terry Bollea (also known as Hulk Hogan) filed against Gawker Media. Then Mr. Thiel became the tech industry’s most vocal supporter of Donald J. Trump’s “America First” presidential campaign. Of course, with a higher profile comes additional scrutiny, leading to the recent revelation that Mr. Thiel was granted citizenship in New Zealand in 2011. “I am happy to say categorically that I have found no other country that aligns more with my view of the future than New Zealand,” Mr. Thiel wrote in his application, according to a New York Times article by David Streitfeld and Jacqueline Williams. That love of New Zealand might seem strange to people who have taken Mr. Trump’s promises to heart. Advisers to Mr. Thiel, who is a German immigrant to the United States, wrote to the New Zealand government that Mr. Thiel believed “citizenship is irrevocable.” “It is the public recognition of a hallowed bond,” they said. “For that reason and others, he is prepared to make this solemn allegiance and to hereby embrace and contribute to the life, history and culture of New Zealand.” "

Trump last spring, Duke Buchan III was a mostly anonymous figure on Wall Street. He was financially successful and played polo, but unlike many of the large donors that flock toward presidential candidates in an election year, he was not a billionaire or a big-name financier. Poor investment returns forced him to shutter his hedge fund in 2011, although he did sock away enough to maintain three residences — a sprawling horse farm in upstate New York, a home in Palm Beach and an apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Now, Mr. Buchan is looking to reap a juicy dividend on his winning trade: an ambassadorship to Spain, Argentina or Uruguay. Of course there is no guarantee that he will be so rewarded, even though it is widely accepted among Republican money men that Mr. Buchan was an early backer at a time when most of Wall Street was hedging its bets, either wary of being associated with such a fiery figure or predicting that Hillary Clinton would win the election. And Mr. Trump has proved to be unpredictable in his appointments, often casting aside his most ardent advocates. "
155,How Trump Could Protect Workers’ Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/how-trump-could-protect-workers-rights.html?searchResultPosition=47,2017/02/02,OPINION,"President Trump has found something worth saving from the Obama era. According to a statement issued this week by the White House, Mr. Trump will retain an executive order from 2014 that bars discrimination against LGBTQ people at companies that do business with the federal government. The order was one of several issued by President Obama to improve working conditions for people whose employers are federal contractors or subcontractors. As the nation’s chief executive, the president has both the duty and the prerogative to set rules for companies that contract with the government. Still, such orders often serve a political as well as a practical purpose. By establishing rules for companies that do business with the government, presidents communicate the standards they would like to see throughout the entire work force. Mr. Trump has sided with Mr. Obama — and with history and decency — by retaining the LGBTQ anti-discrimination order. But for his stance against discrimination to have broad impact, it needs to be paired with support for Mr. Obama’s other workplace protections. As early as this week, Congress will likely send Mr. Trump a fast-track bill to roll back final rules intended to implement the “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” executive order, signed by Mr. Obama in 2014. The order requires federal contractors to disclose their labor law violations when bidding for federal contracts to ensure that violations are resolved before government contracts are awarded. One provision in the order specifically protects workers who allege discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity or religion or harrassment of a sexual nature. It prohibits employers from requiring that such allegations be resolved in private arbitration. Rather, accusers would have the right to go to court to resolve their disputes. No president, no American, can claim to support the rights of others while closing the courthouse door to those whose rights have been violated. The bill to undo “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” deserves a veto. Signing it would undercut Mr. Trump’s own statements about defending American workers, in general, and LGBTQ rights, in particular. "

Instead, the address of a website will appear on the screen, giving viewers a chance to see how their story ends. “I still can’t even understand why it was censored,” Maggie Hardy Magerko, 84 Lumber’s president and owner, said in an interview this week. “In fact, I’m flabbergasted by that in today’s day and age. It’s not pornographic, it’s not immoral, it’s not racist.” Advertisers pay millions of dollars for commercial space during the game, but the network and the National Football League maintain the right to approve any ad. “We review spots to ensure they do not violate our advertising policies,” a league spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said in an email. “The ad that will air does not violate our policies.” He did not say if the N.F.L. had asked for 84 Lumber’s original commercial to be altered.

158,Sex and the French Elections,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/sex-and-the-french-elections.html?searchResultPosition=79,2017/02/02,OPINION,"PARIS — The cover of Paris Match magazine late last year featured a handsome, 30-something man strolling arm in arm with an attractive blond woman in her 60s. The same couple were on the cover of a summer issue, holding hands at the beach, and on a spring edition dressed up for a state dinner. As France gears up for presidential elections in April (and probably a runoff in May), this unusual pair could help prevent it from becoming the next country to succumb to xenophobic populism. He’s the upstart presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, and she’s his former high school French teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, now his close adviser and wife. Mr. Macron, the 39-year-old former economy minister, is now in second place in the polls. He surged past the conservative François Fillon this week thanks to “Penelope-gate” — an investigation into whether Mr. Fillon’s Welsh-born wife held a well-paid government job but didn’t actually work, and other allegations. Mr. Macron still lags the front-runner, Marine Le Pen, who wants France to slash immigration and leave the European Union. Mr. Macron is adamantly pro-Europe and quickly opposed President Trump’s barring of refugees. Polls show that Mr. Macron would easily defeat Ms. Le Pen in a runoff. He’s benefiting from a global election season in which voters want to break with conventions. On one hand Mr. Macron is an énarque — a graduate of ENA, France’s elite finishing school for future presidents and ministers — and worked as an investment banker before quickly rising in the Socialist Party. But last year he broke away from the ruling (and ailing) Socialists to form his own centrist party, which he claims is neither left nor right. His youth adds to his novelty. And his unconventional personal story keeps him from seeming like just another ambitious énarque. Mr. Macron and his wife met when he was a 15-year-old 10th grader at a Jesuit high school in Amiens, and Ms. Trogneux was a 40-year-old married mother of three children, one of whom was in Mr. Macron’s class. Then known by her married name, Auzière, she taught French literature and ran the theater club. "

Last month, the Department of Homeland Security, under the Obama administration, awarded $10 million in grants to more than two dozen community groups and cities for programs to counter recruitment efforts by terrorist and white supremacist groups. The group in Minnesota decided to reject the money after Trump administration officials were reported to be considering reshaping the program to target only Muslims. The effort, now known as Countering Violent Extremism, or C.V.E., would be renamed Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, Reuters reported on Thursday. That group, Ka Joog, which works with Somali youths in Minneapolis, said in a statement that its board had decided not to take the nearly $500,000 it was awarded last month because it believed that its efforts had “been hindered by the Trump administration to instill fear, uncertainty and anti-Muslim sentiments.” The Michigan group, Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities, in Dearborn, said it would also reject $500,000 in federal aid. Suehaila Amen, an executive board member, said that her group had already been discussing before the Reuters report came out whether to accept the grant, because some in the community see the hotly disputed program as a way to spy on Muslims. But the decision was sealed by Mr. Trump’s statements and actions, Ms. Amen said. “You’re talking about a president who has maligned the Muslims throughout the entire campaign,” she said. “We don’t feel like we need to compromise our integrity, transparency and integrity in the community for some money or funding.” "

Mr. Trump’s blustery phone call with Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was enough to pull the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee into the diplomatic breach. In a remarkable statement, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced that he had called Australia’s ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, to assure him of an “unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.” Mr. Trump angrily berated Australia’s prime minister after the leader pressed Mr. Trump to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. He then followed up with a Twitter post announcing his displeasure. "

Our state is home to several reputable groundhogs (also called whistle pigs or woodchucks) — including Holtsville Hal, Malverne Mel and Dunkirk Dave — but first and foremost is the revered Staten Island Chuck. While Chuck may not have starred in a Bill Murray movie, New York’s official ambassador for this holiday was named the country’s No. 2 groundhog to watch by The Weather Channel. This morning at 7:30, Chuck did not see a shadow (as opposed to Punxsutawney Phil, who did) and determined the destiny of the winter we’ve hardly even had: Spring’s coming early. But Chuck boasts an 80 percent success rate, according to the Staten Island Zoo. Phil, by comparison, is right only 39 percent of the time. When we visited our groundhog this week at the Staten Island Zoo, we were pleased to learn that this Chuck (full name: Charles G. Hogg VII) is actually female. "

So on this week’s “Still Processing,” we invited three women who live or have lived in the United States but were not born here to get their perspective on what the immigration ban means on a personal, philosophical and historical level. First, we speak with Habab, one of Jenna’s friends, who was born in Sudan and raised in Canada and has been living in Washington legally for the last few years. She was mid-flight when Mr. Trump signed the order, heading home after a routine business trip to South America. She describes the unsettling confusion that greeted her when she landed at Washington Dulles airport. Rukmini Callimachi, who covers terrorism and jihadists for The New York Times, talks with Wesley about the political implications of the ban — and whether it will resolve the problem it is intended to solve. And we speak with Armida Lizarraga, an education consultant who lives in Lima, Peru, with her husband, a United States citizen who happens to be one of Wesley’s closest friends. We talk to her about her memories of living under Alberto Fujimori, the controversial former president of Peru who is now serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights violations. At the end of the show, we offer some recommendations for emotional balms to help one another cope with the chaos of the world right now.

He describes himself as a lucky white male. Evan Spiegel, the 26-year-old chief executive of Snap, may be all these things, but one thing is certain — he has a singular approach to business. Snap’s initial public offering, one of the most eagerly anticipated this year, will vault Mr. Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, the co-founder of Snapchat, into the ranks of tech billionaires. It will also bring the company’s approach to business, often credited to Mr. Spiegel’s atypical way of seeing things, into the public eye. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, is expected this week to reveal the paperwork for its initial public offering, showing how it is doing as a business and whether the valuation it is reportedly seeking ($20 billion to $25 billion) is justified. The choice to go public is as much a sign of Mr. Spiegel’s unconventional approach as his original idea to focus on the “right now” with Snapchat when other social media were looking at people’s past. Even as other start-ups have opted to stay private for as long as possible, he has long maintained that a public offering was best for the company. Anthony Scaramucci will not be taking a senior job at the White House as previously announced. Reince Priebus, President Trump’s chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist, informed him that he would not be joining the administration as a liaison to the business community, but they plan to find him another role. "

Putin of Russia last paid a visit to Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban was under siege for his autocratic style, Russia was isolated for its seizure of Crimea, and both men were called xenophobes for their hard-line stance on immigration. Two years later, as Mr. Putin landed on Thursday for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era, it was a different story. Both men feel vindicated. There is talk of lifting the economic sanctions placed on Russia for its land grab in Ukraine. Their brand of nationalism has moved from the fringe to the mainstream. There was a note of triumphalism, even a bit of swagger, in the air. “We all sense, it’s in the air, that the world is in the process of a substantial realignment,” Mr. Orban said in a news conference after Thursday’s meeting. “We believe this will create favorable conditions for stronger Russian-Hungarian relations.” Even so, beneath the triumph lies a strain of uneasiness. The visit is expected to be fairly low-key, an indication of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration, analysts say. President Trump’s intentions remain unclear, and the prospects of a grand bargain between Washington and the Kremlin are highly uncertain. In the meantime, leaders across Europe have been forced to recalculate the best way to balance pressures in the East and West. Nowhere is that challenge felt more keenly than in Central and Eastern Europe, historically torn between Russia and the West. That means European and global leaders are closely scrutinizing the visit. They are looking for hints of how aggressive Mr. Putin and populist leaders like Mr. Orban will be in capitalizing on this new international climate and on Mr. Trump’s stated desire for better relations with Moscow.

165,Trump Takes the Hair-Growth Drug Propecia. How Does It Work?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/health/donald-trump-hair-growth-drug-propecia.html?searchResultPosition=17,2017/02/02,HEALTH,"The revelation by his longtime doctor that President Trump takes a medication to prevent hair loss has piqued curiosity about the drug. In an interview with The New York Times, the physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said that Mr. Trump takes finasteride, also marketed as Propecia. The drug, a one-a-day pill, is a popular treatment for so-called male-pattern hair loss, in which the hairline recedes and hair thins at the temples and crown, sometimes to the point of leaving just a horseshoe-shaped fringe around the sides and the back of the head. The culprit in this type of baldness is a male hormone, dihydrotestosterone or DHT. In some men, hair follicles are particularly sensitive to it, probably based on genetics. DHT forms when an enzyme converts testosterone into it; finasteride blocks the enzyme, lowering DHT levels. The drug is better at stopping hair loss than at bringing back what’s already gone. “I set expectations from the beginning, realistic expectations” about the drug, said Dr. Andrew Alexis, the chairman of the dermatology department at Mount Sinai St. Luke’s and Mount Sinai West in New York. “The thing I emphasize the most is stopping progression and preserving the hair you have. I think it’s very successful at doing that. “ Dr. Alexis is not involved with Mr. Trump’s care. Most men with this type of hair loss start treatment with a different drug, minoxidil, also sold as Rogaine, which is rubbed into the scalp, Dr. Alexis said. If they do not see enough of an effect, they can add finasteride. Many of his patients wind up using both drugs, Dr. Alexis said. The treatment works best on the top of the head, and not as well at the temples and the receding hairline. For both drugs, the effects on hair loss were discovered by accident, when patients were taking them for other reasons. Minoxidil, in pill form, was used to treat high blood pressure, and finasteride was prescribed for prostate enlargement. But balding patients noticed that some hair grew back. Finasteride can have side effects, including decreased sex drive, erectile problems and a decreased volume of ejaculate. But those reactions are not common, affecting less than 2 percent of the men in studies. Dr. Alexis said he warns patients about the potential problems, and that some men decline the drug as a result. But many decide to try it, and they generally stick with it, he said. The drug also carries a warning that men 55 and over who take it may have an increased risk of an aggressive type of prostate cancer. But the warning is based on studies of a dose five times higher than the dose used for hair loss. The higher dose is used to treat enlarged prostates. The risk, if any, for men taking the smaller dose is not known, Dr. Alexis said. "
166,Justice Dept. Reverses Policy That Sped Up Deportations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/justice-department-deportation-trump.html?searchResultPosition=16,2017/02/02,U.S.,"The Justice Department this week rescinded the Obama administration’s policy of speeding up hearings and deportations of families and children seeking refuge in the United States, a move applauded by immigration advocates who had called the practice unfair and ineffective. The expedited hearings were started in 2014 to deal with increasing numbers of people fleeing Central America, in hopes of deterring additional migration. But the policy was largely viewed as a failure in that regard, as even more people from the region sought relief in the past two years than in 2014. The reversal this week was a rare occasion for advocates to cheer the Trump administration after two weeks of moves they decried. “This is a good thing,” said Bryan Johnson, an immigration lawyer in New York. “They are going back to common sense.” The reversal, explained in a memo from the country’s chief immigration judge, MaryBeth Keller, to judges nationwide, said the change would let the courts focus more on immigrants in detention centers who are awaiting deportation hearings, a costly population and a higher priority for the government. Families and children applying for asylum are usually not detained while their cases are being considered. Lauren Alder, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Justice Department that oversees the immigration courts, said the new policy reflected “the present state of the immigration system,” adding that changes in court practices “should not be interpreted as long-term solutions to fix the broken system, but are short-term solutions to manage the growing caseload.” "

Tillerson and intended to replace him with Mike Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director. Mr. Trump also named Gina Haspel as his choice to become the next C.I.A. director. WASHINGTON — As a clandestine officer at the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002, Gina Haspel oversaw the torture of a terrorism suspect and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting the brutal interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand. On Thursday, Ms. Haspel was named the deputy director of the C.I.A. The elevation of Ms. Haspel, a veteran widely respected among her colleagues, to the No. 2 job at the C.I.A. was a rare public signal of how, under the Trump administration, the agency is being led by officials who appear to take a far kinder view of one of its darker chapters than their immediate predecessors. Over the past eight years, C.I.A. leaders defended dozens of agency personnel who had taken part in the now-banned torture program, even as they vowed never to resume the same harsh interrogation methods. But President Trump has said repeatedly that he thinks torture works. And the new C.I.A. chief, Mike Pompeo, has said that waterboarding and other techniques do not even constitute torture, and praised as “patriots” those who used such methods in the early days of the fight against Al Qaeda. Ms. Haspel, who has spent most of her career undercover, would certainly fall within Mr. Pompeo’s description. She played a direct role in the C.I.A.’s “extraordinary rendition program,” under which captured militants were handed to foreign governments and held at secret facilities, where they were tortured by agency personnel.

Players Association Opposes Trump’s Immigration Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/sports/football/nfl-players-association-trump-immigration-order.html?searchResultPosition=14,2017/02/02,N.F.L.,"HOUSTON — The N.F.L. Players Association said Thursday that it was opposed to President Trump’s temporary ban on refugees and on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. “Our Muslim brothers in this league, we got their backs,” said Eric Winston, the union’s president. “These guys are players in the National Football League; their families are our families.” There are believed to be only a handful of Muslim players in the league. Mohamed Sanu, a wide receiver on the Atlanta Falcons who is Muslim, was one of the few players this week who expressed an opinion to reporters about the ban. “It’s a very tough situation, and I just pray that us as a country and a world can be united as one,” he said Monday. “It’s really hard for me to talk about this right now. It would take a lot of time, so I just want to focus on the game and focus on football.” The union’s opposition to the president’s executive order came a day after N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell would not clarify the league’s stance on the issue. “As commissioner of the N.F.L., I’m singularly focused on the Super Bowl right now,” Goodell said at a news conference on Wednesday. “As I said before, we have a unique position to have an event on Sunday that will bring the world together. They will have an opportunity to be entertained, to feel good about what we’re doing, and that’s something that we feel very proud of.” DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the players’ union, also addressed other player issues on Thursday. He said the players were not willing to trade a portion of their share of the league’s revenue in return for reducing the commissioner’s disciplinary powers. The union has fought the league several times in court to reverse the commissioner’s suspensions of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and other players. Smith said the union was also looking at the potential use of medical marijuana to assist players dealing with pain. “The time has come to look at it somewhat different,” he said, adding that 4,900 injuries were reported last season. “We want to look at the issue of pain comprehensively.” The N.F.L. opposes allowing players to use medical marijuana, though Goodell said Wednesday that he would look at the issue if it was part of a broader renegotiation of the league’s labor agreement.

Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, condemned Russia on Thursday for its recent “aggressive actions” in eastern Ukraine. “We do want to better our relations with Russia,” Ms. Haley said during her first remarks to an open briefing of the United Nations Security Council. “However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.” She made it clear that American sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea would remain in place. During her Senate confirmation hearing last month, Ms. Haley also expressed support for continuing the sanctions and accused Russia of committing war crimes in the Syrian conflict. But her strong criticism of the government of President Vladimir V. Putin put her at odds with President Trump, who has expressed a desire for warmer relations with the Kremlin. Her Russian counterpart, Vitaly I. Churkin, told reporters after the meeting that it would be “frivolous” to speculate on whether the Trump administration would be friendlier than that of President Barack Obama. “I don’t want to make any predictions,” Mr. Churkin said. “My intention is to try to do my best to establish a good working relationship with the head of the new U.S. delegation.” “They’re just in their first few days,” he added. Mr. Churkin said he expected to meet with Ms. Haley on Friday. The conflict in eastern Ukraine escalated in recent days, after Mr. Trump spoke by phone on Saturday with Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump has said he admires. Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists of aggression. Mr. Putin, by contrast, blamed a financially struggling Ukraine, and its need for money from the international community, for the escalation. “The best way to get that,” Mr. Putin said Thursday on a visit to Budapest, “is to portray yourselves as victims of aggression.” The Ukrainian ambassador, Volodymyr Y. Yelchenko, who presides over Security Council deliberations this month, accused Russia of carrying out war crimes. "

You cover it. But what about when the man being protested is known for rhetoric that makes you nauseated? Or when you see a student get beaten up because he looked “like a Nazi”? How do you remain objective? Those were the questions that faced me when, as a reporter for the student newspaper at the University of California, Berkeley, I covered the protest on Wednesday  night at the college that turned violent, drawing national attention. I didn’t know what to think about it all, and truthfully, I still don’t. The protesters were demonstrating against a scheduled speech on campus by Milo Yiannopoulos, a Breitbart editor and right-wing provocateur, who had been invited by the Berkeley College Republicans. This was always going to be a controversial event. Mr. Yiannopoulos has been giving inflammatory speeches on a college tour meant to push back against what he sees as the stifling politically correct left. But his language has veered decidedly toward hate speech. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, for example, he singled out a transgender student for ridicule by name. Because of actions like that, many Berkeley students and more than 100 faculty members petitioned the university to block the event, but the chancellor, Nicholas Dirks, declined to do so, citing free speech. This, of course, raises questions about free speech: Is it free speech if it makes us feel unsafe in our own skin? On the other hand, what does this campus represent if it doesn’t respect the rights of people with whom many of us disagree? "

It is meant to intercept North Korea’s medium-range missiles. “Were it not for the provocative behavior of North Korea, we would have no need for Thaad out here,” Mr. Mattis added. “There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about Thaad.” South Korea was a logical first stop for Mr. Mattis, who will also visit Japan on the trip. Tensions have risen in the region after Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, proclaimed during his New Year’s Day address that his military was preparing to conduct its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Asian nations have also been concerned about the conflicting signals from President Trump about the United States’ posture in the region. The most recent one was a contentious phone call between Mr. Trump and the Australian prime minister, which was disclosed just as Mr. Mattis began his Asia trip. Mr. Trump mused during his election campaign that the United States could save money if nations like South Korea and Japan developed their own nuclear weapons — comments that ran counter to decades of American nonproliferation policy.

It is an office tower, not an apartment building. INTERNATIONAL An article on Jan. 5 about the rescheduling of the trial of a son of the president of Equatorial Guinea on embezzlement and money-laundering charges transposed two of the son’s names.

The dozens arrested belong to what the Morton County Sheriff’s Department described in a statement as a “rogue group” that had set up camp on private property south of the Backwater Bridge, the site of previous standoffs between demonstrators and the police. After instructing the group to take down the camp, law enforcement officers advanced on the site around 3:30 p.m. local time and cleared the area within about a half-hour, according to the statement. “Regardless of this incident, it is our desire to continue the dialogue with tribal and camp leaders so that the camps continue to be cleaned and protesters leave prior to the flooding season,” the Morton County sheriff, Kyle Kirchmeier, said in a statement. Representatives of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe worked with officers to collect tepee hides left at the site, according to the department, which said it had made nearly 700 arrests during protests since Aug. 10. “We hope the arrestees are treated fairly and justly,” David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock reservation’s official tribal government, said in a statement. About a week ago, President Trump acted to expedite the $3.7 billion pipeline, which the Army had sidetracked in December. Despite reports on Tuesday suggesting that the Army Corps of Engineers had approved a final element of the pipeline, an Army Corps spokesman told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it had only begun its review of an easement, which is necessary for the pipeline’s completion. In response to the news of the easement on Tuesday night, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said it would pursue legal action to ensure that the Army Corps conducted an environmental impact study before granting an easement.

The phone call last Saturday between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull turned contentious after the Australian leader pressed the president to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Late Wednesday night, Mr. Trump reiterated his anger over the agreement on Twitter. He called the agreement a “dumb deal” and blamed the Obama administration for accepting it but then said that he would “study” it. The tweet was posted after The Washington Post reported details of the phone call. The leaders of the two allies did not seem to agree on the outcome of the conversation. Mr. Trump’s tweet suggested the agreement could be at risk while Mr. Turnbull said that, despite the bluntness of the discussion, the United States had committed to upholding the arrangement. The flare-up — and conflicting characterizations of the call from Mr. Trump and Mr. Turnbull — threatened to do lasting damage to relations between the two countries and could drive Canberra closer to China, which has a robust trading relationship with Australia and is competing with Washington to become the dominant force in the Asia-Pacific region.

Congressional Republicans are trying to nudge Mr. Trump away from one of his big campaign promises: a 35 percent tariff on any product made by an American company at an overseas factory, then imported into the United States market. Success in getting the president off that applause line will be critical to getting tax legislation passed in 2017 and fulfilling a central promise that Republicans have been making to voters for years. At the same time, both sides want to end what they see as a penalty on American exporters, who compete with overseas factories that can game the system for lower tax rates. “Like us, they’re just not satisfied with a tax code today that favors foreign products over U.S. products, and I think they are looking carefully at ending that ‘made in America’ export tax so that we can compete around the world,” Mr. Brady, Republican of Texas, said of the Trump administration. At the White House meeting, Mr. Brady was joined by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat, and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means. The conversation with Mr. Trump also focused on trade and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Brady’s plan would also essentially levy a 20 percent tax on all imports, to create revenue and spur domestic production and exports — a notion Mr. Trump has said is overly complicated. The prospect of such a sweeping change has stirred fears among big companies in the retail and energy sectors, which rely heavily on imports, and created a backlash that could scuttle plans to slash tax rates without adding to the deficit. The split within corporate America over the shape of a tax code rewrite was on display Thursday as Freedom Partners, an advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, called on Republicans to “scrap” the border tax idea, which it warned would mean higher prices for consumers. Also Thursday, a new business group, the American Made Coalition, began to rally support around the tax plan championed by Mr. Brady and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. "

Trump argued that the United States faced a threat — radical Islamic terrorism — on par with fascism, Nazism and communism. He declared to a cheering crowd in Youngstown, Ohio, that “those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry and hatred will not be allowed into our country.” Now that view is not the stuff of stump speeches.

President Bill Clinton liked Indian food from the Bombay Club and the occasional run to McDonald’s. President Barack Obama spent eight years dining all over town, eating everything from upscale Italian at Fiola Mare to truffle macaroni and cheese at Equinox. President Trump, a culinary creature of habit and junk food aficionado, seems content, for now, to ensconce himself in the White House rather than partake of the dining options in increasingly foodie Washington. But in this overwhelmingly Democratic city, where even a local hoagie chain owner faced a storm of criticism for attending a meeting on small businesses with Mr. Trump at the White House, restaurateurs are hoping that Ivanka Trump, and not necessarily her father, turns up. “I can’t see him sitting down and having a bowl of gumbo,” said Gus DiMillo, whose restaurant group owns Acadiana, which specializes in Cajun-Creole fare. “I’m more curious about Ivanka.” A precisely put-together entrepreneur, mother of three and wife to Jared Kushner, a top White House adviser, Ms. Trump will most likely continue the work she did on the campaign trail to humanize her father and promote the family brand in Washington. But many residents are still smarting from the results of the election and wondering what will happen to an urban renaissance and an explosion of restaurants, bars and nightclubs that coincided with Mr. Obama’s time in office. Nicholas Stefanelli, the head chef and owner of Masseria, a restaurant frequently visited by the former first lady, Michelle Obama, said that Washington took on the characteristics of each administration in power — but that the Trumps would probably have to adapt to the dining and night-life culture of the city, not the other way around.

Amid a storm of protest, Mr. Trump on Thursday continued to stick by the ban as essential to the safety of the nation, saying that in the “coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty.” “We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values,” Mr. Trump said at the National Prayer Breakfast. Now, the Department of Homeland Security’s internal auditor has entered the fray. The office of the department’s inspector general announced late Wednesday that it would review how the agency carried out the executive order, which suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days and blocked for 90 days citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The auditor said the review was a response to requests from Congress, whistle-blowers and to complaints received on a hotline. In addition to reviewing how the Department of Homeland Security carried out the executive order, the inspector general’s office said it would review the agency’s adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct. The inspector general’s office, which did not say how long its review would take, said it could look into other issues as well. Following Mr. Trump’s order, the State Department went even further than prohibiting those outside the country from entering: It issued an internal memorandum revoking the visas of all nationals from those countries, without notifying them, even those who are legally studying, working and living in the United States.

Waving American and Yemeni flags and holding signs in English and Arabic, the demonstrators filled the plaza at Borough Hall. They gathered for the Islamic sunset prayer and listened intently as a series of public officials greeted them with the words “Assalamu alaikum” and condemned the president’s order, which temporarily bars citizens of Yemen and six other majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. “This order goes against everything we came here for and everything America stands for,” said Abdul Salam Mubaraz, a bodega owner who had closed his shop for the day and spoke from the stage. For people fleeing war-torn countries like Yemen, he said, the restrictions amounted to “having the door of freedom shut by President Trump.” Yemeni-owned bodegas are institutions in many New York neighborhoods, selling coffee and bagels, groceries, umbrellas and many other items. Organizers said several hundred had closed from noon to 8 p.m. on Thursday in protest, which Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, told the crowd, sent “a loud and clear message to America.” Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed support for the protesters on Twitter. “New York City’s bodega owners are bravely shutting their doors to oppose the president’s shameful executive order,” Mr. de Blasio wrote. “I stand with them.” "
182,How Trump Would Corrupt the Pulpit,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/how-trump-would-corrupt-the-pulpit.html?searchResultPosition=27,2017/02/02,OPINION,"President Trump just reiterated his campaign promise to “get rid of and totally destroy” the law prohibiting churches and other nonprofit tax-exempt institutions from endorsing political candidates. This change would be horrible for politics — and even worse for religion. The law, known as the Johnson Amendment, was written by Lyndon B. Johnson, then a senator from Texas, in 1954. It prohibits tax-exempt churches from endorsing political candidates. Mr. Trump on Thursday said repealing the rule would “allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,” adding, “Freedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is under serious threat.” Let’s start by clearing up two misunderstandings. The rule does not prevent churches — or other charities — from speaking freely. Religious leaders and churches have been weighing in on political issues for as long as there have been pulpits. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Jeremiah Wright and thousands of clergy on any given weekend have been energetic advocates of political or social causes. The rule does not even prohibit clergy from endorsing a candidate. Rather, it says that if a religious leader endorses a candidate, then his church cannot receive the significant benefit of tax exemption, and that people cannot, therefore, make a tax-deductible contribution to that church. Eliminating the endorsement rule would mean that your tax dollars would now indirectly subsidize a church’s support for a particular political candidate. For instance, conservative taxpayers would indirectly support the Rev. Al Sharpton if he decided to endorse a candidate — or the local mosque that wanted to endorse a candidate. And progressives would indirectly support churches that endorse candidates who are opposed to same-sex marriage. The conservatives clamoring for this change should think hard: They don’t like their tax dollars going to support groups that perform abortions. Do they really want to pay for churches that push pro-choice candidates? They fear and distrust Islam. Do they really want their hard-earned money to back the preferred political candidates of the local Islamic center? "

Using an obscure law that allows Congress to review regulations before they take effect, the Senate voted to reverse the Stream Protection Rule, which seeks to protect the nation’s waterways from debris generated by a practice called surface mining. The Interior Department had said the rule would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests by keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters. The Senate vote was 54 to 45, following a House vote for repeal on Wednesday. “Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams,” Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule, said on Wednesday. “Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business.” The Senate also moved to reverse a separate rule requiring publicly traded oil, gas and mineral companies to disclose payments to foreign governments for licenses or permits. The disclosure rule was aimed at curbing bribery and at helping resource-rich developing countries hold fossil-fuel companies, and their governments, accountable. After a procedural vote on Thursday, final Senate action to cancel the rule is expected Friday, with Mr. Trump’s signature to follow. The Trump administration, which has vowed to peel back regulations, is particularly close to the fossil fuel industry. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed President Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil. "

The chief executive of Uber was holding a regularly scheduled all-hands meeting on Tuesday at the ride-hailing company’s San Francisco headquarters when he faced an onslaught of questions from upset employees. Uber was under attack — unfairly, many staff members believed — after people accused the company of seeking to profit from giving rides to airport customers in New York during weekend protests against President Trump’s immigration order. But there was another matter disturbing the employees: Mr. Kalanick himself. He had joined Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council in December. After the immigration order against refugees and seven Muslim-majority countries, many staff members wondered why Mr. Kalanick was still willing to advise the president. “What would it take for you to quit the economic council?” at least two employees asked at the Tuesday meeting. On Thursday, Mr. Kalanick gave his answer, stepping down from Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,” Mr. Kalanick wrote in an email to employees obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Kalanick’s exit from the advisory council underscores the tricky calculus facing many Silicon Valley corporate chieftains who try to work with the new administration. On one hand, many tech executives have openly tried to engage with the president, a path that is typically good for business. Yet Mr. Trump’s immigration order has been so unpopular with so many tech workers — many of whom are immigrants themselves and who advocate globalization — that they are now exerting pressure on their chief executives to push back forcefully against the administration.

But the public began to notice the heat waves and the torrential rains and the tidal flooding. So then we had the “I am not a scientist” phase, with one lawmaker after another fending off climate questions with that formula. That drew such ridicule that Republicans critical of climate science had to come up with a more nuanced answer. Several variations on the new approach were on display recently during confirmation hearings for some of President Trump’s cabinet nominees. “Science tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,” Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate committee. “The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.” Let us ponder the craftsmanship of that second sentence. “With precision” is the key phrase, of course, and it renders the statement almost axiomatically true. Do we have trouble taking the precise temperature of an entire planet and then divining, for a given period, exactly how much of the change in that temperature is caused by human activities? "

There are the Twitter-borne insults, the constant staff leaks and backbiting and the exhausting whirlwind of controversy and chaos. If it is Wednesday, it must be contretemps with Iran. Or is it Mexico? Or Australia? And what did he say about Frederick Douglass? And, oh my, how about that Trump doctor? Speaking of health, covering Mr. Trump is like practicing journalism on a treadmill. It can be difficult to keep up. This is all to say that what is striking about the early days of the Trump administration is how very little D.J.T., as his staff likes to call him, has changed since he became the most powerful man in the world. The presidency can be sobering: the nuclear codes, the intelligence briefings, the weight of history. But if entering the White House has changed Mr. Trump, he is not showing it. He is still mocking his rivals and the news media, he continues to propagate conspiracy theories such as the falsehood that there were millions of illegal votes in the election, and he still spends a good deal of time watching television news. He has made no adjustments in the way he refers to U.S. allies, including Mexico, now that he speaks for an entire nation. There is a reason that during the campaign, speculation from TV-bound pundits about a potential Trump “pivot” became a sort-of inside joke among the reporters covering the race: It was never going to happen.

Katyal was for a time the top lawyer in the Obama administration. As acting solicitor general, he represented the government before the Supreme Court. He is no conservative, and says he is disappointed that the latest nominee to the court is from the White House of President Trump. Yet in the opinion pages of The New York Times on Tuesday, Katyal made a forceful case for Trump’s pick to the high court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Katyal called the nominee a man of principle who will uphold the rule of law, and “bring a sense of fairness and decency to the job, and a temperament that suits the nation’s highest court.” The author says he knows this because he has seen Gorsuch in action, both in court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve. What Katyal did not mention — and the Op-Ed page did not disclose in his bio — is that he has cases pending before the Supreme Court. Katyal was identified as a former solicitor general, a law professor at Georgetown University and a private litigator at the law firm Hogan Lovells. But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb, Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court. Some readers would have liked to know more about Katyal’s background. Here’s one email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands, N.J. I took this concern to both Op-Ed page and to Katyal himself. Jim Dao, the Op-Ed editor, said the editors had not been aware of Katyal’s cases before the court. Writers are required to disclose potential conflicts, he said, but the process got rushed in this case. “Editors do try to ask writers directly,” he said. “On tight deadlines — and the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline — the question doesn’t always get asked. So I don’t blame the writer or the editor in this case.” "

Is Donald Trump to be given free rein to carry out his agenda regardless of the damage he is likely to inflict on the American people? In short, are there any adults left in the Republican Party willing to confront him? JAY N. FELDMAN Port Washington, N.Y. To the Editor: I have been surprised and chagrined at the lack of opposition to the Trump cabinet nominees by many Democratic senators. Even those claiming the progressive label are approving these cabinet nominees. Demonstrators objecting to this wimpy policy are picketing a number of offices of these Democratic senators. Yet there is very little media coverage of these protests. The Women’s March was tremendous. Now we need to follow up with sustained political action and resistance to what is happening to our country through the misguided actions of this White House regime. MUNIR KATUL  Eugene, Ore.

Stephen A. Feinberg, the founder, has held discussions with President Trump’s transition team about “a senior role,” according to a letter to Cerberus investors on Thursday that was reviewed by DealBook. The firm said that were he to take such a position, he would have to publicly disclose significant amounts of information about his finances. That could bring uncomfortable scrutiny upon Cerberus again. The $30 billion firm has been criticized for owning Remington, which made the rifle used in the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. After the shooting, Cerberus sought unsuccessfully to sell its interest in the gun maker, then offered its investors a way to cash out their stakes in the business. Cerberus said it had a succession plan in place if Mr. Feinberg were to leave, though it declined to elaborate. Mr. Feinberg, 56, has been a notable backer of Republican candidates and had served on Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council. He is among several financial moguls to enter the Trump administration’s orbit. The investor Wilbur L. Ross is Mr. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, while the hedge fund manager Steven T. Mnuchin is the administration’s nominee for Treasury secretary. Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder and the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, leads a forum of business leaders who will meet with Mr. Trump on economic matters. News of Mr. Feinberg’s discussions with the Trump administration was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. "

191,United States to Australia: Get Lost,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/united-states-to-australia-get-lost.html?searchResultPosition=18,2017/02/02,OPINION,"Let’s imagine for a moment Rex Tillerson, the newly installed secretary of state, awakening to this tweet from President Trump about an important American ally: “Do you believe it? The Obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!” First, the “illegal immigrants” are in fact desperate people fleeing conflict whose status as refugees has in most cases been officially recognized. Second, as refugees, they have the right, under the Geneva Conventions, of which the United States is a signatory, to be treated “without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin.” Third, the “thousands” are in fact about 1,250 of the 2,500 men, women and children who, for more than three years now, have been marooned on two remote South Pacific islands, Manus and Nauru, in appalling conditions that have seen suicide, deaths through negligence, a killing, and relentless mental abuse. Fourth, this “dumb deal” reflects the pressing Australian interest in finding a way out of its predicament with the refugees and the American interest in strengthening its Australian alliance at a time when United States Marines are rotating through Darwin and China is flexing its muscles in the South China Sea. Fifth, diplomacy is about identifying shared interests; it stands no chance when the tweeted tantrums of a tempestuous president constitute Washington’s highest-level communications with a world held in America-first contempt. The notion must cross Tillerson’s mind that Trump’s inaccurate tweet is needless provocation of a friend; that simultaneously infuriating Asian and European allies may not be smart; and that his task will be a thankless one as Trump’s White House coterie hatches seat-of-the-pants policy and leaves his already restive State Department to deal with weighty issues in Luxembourg and the Solomon Islands. Let’s further imagine that all this passes through Tillerson’s head before he grabs the Washington Post and discovers that Trump has taken his Australia bashing further. He has hung up on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after telling him it’s his “worst call by far” with world leaders (behind Vladimir Putin, of course), and accused Turnbull of preparing to send the next “Boston bombers” America’s way. At which point Tillerson must really be wondering — as is the rest of the world after two weeks of fast-tracked chaos from Trump. The president wants to run the United States like his business, with scant accountability and contempt for rules. Fine, except that bankruptcy is the worst conceivable outcome for a business whereas nuclear war is the worst conceivable outcome for America and all of humanity. Trump is in way over his skis. From the pointless, counterproductive, prejudice-reeking temporary ban on immigration from seven mainly Muslim countries to a botched Navy SEAL raid on Al Qaeda in Yemen, the same traits of haste and imprudence have been apparent. Trump is a propagator of mayhem at the head of a TV- and Twitter-driven movement whose goal is to circumvent democratic institutions through the exercise of hypnotic and disorienting power. He is only incidentally the president. "

hen I first met Yang Jinkai, two days before he boarded a plane for America, the smog hanging over his industrial home city, Shenyang, had turned the sun into a ghostly orb. The 16-year-old paced around the family apartment as his mother labeled his suitcases and packed them with the comforts of home: quilted pajamas, chopsticks, instant noodles. She gestured toward a lone memento that would remain in his bedroom, a life-size needlepoint portrait of her only child, woven in shimmering gold thread. “I worked on that all year,” she said. “I knew this moment would come.” Yang had never traveled outside China. But he had already chosen a new first name for his life in America, Korbin (“That sounds American, right?”), and was daydreaming about the adventure ahead. “It will be magical,” he said. “I’ll make lots of American friends. I’d like to have an American girlfriend. Maybe” — he shot a glance at his father — “I’ll even get a gun.” Over the summer, Korbin had been working on his English by watching, perhaps too zealously, the American television series “Criminal Minds.” To help Korbin escape the competitive straitjacket of the Chinese education system, his father had paid nearly $40,000 to an education consultancy to get him enrolled in a public high school in Michigan. The Yang family’s ultimate goal was for Korbin to attend a top American university, and the name of his new high school, Oxford, only added to the allure. It didn’t matter that the place had no connection to the British university or that this Oxford was a small town north of Detroit. “My father,” Korbin said, “really likes the idea of an Oxford diploma.” Even as U.S.-China relations have slipped toward mutual antagonism, the flood of Chinese students coming to the United States has continued to rise. Roughly 370,000 students from the mainland are enrolled in American high schools and universities, six times more than a decade ago. Their financial impact — $11.4 billion was contributed to the American economy in 2015, according to the Department of Commerce — has turned education into one of America’s top “exports” to China. It is a strange historical moment when the elites of a rising power send their only sons and daughters, products of China’s former one-child policy, to the schools of a geopolitical rival. Yet the idea of a liberal Western education exerts an almost talismanic hold over China’s ruling classes. While the country’s educational emphasis on rote memorization churns out some of the world’s best test-takers, many Chinese families harbor worries that diverge sharply from those of the tiger parents of popular conception. They fret about the toll competition exacts from their coddled offspring; they wonder if their child’s creativity is being stifled. Even President Xi Jinping, who is presiding over a crackdown on Western influences in China’s schools, allowed his daughter to attend Harvard. According to a 2016 survey conducted by a Shanghai-based research firm, 83 percent of China’s millionaires are planning to send their children to school abroad. The average age, according to the poll, has dropped to 16 today from 18 in 2014 — the first time it has reached the high-school level. "
193,Fighting Racial Bias on Campus,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/education/edlife/fighting-racial-bias-on-campus.html?searchResultPosition=75,2017/02/02,EDUCATION LIFE,"Shaun R. Harper has been at the center of the racial debate of the past year — first, as protests illuminated the concerns of students of color, then as the Trump triumph emboldened some to commit overt acts of bias, particularly against Latino and Muslim students. In his new book, “Race Matters in College,” due out in June from Johns Hopkins University Press, he provides a pathway for campuses struggling with these very issues. A leading scholar on racial equity in higher education, Dr. Harper will in July be leaving the University of Pennsylvania, where he founded and directed the Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education, and joining the University of Southern California, where he will teach and start up a similar center with big ambitions. One priority is a survey to assess the racial climate on the nation’s campuses. What is your reaction to the environment on campus following the Trump election and inauguration? The uptick in reports of racial bias reinforces my argument as to why it’s so important that colleges and universities be responsible for white students having access to a proper course of study in race. I was also struck by how many white people on college campuses were shocked to learn that there was so much racism in America. In fact, I use the election to address in my book why even the most educated white people were so naïve and blind to the realities of race. What prompted you to write your book? I saw this as an opportunity to help people understand that universities didn’t just all of a sudden become racist. They’ve been racist and exclusive from the start. I wanted to call attention to both the problems and the opportunities. When I say the opportunities, I mean the opportunity to actually force higher education institutions to follow through on their commitment to diversity. What makes you think universities breed racism? On most predominantly white campuses, people of color are overwhelmingly represented in food service, grounds keeping, custodial roles and fairly low-paid secretarial roles; and they are tragically underrepresented among tenured faculty members, deans, provosts and presidents, people who are in power. This sends a message to black and Latino students that they aren’t really valued. To their white counterparts, their expectation is that people of color work at the lowest levels of the organizations they lead. For example, the guys on the field are black men, but the coaches, commissioners and top executives at the N.C.A.A. are overwhelmingly white men. There is some real asymmetry there. If universities fail to address these issues in a meaningful way, what are the long-term effects? White people never thought before about their own underpreparation to even think about race, talk about race, and achieve racial equity. Companies and newsrooms say they want to achieve racial diversity but don’t know how. This is extremely consequential for our democracy. Our conversation about race in higher education has to start to include white people and pay some attention to their preparation, because otherwise, we’re going to continue to see an oversupply of white people in leadership positions in all sectors of our society and our economy. These are the people who will eventually shape public policies and teach future generations. "

A coronation of sorts, it marked her as a new face of the brand, and favorite of the designer Karl Lagerfeld. “Her” being Lily-Rose Depp, the daughter of the actress-singer Vanessa Paradis, a former face of the brand, and Johnny Depp. As it happens, Ms. Depp’s appearance at Chanel followed fast on the heels of Burberry’s announcement that it had chosen Iris Law, the daughter of Jude Law and Sadie Frost, as the new face of its makeup line Liquid Lip Velvet, as well as the appearance of Lennon Gallagher, the son of Liam Gallagher, the Oasis frontman, and Patsy Kensit, on the Topman runway during London Fashion Week Mens. Not to mention the announcement that Frances Bean Cobain, the daughter of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love, was the star of the new Marc Jacobs ads. Plus that Jimmy Freud, the son of Bella Freud, was featured in the new issue of Love magazine. And it presaged the release this week of a new Gap video campaign featuring Rumer Willis (daughter of Demi Moore), T J Mizell (son of Jam Master Jay), Coco Gordon (daughter of Kim Gordon), Lizzy Jagger (daughter of Mick Jagger), Chelsea Tyler (daughter of Steven Tyler) and Evan Ross (son of Diana Ross) — all of whose famous forebears once upon a time also made their own Gap ads. Given that the title is “Generation Gap,” and the clothes being worn are all reissued updated versions of 15 staple Gap pieces of the ’90s that their respective parents wore — the black bodysuit, the sleeveless tee, the logo sweatshirt — the connection makes a certain amount of sense. But it also may signal the second, institutionalized phase of what has become a bona fide cross-border fashion phenomenon. “We call it the ‘children of,’” said Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W, who happened to have just shot Brandon Thomas Lee (son of Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson) and Nyima Ward (the model Trish Goff’s son) among others for the April issue.

He didn’t care. He was going to America. But this week, he remained 7,000 miles away, marooned with more than 100 other Somali refugees in a spartan transit center in central Nairobi that smelled of nervous sweat. Mr. Ibrahim and many of his displaced comrades had been waiting more than two decades to be resettled in the United States and were supposed to fly to America this week. But their hopes were crushed by President Trump’s executive order to freeze the refugee flow into the United States for at least four months. More than 25,000 refugees from Somalia, one of the poorest, hungriest, war-torn countries on earth, were in the pipeline to be resettled in the United States. Mr. Ibrahim was much closer than most — so close that, with his ticket, paperwork and bag all zipped up, the thought of it made his voice quiver. He had waited 26 long years for this, living in a sweltering, crowded, disease-ridden refugee camp along the Kenya-Somalia border that is the opposite of hope. Now his worst fears are shaping up. The Somali refugees who had already been extensively vetted and approved by several American government agencies will most likely be bused back to the camps. Many said that they feared for their lives and that their situation was actually worse than it had been before they came so close to leaving. "

In light of President Trump’s selection of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch just as the new president’s aggressive and contested use of executive power came into view, Democrats intend to aggressively question whether Judge Gorsuch will hold in check the man who seeks to elevate him to the nation’s most influential court. Democrats believe a unique sequence of events — issuing a constitutionally questionable executive order on Friday, firing an acting attorney general who refused to defend it on Monday and nominating a Supreme Court justice on Tuesday — places executive overreach and separation of powers squarely at the center of the confirmation debate. “His administration, at least at its outset, seems to have less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory, and is challenging the Constitution in unprecedented fashion,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said of Mr. Trump on Wednesday on the Senate floor. “There’s a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist.” Democrats will still meticulously pick through the record of Judge Gorsuch, who sits on the federal appeals court in Colorado, in search of disqualifying material, and they are already raising questions about what they see as business-friendly rulings. But it is easy to envision them pressing him directly on whether he found the recent executive order on immigration, and perhaps others, to be constitutional. The wrong answer for Democrats or a refusal to respond directly could then translate into a reason to oppose Mr. Gorsuch. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put it this way: The American people deserve a court that comprises those capable of “serving as an independent and vigilant check on the other branches of government.” "

For the rest of the list, click here.) PACHINKO
By Min Jin Lee
490 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $27. Min Jin Lee’s stunning novel “Pachinko” — her second, after “Free Food for Millionaires” (2007) — announces its ambitions right from the opening sentence: “History has failed us, but no matter.” “Pachinko” chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family, first in Japanese-occupied Korea in the early 20th century, then in Japan itself from the years before World War II to the late 1980s. The novel opens with an arranged marriage in Yeongdo, a fishing village at the southern tip of Korea. That union produces a daughter, Sunja, who falls in love at 16 with a prominent (and married) mobster. After Sunja becomes pregnant, a local pastor offers her a chance to escape by marrying him and immigrating together to his brother’s house in an ethnic Korean neighborhood in Osaka. Together, they embark into the fraught unknown. Pachinko, the slot-machine-like game ubiquitous throughout Japan, unifies the central concerns of identity, homeland and belonging. For the ethnic Korean population in Japan, discriminated against and shut out of traditional occupations, pachinko parlors are the primary mode of finding work and accumulating wealth. Called Zainichi, or foreign residents, ethnic Koreans are required to reapply for alien registration cards every three years even if they were born in Japan, and are rarely granted passports, making overseas travel nearly impossible. From a young age, Sunja’s oldest son sees being Korean as “a dark, heavy rock”; his greatest, secret desire is to be Japanese. His younger brother, Mozasu, even after he accumulates great wealth through his pachinko parlors, confides to his closest Japanese friend: “In Seoul, people like me get called Japanese bastards, and in Japan, I’m just another dirty Korean no matter how much money I make or how nice I am.” Mozasu’s son, Solomon, learns this too quickly after graduating from an American university. He returns to Tokyo on an expat package with the Japanese branch of a British investment bank, then is fired once his ethnic Korean connections are no longer needed for a business deal. Still, Solomon is of a new, less wounded generation. He believes there are still good Japanese people and sees himself as Japanese, too, “even if the Japanese didn’t think so.” "

But it is probably safe to say that none of the 28 leaders who are gathering in Malta on Friday expected the crisis that has overtaken the agenda: the United States of America. Like much of the world, the European Union is struggling to decipher a President Trump who seems every day to be picking a new fight with a new nation, whether friend or foe. Hopes among European leaders that Mr. Trump’s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating, replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement over how to proceed. If many foreign leaders expected a Trump administration to push to renegotiate trade deals, or take a tough line on immigration, few anticipated that he would become an equal opportunity offender. He has insulted or humiliated Mexico, Britain, Germany and Iraq; engaged in a war of words with China and Iran; and turned a routine phone call with the prime minister of Australia, a staunch ally, into a minor diplomatic crisis. With the possible exception of NATO, where he has softened his tone, Mr. Trump has expressed disdain for other multilateral institutions such as the European Union. His praise has been reserved for populists and strongmen, like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and, of course, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump is convinced that the United States has been played for a patsy by the rest of the world and is vowing to set things straight. “We’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually,” he said on Thursday at a prayer breakfast. “It’s not going to happen anymore.” Against this forbidding backdrop, some European leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that Mr. Trump may represent a truly dire challenge, one that threatens to upend not only the 70-year European project of integration and security, but just about everything they stand for, including liberal democracy itself.

It came from volunteers of Rutgers Presbyterian Church on Manhattan’s Upper West Side who signed on to sponsor this family of Kurdish Syrian refugees months ago, only to find them caught up in a maelstrom of presidential politics, judges’ decisions and delays. The volunteers cried, and the Khojas could not stop smiling. “We heard that we can’t go to America and now we are here and we can’t believe our eyes,” Suzan Khoja, 28, said in breathless English. Ms. Khoja; her five siblings, ages 12 to 31; and her parents left Aleppo and had been living in Istanbul for a few years. Their arrival at Kennedy, just before an appellate court in San Francisco heard arguments about whether President Trump’s indefinite ban on Syrian refugees should be reinstated, was the dramatic end to 12 days fraught with confusion, deferred dreams and cautious hopes. “When the plane landed, I felt that now this is a reality,” said the patriarch, Mahmoud Khoja, 58. On the ground in the United States, the groups working to bring refugees in — often affiliated with churches and synagogues — had been going through their own whipsaw of emotions. Rutgers Presbyterian’s refugee task force put a typical New York spin on the crisis, turning to its high-placed contacts and deep pocket of donations to see if it could bring the family into the country despite the ban on refugees. The group enlisted several immigration lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union and human rights professors in Istanbul. Someone had a number for Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, but then learned that to go to Canada, the family would have to start the three-year application process again. "
202,Why the Defense Dept. Is Looking to Lease Space in Trump Tower,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/trump-tower-defense-department.html?searchResultPosition=78,2017/02/08,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — In seeking to rent space in the 58-floor skyscraper that is President Trump’s home in Manhattan, the Defense Department is continuing a long tradition of finding a place close to the commander in chief for his top military aides — including the ones who carry the “nuclear football” of launch codes that follows the president everywhere. The Defense Department has regularly paid for space near temporary or part-time presidential residences, including near the Chicago home of President Barack Obama. Before that, the Pentagon placed a heavily secured trailer at the Crawford, Tex., ranch of President George W. Bush. But it is hard to put a trailer with the nuclear football right outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, officials say. Even so, a move into the Manhattan high-rise raises questions of taxpayer money going directly to Mr. Trump. The football — essentially the briefcase of nuclear codes and communications systems — follows the president wherever he goes, held 24/7 by a military aide who must be able to get it to him in minutes if necessary. Whoever is taking care of the nuclear football needs a place to sleep, close to the president. Thus, the need to rent space in Trump Tower, officials say. “In order to meet official mission requirements, the Department of Defense is working through appropriate channels in accordance with all applicable legal requirements in order to acquire a limited amount of leased space in Trump Tower,” Lt. Col. J. B. Brindle, a Pentagon spokesman, said statement. “The space is necessary for the personnel and equipment who will support the POTUS at his residence in the building,” he said, using an acronym for president of the United States. Since the military aide cannot move into the three-story apartment that Mr. Trump shares with his wife, Melania, and son Barron, that leaves looking to lease space elsewhere in the building. The Defense Department did not say how much it would pay for the space. Leasing agents say a floor in Trump Tower can rent for $1.5 million a year, but it was unclear whether the Pentagon would rent that much space. One possibility would be for the Pentagon to lease a condominium from a resident in the building who owns the space. Renting space from a president is not without precedent. The Secret Service paid Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. $2,200 a month to rent a cottage adjacent to his home in a Wilmington, Del., suburb. The Secret Service also has an arrangement in Trump Tower. Administration officials declined to comment on why the two agencies could not share the space. "
203,An Orchestra Triumphs Over Trump’s Travel Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/arts/music/budapest-festival-orchestra-triumphs-over-trumps-travel-ban.html?searchResultPosition=79,2017/02/08,MUSIC,"The Budapest Festival Orchestra and its conductor, Ivan Fischer, gave two of the freshest, least conventional Beethoven performances of the season at Lincoln Center this week. Music students unexpectedly rushed the stage to join them in a soaring section of the Fifth Symphony, and incognito choristers popped up among the audience members to sing the Ninth’s “Ode to Joy.” But the high-energy concerts — part of a five-city American tour that concludes on Sunday in Boston — were briefly thrown into doubt by President Trump’s chaotically instituted travel ban. As the orchestra prepared to leave Hungary last week, it was informed that one of its cellists, a longtime Hungarian citizen, would not be allowed to enter the United States because he also held citizenship in Iraq, one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries named in the ban. Mr. Fischer — who has become known as a voice for tolerance and inclusion as his native Hungary has embraced nationalist and staunchly anti-immigrant policies under the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban — suddenly found himself having to make the case for openness to United States officials, whom he called to protest. “It struck a nerve in me, a very strong feeling that I will never allow anybody to single out a musician in my orchestra and disadvantage that person because of their origin, skin color, religion or any other factor,” Mr. Fischer said in an interview at his hotel on Tuesday. Mr. Fischer, 66, who is Jewish and lost grandparents in the Holocaust, said that he had often thought of Jewish musicians’ being singled out and removed from leading orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic, during the Nazi period, some being exiled and some killed. “Having learned this lesson,” he said, “I have a very strong determination not to allow that ever to happen.” "

hen The New York Times decided to expand in Australia, a rift with the United States seemed about as likely as a 25-point Super Bowl comeback. Enter Donald Trump. You’ve probably already read about his phone call with Prime Minister Turnbull: the brevity of the exchange; President Trump’s rejection of a deal that would bring up to 1,250 refugees to the U.S. from Australia’s detention centers in Manus and Nauru. If you want to see who those refugees really are, watch this Times video, or just look at the photo above of Behrouz Boochani, a dissident from Iran. “Behrouz is intense when you first meet him,” said Ashley Gilbertson, the Australian photographer who shot this portrait on Manus island. “The intensity in many people wears off after first meeting — not Behrouz.” If you want more context, read Jane Perlez, writing from Beijing about how that combative call — along with Mr. Trump’s rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — threatens to push Australia closer to China.

One minute reporters are clamoring to chat up Bradley Cooper or ask J. Law about her dress, the next they are presented with a genocide survivor, a soldier ravaged by war, or a Congolese park ranger who risks life and limb to protect the last of an endangered species. If the red carpet doubles as a popularity contest — and it does — celebrities win, hands down. But this year’s batch of documentary makers and their subjects might find themselves in a brighter spotlight because of the increasingly heated political climate. Five of the 10 feature-length and short documentaries nominated for Oscars are directly or indirectly about refugees. Three of them trace the perilous paths of desperate migrants; a fourth is about Syrian rescuers who search for people buried alive in bombed buildings; and a fifth is about a Holocaust survivor who arrived on America’s shores seven decades ago. Several of the documentarians wanted to bring their subjects to the Oscar ceremony, but plans were upended by President Trump’s order banning travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. With the ban’s fate tied up in the courts, their attendance remains uncertain. So, the Bagger asked the filmmakers and a few subjects, too: Given the uproar over refugee issues fueled by the controversial ban, what would your message be if you found yourself on the Oscar stage?

The explosion of indignation, mockery and free publicity that greeted Tuesday night’s move to prevent Senator Warren from reading a letter about Senator Jeff Sessions written by Coretta Scott King resonates with so many women precisely because they have been there, over and over again. At a meeting where you speak up, only to be cut off by a man. Where your ideas are ignored until a man repeats them and then they are pure genius — or, simply, acknowledged. Being interrupted or ignored, and being one of the few women in the room, can be both inhibiting and enraging. You check your own perception: Was I being too aggressive, or did I really have a point? Is this about being a woman, or something else? Raising questions of a double standard, male Democratic senators including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jeff Merkley of Oregon later read into the record the very same letter that Senator Warren was reading when the Senate voted, along strict party lines, to ban her from further debate on the nomination of Mr. Sessions as attorney general. The firestorm came as liberal women have placed themselves in the vanguard of opposition to the administration of President Trump. Casting him as anti-woman, they cite the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, when Mr. Trump boasted of forcing himself on women; his comments that women who criticized him were ugly and overweight; a cabinet with four women in a sea of men; and policies including restricting access to abortion and contraception.

207,"Donald Trump, Middle-School President",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/donald-trump-middle-school-president.html?searchResultPosition=83,2017/02/08,OPINION,"Any parent who has had children in middle school is familiar with their teenage excuses. First, they complain that the teachers are mean and assign too much homework, then that the reading is boring, and then when all else fails, they give you that aggrieved look and whine, “It’s tooooo haaaaard.” The point is that whatever happens, it’s someone else’s fault. It’s annoying when it comes from a 13-year-old. When it comes from the president of the United States and his team, it’s downright terrifying. In a chilling article in The Times this week, Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman described President Trump’s Keystone Kops White House where aides meet in the dark because they can’t figure out how to use the light switches (setting them to “on” might be worth trying), and Trump wanders around his living quarters in his bathrobe watching CNN and obsessing about how mean everyone is to him. When his executive order putting Steve Bannon into the top circle of the National Security Council drew howls of protest, Trump got mad — because, Thrush and Haberman reported, he had not been fully briefed on the order before he signed it. Not fully briefed? Didn’t Trump think he should at least have a conversation about the ramifications of setting aside a seat in the Situation Room for a purely political aide with no known national security credentials? (And no, Bannon’s seven years as a junior Navy officer do not amount to national security expertise.) Did Bannon just write the order himself without telling Trump what was in it? Apparently there was not sufficient discussion of the anti-Muslim refugee and visa ban, either. Maybe the White House got overloaded with math homework or finding the light switches and couldn’t get to it. Nor was there time to discuss an order that gave the Central Intelligence Agency the power to go back into the “black site” prison business, or one that rolled back protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. (The first was revised and the second, apparently, scrapped.) "

The prize is given annually to a “critically acclaimed writer whose body of work helps us understand and interpret the human condition,” according to PEN America’s news release. While the prize has mostly gone to novelists, including Salman Rushdie and Toni Morrison, Mr. Sondheim has made an undeniable impact on the last 60 years of culture by writing musicals including “West Side Story,” “Sweeney Todd” and “Company.” And the precedent for giving a literary award to a musical artist was strengthened last year, when Bob Dylan accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature. “Stephen Sondheim has really given voice to complex aspects of the human spirit: to nuance, to psychology, to inner voices,” Andrew Solomon, president of PEN America, said in a phone interview. “His work points to the significance of living a moral life, and that’s never felt more urgent than right now.” Mr. Sondheim will be honored by PEN on April 25 at the American Museum of Natural History, with Meryl Streep presenting the prize. She starred in the 2014 film adaptation of Mr. Sondheim’s “Into the Woods,” and received an Oscar nomination for her role. This weekend Mr. Sondheim’s work will be back on Broadway, with a revival of the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Sunday in the Park with George” starring Jake Gyllenhaal. And he’s working on a new musical inspired by the works of Luis Buñuel, tentatively slated to arrive at the Public Theater sometime this year. J. K. Rowling, the creator of the Harry Potter books, received the award last year; she spent part of her acceptance remarks defending Donald J. Trump’s right to free speech, while nevertheless calling him “offensive and bigoted.” "

The complication is that the advancing forces — the Syrian Army and pro-government militias backed by Russia, and Syrian rebels backed by Turkey — are sworn enemies. Their simultaneous race to seize the city, Al Bab, has turned into a test of how a global realignment of powers supporting Syria’s antagonists could help reshape or end the nearly six-year-old conflict. Al Bab, which had roughly 100,000 people when the war began in 2011, is the last urban area held by the Islamic State west of its de facto capital, Raqqa, where the group remains entrenched. Russia and Turkey have swerved in recent months from outright hostility to working more closely in a diplomatic effort aimed at resolving the conflict, after fitful and repeated failures led by the United Nations and the United States. But in the battle for Al Bab, Russia and Turkey must transform their newfound understanding into results on the ground, with the ambitious goal of pushing their Syrian partners into de facto military cooperation. Otherwise they risk creating a new flash point. "

Though the order, issued on Jan. 27, has been blocked in a federal court, and citizens of the affected countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may resume travel, Americans may not be able to enter Iran as tourists for the next few months. Wilderness Travel, which is based in Berkeley, Calif., canceled its April and May departures after its Iranian counterparts advised the company that Iran is presently not issuing travel visas to Americans. “No visas will be issued for American citizens for the next 90 days, and it is not clear what will happen after that date,” Barbara Banks, the director of marketing and new trip development for Wilderness Travel, said in an email. “The increase of interest in travel to Iran had been a wonderful development; cultural exchange and understanding is the foundation for a peaceful world. We hope that this unfortunate situation will be resolved, and look forward to an end to the travel restrictions on both sides.” SmarTours, based in New York, had begun selling its first trips to Iran in January. It has canceled its initial July departure, but it hopes to begin monthly departures in August. “We are confident that we will be able to send lots of travelers to Iran in 2017,” Greg Geronemus, the co-chief executive of SmarTours, said in an email. “The strong push back from the judicial system in the U.S. gives us confidence that the executive order will not hold up, and our conversations with our partners in Iran clearly suggest that Iran will reverse its reciprocal ban once matters are settled in the U.S.” Abercrombie & Kent had scheduled four departures this year of its 12-day trip to Iran, with the first coming in May. The company has canceled the May trip, citing visa uncertainty. A company representative said most of those guests booked in May have expressed interest in a fall trip, and Abercrombie & Kent still plans to have departures in September and October. Other tour companies such as Intrepid Travel and Cox & Kings have said they will continue to offer Iran trips, which are popular with foreign travelers who are not American. Mir Corporation, a Seattle-based tour operator that has been guiding trips in Iran for nearly 20 years, has not canceled its small-group trips for spring continues to sell its fall departures . Until recent events, Iran was viewed by many travel companies as an emerging destination for American travelers keen to visit ancient ruins and ornate mosques. "

Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, survived a near-party-line vote, 52 to 47, in the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Mr. Trump strains to install his cabinet. No Republicans broke ranks in their support of a colleague who will become the nation’s top law enforcement official after two decades in the Senate. But the confirmation process — ferocious even by the standards of moldering decorum that have defined the body’s recent years — laid bare the Senate’s deep divisions at the outset of the Trump presidency. At the same time, the treatment of Ms. Warren, who was forced to stop speaking late Tuesday after criticizing Mr. Sessions from the Senate floor, rekindled the gender-infused politics that animated the presidential election and the women’s march protesting Mr. Trump the day after his inauguration last month. Mr. Sessions cast his final vote as a senator to note that he was present for Wednesday’s tally. His confirmation was met by applause from his colleagues, including a few Democrats, on the Senate floor. “I can’t express how appreciative I am for those of you who stood by me during this difficult time,” Mr. Sessions said shortly after the vote. “By your vote tonight, I have been given a real challenge. I’ll do my best to be worthy of it.” "

There will surely be other unqualified cabinet nominees confirmed by the Republican-held Senate. Unqualified in the most fundamental sense: The president’s selections are men and women who, with few exceptions, want to eviscerate the very departments they are being asked to lead. This is a troubling time in America. Our democracy is being put to the test. The history books will record that not only did our 45th president play fast and loose with our constitutional rights and the rule of law, but that the Republican-held Congress rolled over and put party above country. To those who seek to demoralize us, please know that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights of the United States of America will be our guiding light. JILL NEWBERGER Downers Grove, Ill. To the Editor: After hearing the disheartening news that Betsy DeVos was confirmed as the education secretary, I doubt that the 50 Republican senators who voted for her and Vice President Mike Pence would choose a starkly unqualified doctor, dentist or teacher for their children or grandchildren. Nevertheless, they voted for someone who does not have the basic knowledge or experience in public education, choosing to deny the best possible services for American children. The Republicans stood their ground. Shame on them. JUDITH O’BRIEN  Yarmouth Port, Mass. To the Editor: President Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, claims to be a champion of “school choice,” but African-Americans are wary of the term. We recall that it was once a ploy to avoid school integration and deny minority students a quality education. Instead of more charter schools, we need to adequately fund and staff existing non-charter public schools. HOSEA L.

This reminded me that in the world’s first democracy, citizens of Athens gathered in huge numbers to laugh at Aristophanes’ biting satire of that city’s officials and notables. And, according to legend, when an actor playing Socrates made fun of the philosophic gadfly from the stage, the real Socrates rose from his seat and pointed to his own face to confirm that, indeed, the likeness was good. Maybe Mr. Trump can find a way to show the public and his celebrity impersonators that he’s a good sport and really understands how democracy works. Even kings had official jesters to remind them of their humanity. Perhaps instead of speaking truth to power, if more people — yes, even journalists — would erupt in laughter at Mr. Trump, he might become a better person and a better president.

While the 25-minute interview touched on issues like the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary and President Trump’s relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the bulk of it focused on Mr. Trump’s criticism of the media and the administration’s penchant for repeating falsehoods. The interview was frequently testy, and Mr. Tapper’s performance was widely praised by those seeking a more aggressive approach to fact-checking the Trump administration. But then Axios, citing an anonymous source, reported that Mr. Tapper would now likely be a target for “hit pieces” from at least one conservative news site. The New York Times was unable to independently verify the report. Mr. Tapper appeared to welcome the critics, posting on Twitter that he would just wait for “attack dogs” to come at him. "

But until the start-up begins trading, that honor will briefly belong to Jose Cuervo. The world’s biggest tequila maker announced the price range for its stock offering on Wednesday, seeking up to 15.3 billion pesos, or $742 million, in proceeds. Factor in the “greenshoe,” Wall Street parlance for additional shares set aside to cover exceptional investor demand, and Cuervo is hoping to raise 17.5 billion pesos from its initial offering. In a regulatory filing with the Mexican Stock Exchange, Cuervo’s parent company, Becle, said it intends to sell Cuervo’s shares between 30 pesos and 34 pesos each. At the midpoint of that range, Cuervo is set to finally begin trading this week after having hired Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase last year to work on the deal. Since then, the company has had to weather volatility in the Mexican stock market, including turmoil that arose after Donald J. Trump’s election and subsequent questions about American-Mexican trade relations. By seeking to go public, Becle is finally seeking a stock listing for its two-century-old business, one that stretches back to José Antonio de Cuervo y Valdés receiving land in what is now Mexico from the king of Spain. Mr. Cuervo and his descendants in the Beckmann family have distilled tequila from the blue agave plants that sprout in the region of Tequila ever since. The Beckmanns are expected to retain control of the company even after the initial offering, though the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek is also expected to become a big investor through the stock sale. Cuervo is the biggest producer of tequila worldwide, with roughly a third of the global market for the spirit. "

And gave her a megaphone. Silenced on the Senate floor for condemning a peer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, emerged on Wednesday in a coveted role: the avatar of liberal resistance in the age of President Trump. Late on Tuesday, Senate Republicans voted to halt the remarks of Ms. Warren, already a lodestar of the left, after she criticized a colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, by reading a letter from Coretta Scott King. Instantly, the decision — led by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who invoked a rarely enforced rule prohibiting senators from impugning the motives and conduct of a peer — amplified Ms. Warren’s message and further inflamed the angry Senate debate over Mr. Sessions’ nomination. He was confirmed on Wednesday. For Ms. Warren’s supporters, it was the latest and most visceral example of a woman muzzled by men who seemed unwilling to listen. Critics saw something else: a senator who has rankled members of both parties with her nose for the spotlight lobbing a far-too-early salvo in the next presidential race. “A lot of that’s about 2020 politics,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, grumbled on MSNBC.

221,Review: CNN’s ‘History of Comedy’ Has Good Timing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/arts/television/review-cnn-history-of-comedy.html?searchResultPosition=76,2017/02/08,TELEVISION,"It’s probably just a coincidence of scheduling, but comedy seems to be in an introspective, somewhat defensive stretch. Last summer the documentary “Can We Take a Joke?,” a theatrical release, explored how hard it is to tell a joke these days without offending someone. Next month, another documentary, “The Last Laugh,” looks at similar issues. And on Thursday, CNN kicks off “The History of Comedy,” an eight-part docu-series full of illuminating perspectives on how far comedy has evolved — or, some might say, degenerated — over the decades. The CNN program would be enjoyable just for its wealth of vintage clips. The comedy scene today is so crowded and devoted to envelope-pushing that it’s easy to define it merely through the hot names of the moment. To watch this series is to remember — or, depending on your age, to be introduced to — earlier comics who were incendiary in their own way, in much less permissive times. The series is broken up by subjects, and Part 1 on Thursday night is devoted to ribaldry and raunchiness. An assortment of well-chosen current comics invoke the usual gods — Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor — as they talk about the storming of the censorship battlements, but they also note some less familiar figures. Those who know Redd Foxx only from his relatively mild 1970s sitcom, “Sanford and Son,” might be surprised at the snippets from the risqué comedy albums he was recording way back in the 1950s. The episode, which of course spends time on Carlin’s seven-dirty-words battle of the early 1970s, ends hilariously as some current comics — Sarah Silverman, Lewis Black, Penn and Teller, Patton Oswalt and more — try to list what the seven actually were. Turns out there are rather a lot more than seven. Next week’s installment, “The Funnier Sex,” traces the long struggle of female comics to be heard in the writers’ room and onstage. It, too, is full of archival material, well deployed to make clear just how stifling the environment was for a very long time and how bold the women were who broke through. Female comics today have acts full of audacious material, and the episode includes a delicious sampler, but the brashest line in the hour may come from Joan Rivers in an undated clip. "
222,Pentagon Unit Considered Setting Up a Secret Overseas Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/defense-department-secret-prisons.html?searchResultPosition=75,2017/02/08,U.S.,"WASHINGTON — As the Central Intelligence Agency was setting up its secret prisons overseas 15 years ago to interrogate terrorism suspects, a Defense Department unit was considering a proposal to establish a secret military prison abroad, according to previously undisclosed government documents. The proposal was presented in a 2002 memo written in part by Bruce Jessen, one of two psychologists who eventually helped create the C.I.A.’s “enhanced interrogation” program. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, recommended opening at least one secret overseas site where prisoners would be subjected to “constant sensory deprivation” and develop “ a profound sense of despair.” The military, though, did not act on the proposal for an “undisclosed non-U.S., unsuspected, secure location” to “hold, manage and exploit detainees.” The Department of Defense, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the extent to which the plan, which originated in the military’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was considered. Aside from sensory deprivation, the memo suggested that additional pressure tactics be permitted against prisoners, including those that “maximize cultural undesirability,” but it did not mention the brutal physical coercion techniques, such as waterboarding, later approved for use in the C.I.A. prisons. The memo is included among several government documents provided during the discovery process in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Spokane, Wash., against Dr. Jessen and the other psychologist, James E. Mitchell, by two former C.I.A. prisoners and the representative of a third man, who died in custody. "
223,Trump Assails Nordstrom for ‘Unfairly’ Dropping His Daughter Ivanka’s Line,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/business/ivanka-trump-nordstrom-tj-maxx.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/02/08,BUSINESS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family’s sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage — not his own family’s personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump’s products — a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores — the president took to Twitter to complain that “Ivanka has been treated so unfairly” by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then re-sent it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump’s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump’s products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the president’s tweet was not about business but about “an attack on his daughter.” "
224,California Today: Are We Getting Our Federal Taxes’ Worth?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/california-today-federal-taxes.html?searchResultPosition=109,2017/02/08,U.S.,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Calling California “out of control,” President Trump recently threatened to withhold federal funds from the state. In response, the State Senate leader, Kevin de León, said California was creating jobs faster than any state in the nation and paid more annually in federal taxes than it gets back. So what exactly do Californians get back per dollar paid in federal taxes? “There isn’t really a simple answer, unfortunately,” said Ann Hollingshead, a fiscal and policy analyst for the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. Part of the difficulty stems from the tangled web of money that flows between individuals, the state and the federal government. Perhaps the most cited figure comes from the Tax Foundation, a conservative group that found Californians got back about 78 cents in services per federal tax dollar paid in 2005. State analysts pointed out that the foundation’s figure is adjusted to include California’s share of the federal deficit. That, in effect, widens the gap between money out and money in. "

You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. After I used the phrase “must-read” in a recent column to describe Jonathan Chait’s work, a reader asked me which other journalists’ work I make a point of reading. It’s not a short list, and today I’ll add two names to it: David Frum, the former George W. Bush speechwriter who’s a senior editor at The Atlantic, and Ezra Klein, the founding editor of Vox. Yesterday, Klein published a column responding to Frum’s cover story in the current Atlantic. I highly recommend both. They revolve around what Frum calls “ominous indicators of a breakdown of the American political system.” The founders created a system in which Congress was supposed to act as the main check on the power of the president. But the polarization of politics, Frum writes, has meant that “Congress has increasingly become a check only on presidents of the opposite party.” I’d add that the radicalization of the Republican Party — playing games with the debt ceiling, refusing to consider a Supreme Court nominee, etc. — has made the problem especially acute with a Republican president. And Trump isn’t just any president. He is willing, even eager, to violate all kinds of long-held American values, threatening opponents, lying frequently and reveling in conflicts of interest. "
226,"In Istanbul, Surprise That Trump Towers Complex Is Linked to Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/world/middleeast/in-istanbul-surprise-that-trump-towers-complex-is-linked-to-trump.html?searchResultPosition=107,2017/02/08,MIDDLE EAST,"ISTANBUL — The mall was named for him. His name adorns signposts at the nearby metro station. It also looms from the sides of the twin skyscrapers that the mall sits beneath. Yet many of the diners, shoppers and store owners here at Trump Towers Istanbul on a recent evening could not quite believe that the complex — among the tallest buildings in one of the world’s largest predominantly Muslim cities — had anything to do with President Trump. Evin Sumeli, a 19-year-old training to be an anesthetist, was sitting down for a meal with her sister, Mizgin, 18, when she learned that Mr. Trump does indeed profit from the buildings. “O.K. — we’re leaving!” she declared. One floor below, Cigdem Turan, a cashier at a cosmetics store, was similarly surprised. “I actually asked people if he had anything to do with the building, but they said no,” said Ms. Turan, 25, who began working at Trump Towers early last fall. “My husband said it’s probably just a coincidence.” A coincidence, however, it is not. Technically, neither Mr. Trump nor the Trump Organization owns the property (or most of the other buildings featuring the Trump name outside the United States). But in 2010, Mr. Trump allowed the building’s Turkish owners, Dogan Holding, to brand it with his name, in exchange for a sizable fee. The total has not been disclosed, but campaign records show that by July 2015, Dogan Holding had paid Mr. Trump between $1 million and $5 million for the use of his name. It was the revelation of that deal that had the Sumeli sisters making for a premature exit. “Why should I respect a president who doesn’t respect my veil?” asked the younger Ms. Sumeli, who is studying child development. “We won’t be coming here again,” her elder sister added.

227,"ISIS Detainees May Be Held at Guantánamo, Document Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/guantanamo-islamic-state-detainees.html?searchResultPosition=106,2017/02/08,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Trump White House is nearing completion of an order that would direct the Pentagon to bring future Islamic State detainees to the Guantánamo Bay prison, despite warnings from national security officials and legal scholars that doing so risks undermining the effort to combat the group, according to administration officials and a draft executive order obtained by The New York Times. White House officials have detailed their thinking about a new detainee policy in an evolving series of drafts of an executive order being circulated among national security officials for comment. While previous versions have shown that the draft has undergone many changes — including dropping language about reviving C.I.A. prisons — the plan to add Islamic State detainees to the Guantánamo population has remained constant. The latest version of the draft, which circulated this week, would direct Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to use Guantánamo to detain suspected members of “Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, including individuals and networks associated with the Islamic State.” The White House has kept similar language in the draft order despite warnings from career government national security officials that carrying out its plan would give federal judges an opportunity to reject the executive branch’s theory that the war against the Islamic State is legal, even though Congress never explicitly authorized it. The issue could arise when reviewing an inevitable habeas corpus lawsuit filed by an ISIS detainee. The Obama administration first argued in late summer 2014 that the Islamic State was part of the existing armed conflict that Congress authorized in 2001 against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But while the Islamic State got its start as Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq more than a decade ago, that theory is disputed because the two groups later split and went to war with each other. "
228,When We Really Did Fear a Bowling Green Massacre,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/when-the-government-really-did-fear-a-bowling-green-massacre.html?searchResultPosition=105,2017/02/08,OPINION,"THE year was 2012. The place was Bowling Green, Ohio. A federal raid had uncovered what the authorities feared were the makings of a massacre. There were 18 firearms, among them two AR-15 assault rifles, an AR-10 assault rifle and a Remington Model 700 sniper rifle. There was body armor, too, and the authorities counted some 40,000 rounds of ammunition. An extremist had been arrested, and prosecutors suspected that he had been aiming to carry out a wide assortment of killings. “This defendant, quite simply, was a well-funded, well-armed and focused one-man army of racial and religious hate,” prosecutors said in a court filing. The man arrested and charged was Richard Schmidt, a middle-aged owner of a sports-memorabilia business at a mall in town. Prosecutors would later call him a white supremacist. His planned targets, federal authorities said, had been African-Americans and Jews. They’d found a list with the names and addresses of those to be assassinated, including the leaders of N.A.A.C.P. chapters in Michigan and Ohio. But Mr. Schmidt wound up being sentenced to less than six years in prison, after a federal judge said prosecutors had failed to adequately establish that he was a political terrorist, and he is scheduled for release in February 2018. The foiling of what the government worried was a credible plan for mass murder gained little national attention. For some concerned about America’s vulnerability to terrorism, the very real, mostly forgotten case of Richard Schmidt in Bowling Green, Ohio, deserves an important place in any debate about what is real and what is fake, what gets reported on by the news media and what doesn’t. Those deeply worried about domestic far-right terrorism believe United States authorities, across many administrations, have regularly underplayed the threat, and that the media has repeatedly underreported it. Perhaps we have become trapped in one view of what constitutes the terrorist threat, and as the case of Mr. Schmidt shows, that’s a problem. The notion of a “Bowling Green massacre,” of course, has been in the news recently. Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Trump, referred to it in justifying the president’s travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Ms. Conway had Bowling Green, Ky., in mind, but she eventually conceded there had been no massacre there. She meant, she said, to refer to the 2011 case of two Iraqi refugees who had moved to Kentucky and been convicted of trying to aid attacks on American military personnel in Iraq. One was sentenced to 40 years, the other to life in prison. "

The editor wrote an article, and the news rocketed through cyberspace. One link caught the eye of Mr. Trump himself, who shared it on his official Facebook page with a word of praise for the reported policy: “Smart!” But there was a problem: The Kuwait ban was from 2011, long before Mr. Trump announced a similar measure in the United States, said James Brownsell, the managing editor of The New Arab, the site that produced that article on Feb. 1. His writer did not notice that the news was years old. Many sites that often support Mr. Trump and also published the report, including Infowars.com and Russia’s Sputnik news agency, have since clarified that it was outdated and unrelated to Mr. Trump’s order. But by Tuesday night, his uncorrected posting had racked up more than 251,000 reactions, 68,000 shares and 15,000 comments, many by fans who see Kuwait’s supposed decision to follow Mr. Trump as a vindication of the president’s policy. “So you mean to tell me Muslims are banning Muslims from certain countries?” a user wrote under the name Christina Villar. “Then we have some Americans thinking our president is heartless. No, he is smart!” "
230,Supreme Court Nominee Calls Trump’s Attacks on Judiciary ‘Demoralizing’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/donald-trump-immigration-ban.html?searchResultPosition=103,2017/02/08,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump’s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president’s criticism of independent judges “demoralizing” and “disheartening.” The remarks by Judge Gorsuch, chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation’s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings “disgraceful” and described the courts as “so political.” Those remarks followed Mr. Trump’s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a “so-called judge” whose “ridiculous” ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump’s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even “a bad high school student would understand.” “This is highly unusual,” said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. “Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity.” "

Brian Sipe and Bernie Kosar were steady presences in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. Further back, Cleveland relied on the Hall of Famer Otto Graham for 10 seasons, and 10 championship game appearances. Those days are long gone. This week, the Browns released the 37-year-old Josh McCown, who started 11 games for them over the last two seasons. That ends yet another very brief quarterback era in Cleveland. Since the team re-formed in 1999, the Browns have started 26 quarterbacks, including two McCowns and someone named Spergon Wynn. And then there’s Johnny Manziel. Here’s a look at the team’s quarterback woes over the years. The Browns re-entered the N.F.L. hopefully, with the No. 1 overall draft pick Tim Couch as their quarterback. Couch started for four years, though he missed some time with injuries, which led to shots for Doug Pederson, now the coach of the Eagles; Ty Detmer; and, yes, Spergon Wynn. (The Browns lost the one game he started, 48-0, to the Jaguars.) Still, in 2001, Couch did start every game. No Browns quarterback has done so since. The team struggled at first, but managed a 9-7 season in 2002 and made the playoffs. They lost to the Steelers, 36-33. It turned out to be a high-water mark; they have not been back to the playoffs since. "

It criticized Mr. Sessions’s record on civil rights and said that elevating him to higher office would demean the record of Mrs. King’s husband, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The letter resurfaced last month, when BuzzFeed News reported that Senator Strom Thurmond, a Republican from South Carolina who was then the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had failed to enter it into the Congressional Record. On the same day as BuzzFeed’s report, The Washington Post obtained the letter and published it online. Three decades ago, the letter was credited with helping to derail Mr. Sessions’s nomination. On Tuesday, it became a rallying cry for Democrats who are opposed to his nod to become the United States attorney general. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, was trying to read the letter aloud in the Senate chamber when her fellow senators, accusing her of violating a rule that forbids one senator from demeaning another, invoked a law, forcing her to stop. The statement consists of two parts: a cover letter addressed to Mr. Thurmond, which Ms. Warren did not read aloud, and the statement, part of which Ms. Warren read on the Senate floor. She later read it in full on Facebook Live, uninterrupted. By Wednesday afternoon, her video had been viewed more than seven million times. "

He asked those present to pray with him “for our Rohingya brothers and sisters who are being chased from Myanmar and are fleeing from one place to another because no one wants them.” The pope urged Christians “to not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil, to overcome evil with good,” and added: “A Christian can never say, ‘I’ll make you pay for that.’ Never! That is not a Christian gesture.” The remarks were widely seen as a reference to President Trump’s vow to make Mexico pay for a wall along its border with the United States, though the pope did not mention Mr. Trump by name.

Every year since then, she has walked in and out of the meetings after a brief review of her case and some questions. But not this year. On Wednesday, immigration agents arrested Ms. Rayos, 35. Despite efforts by her family and others who tried to block, legally and physically, her removal from the United States, she was deported Thursday to Nogales, Mexico, the same city where she crossed into the United States 21 years ago. Immigration agents “said she’s a threat, but my wife isn’t a threat,” her husband said in an interview. As one of the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, Ms. Rayos was always a candidate for deportation, but as a matter of practicality, the Obama administration had focused its finite resources on removing the most serious criminals. The government even won a deportation order against Ms. Rayos in 2013, but had not carried it out, instead merely requiring her to check in periodically. "

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Under Armour’s Kevin Plank described Trump as “a real asset” to the country. In an interview on Wednesday with The San Jose Mercury News, Curry responded, “I agree with that description, if you remove the ‘et.’” Curry — the Golden State Warriors’ point guard and one of Under Armour’s highest-paid endorsers — expressed surprise at Plank’s comments, saying he had spent all day Tuesday speaking to representatives from Under Armour and his own advisers, “trying to understand what was going on and where everybody stood on the issue.” Plank’s comments also drew backlash on social media, with many expressing their displeasure using the hashtag #boycottUnderArmour. After a discussion between Curry and Plank, Under Armour released a statement Wednesday in an effort to clarify its chief executive’s remarks. The statement said that Plank’s comments to CNBC were about Trump’s business policies, not his social viewpoints. “We engage in policy, not politics,” the statement read. “We believe in advocating for fair trade, an inclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country, and tax reform that drives hiring to help create new jobs globally, across America and in Baltimore,” the company’s headquarters. The company’s response seemed to satisfy Curry, who endorsed the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Nevertheless, Curry, who is under contract with Under Armour through 2024, signaled his willingness to leave a company that did not align with his values by saying, “There is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off, if it wasn’t in line with who I am.” Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said he was proud of his players for speaking out on political and social issues. “This is a time when people are speaking out,” Kerr said. “This is a time when activism is into the forefront, all over the map.” "

The appointment is a step forward for Mrs. Trump, who has remained out of sight in Washington and seems to be staffing the East Wing from afar. According to a statement from the White House on Wednesday, Ms. Niceta Lloyd, who is known as Rickie, will be immersed in overseeing all social events and gatherings, including state dinners and the White House Easter Egg Roll. Ms. Niceta Lloyd, 46, has worked for over two decades as an account executive at the Washington event planning business Design Cuisine, where she has been the main coordinator of events at the State Department and for previous Republican and Democratic inaugurals. “Rickie brings with her over 22 years of solid diplomatic, political and social entertaining experience,” Mrs. Trump said in a statement. “I am looking forward to sharing my ideas and traditions of entertaining and social hospitality to America’s house, my new home as well. That, along with Rickie’s vast experience, I am even more excited.” Mrs. Trump is selecting as her envoy to the city’s social scene someone whose family has deep ties to the Washington establishment, a point the White House emphasized in its statement. In 2006, Ms. Niceta Lloyd married Thomas Lloyd, the grandson of Rachel Lambert Mellon, in Washington. Mrs. Mellon, known as Bunny, was the heiress, philanthropist and art collector who became famous for helping redesign the White House Rose Garden with Jacqueline Kennedy. So far, Mrs. Trump has offered few clues about her ambitions as first lady, although her debut fashion choice reflected a reverence for American design. On Inauguration Day she wore a Tiffany-blue dress and matching jacket by Ralph Lauren that channeled the classic American style closely associated with Mrs. Kennedy. "
237,Weak Reporting System Let Risky Surgical Device Stay in Use,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/health/morcellator-gao-report-fda.html?searchResultPosition=68,2017/02/08,HEALTH,"Doctors and hospitals failed to tell the Food and Drug Administration about cases in which cancer was spread around inside women’s bodies by a surgical tool used to operate on the uterus, according to a report issued on Wednesday by the Government Accountability Office. Scattering cancer cells worsens the disease and decreases a patient’s chances of long-term survival. Because information was lacking, the tool, called a power morcellator, was widely used for more than 20 years before the F.D.A. acted to limit it, after being alerted to the problem in 2013 by a patient who was harmed. The device, with a spinning blade that shreds tissue, was by then being used in at least 50,000 women a year in the United States to help remove benign uterine tumors called fibroids, or to remove the entire uterus. It had become a mainstay in minimally invasive surgery, slicing up tissue so it could be removed through tiny incisions. But some women with fibroids have undiagnosed cancers, and morcellation can spray malignant cells around inside the abdomen and pelvis like seeds, “upstaging” the disease to a more advanced and deadly form. Before 2013, the F.D.A. had received no reports of uterine cancers being disseminated by morcellators. But after the 2013 case, which was widely covered by the news media, reports began to pour in, and by September 2016 there were 285. Some of the women have died. The government report points out a major flaw in the system for detecting harm from drugs and devices like morcellators: It is passive, relying on “adverse event” reports to the F.D.A. from doctors, hospitals, drug and equipment manufacturers, and consumers.

No gratuitous insults, no personal threats or childish tantrum — only judges and lawyers debating complex legal issues with respect and restraint. It was the sound of grown-ups taking responsibility for governing the country, and for people’s lives. Contrast that with the unfiltered outbursts Americans have endured from President Trump in the chaotic days since he signed his slapdash order suspending entry for people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, and all refugees. Mr. Trump’s attacks on judges who questioned his order were too much even for his nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch of the federal appeals court in Denver. Judge Gorsuch called the comments “demoralizing” and “disheartening,” according to a senator with whom he met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Mr. Trump — who has a toddler’s aversion to the word “no” — berated a federal judge who temporarily blocked the order last week, calling him a “so-called” judge on Twitter. He then warned that the judge, and the entire court system, could be responsible for any future terrorist attacks that might occur. "
239,Travel Ban Could Be Just the Beginning of Upheaval for Airlines,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/business/air-traffic-control-privatization.html?searchResultPosition=70,2017/02/08,BUSINESS,"Airline executives were preparing to meet with President Trump on Thursday to discuss issues including jobs and international competition, a meeting that comes as the on-again, off-again enactment of his travel ban has had them scrambling. But even beyond the ban, executives and government officials expect Mr. Trump to be a disruptive influence on air travel. Some are concerned about an executive order seeking the elimination of two regulations for every new one enacted, which they say could have a negative effect on safety rules. They also await Mr. Trump’s thoughts on a proposal to privatize the air traffic control system, which has been run by the federal government since 1936. President Trump has not taken a position on a House Transportation Committee proposal to turn over more than 300 air traffic control facilities and 30,000 employees to a private nonprofit corporation run by executives nominated by aviation industry participants. Privatization would be the biggest change in the system since President Ronald Reagan fired 11,345 striking air traffic controllers in 1981, effectively killing their union. The Federal Aviation Administration had to spend three years restaffing after the striking workers were fired, and the system was hit with a personnel shortage 25 years later when those replacement workers became eligible for retirement. Overtime and six-day work weeks have been the norm since that time in busy areas, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Controllers complained that had affected safety and morale. While some airlines and the air traffic controllers association support privatization, not all F.A.A. work groups do. In size and complexity, the change would be even more difficult than in 1981, although the potential impact on safety has not been a significant part of the discussion. "

Mr. Trump’s remark came during a meeting at the White House with sheriffs from around the country. At one point, the president asked the sheriffs seated at a table around him if there were any pressing law enforcement issues they wanted to talk about. A Texas sheriff, Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, spoke up. “Mr. President, on asset forfeiture,” Sheriff Eavenson said, in an exchange that was observed by reporters and filmed, “we’ve got a state senator in Texas that was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive that forfeiture money, and I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation passed.” “Can you believe that?” Mr. Trump responded, then added, “Who’s the state senator?” Sheriff Eavenson did not reply. “Do you want to give his name?” Mr. Trump said. “We’ll destroy his career.” Laughter then broke out. It remained unclear which Texas state senator Sheriff Eavenson was talking about. The sheriff, one of the top officials in a county about 25 miles east of Dallas, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. The state senator who represents Rockwall County, Bob Hall, a Republican, also did not respond to requests for comment. According to The Texas Tribune, Mr. Hall told reporters on Tuesday at the state Capitol in Austin that he had “no idea” if he was the senator the sheriff was referring to, but said he had a “very good relationship” with the sheriff.

241,Yemen Backtracks on Suspending U.S. Raids After Civilian Casualties,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/world/middleeast/yemen-raid-american-military.html?searchResultPosition=72,2017/02/08,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — Yemen’s government said on Wednesday that it had requested a “reassessment” of an American commando raid last month that killed several women and children and closer coordination on future operations, but said that it had not suspended future raids by United States Special Operations forces. Citing American officials, The New York Times had reported on Tuesday that Yemeni authorities, angry about the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first counterterrorism operation authorized by President Trump, had withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country. But on Wednesday, Yemeni officials publicly backtracked somewhat from what they had told White House officials, caught between the public outrage at home over civilian deaths and fear of losing American counterterrorism assistance. When asked about The Times report on Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, did not deny that American commando missions had been suspended. Referring to the Yemenis, Mr. Spicer said that “we’re going to continue to work with them to strengthen our diplomatic relationship, to understand our fight against terrorism.” In Cairo, however, Yemen’s foreign minister, Abdul Malik al-Mekhlafi, called for the review of the operation, in which one American commando and some 14 fighters of Al Qaeda died, adding that “Yemen continues to cooperate with the United States and continues to abide by all the agreements.” Yemen’s embassy in Washington said in a statement that it had not suspended any counterterrorism programs with the United States. But hinting that Yemeni leaders were not fully informed in advance about the mission, the embassy also said that “any counterterrorism operations carried out in Yemen should continue to be in consultation with Yemeni authorities and have precautionary measures to prevent civilian casualties.” The raid, which suffered a number of failings and faced unexpected resistance, was an early test of Mr. Trump’s national security decision-making — and his willingness to rely on the assurances of his military advisers. His aides say that even though the decision was made over a dinner, it had been fully vetted and had the required legal approvals. "

Born in New York, Mr. Johnson, 52, held dual citizenship until last year. He had long complained about having to pay taxes in the United States even though he was 5 when he last lived there. Unlike most countries, the United States taxes nationals who live abroad on their worldwide income. According to British news reports, as recently as 2015, he settled a hefty capital gains tax bill on the sale of his north London home — after claiming that he wouldn’t pay. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2014, he described the “doctrine of global taxation” applied by the United States as “incredible.” With a disheveled shock of blond hair, sharp wit and clipped accent, Mr. Johnson sometimes seems like a caricature of the private-school-educated Briton. Although he did indeed graduate from Eton and Oxford, he has Turkish and Russian ancestors, and his early education took place in Brussels. He was appointed foreign secretary last summer after Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum. Mr. Johnson, a Conservative, has not been known for his diplomatic skills. His relations with Donald J. Trump took a blow in December 2015, when he accused Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, of being “out of his mind” and of “a quite stupefying ignorance” that made him unfit for the presidency. After Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Johnson swiftly changed course, suggesting in November that “there’s a lot to be positive about.” He added, “It’s very important not to prejudge the president-elect or his administration.” As mayor of London, Mr. Johnson cultivated the image of an endearing bumbler and came across like a comedian. But underneath that image was a quick mind with a shrewd political acumen. It was during his tenure that London hosted the 2012 Olympic Games. He has known former Prime Minister David Cameron since they were schoolboys, and many were surprised that he swung behind the so-called Brexit campaign, opposing Mr. Cameron. Mr. Johnson’s name appeared on a Treasury Department list of 5,411 people who gave up their American citizenship in 2016. As The Wall Street Journal reported, he is listed as Alexander Boris Johnson, a shortened version of his full birth name, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. "

The completion of the factory, which will complement two other Intel semiconductor plants in Chandler, Ariz., had been under consideration for several years. Standing beside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, said the company had decided to proceed now because of “the tax and regulatory policies we see the administration pushing forward.” Mr. Trump said: “The people of Arizona will be very happy. It’s a lot of jobs.” He said Intel called the White House several weeks ago to coordinate the announcement. That outreach illustrates the tightrope that Silicon Valley companies are walking as they deal with a president most of them did not want to see in office. Intel was one of nearly 130 companies that signed a legal brief challenging Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order temporarily blocking the entry of all refugees and of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Earlier, Mr. Krzanich criticized the order on Twitter, declaring, “As a company co-founded by an immigrant, we support lawful immigration.” (Intel’s third employee and longtime chief executive, Andrew S. Grove, survived the Holocaust and arrived in the United States after fleeing the Soviet invasion of his native Hungary in 1956.) Yet Intel, like Apple and other large technology companies, also supports the Trump administration’s plans to reduce corporate taxes and regulations. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Krzanich planned and then canceled a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump. "

Her role highlights the close ties between President Trump’s family and the family that controls Fox News Channel, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets. Ms. Trump, the president’s daughter, stepped down in December as a Murdoch trustee, a relationship reported on Wednesday by The Financial Times. The trust for the Murdoch daughters holds some $300 million in stock in News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, companies that Mr. Murdoch, 85, leads, and in which he and his family hold controlling interests. Mr. Trump has been a favorite topic of Mr. Murdoch’s New York Post for decades, and in the years before last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump had a regular morning call-in segment on Fox News. During the campaign and since the election, Fox News has covered him far more favorably than its competitors. Mr. Murdoch has two daughters, ages 15 and 13, with his former wife, Wendi, 48. It was Wendi Murdoch who chose Ms. Trump, 35, as a trustee, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The two women have long been close, and their friendship has continued since the Murdochs’ 2013 divorce. Ms. Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, served as a conduit between the Trump campaign and Mr. Murdoch. "

Trump’s presidency has galvanized political activism to a level of passion not seen since the civil rights movement. Far less clear is what you can do in reaction to the Trump administration’s changes. And in an era that promises instant gratification — like cars, couriers and food summoned to your driveway with the tap of a smartphone app — you might think tech is a quick and easy solution to becoming a political activist. But it turns out software and web tools can go only so far. “Sitting behind your computer is not going to be as effective as showing up for people where they really need it,” said Joshua Tauberer, the creator of GovTrack, a popular web tool for tracking legislation. “Government is people.” At best, tech is an excellent resource for staying on top of political activities. But at some point, you will have to go outside or pick up the phone and engage with people, like fellow citizens and members of Congress. That’s not to say tech is powerless. Opponents of Mr. Trump’s immigration ban, for example, used Twitter and Facebook to rally thousands of people for protests at the nation’s airports last month. Similarly, protesters used social media platforms to help coordinate the Jan. 21 women’s marches, which by one account constituted the largest day of demonstrations in American history. But what else can you do besides following news and events on Twitter and Facebook? What follows is a guide to some of the most useful resources and tools I uncovered after interviews with tech-skilled activists. "

A federal judge has blocked the proposed $48 billion merger of Anthem and Cigna, soon after another judge did the same to the $37 billion deal between Aetna and Humana. In the latest ruling, the judge found that the deal between Anthem and Cigna would most likely harm customers, push up prices and eliminate competition. Anthem now owes Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee. It’s worth noting this was not exactly a match made in heaven. Court documents showed that the two companies had accused each other of breaching their agreement. They had argued that the merger would create billions of dollars in savings, but the government countered that such savings required the companies to cooperate in integrating their businesses. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, once promised to do whatever it took to save the euro.

For family members of the dead, the disclosures deepened frustrations about why no action was taken before the warehouse was consumed by flames during a party on Dec. 2 in one of the deadliest structure fires in United States history. A few of the most significant revelations from the documents: • The warehouse and neighboring lot had been subject to 39 code enforcement inspections since 2004. It was unclear whether inspectors ever entered the building. • The Police Department responded 19 times to the warehouse and neighboring lot, and the Fire Department went four times. "

Iranians have taken notice. “We thank Americans who stood up for the seven countries blocked from entering the US by the new travel ban,” one popular Iranian Twitter account stated, with the hashtag #LoveBeyondFlags. The Twitter user added that the theme of #LoveBeyondFlags resonated from the Azadi Tower, a landmark at the western entrance of Tehran, to the Statue of Liberty in New York. The tower’s name can be translated as “freedom.” Other social media users shared images of Iranian and American wrestlers clasped in embrace, and of protesters who have thronged airports to welcome citizens of Iran and the other six countries — Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — who had managed to enter the United States.

251,How the Trump Gag Rule Threatens Women’s Lives in Nepal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/how-the-trump-gag-rule-threatens-womens-lives-in-nepal.html?searchResultPosition=40,2017/02/09,OPINION,"One January morning in 2002, I met 15-year-old Sita Tamang in a prison in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Her boyfriend, who had promised marriage, made her pregnant. Afterward, he gave her a pill to make her “feel stronger.” The pill aborted her pregnancy. Ms. Tamang was still delirious with pain and shock when the police arrested her and charged her with infanticide. A court gave her a life sentence. In the late 1990s, 80 Nepali women were in prison for having undergone an abortion. It took Nepali activists three decades of advocacy to change the abortion laws. In March 2002, Nepal legalized abortion. Over the next two years, the women imprisoned for abortion were granted amnesty and released. Nepal had a very high maternal mortality rate. For every 100,000 live births, 539 women died in 1996. Unsafe abortion was seen to be one of the reasons. Most women had little or no access to any health care during pregnancy or delivery. A poor country torn by a decade of insurgency, Nepal relied on outside help to provide health care, and the United States was the largest donor. On Jan. 20, 2001, President George W. Bush assumed office. On that very first day in the White House, he imposed the “global gag rule,” which stopped United States government funding to overseas organizations that provide abortions or counseling on abortions. As soon as abortion became legal in Nepal, the Family Planning Association of Nepal, the largest organization providing contraceptives, lost part of its American funding. It was doing pioneering work in expanding awareness of reproductive health and contraceptive use in Nepal. FPAN refused to renounce counseling or referrals on abortion. It was forced to lay off 60 health workers and give up its mobile health clinics on reproductive health in rural areas, and its capacity to provide contraceptives was substantially impaired. The group didn’t use American funds for abortion or abortion counseling, but it worked with government hospitals and clinics that provided the procedure. At some clinics that received United States funding, “we had to build walls” to comply with the gag rule, recalled Shyam Thapa, a social scientist who advised the United States Agency for International Development. The walls separated the American-funded family planning section from the section providing abortion counseling. "
252,Trump Pushes Australia Toward China,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/trump-pushes-australia-toward-china.html?searchResultPosition=39,2017/02/09,OPINION,"CANBERRA, Australia — The United States-Australia alliance faces a crucial test over how to deal with a powerful and increasingly assertive China. Under President Trump, it is already failing. The phone call last week between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in which the president denounced a refugee deal made between the United States and Australia under President Obama, showed Australians that they can no longer trust America. As a result of Mr. Trump’s approach, Australia will drift away from America and move closer to China. Mr. Obama’s ineffectual “pivot to Asia” undermined confidence among Australians that Washington had the resolve to resist Beijing’s ambitions, or the finesse to do so without provoking a war. Mr. Trump is making that worse. No one in Australia wants this to happen. Australia has benefited as much as any other country from the peace and stability that American leadership has brought to Asia. No country feels closer to America in its core values. But China has become extraordinarily important to Australia economically. China is by far the biggest market for Australia, the destination for more than 30 percent of its exports, and the trade balance remains strongly in Australia’s favor. Sales to China are five times that to America. As its economic clout has increased, China has become more assertive politically, seeking to displace the United States as Asia’s leading power. It has built China-centered regional economic institutions like the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, and challenged American military superiority with forays into the East and South China Seas and by bullying American allies in the region.

In a statement, the White House said Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi “discussed numerous topics, and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our One China policy.” It described the call as “extremely cordial” and said the leaders had invited each other to visit. The concession was clearly designed to put an end to an extended chill in the relationship between China and the United States. Mr. Xi, stung by Mr. Trump’s unorthodox telephone call with the president of Taiwan in December and his subsequent assertion that the United States might no longer abide by the One China policy, had not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected. Administration officials concluded that Mr. Xi would take a call only if Mr. Trump publicly committed to upholding the 44-year-old policy, under which the United States recognized a single Chinese government in Beijing and severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Given the domestic political stakes of this issue for Mr. Xi, the fact that both sides went ahead with a call – and that the White House statement afterward acknowledged Mr. Trump’s acquiescence – suggested that the agreement on “one China” had been worked out beforehand. The Chinese state news media, in its readout of the call, said Mr. Trump had “stressed that he fully understood the great importance for the U.S. government to respect the One China policy,” and that “the U.S. government adheres to the One China policy.” "

255,Wind Power Surpasses Hydroelectric in a Crucial Measure,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/business/energy-environment/wind-energy-renewable.html?searchResultPosition=36,2017/02/09,ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT,"The wind industry crossed an important threshold in the United States last year, exceeding the generating capacity of hydroelectric power for the first time, according to the main industry trade group, the American Wind Energy Association. The nation’s fleet of dams has long stood as the top renewable energy source, but there has been little market interest in building more big hydroelectric generating stations. In the meantime, wind has rapidly expanded — more than tripling in capacity since 2008 — with many more installations on the way. The comparison here is limited, measuring the maximum amount of power that generating stations are rated to produce — a threshold few, if any, ever meet. According to the Energy Information Administration, conventional hydroelectric generating capacity stood at 78,956 megawatts in 2015, while wind, the industry group says, reached 82,183 megawatts last year, about enough to run 24 million average American homes. (The hydroelectric figure does not include pumped storage, in which water pumped to an elevated reservoir can be released through a turbine to generate electricity when needed.) But hydroelectric power could still lead in terms of actual production: According to the Energy Information Administration’s most recent annual electric power report, hydroelectric edged out wind in terms of power sent to the grid by roughly 30 percent in 2015, though both forms trailed fossil fuels and nuclear power by wide margins. Any power plant’s potential output can be diminished by a number of factors, including market conditions that render its electricity uneconomical, shutdowns to fix or maintain equipment, orders to curtail unneeded production from system operators and fuel shortages. This is particularly the case for renewable energy sources, whose fuel depends on ever-shifting weather patterns to keep clouds from shading the sun, fill rivers with water and make the winds blow. "

That’s the trail that companies in Silicon Valley are now trying to find. The difficulty was on full display on Wednesday when Intel held an event with the president to announce it will complete an unfinished manufacturing plant in Arizona, just days after it joined nearly 130 other technology companies in a legal brief denouncing Mr. Trump’s immigration ban. For Intel, as for other companies trying to figure out the new political landscape, there are many competing factors to consider. On the one hand, there could be a lot to gain in working with Mr. Trump. As Vindu Goel writes, Intel is in favor of the Trump administration’s tax cut plan. Intel, a company that manufactures a lot of goods in the United States, can also tag along with Mr. Trump’s overall message of revitalizing American manufacturing. But it is a tricky path. Workers in the tech industry overwhelmingly opposed Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and have shown outrage over his immigration ban. The danger for companies that decide to work with Mr. Trump is a revolt from within — from valuable employees who could easily jump ship to other tech firms if they don’t see their bosses being responsive to their concerns. But if its workers aren’t offended, Intel will have won the day: a new plant, some White House-fueled marketing and a promise to employees to fight the president on the issues they really care about. A win for everyone, just as Mr. Trump once promised. "

John W. Nicholson said in a sober assessment of America’s longest war to the Senate Armed Services Committee . The international force that is helping the Afghans currently has 13,300 troops, 8,400 of whom are American. Afghan forces have taken heavy casualties over the last year as they have sought to hold off the Taliban and prevent them from capturing provincial capitals. General Nicholson repeated previous assessments that the sanctuary Taliban fighters and militant groups enjoy in Pakistan remains a major obstacle. “It is very difficult to succeed on the battlefield when your enemy enjoys external support and safe haven,” said the commander, who added that the United States needed to do a “a holistic review” of its policy toward Pakistan. The issue of safe havens in Pakistan also was discussed Thursday when the new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, spoke by telephone with Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, Pakistan’s chief of army staff. In the conversation, “Gen. Bajwa reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to counter all militant groups operating in its territory,” according to a Pentagon statement. "
259,Trump May Turn to Arab Allies for Help With Israeli-Palestinian Relations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/middleeast/trump-arabs-palestinians-israel.html?searchResultPosition=31,2017/02/09,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers, venturing for the first time into the fraught world of Middle East peacemaking, are developing a strategy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would enlist Arab nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to break years of deadlock. The emerging approach mirrors the thinking of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who will visit the United States next week, and would build on his de facto alignment with Sunni Muslim countries in trying to counter the rise of Shiite-led Iran. But Arab officials have warned Mr. Trump and his advisers that if they want cooperation, the United States cannot make life harder for them with provocative pro-Israel moves. The White House seems to be taking the advice. Mr. Trump delayed his plan to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem after Arab leaders told him that doing so would cause angry protests among Palestinians, who also claim the city as the capital of a future state. And after meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan last week, Mr. Trump authorized a statement that, for the first time, cautioned Israel against building new West Bank settlements beyond existing lines. “There are some quite interesting ideas circulating on the potential for U.S.-Israeli-Arab discussions on regional security in which Israeli-Palestinian issues would play a significant role,” said Robert Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “I don’t know if this is going to ripen by next week, but this stuff is out there.” The discussions underscore the evolution of the new president’s attitude toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as he delves deeper into the issue. During the campaign and the postelection transition, Mr. Trump presented himself as an unstinting supporter of Israel who would quickly move the embassy and support new settlement construction without reservation. But he has tempered that to a degree. The notion of recruiting Arab countries to help forge an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians — known as the “outside-in” approach — is not a new one. As secretary of state under President George Bush, James A. Baker III organized the first regional conference in 1991 at which Arab leaders sat down with Israel’s prime minister. President George W. Bush invited Arab leaders to a summit meeting with Israel in Annapolis, Md., in 2007. And President Barack Obama’s first special envoy, George Mitchell, spent months in 2009 trying to enlist Arab partners in a joint effort. "

This time, though, the benefactor isn’t the United States. It is China. The Chinese government is financing and subsidizing $1 trillion in spending, mostly in low-income countries around the world. The initiative includes the creation of a modern rail network for Africa, intended to “transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another,” as Andrew Jacobs of The Times reported from Djibouti this week. To see some of the joy that’s resulted from the opening of new train lines, watch the video that accompanies the story. It’s a wonderful development in many ways. It’s also a reminder of China’s rising strategic challenge to the United States. The Silk Road initiative gives China influence in, and access to, a huge continent — one with growing economies and geopolitically important spots, like Djibouti. And the United States? Our country is not exactly in the midst of a sustained campaign of reaching out to the rest of the world. Our government has just scrapped a trade deal with Asia and is trying to ban many Muslims from entering this country. The Trump administration has signaled that it also may soon cut back on humanitarian aid to Africa. On today’s Op-Ed page, Bill Frist, the former Republican Senate leader, makes an urgent plea for continuing the Pepfar program. A program that George W. Bush personally helped to push, it has saved many, many lives in Africa through improved AIDS treatment. But more than one million Africans still die every year from AIDS, many because of lack of access to treatment. President Trump and some close aides have spoken favorably about Pepfar, but the administration has also raised questions about its “massive” [sic] cost. The overwhelming reason to continue Pepfar is humanitarian. Yet it has the ancillary benefit of promoting American interests on a continent where our main rival for global influence is very active. As Frist writes: “Pepfar is the greatest humanitarian effort undertaken by the United States in more than 60 years. But it also makes us safer by making afflicted countries stronger, more stable and more grateful to us.” "

Trump. His message of reducing regulations and taxes appealed to this Republican stronghold, one of Mr. Trump’s strongest bases of support in the state. As for his promises about cracking down on illegal immigrants, many assumed Mr. Trump’s pledges were mostly just talk. But two weeks into his administration, Mr. Trump has signed executive orders that have upended the country’s immigration laws. Now farmers here are deeply alarmed about what the new policies could mean for their workers, most of whom are unauthorized, and the businesses that depend on them. “Everything’s coming so quickly,” Mr. Marchini said. “We’re not loading people into buses or deporting them, that’s not happening yet.” As he looked out over a crew of workers bent over as they rifled through muddy leaves to find purple heads of radicchio, he said that as a businessman, Mr. Trump would know that farmers had invested millions of dollars into produce that is growing right now, and that not being able to pick and sell those crops would represent huge losses for the state economy. “I’m confident that he can grasp the magnitude and the anxiety of what’s happening now.” Mr. Trump’s immigration policies could transform California’s Central Valley, a stretch of lowlands that extends from Redding to Bakersfield. Approximately 70 percent of all farmworkers here are living in the United States illegally, according to researchers at University of California, Davis. The impact could reverberate throughout the valley’s precarious economy, where agriculture is by far the largest industry. With 6.5 million people living in the valley, the fields in this state bring in $35 billion a year and provide more of the nation’s food than any other state. The consequences of a smaller immigrant work force would ripple not just through the orchards and dairies, but also to locally owned businesses, restaurants, schools and even seemingly unrelated industries, like the insurance market.

264,Crowdfunding Helps Rescue Refugees Upended by Travel Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/travel-ban-crowdfunding.html?searchResultPosition=49,2017/02/09,U.S.,"Trapped in an airport terminal in Jordan by President Trump’s travel ban, Hanan Isweiri fretted that as a Libyan citizen she would not be able to return to her husband and three children in Colorado. She wondered if she could complete the doctorate she had worked toward for seven years. Most of all, she feared for her 1-year-old son, who was having an allergic reaction but was not permitted to leave the airport. Just about the only thing she did not have to worry about — despite staying in airport hotels in Jordan and Turkey, and repeatedly booking and rebooking intercontinental flights in those chaotic early days — was money. Friends had set up a GoFundMe web page, raising $5,366 to help defray the significant costs she incurred as a result of the ban. “Some friends do a fund-raising site for me, and I believe without this I would never make it,” said Ms. Isweiri, 41, who made it back to Colorado on Sunday, two days after a federal judge put a halt, for now, on the travel ban. After Mr. Trump’s executive order, individual lawyers volunteered their time and expertise at airports around the country. Large organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, which had seen a boom in fund-raising after Mr. Trump’s election victory, have helped mount legal challenges. But the financial dislocation for ordinary people like Ms. Isweiri, a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University who was in Libya for her father’s funeral when Mr. Trump signed off on the ban, was enormous. In dozens of cases, crowdfunding sites allowed friends, neighbors and complete strangers to fill the gap and cover the expenses that otherwise might have unwound the financial security of immigrants and residents affected by the ban. Because of the decentralized nature of the campaigns, it is hard to say exactly how many have started since the change in immigration policy. But the largest crowdfunding site, GoFundMe, and a company it recently acquired, CrowdRise, have seen more than 50 new campaigns that have raised nearly $1.5 million related to the executive order, which halted travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. An appeals court in San Francisco is reviewing the order. "

It was Judge Richard R. Clifton — not Noah G. Purcell, Washington State’s solicitor general — who said that evidence of religious discrimination was thin and that “the concern for terrorism with those connected with radical Islamic sects is kind of hard to deny.” • An article on Wednesday about the Senate confirmation of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education described incorrectly the role of public pressure in the “no” votes cast by two Republicans. While Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she received urging her to reject the nomination, Senator Susan Collins of Maine did not in fact refer to such public comments as influencing her decision to oppose the nomination. NATIONAL An article on Jan. 29 about the anxiety toward Muslim refugees that is being stoked by the far-right media misidentified the source of a widely shared article claiming that members of Al Qaeda had entered the United States disguised as refugees. It was published by American News, not by Conservative Tribune. THE ARTS A Critic’s Notebook article on Wednesday about this year’s Oscar-nominated short films erroneously included one person as a co-director of the film “Joe’s Violin.” The film was directed solely by Kahane Cooperman, not also by Raphaela Neihausen, who was one of the film’s producers, along with Ms. Cooperman. The error was repeated in a picture caption. OBITUARIES An obituary on Jan. 16 about the singer and pianist Buddy Greco omitted a survivor.

He is Peter Brook, not Brooks. • An obituary on Tuesday about Lorenzo Servitje, a founder of the multinational baking company Grupo Bimbo, included a quotation from the book “White Bread,” by Aaron Bobrow-Strain, that misspelled the name of a brand Mr. Servitje’s company owns.

Now They’re Worried.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/middleeast/iran-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/02/09,MIDDLE EAST,"TEHRAN — It was supposed to be a regular weekly debate night for a group that meets to discuss movies in a middle-class Tehran neighborhood. But on this particular evening, the 20 or so housewives, intellectuals and students in the group wanted to talk about only one thing: a possibly violent conflict between Iran and the United States. Months had passed since members of the group had been so worked up, recalled one of the participants, Fariba Sameni, a 57-year-old translator. No one wanted to discuss film. Younger members were convinced that President Trump would inevitably bomb Iran. “They shouted that their futures would be destroyed,” Ms. Sameni said. The group’s leader, a professor, argued that Mr. Trump, with his background as a businessman, would ultimately make a deal with Iran. The professor’s argument was unconvincing, Ms. Sameni said. “When I went home, I felt anxious and worried,” she said, “as if something really bad is about to happen.” Gloom and dread can be felt across the Iranian capital, and some people blame not only Mr. Trump, but also their own leaders. First Mr. Trump ordered a ban on travel by most Iranians to the United States. Then the Iranian military conducted a missile test, which was followed by a warning from Mr. Trump’s national security adviser that Iran was “on notice” for an undefined reprisal. "

269,Trump’s Leading Rivals Wear Robes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/trumps-leading-rivals-wear-robes.html?searchResultPosition=60,2017/02/09,OPINION,"President Obama was no fan of the dreadful 2010 Supreme Court decision ruling in favor of corporate personhood. In that case, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the court asserted that political spending, including by corporations, was a form of speech protected by the First Amendment, opening the door for corporations to spend unlimited money on ads and other tools to get candidates elected. The president was not alone. As The Washington Post reported the month after the ruling: “Americans of both parties overwhelmingly oppose a Supreme Court ruling that allows corporations and unions to spend as much as they want on political campaigns, and most favor new limits on such spending, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.” The Post continued: “Eight in 10 poll respondents say they oppose the high court’s Jan. 21 decision to allow unfettered corporate political spending, with 65 percent ‘strongly’ opposed. Nearly as many backed congressional action to curb the ruling, with 72 percent in favor of reinstating limits. The poll reveals relatively little difference of opinion on the issue among Democrats (85 percent opposed to the ruling), Republicans (76 percent) and independents (81 percent).” An overwhelming majority of America was aghast. So Obama reflected that frustration in his public statements. The president addressed the debacle in his 2010 State of the Union address, in the presence of the Supreme Court justices who decided the case. He began his comments with a phrase that had not appeared in the prepared text, “With all due deference to separation of powers.” Then he let loose: “Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign corporations — to spend without limit in our elections. I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and I’d urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.” Obama had previously criticized the ruling in one of his weekly radio addresses, stating: “I can’t think of anything more devastating to the public interest. The last thing we need to do is hand more influence to the lobbyists in Washington, or more power to the special interests to tip the outcome of elections.” "
270,Putting Clients Second,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/putting-clients-second.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/02/09,OPINION,"THE Trump administration recently announced that it intends to review, and presumably overturn, the Obama-era fiduciary duty rule that is scheduled to take effect in April. The administration’s case was articulated by Gary Cohn, the new director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Cohn, most recently the president of Goldman Sachs, called it “a bad rule” and likened it to “putting only healthy food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldn’t eat it because you might die younger.” Comparing healthy and unhealthy food to healthy and unhealthy investments is an interesting analogy. The now-endangered fiduciary rule is based on a simple — and seemingly unarguable — principle: that in giving advice to clients with retirement funds, stockbrokers, registered investment advisers and insurance agents must act in the best interests of their clients. Honestly, it seems counterproductive to go to war against such a fundamental principle. It simply doesn’t seem like a good business practice for Wall Street to tell its client-investors, “We put your interests second, after our firm’s, but it’s close.” The annulment of the government’s fiduciary rule would clearly be a setback for investors trying to prepare for retirement. But the fiduciary principle itself will live on, and even spread. The truth is, the existing proposal doesn’t go nearly far enough. It is limited to retirement plan accounts and ignores the other three-quarters of the assets owned by individual investors. Any effective rule must encompass all investors. It is widely agreed that the fiduciary rule would give impetus to the growing use of lower-cost, broadly diversified index funds (pioneered by Vanguard, the company I founded), such as those tracking, with remarkable precision, the S&P 500 stock index. But even without the rule, there has already been a tidal shift to index funds — actually, more like a tsunami. Since 2008, mutual fund investors have liquidated more than $800 billion of their holdings in actively managed equity mutual funds and purchased about $1.8 trillion of equity index funds. Low-cost index funds are almost certainly what Mr. Cohn means when he refers to the “healthy food on the menu.” "
271,It’s Black History Month. Look in the Mirror.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/its-black-history-month-look-in-the-mirror.html?searchResultPosition=58,2017/02/09,OPINION,"To many Americans, February, first officially recognized by President Gerald Ford in 1976 as Black History Month, is a time to celebrate African-American achievements, ones that were gained against nearly impossible economic, social and political odds. But there is one achievement that is rarely on the list. As a people, African-Americans forced the United States of America to look deep into its own soul and to see the moral bankruptcy that lay there. That bankruptcy was exposed as African-Americans struggled to live under white supremacy, a system that rendered them “sub-persons.” And even as we fought to make America “our home” — a home that was already brutally taken from Native Americans by white colonial settlers — our black bodies were subject to unconscionable white enslavement, violence and oppression; we lived through forms of carnage, mutilation, rape, castration and injustice that will forever mark the profound ethical failure of this country. By surviving, and demonstrating that the American experiment had failed black people and minorities, we became far more American than those who withheld America’s promise. On paper, America stood for freedom. Yet that freedom was denied to black people. White America, white people, lived in a profound form of what Sartre called “bad faith” — a state of inauthenticity and self-deception. The white social critic Lillian Smith (1896-1966), who grew up in the Deep South and later wrote “Killers of the Dream,” observed, “I had learned that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that we might have segregated churches.” She also noted, “I learned it is possible to be a Christian and a white Southerner simultaneously” and “to pray at night and ride Jim Crow car the next morning and to feel comfortable in doing both.” It is this bad faith, this ethical perversity, that haunts the history of white America. And as Frederick Douglass noted, “Between the Christianity of this land and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference.” And in his speech “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July” (1852), Douglass said to white America: “The Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.” As I listened to President Trump’s Black History Month remarks on Feb. 1, it was painfully clear that he didn’t bear witness to that Douglass. It is convenient for him not to know that Douglass. In this nightmare of Trumpism, we mustn’t forget Douglass’s words, just as we mustn’t forget the dejection felt by those who suffered under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 or in the anti-Japanese internment camps during World War II. Those actions contradicted America’s alleged identity as a nation whose arms are open to the stranger, the outcast; a nation that, in theory, does not discriminate based upon race or national origin. It is this brutal and contradictory history from which America cannot, and should not, turn away. Just as Jews refuse to forget Hitler’s Germany, we black Americans refuse to forget the often unspeakable atrocities we endured. It is this resistance to forgetting that must be nurtured as we find ourselves in the midst of a dangerous form of antiglobalism, white nativism and xenophobia under Trump’s vision for making America “great again,” a vision closer to D. W. Griffith’s 1915 “The Birth of a Nation” — a film predicated upon white fear and denigration of the black other — than that of an actual nation. "
272,All of Islam Isn’t the Enemy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/all-of-islam-isnt-the-enemy.html?searchResultPosition=57,2017/02/09,OPINION,"Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world? That could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim nations with an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood — perhaps the most influential Islamist group in the Middle East — as a terrorist organization. Such an order, now under consideration, would be seen by many Muslims as another attempt to vilify adherents of Islam. It appears to be part of a mission by the president and his closest advisers to heighten fears by promoting a dangerously exaggerated vision of an America under siege by what they call radical Islam. The struggle against extremism is complex, and solutions must be tailored both to the facts and to an understanding of the likely consequences. Since 1997, the secretary of state has had the power to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations, thus subjecting them, as well as people and businesses who deal with them, to sanctions, like freezing their assets. President Barack Obama resisted adding the Brotherhood to that list. There are good reasons that the Brotherhood, with millions of members, doesn’t merit the terrorist designation. Rather than a single organization, it is a collection of groups and movements that can vary widely from country to country. While the Brotherhood calls for a society governed by Islamic law, it renounced violence decades ago, has supported elections and has become a political and social organization. Its branches often have tenuous connections to the original movement founded in Egypt in 1928. Under State Department guidelines, the “terrorist” designation is intended to punish groups that carry out terrorist attacks. There’s no question that some such groups have grown out of the Muslim Brotherhood, like Hamas, the adversary of Israel, which the United States named a terrorist organization in 1997. Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has worked to crush the Brotherhood in his country since he overthrew his predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, a former Brotherhood leader, in 2013. But there is no evidence that senior Brotherhood leaders ordered any violence or carried out any of the recent major terrorist attacks in Egypt, according to the analysts Michele Dunne and Nathan Brown of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

While every administration should strongly review our nation’s overseas commitments, and there are undoubtedly programs that we should cut, I hope he recognizes the success and importance of one in particular: the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. I have been treating patients in Africa and Haiti for 20 years. When I was Senate majority leader in 2003, I led the Senate’s passage of the plan, called Pepfar, on an overwhelming voice vote. It has since been reauthorized twice. President Trump, like his predecessors, will have the chance to put his own stamp on this winning program. Pepfar was created in a moment of crisis: In the late 1990s, H.I.V.-AIDS was the No. 4 killer worldwide, and No. 1 in Africa. The program aimed to bring reliable, proven measures like antiretroviral drugs, counseling and prevention services to underserved communities around the world — and it worked. Today, Pepfar reaches 11.5 million people with antiretroviral drugs, a 50 percent increase since just 2014. Two million babies with infected mothers have been born H.I.V.-free thanks to Pepfar interventions, and 6.2 million orphans and vulnerable children receive care from the program. The program has been able to expand, without a significant change in its budget, because it leverages the latest scientific innovations and reductions in drug prices. As a result, the rate of new H.I.V. infections in Malawi, for example, has dropped 76 percent in 13 years. But the work is far from over. One million people worldwide died of AIDS last year, and only about half of those afflicted with the disease are getting proper treatment. Pepfar’s success is no secret to the new administration. In his confirmation hearing as secretary of state last month, Rex Tillerson called it “a model for us to look to as we’re thinking about other ways in which to project America’s values, project our compassion” to “solve these threats.” A few days later, though, The New York Times reported that the Trump transition team was asking questions about the value of humanitarian aid in general and Pepfar in particular. For example, transition officials asked, “Is Pepfar worth the massive investment when there are so many security concerns in Africa?” "

In its 250th anniversary year, Christie’s described the process of wooing auction sellers as “challenging,” which may account for sales contracting 22 percent, to £3.3 billion, or about $4.1 billion. Auction sales were also down in 2016 at the rival houses Sotheby’s and Phillips. Private transactions at Christie’s, however, increased 25 percent, to £694 million. The largest of these was the joint acquisition for 160 million euros, or $170.8 million, of Rembrandt’s wedding portraits of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit by the Louvre Museum in Paris and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. “It was a solid year. We achieved four out of the year’s five top auction prices,” said Guillaume Cerutti, Christie’s chief executive. Mr. Cerutti, 50, took over from Patricia Barbizet in December, having been the auction house’s president of Europe, Middle East, Russia and India operations. “The market is strong on the buyer’s side, more challenging on the seller’s side,” he added. Christie’s 2016 auction results were notable for the absence of 20th-century masterworks, such as Picasso’s “Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’),” which sold in 2015 for $179.4 million, a record for a work of art sold at auction. Last year, with Britain’s referendum on European Union membership and the United States’ presidential election creating uncertainty, owners of the world’s most valuable postwar and contemporary art were more reluctant to sell at auction.

Can It Survive the Trump Era?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/integration-works-can-it-survive-the-trump-era.html?searchResultPosition=53,2017/02/09,OPINION,"The 2016 election deepened the chasm between those voters who believe that the government should address the problems of the poor and those who are convinced that the government already provides disadvantaged minorities with too much help, at the expense of the white working and middle classes. While the polarized belief systems that exploded in the battle between Trump and Clinton are driving both policymaking and an invigorated opposition, researchers continue to provide empirical evidence on the difficult issues of race, poverty and intergenerational mobility. Rucker C. Johnson, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, has followed two generations of black families and concluded that integration has been an effective tool for raising educational levels and living standards. “Equal opportunity education policies generally are motivated to try to break the cycle of poverty, to break the vicious cycle of disadvantage from one generation to the next, and create a virtuous cycle where being born poor isn’t a life sentence,” Johnson told the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association in 2016. “We have a very rare opportunity where a major intervention” — desegregation — “has been shown to be very effective on one generation’s lifetime outcomes, and then to be able to show that those beneficial effects extend into the next generation – particularly the black children whose parents went to desegregated schools.” Separate research published in 2015 by Johnson, C. Kirabo Jackson, an economist at Northwestern, and Claudia Persico, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, found that At the same time, Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at Brookings, and Dimitrios Halikias, a research assistant, tackled one of the most vexing issues in education in their February 2017 Brookings paper, “Race Gaps in SAT Scores Highlight Inequality and Hinder Upward Mobility.” “Race gaps on the SATs are especially pronounced at the tails of the distribution,” the two authors note. In math, for example, Translating those percentages into concrete numbers, Reeves and Halikias estimate that While the numbers Reeves and Halikias report are bleak, there are findings that suggest that these gaps can be ameliorated.

Japan’s Drivers Don’t.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/business/trump-japan-american-cars.html?searchResultPosition=51,2017/02/09,BUSINESS,"TOKYO — Yoshihiro Masui’s growling Ford hot-rod, its sides adorned with the Stars and Stripes, attests to his love of American cars — an unusual passion in Japan, where Toyota, Honda and other domestic brands rule the roads. “Japanese cars don’t break down, but they’re boring,” said Mr. Masui, 67, a semiretired music producer. Besides the hot-rod — a replica Model T with a racecar’s engine — he owns a gleaming white Ford Thunderbird, the latest of nearly 70 Detroit-made vehicles he figures he has bought and sold over the years. “You definitely stand out,” he said. Detroit pines for a day when the sight of an American car on a Japanese street is not so notable. Even as Japanese cars have taken a wide portion of the United States market, American brands are barely visible in Japan, a situation that has long frustrated American auto executives and trade negotiators and has become a renewed source of political friction under President Trump. Mr. Trump accuses Japan of shutting American producers out, by throwing up regulatory barriers and rigging the currency market in favor of Japanese brands. “They do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan,” he said in a meeting with American executives last month. Such talk is alarming in Japan, where the auto industry is a pillar of the economy. When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets Mr. Trump starting on Friday, averting a trade war will be at the top of his agenda. Mr. Abe’s government has been floating proposals, like using Japanese pension money to fund Mr. Trump’s infrastructure plans, that might mollify the president and help offset Japan’s large trade surplus.

It was a bit of a kiss-and-tell moment when Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, told reporters that President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil M.

Mnuchin that “there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class” — seems as if it was made to be broken. Mr. Mnuchin initially made the statement during an interview on CNBC in November, after President Trump chose him for the cabinet. At Mr. Mnuchin’s confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, rebranded the comment as a “rule,” transforming a throwaway line into a formal pledge. Whether it will be kept may become clearer in two or three weeks — the timing Mr. Trump mentioned Thursday for delivering a “phenomenal” tax plan. Although Mr. Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered. Redesigning the tax code with an eye fixed on lower rates has been a Republican mission for decades, and one that Mr. Trump adopted. That prospect, combined with a promised regulatory retreat, has pumped up the stock market and fueled optimism among business leaders. "

The theater, New York’s pre-eminent nonprofit, said Thursday that it would open its annual Shakespeare in the Park season with “Julius Caesar,” and declared, “Shakespeare’s political masterpiece has never felt more contemporary.” The Public’s synopsis of the play makes clear that the outdoor production would have some parallels with contemporary American politics. “Rome’s leader, Julius Caesar, is a force unlike any the city has seen,” the description reads. “Magnetic, populist, irreverent, he seems bent on absolute power. A small band of patriots, devoted to the country’s democratic traditions, must decide how to oppose him.” The play is an unusual choice for the annual summer program: During the 55 years of free theater in Central Park, “Julius Caesar” has been done just once, in 2000. And this summer’s production will be directed by Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, who last directed a show in the park in 2008 (“Hamlet”). “Julius Caesar” will be followed by more familiar summer fare: a production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” directed by Lear deBessonet. The comedy was previously staged in the park in 1982, 1991 and 2007. “Julius Caesar” is to run from May 23 to June 18, and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” from July 11 to Aug. 13. Casting has not yet been announced. Most of the tickets to Shakespeare in the Park are distributed, for free, on the day of the performance, either in person or by a digital lottery. "

Mr. Mohamed now has the opportunity to form Somalia’s first functioning government in more than 25 years. With his election, there’s hope that Somalia can turn away from years of dysfunctional, corrupt leadership, and put in place a government that can tackle the country’s serious problems. Transparency International ranks Somalia the most corrupt country on earth. Some $20 million changed hands in the lead-up to Wednesday’s election, and bribe-taking, crony capitalism and the stealing of public money are deeply entrenched. Mr. Mohamed must move quickly to curb the corruption that has made it nearly impossible to provide basic services. Poverty and terrorism have made Somalia the world’s third-largest refugee-producing country after Syria and Afghanistan. More than one million Somalis have fled the country, many to neighboring Kenya. Famine, which caused the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Somalis in 2011, is again a severe threat because of continuing drought. The Al Qaeda-affiliated Shabab militant group, one of the world’s deadliest Islamist organizations, and other armed groups remain strong in Somalia, despite an intensified American clandestine war, in concert with African troops, against Islamist terrorists. On Tuesday, mortars landed near Mogadishu’s international airport, where lawmakers voted the next day. On Wednesday morning, militants attacked a hotel in Somalia’s semiautonomous region of Puntland, killing four guards. Somalia is one of seven countries on President Donald Trump’s legally contested travel ban list, causing profound anxiety for thousands of Somali refugees and for Somali families settled in the United States. There are also fears that Mr. Trump might move to cut American aid. That would be a mistake, especially now. Mr. Mohamed will need all the support he can get to put the government on a path to delivering the services and security Somalia needs. "

Both are megaselling queens of pop whose every move reverberates throughout the culture. The fact that they will face off in each of the top three categories — album, record and song of the year — gives the Grammys a rare tension that can only be good for ratings. Yet their competition is also fraught in ways that have long dogged the awards. One concerns race, a subject the Grammys have a tangled history with — especially this year, when one of the most acclaimed young black artists, Frank Ocean, has boycotted the process altogether. Another sensitive area is the Grammys’ spotty record in recognizing the vanguards of contemporary pop. Added to the mix is a heightened political climate in which issues of race and identity are front and center, raising the question of whether the music industry will use this year’s Grammys as a soapbox. Many longtime Grammy watchers say that a sweep by Adele — and therefore a Beyoncé snub — could feed into long-simmering complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories. Ebro Darden, a disc jockey on the New York hip-hop station Hot 97 and on Apple’s Beats 1, said that a big Beyoncé win would be “the best move” for the Grammys “if they want to get the most attention and keep people interested.” Should Adele dominate, he added, some music fans “would come for them and say #OscarsSoWhite.” "

The three-judge panel, suggesting that the ban did not advance national security, said the administration had shown “no evidence” that anyone from the seven nations — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — had committed terrorist acts in the United States. The ruling also rejected Mr. Trump’s claim that courts are powerless to review a president’s national security assessments. Judges have a crucial role to play in a constitutional democracy, the court said. “It is beyond question,” the decision said, “that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.” The decision was handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. It upheld a ruling last Friday by a federal district judge, James L. Robart, who blocked key parts of the travel ban, allowing thousands of foreigners to enter the country. "

The organization, Al Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, is one of several groups to have their offices closed, their assets frozen or travel bans imposed on their leaders in the past year. Prominent lawyers, journalists and others considered a threat to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi have also been singled out. In justifying the sweeping measures, Egyptian officials say they need to regulate Western-funded groups that threaten the stability of the Egyptian state and aid terrorism. Critics say Mr. Sisi is seeking to consolidate his control by silencing even the mildest sources of dissent. Since coming to power in 2013, his government has locked up tens of thousands of opponents and effectively outlawed public protests. Now, many fear, President Trump’s support for Mr. Sisi could embolden the Egyptian leader to go further. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Sisi as a “fantastic guy” and invited him to the White House. Mr. Sisi was notably silent about Mr. Trump’s recent ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Al Nadeem Center, which was founded in 1993, has been fighting for survival since last February, when the government first threatened to close it, citing vague health regulations. The center has provided therapy to about 1,000 victims of police abuse, its founders say, and cataloged instances of police torture, unlawful killings and illegal abductions. "

And not only because she’s a night owl, known to labor over canvases long into the evening in her studio on Crosby Street in SoHo, with a cat named Raymond Carver twining around her ankles. It is also because some of Ms. Celmins’s best-known works — examples of which are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Modern, the Pompidou and other important museums — are painstakingly wrought images of night skies, so realistic that they can be mistaken for photographs, but so dark and strange that you sometimes see viewers bringing their noses right up to the surface, as if they were trying to focus on the stars through the lens of a telescope. Ms. Celmins, 78, keeps a clipping of the ascetic abstractionist Ad Reinhardt’s 12 rules for painting, one of which is to avoid form at all costs. “No figure or fore- or background,” he wrote. “No volume or mass, no cylinder, sphere or cone, or cube or boogie-woogie.” And she has been drawn obsessively for more than four decades to her most beloved subjects — the dark sky, the surfaces of the ocean and the moon and the desert, without horizon or perspective — because such seemingly formless vistas allow her to imagine, as she once said, “that I wrestle a giant image into a very tiny area and make it stay there so that it seems inevitable that it is there.” If you’re a fan, waiting out that wrestling match can be excruciating. She works with all the haste of a medieval illuminator. But after a hiatus of almost seven years since her last exhibition, she is returning with a new body of work, at Matthew Marks (522 West 22nd Street in Chelsea), her first show there, opening on Friday. In a sense, it serves as a warm-up for a far bigger one, the first full retrospective of her work in more than 20 years, organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where it will open at the end of 2018 before traveling to the Met Breuer, the show’s co-organizer, in 2019. One recent afternoon, Ms. Celmins appeared near her elevator door, wearing an apron smeared with paint. “Let me take this thing off so I don’t look like a dirty worker,” she said, winking. “Except that I am a dirty worker.” Behind her, in her studio, which shares space with the small apartment where she has lived for 28 years, two assistants were applying touches to paintings bound for the gallery’s show, an unusual situation for Ms. Celmins, who has worked resolutely alone since her student days at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Trump after the election in November, plans to meet with the president in Washington on Friday in the Oval Office. Mr. Abe is then planning to fly to Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., to play golf with the president. Mr. Abe wants to talk to Mr. Trump about trade and economic issues, which have already been the subject of some critical Twitter postings and remarks from the president. Mr. Abe is also eager to pursue a closer personal relationship with Mr. Trump, with whom he shares some ideological leanings, including a resistance to immigration. With Mr. Trump warning Toyota of a “big border tax” on the company if it built a new plant in Mexico and telling American business leaders that Japan purposely devaluates the yen for economic advantage, Mr. Abe is concerned about how Mr. Trump’s “America First” policies could affect Japanese companies and the country’s broader economy. Now that Mr. Trump has formally abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership multilateral trade deal — on which Mr. Abe expended considerable domestic political capital — Mr. Abe will be looking to sound out Mr. Trump on the possibility of negotiating a future bilateral trade deal between the two countries. Mr. Abe could point out that Japanese companies invest heavily in the United States. According to the Japan Business Federation, Japanese companies have directly invested more than $400 billion in building factories and other facilities in the United States, creating about 1.7 million jobs for American workers.

But more damaging than Nordstrom’s decision to drop her clothing line might have been the reaction from her father, the president. His lashing out at the upscale department store seems to reflect an approach to industrial policy that often brings unintended consequences. In response to Nordstrom’s decision, President Trump took to Twitter to complain: Lest the message be unclear, his official presidential  account dutifully retweeted the complaint. And his son Donald Trump Jr. followed up with reports that supporters were planning to boycott the store. Such actions, if meant to disrupt Nordstrom’s business, could be a signal to other retailers that it’ll be costly to cut off existing business relationships with the Trump family. This kind of bullying could have unintended consequences. Put yourself in the shoes of a purchasing manager considering adding the Ivanka Trump Collection to your stores. Even if you think her products are excellent, Mr. Trump’s outburst provides an incentive not to stock them. After all, if it doesn’t work out, who wants to be in the cross-hairs of an easily angered president with 24.3 million Twitter followers and the power of the regulatory state? It might be far safer to do business with someone else. Mr. Trump’s strategy to protect his daughter’s business seems to mirror his strategy to protect American jobs. Just as he has made it more expensive for potential partners to sever business relationships with his daughter, the C.E.O.s of Carrier, General Motors and Toyota can attest that he has made it more expensive for them to sever their relationships with American workers. And when you make it more expensive to exit a relationship, you make it more expensive to enter it. That extra cost can create a greater harm. It’s a lesson that many European governments have learned the hard way. Research shows that efforts to boost employment by making it difficult or costly to fire workers have backfired. The prospect of a costly and lengthy legal battle for laid-off employees makes it less appealing to hire new workers. The result has been that higher firing costs have led to to weaker productivity, sclerotic labor markets and higher unemployment. Even France’s Socialist party saw the relationship of easier exits to increased entrances. Facing very high unemployment and a weak economy, some of its party leaders last year tried to make it easier for companies to fire people. But for months, protesters took to the streets to block any legislation. The prospect of a costly Trump tantrum could give factory bosses reason to think twice before setting up shop in the United States. In the short run, perhaps Mr. Trump’s threats can slow a painful decline. But in the longer run, defending the status quo may do more harm than good. "

No viewer, however, has seen his criticism of the show scrutinized — or had the show get under his skin — quite like President Trump. Mr. Trump is the first president of the United States to take umbrage publicly at his portrayal on “S.N.L.” and fight back in real time (a phenomenon that began this past fall, when Alec Baldwin began impersonating him). That fraught dynamic is even more remarkable given that Mr. Trump has been lampooned on the program regularly for almost 30 years — he is as much of an “S.N.L.” character as Stefon, the Church Lady or Debbie Downer — and for a time he seemed to enjoy a friendly relationship with the show. So where did it all go awry? With Mr. Baldwin about to host “Saturday Night Live” this weekend and the world waiting to see how (if at all) Mr. Trump reacts, here’s a look back at the complicated relationship between the chief executive and the comedy series he loves to hate. In their debut as characters on “Saturday Night Live,” Donald J. Trump and his first wife, Ivana (played by Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks), are the filthy-rich romantic leads of this parody of O. Henry’s “The Gift of the Magi.” Donald sells his yacht, the Trump Princess, to buy Ivana a gold, jewel-encrusted door for Mar-a-Lago, but Ivana has sold Mar-a-Lago to buy Donald a gold, jewel-encrusted anchor for his yacht. Though the Trumps are presented as wealthy, brand-obsessed philistines, the satire isn’t too pointed. "

For years, Kenya has threatened to shut the sprawling camp, a crowded, sweltering realm near Kenya’s border with Somalia that has been a refuge for desperate people since Somalis began fleeing to Kenya in 1991, when their country was plunged into civil war. The government has said the camp is a breeding ground for Islamist terrorists, though the evidence is mixed for how central it really is to Kenya’s terrorism problem, which has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years. The vast majority of refugees who live in Dadaab are Somalis, too scared to return home to a nation plagued by war, famine, chaos, poverty and disease. On Thursday, Judge John Mativo of Kenya’s High Court, the equivalent of an American Federal District Court, ruled that the government’s plan to close the camp “specifically targeting Somali refugees is an act of group persecution, illegal, discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional.” The judge also ordered the Kenyan government to reinstate its refugee department, which the government essentially closed last year. In May, Kenya announced it was serious about closing Dadaab, though it has since missed several self-imposed deadlines. Diplomats, United Nations agencies and human rights groups have told the Kenyans that forcing the refugees to return to Somalia would be a violation of international law. Kenya’s foreign donors, including the United States, have threatened to withhold payments if the government kicks out the refugees. That has left Kenya in a tight spot: Relocating hundreds of thousands of people would not be cheap. Few say they believe Dadaab’s future is settled. Within hours of the ruling, the Kenyan government vowed to appeal, arguing that the situation in Somalia had improved and the refugees could return. It is unclear whether the Kenyan government will follow the court order. Though Kenya’s judiciary is considered strong and independent, the president has enormous power and Kenyan security forces routinely violate the rights of Somali refugees. Still, the pressure is growing to do something about Dadaab. Aid officials, who have sharply criticized repatriation, admit that the current situation is untenable. “Kenya and the international community must work toward finding alternative solutions for refugees, including local integration options,” said Muthoni Wanyeki, an Amnesty International regional director. More than 9,000 Somali refugees were resettled in the United States last fiscal year, many coming from Dadaab. But a recent change in United States policy could threaten that trend. President Trump signed an executive order last month barring Somalis from traveling to the United States. Over the past two weeks, scores of refugees have been bused back and forth between Dadaab and Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, as the United States’ refugee policy is argued in American courts. "

Gorsuch’s comments that the president’s criticism of independent judges is “demoralizing” and “disheartening,” President Trump will perhaps withdraw Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. The only chance we have of restoring some measure of sanity to Washington is if the Republican senators begin to stand up to Mr. Trump’s irrational excesses. Withdrawing the nomination of a judge whom the Republicans are ecstatic about might just do it. One can only hope. HENRY VON KOHORN Princeton, N.J.

Gorsuch is not as bad as they thought and won’t oppose him as strenuously? WENDY GRAF Los Angeles To the Editor: It is no wonder that politics is so divisive when the press goes to no end to obtain a gotcha moment. Private conversations should remain private. If the Supreme Court nominee wants to make a public statement, he is most welcome to do so. But it’s none of my business what the judge says in private. MICHAEL BURKE Brookline, Mass.

And the president wants us to believe he is smart. MALCOLM M. GAYNOR  Chicago The writer is a retired lawyer. To the Editor: Re “Senate Confirms Sessions to Lead the Justice Department” (front page, Feb. 9): In reality, there was little chance that Senate Democrats could defeat the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to become the attorney general, given their minority status. One can only hope that the intense debate as to his qualifications and past racially motivated statements will encourage him to lead the Justice Department in defending the constitutional rights and best interests of all Americans.

297,‘A Patriotic Duty’: Dissent at the State Department,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/a-patriotic-duty-dissent-at-the-state-department.html?searchResultPosition=24,2017/02/09,OPINION,"To the Editor: “Dissent on Travel Ban Spreads From One Embassy to Another” (front page, Feb. 1), about a State Department cable that “traveled like a chain letter — or a viral video” through American embassies around the world, quotes a diplomat as saying policy dissent is part of the department’s culture to the point that “we even have awards for it.” Acknowledgment of the value of policy dissent at the department began in 1967 when the American Foreign Service Association and my mother, Enid Hammerman Rivkin, established the William R. Rivkin Award in honor of my father, an ambassador, to encourage Foreign Service officers to tell truth to power, recognizing the best for their initiative, integrity, courage and constructive dissent. In 1971, the State Department established a formal “dissent channel” to ensure that its senior officials would consider differing views in formulating policy. So when 1,000 or so department employees explained through the established dissent channel that President Trump’s executive order suspending visas for citizens of seven Muslim countries would not make our country safer, and why it would in fact sour relations with these countries, deprive us of intelligence and other resources needed to fight terror abroad, increase anti-American sentiment, thwart humanitarian efforts and hurt our economy, one would have expected senior officials to give them a careful hearing. That is what Secretary of State John Kerry did last year after a group of midlevel Foreign Service officers wrote a dissent cable criticizing Obama administration policy in Syria. Instead, the White House press secretary warned that dissenters “should either get with the program or they can go.” One need not agree with the dissenters to recognize that thoughtful dissent is not disloyalty but a patriotic duty.

298,A Plan to Prune the City’s Thicket of Warrants for Petty Offenses,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/nyregion/a-plan-to-prune-the-citys-thicket-of-warrants-for-petty-offenses.html?searchResultPosition=25,2017/02/09,NEW YORK,"There are 1.5 million low-level warrants on file in New York, demanding arrests for offenses so minor that many are not even categorized as crimes. Some stem from unpaid fines of only $25. Many are the result of old tickets for drinking beer in public, disorderly conduct, sitting in a park after dark or riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. They are part of the legacy of a quarter-century of aggressive policing tactics, known by various names — “broken windows,” “zero tolerance” or “stop and frisk” — but all involve an escalating number of tickets for minor infractions. And at 1.5 million, the warrants have created a class of New Yorkers, in large part black and Hispanic, who stand a good chance of being arrested if an officer asks to see their identification and runs their name through a police database. Now the city’s five district attorneys are considering throwing out a large number of warrants in an effort to move past the controversies over former policing practices and to spare New Yorkers from being arrested for petty infractions committed long ago. Many details are still being worked out, like whether to delete just a tenth of these warrants, or as many as half. But the city’s district attorneys have agreed in principle to ask the courts to purge at least some of them — in what will most likely be applauded by advocates of criminal justice reform and for immigrants concerned about increased deportations under the Trump administration. A warrant can hang over someone’s head for years, even decades, threatening to escalate any interaction with the police into a night in jail, or worse. For undocumented immigrants, a low-level warrant could conceivably lead to deportation proceedings, civil rights lawyers say, particularly given the executive order President Trump signed on Jan. 25 that expands the definition of who is to be targeted for deportation. An arrest on a warrant “throws people right in the cross hairs of ICE and that is particularly scary now,” said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

But what President Trump did on Wednesday in his Twitter attack on the Nordstrom department store chain, castigating it for dropping Ms. Trump’s line, was far worse. In sum, Nordstrom made a business decision not to do business with the president’s daughter because her  clothing line was not selling well, and the president used his official position to attack the company for this decision. The president’s tweet — posted on his personal account and then re-sent from his White House account — is an act of intimidation. Nordstrom interacts with many executive branch agencies: the Department of Labor, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and others. Each one of these agencies will be headed by Trump appointees. Most will be staffed with other political appointees as well. The president is telling all of these people that he is very angry with Nordstrom. The message is clear, and it won’t take much for a political appointee in some agency to conceive of an ingenious way of ingratiating himself with the White House by making life difficult for the store chain. Most important, regardless of whether such retaliation actually happens, Nordstrom and the handful of other companies that announced they, too, would drop the line have to live in fear of it for the rest of the Trump administration. And now every other department store knows that it had better not make a similar “business decision” that displeases the president. In other words, do business with the Trump family and help the Trump family promote its products, or else. "

The policy change, confirmed by the I.R.S. on Wednesday after elements were reported by the libertarian magazine Reason, does not do away with the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that all Americans who can afford it obtain health insurance or pay a fine. But it might make it a little harder for the I.R.S. to figure out who is breaking the rules. The I.R.S. recently notified tax preparers that it will not reject tax returns that omit information about whether a filer had health insurance during the previous year. That’s actually a continuation of an informal Obama administration policy, but because of the way the decision was announced, it is likely to have broader effects on how many people report their insurance status to the government and how many people end up paying penalties for staying uninsured. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on the day of his inauguration asking agencies to reduce burdens related to compliance with the health law. In its statement, the I.R.S. indicated that this policy was related to that instruction. Tax returns include a line that asks people to indicate whether they had insurance for the entirety of the previous year. If they did, they can check a box. If not, they are asked to provide more detail: about how much coverage they had; whether they had been granted an exemption; or, if they owe penalties, how much. "

While all might have been considered excellent candidates for the job in earlier years, global health officials are worried that their backgrounds could push the Trump administration away from historical commitments to the fund. One candidate, in particular, has used Twitter posts to call Mr. Trump a fascist, saying he has much in common with ISIS for his anti-Muslim stance. A spokesman for the Global Fund said on Wednesday that it considered all three candidates “skilled and highly experienced,” that none would be asked to withdraw and the election would proceed as scheduled on Feb. 27. The four-year term of Dr. Mark Dybul, the current executive director, ends on May 31. A senior United States government official said administration global health officials received the three candidates’ names Monday evening and had not yet met to discuss them. "

Schwarzman throws himself a 70th birthday party complete with camels, a gondolier, a 12-minute fireworks display and a performance by Gwen Stefani — with an estimated cost ranging from an improbable $20 million to a more likely $7 million to $9 million — and the tsk-tsking can be heard from coast to coast, as it is cited as one more example of the wretched, over-the-top excess of the new Trumpian era. Does no one remember the Reagan years? These kind of multimillion bashes seemed to be almost a monthly occurrence during the mid-and late-1980s (except for a brief blip following the Black Monday crash of 1987), with one mogul after another raising the party stakes for their Champagne-swilling, caviar-supping, Lacroix-wearing guests. Perhaps the most visible couple during the latter stages of the Reagan era was Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg, with the second Mrs. Steinberg often referred to in the news media as “the queen of nouvelle society.” In 1988, the Steinbergs were said to have spent $3 million (or roughly $6.1 million in today’s dollars) on the wedding of Saul’s daughter Laura to the real-estate heir Jonathan Tisch — a candlelight ceremony at the Central Synagogue on Lexington Avenue, with the bride and her 10 attendants dressed in gowns by Arnold Scaasi, followed by a sit-down dinner for 500 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that featured centerpieces of gilded magnolia leaves and spring branches. It was covered by the Metro Section of The New York Times, which stated simply, “It was a power wedding.” A year later, in August, 1989, Gayfryd spent $1 million on Saul’s 50th birthday party, held at their estate in Quogue, on Long Island, in a tent decorated as a Flemish drinking hall with 10 tableaux vivants of Saul’s favorite old masters and about 250 of their best friends in attendance, including the commerce secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and his wife Georgette, Barbara Walters, Larry Tisch, Steve and Courtney Ross, the fashion designer Carolyne Roehm and her then-husband Henry Kravis, Robert and Blaine Trump, and Tina Brown and Harry Evans.

Sensational leaks. Battling broadsheets. The swirling story around President Trump’s dealings with Russia is being compared in journalism circles to past blockbusters like Watergate and the Monica Lewinsky scandal — with a 21st-century twist. News organizations like The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN are jousting for scoops, but instead of sending clerks to grab the early editions from newsstands, editors watch the news unfold on Twitter in real time. Anonymous sources are driving bombshell stories, but leaks are springing from encrypted iPhone messaging apps rather than from meetings in underground parking garages. The news cycle begins at sunrise, as groggy reporters hear the ping of a presidential tweet, and ends sometime in the overnight hours, as newspaper editors tear up front pages scrambled by the latest revelation from Washington. In consequence and velocity, the political developments of the past four weeks — has it been only four weeks? — are jogging memories of momentous journalistic times. “There is this sense of urgency and energy that I feel now that reminds me of being 29 and in a very different situation: in the middle of a revolutionary situation in Russia,” said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, who was a correspondent for The Washington Post in Moscow during the collapse of the Soviet Union. “I’m not saying it’s a revolution now. But there is this uncertainty about what is happening minute to minute, day to day.” “There is this sense that every day is going to bring something startling, if not calamitous,” he added. For journalists anxious about the state of their profession, there is a renewed sense of mission. Newspapers are seeing a sharp rise in subscriptions. Television news, once dismissed as a dinosaur in the internet age, is thriving. Rachel Maddow’s audience on MSNBC is up 79 percent from a year ago, with her show pulling more than two million viewers a night for the past two weeks. On Tuesday, Tucker Carlson of Fox News had more viewers than network shows like “New Girl” and “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” "

Trump embraced the hackers who had leaked Hillary Clinton’s emails to the press, declaring at a rally in Pennsylvania, “I love WikiLeaks!” To the cheering throngs that night, Mr. Trump marveled that “nothing is secret today when you talk about the internet.” The leakers, he said, had performed a public service by revealing what he called a scandal with no rival in United States history. Now, after less than four weeks in the Oval Office, President Trump has changed his mind. At a news conference on Wednesday and in a series of Twitter postings earlier in the day, Mr. Trump angrily accused intelligence agencies of illegally leaking information about Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, who resigned after reports that he had lied about conversations with the Russian ambassador. “It’s a criminal action, criminal act,” Mr. Trump fumed at the White House. In a Twitter message, he asserted that “the real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” But this is Washington, where leaks are common currency — and, depending what side you’re on, either sinister or patriotic. Democrats these days see the proliferation of leaks about the Trump administration as the acts of public servants revealing the misdeeds of a presidency. Republicans see them as the reckless actions of disgruntled bureaucrats eager to advance their own agendas and sabotage Mr. Trump. Either way, Mr. Trump’s presidential flip-flop follows a landmark month for Washington leaks. Drafts of his executive orders floated around the city for days before he signed them. Parts of the president’s conversations with foreign leaders have been published verbatim in news accounts. Agency memos and cables have been repeatedly cited by journalists to document anxiety among the city’s civil servants. "

Smiling by Mr. Trump’s side, Mr. Netanyahu, who has steadily undermined the prospect of a Palestinian state, clearly believed his vision was the one the new American president had in mind. The two leaders seemed almost giddy in their first official meeting, which was intended to show how Mr. Trump can be a better friend to Israel than President Barack Obama was, even though Mr. Obama completed a new 10-year, $38 billion defense agreement with Israel. Mr. Trump voiced optimism about getting a “great peace deal” between Israel and its neighbors. While Mr. Trump did urge Mr. Netanyahu to “hold back” on settlements in the West Bank and said Israel must make compromises, he offered no details on any peace initiative, and the vagueness of his remarks suggests he has no inkling of how to move forward. His willingness, however, to lend credence to those who would deny a separate state to the Palestinians will certainly make peace harder to achieve. Palestinians have long sought their own state and are sure to reject the idea of having their lands annexed by Israel, even if offered some kind of limited autonomy. The two-state solution began to take shape after the 1993 Oslo accords and was endorsed by President Bill Clinton in 2001. As recently as December, the United Nations Security Council reaffirmed its “vision of a region where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders.” "

SoftBank, the Japanese technology and telecommunications conglomerate, scooped up a New York-listed private equity firm this week. HNA Group, the Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate, took a piece of a New York hedge fund company last month, a week after buying a New Zealand investment company. And HNA has tossed its hat into the ring to acquire a British insurer and its asset management unit. Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder of SoftBank, wants to create a “Berkshire Hathaway of the tech industry.” In January, he met with President Trump, then the president-elect, pledging to invest $50 billion in the United States and to create jobs there as part of a new $100 billion investment fund called SoftBank Vision Fund. For the lower-profile HNA Group, which has interests in cloud computing companies, airlines and hotels, the acquisition of the SkyBridge Capital hedge fund of funds firm last month was part of what it described as a strategy to “build a global asset management business.” The small spurt of deals is occurring as Asian companies look for expertise on where to invest their stockpiles of money and hone their ambitions to become financial conglomerates. Several of these multibillion-dollar firms have hired New York banks to help them find investments that include private equity and insurance. It is an opportunistic time for the buyers and the sellers. For many partners at hedge fund and private equity firms, it is a good time to sell. Years of disappointing performance and cheaper index-tracking alternatives have emerged as a challenge to what was once a lucrative, high-fee business. Firms like SkyBridge Capital, which offer investors a chance to spread their money around in an array of other hedge funds, the so-called fund of funds business that layers on additional fees, have had a particularly difficult time lately.

The possible role for Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, has met fierce resistance among intelligence officials already on edge because of the criticism the intelligence community has received from Mr. Trump during the campaign and since he became president. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump blamed leaks from the intelligence community for the departure of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, whose resignation he requested. There has been no announcement of Mr. Feinberg’s job, which would be based in the White House, but he recently told his company’s shareholders that he is in discussions to join the Trump administration. He is a member of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council. Mr. Feinberg, who has close ties to Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, declined to comment on his possible position. The White House, which is still working out the details of the intelligence review, also would not comment. Bringing Mr. Feinberg into the administration to conduct the review is seen as a way of injecting a Trump loyalist into a world the White House views with suspicion. But top intelligence officials fear that Mr. Feinberg is being groomed for a high position in one of the intelligence agencies. "

During the Vietnam War, Watergate and the Iran-contra scandal, when a president’s actions or policies crossed the line, Congress investigated and held the White House to account. The time has come for it to do so again. In the last week alone, Americans have witnessed the firing of President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and learned with shock and incredulity that members of Mr. Trump’s campaign and inner circle were in repeated contact with Russian intelligence officials. Coming on top of credible information from America’s intelligence agencies that Russia tried to destabilize and influence the 2016 presidential campaign, these latest revelations are more than sufficient reason for Congress to investigate what Moscow has been up to and whether people at the highest levels of the United States government have aided and abetted the interests of a nation that has tried to thwart American foreign policy since the Cold War. Given that context, one might expect Mr. Trump to be clamoring for details that would eliminate any suspicion that his administration is in league with an enemy. Instead he has waged an unhinged attack on the intelligence agencies themselves, praising President Vladimir Putin of Russia at every turn and pointing fingers everywhere but at himself, while refusing to take a single step to resolve questions about his administration’s ties to Russia. Hence the urgent need for high-level congressional intervention. The ideal vehicle would be an investigative committee of senior senators from both parties as well as members of the House. Some Senate Republicans are beginning to step up. Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has already said his committee will investigate the election hacking. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Dianne Feinstein, the panel’s top-ranking Democrat, are asking for a briefing and transcripts of Mr. Flynn’s calls to the Russian ambassador.

After walking in the Women’s March on Washington, the designer and her team felt inspired. “We wanted to use our voices, something that was new for a lot of us,” she said. She invited four poets, including her sister, to read at her show, giving them no parameters except that the poems should tell women’s stories. “We put very little restraint on them because it was all relevant,” Ms. Reese said. “I’ve never designed for one kind of woman. It’s always for different women, different shapes, different colors, different ages.” Mara Hoffman took a similar approach, inviting the four co-chairs of the Women’s March to recite lines from the activist Angela Davis and the poets Maya Angelou and Audre Lorde.

But if his supporters on the right were beginning to doubt him, there was no sign of it on conservative talk radio, where Mr. Trump’s contention that he was a victim of leaks and entrenched Washington insiders lit up phone lines around the country. “There is no evidence for the primary assertion that is driving this entire attack on Trump,” Rush Limbaugh, the prominent conservative radio host, said on Wednesday afternoon. “This attack is coming from the shadows of the deep state, where former Obama employees remain in the intelligence community.” In another accusation, he said, “They are lying about things, hoping to make it easier for them and the Obama shadow government to eventually get rid of Trump and everybody in his administration.” How much of conservative America agreed with that particular defense was unclear. But the underlying thrust of the allegations — that Mr. Trump has liberal enemies who want to see him fail, and that they include the news media — appeared to strike a chord with talk radio listeners on Wednesday. “The media is road blocking Trump and his administration in every which way possible,” said a woman who called in on Mr. Limbaugh’s show on Wednesday. “And not that anything is illegal or illegitimate; it’s just they’re digging and digging.” Americans are bitterly divided and often see events through their partisan lenses. On talk programs across the country, responses divided neatly along party lines. Liberals saw the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, as a sign that the administration was ethically compromised and playing fast and loose with national security. Conservatives saw a hostile elite arrayed against Mr. Trump. "

The campaign, spread on social media and messaging apps, has called for a “day without immigrants.” It asks foreign-born people nationwide, regardless of legal status, not to go to work or go shopping in a demonstration of the importance of their labor and consumer spending to the United States’ economy. Activists and groups in cities across the country have picked up the call, reposting fliers found online, and in some cases organizing demonstrations to coincide with the event. Several activists said that they did not know how the campaign began or how many people would heed it, and that as far as they knew, there was no national organization behind it. But the dining scene in Washington, where the new Trump administration is taking a hard line on immigration and deportation, took notice. At least a few dozen restaurants in and around the Beltway have committed to staying closed on Thursday. Others have said they would offer limited service in the expectation that many of their employees would be out for the day. Some restaurants in other cities, including several of the Blue Ribbon restaurants in New York, have joined in. José Andrés, the famed Spanish-born chef who has tangled publicly with President Trump before, said his restaurants Zaytinya and Oyamel, and three Jaleo restaurants, all in the Washington area, would be closed for the day.

Yet the only votes that matter in this contest are not from constituents; this race, for City Council speaker, will be determined by other Council members and the city’s Democratic county leaders, who are normally the deciding factor in efforts to wrangle the necessary votes. The current speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, who is to deliver her State of the City address on Thursday, cannot run for re-election because of the term limits law; several other prominent Council members are also serving their last term. Though the race will not be decided until January, the looming vacancy is already swathed in all the bare-knuckled, back-room intrigue of old-time New York: Promises are offered; deals are made. And a leading candidate suddenly emerges. But this year’s contest offers additional intrigue in the form of Mayor Bill de Blasio; what role he will play is an open question. In the last race, the mayor intervened immediately after his election, helping tip the balance in favor of Ms. Mark-Viverito over Councilman Dan Garodnick of Manhattan. Mr. de Blasio used his influence as the first Democratic mayor in two decades to support a coalition of liberal Council members, many of them also newly elected, that backed Ms. Mark-Viverito. "

It may not be as dramatic as the torrent of political news out of Washington; an improving economy, after all, announces itself through a series of data releases that are just a little bit better than people were expecting. But that’s exactly what has happened. In consumer spending, the job market and manufacturing, the economy seems to be enjoying consistent, broad-based growth to start the year. There could always be a setback, of course, but the momentum is almost uniformly positive as the Trump era gets underway. Some of the factors at work may turn out to be temporary. Energy prices were near recent lows a year ago, and their recovery since has meant oil exploration and related fields are recovering. Similarly, the effects of a steep run-up in the value of the dollar from 2014 to early 2015 have now worked their way through the economy and aren’t holding back manufacturing the way they once were. An unusually warm winter is probably a factor in some of the good numbers, as people who in a normal year would have hunkered down amid snowstorms instead went shopping. But the positive tenor of the latest data has been building for months, and includes some data sets that shouldn’t be too affected by the weather. Think of the numbers released Wednesday and Thursday as the latest strong signals, not in isolation. Retail sales rose 0.4 percent in January, the Commerce Department said, and a booming 0.8 percent when volatile auto sales are excluded. American consumers are powering ahead in the eighth year of the expansion. "

The meeting between Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff, will take place in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. It will be the first face-to-face meeting between military chiefs from Washington and Moscow since 2014. A Pentagon statement said that discussions would center on “the current state of U.S.-Russian military relations and the importance of consistent and clear military-to-military communication to prevent miscalculation and potential crisis.” The state of military relations between the two sides certainly has not been good. Last week, Russian warplanes flew at an usually low altitude over an American guided missile destroyer in the Black Sea, according to a spokesman for the United States European Command. It was a pattern of harassment that Western officials say has been increasingly common as NATO works to strengthen its defenses against a resurgent Russian military. Relations also have been strained by the Russian deployment of a ground-launched cruise missile in what American officials say is a violation of the 1987 treaty banning intermediate-range American and Russian missiles based on land. The Russians have denied the complaint. The meeting between the military chiefs took many months to arrange, and its utility is a matter of debate among military experts. Some former civilian Defense Department officials have argued there is little that a meeting between the two generals can accomplish while the Trump administration’s policy toward Moscow remains unclear.

316,Boeing Workers Reject a Union in South Carolina,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/business/boeing-union-south-carolina.html?searchResultPosition=96,2017/02/15,BUSINESS,"NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Union organizers fell far short on Wednesday in a bid to enlist workers at Boeing’s South Carolina facilities in what was widely viewed as an early test of labor’s strength in the Trump era. Organizers with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers failed to persuade a majority of about 3,000 union-eligible Boeing workers in the state to vote for the union amid enormous pressure from management. Boeing said 74 percent of the more than 2,800 workers voting rejected the union. Many analysts say that Boeing decided to put its second Dreamliner aircraft assembly line in the state to reduce the leverage of the machinists’ union, which represents Boeing’s work force in the Puget Sound region of Washington State and has used work stoppages to exact concessions from the company in the past. South Carolina is one of the least unionized states in the country. Hoyt N. Wheeler, an emeritus professor of business at the University of South Carolina who taught labor relations and employment law, said in an interview before the vote that a victory would be “highly significant” because “one of Boeing’s motivations for coming to South Carolina was to escape the union.” The election took on added significance because of the emphasis President Trump has placed on domestic manufacturing, and on Boeing in particular. The president has called out the company over the cost of the new Air Force One program it is developing, and he recently sought to pit Boeing against Lockheed Martin to hold down the cost of the F-35 fighter jet. On Friday, Boeing will unveil its newest Dreamliner, the 787-10, a larger model being assembled exclusively in North Charleston, at a ceremony Mr. Trump is set to attend. "

In the program, which was broadcast on Feb. 6 and Feb. 8, CNN said it had obtained an intelligence document, during a yearlong investigation, that linked Vice President Tareck El Aissami and others to more than 150 Venezuelan passports and identification papers that were issued to people in the Middle East. CNN did not say where the intelligence document originated. The report came days before the Trump administration froze Mr. El Aissami’s American assets and forbid United States companies from doing business with him over accusations that he had been involved in narcotics trafficking. Mr. El Aissami, 42, has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. The CNN report, which described a passport-for-cash racket run out of the Venezuelan Embassy in Baghdad, appeared to have little overlap with the accusations that led to the sanctions, but one came after the other in a one-two punch that left Venezuela’s government reeling. CNN en Español disappeared from most television screens on Wednesday afternoon, after the government told reporters it would shut down the channel. CNN’s English-language channel remained on the air. Then Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro went on state television to accuse the network and American government officials of plotting to set President Trump against him. "

It is one of the oldest saws in finance. Yet even as a series of political scandals flare up in President Trump’s nascent administration, raising questions about his ability to pursue an investor-friendly agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal spending, the stock market just roars ahead. Over the past two weeks, with the president’s immigration policies and Russia ties dominating headlines, the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has been setting new highs regularly. For the most part, the stumbles by the administration have not been related to promises that Mr. Trump made — and that investors embraced — to recharge an economy that most economists believe is growing at subpar levels. Still, that investors have chosen to ignore the chaos in Washington highlights just how deep is the belief (others might consider it wishful thinking) that Mr. Trump, at his root, is a president who will deliver market-friendly policies. “I fully get the euphoria — there has probably never been a more business-friendly president,” said Adrian Helfert, the head of global fixed income at Amundi Smith Breeden. “Lower taxes and less regulations are good for corporations and equity holders.” Since Election Day, the S.&P. 500 index is up over 9 percent, and with money continuing to pour into stocks from bond and money market funds, the bull market is showing few signs of letting up.

Every day there is a new round of questions and a new set of concerns that raise anxieties and lower trust. Every day it becomes ever more clear that it is right and just to doubt the legitimacy of this regime and all that flows from it. The latest round involves the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, who this week was forced to resign following disclosures about his communications with the Russian ambassador on the same day that then-President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for its interference in our election to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton. The official reason given for requesting Flynn’s resignation was, according to the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer: “The president was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others.” Spicer continued later, “The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for General Flynn’s resignation.” Spicer further stated, “The White House counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue, but rather a trust issue.” "

The number of anti-Muslim groups grew the most, almost tripling to 101 in 2016 from 34 in 2015, in part because of President Trump’s 2015 proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla. There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the center said in its annual report. The number of organized anti-government groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 percent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015. That decline was a consequence of the increasingly mainstream presence of policy ideas and conspiracy theories about Islam and immigrants that originated on the political fringe, researchers said. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, said Mr. Trump’s election had been “absolutely electrifying to the radical right.” “Trump has co-opted many of the issues of the radical right, and that has prevented or at least slowed the growth of these groups,” Mr. Potok said. He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed right-wing hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember.” Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign with a series of divisive claims, including a June 2015 speech that referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” That December, he proposed fighting terrorism with a Muslim ban, a sharp departure from past presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who said jihadist groups did not represent all Muslims. "

This is not about Mike Flynn. It is about the president who appointed him, who earlier considered Flynn for vice president. The latest revelation of frequent contacts between the Trump team and Russian intelligence should be a wake-up call to Republicans as well as Democrats. When Vice President Mike Pence was asked by Chris Wallace of Fox News on Jan. 15 if there had been any contacts between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, he answered: “Of course not. Why would there be any contacts?” Great question, Mr. Vice President. Look, there’s a great deal we don’t know, but Russian interference in our election is potentially a bigger scandal than Watergate ever was. Watergate didn’t change an election’s result — President Richard Nixon would have won anyway in 1972 — while the 2016 election was close enough that Russian interference might have tipped the balance. We don’t know whether the Russians had domestic help in their effort to steal the U.S. election, but here are a few dots that are begging to be connected: First, the American intelligence community agrees that the Kremlin interfered during the campaign in an attempt to help Donald Trump. This isn’t a single agency’s conclusion, but reportedly a “strong consensus” among the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the director of national intelligence. "

Haley, said in answer to a question after a United Nations Security Council meeting devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “But we are thinking out of the box as well, which is — what does it take to bring these two sides to the table, what do we need to have them agree on?” she said. She said nothing about what that approach would be, nor did she go any further in revealing a coherent picture of United States policy on the conflict, one of the most intractable in the world. The day before, Mr. Trump hinted at a new regional effort aimed at bringing the two sides together, but he said he would not insist on the creation of a Palestinian state. “I’m looking at two-state and one-state,” he said. “I like the one that both parties like.” Both Ms. Haley’s and Mr. Trump’s remarks were in sharp contrast with warnings from other diplomats, including the United Nations envoy entrusted to help the two sides find a path out of their long, bitter conflict.

Growing up in Mississippi in the 1960s, Prof. Valerie Grim was only too familiar with racism. So when she discovered flyers from a white nationalist group posted outside her office at Indiana University Bloomington, she wasn’t intimidated. Instead, she was curious about what had led someone to post flyers depicting Michelangelo’s David along with the phrase “Let’s become great again” and the name of Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group, outside offices in the university’s department of African-American and African diaspora studies. The group’s name, symbol and Twitter handle were also written on the whiteboard on Prof. Grim’s door. “This is someone who really got a wrong view of history,” says Professor Grim, who teaches African-American history. She wishes she could invite those responsible for the flyers into her office for a conversation: “Don’t hide behind a flyer. Come in, let’s talk.” Identity Evropa is one of several groups that appeared last year, seemingly in response to President Trump’s candidacy, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The number of hate groups operating in the United States rose from 892 in 2015 to 917 in 2016, the center reported on Wednesday. Identity Evropa has ties to other white nationalist groups in the United States and abroad. The founder of the group, Nathan Damigo, attended the summit of the National Policy Institute, the white nationalist group run by Richard Spencer, in Washington in November. Identity Evropa has ideological similarities to anti-Muslim “identitarian” movements in Europe, and links to identitarian literature on its website. "

Now, less than a month into President Trump’s administration, it’s become something to be ducked, at least for some. As the Dallas Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram: “It’s a tough situation for C.E.O.s. You want to make nice with the president because you’re a public company and you have shareholders, and it’s hard to balance doing the right financial thing versus doing what they think is the right thing, whatever your political beliefs are.” Mr. Cuban, the billionaire investor and star of the reality TV show “Shark Tank,” has been engaged in a running Twitter feud with Mr. Trump. In the latest volley, the president tweeted that Mr. Cuban “backed me big-time but I wasn’t interested in taking all of his calls,” and “He’s not smart enough to run for president!” A Trump invitation “has become a double-edged sword because the population is so divided,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who organizes meetings of chief executives there. Things seemed different as recently as December, when the Blackstone Group’s chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, announced the formation of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, whose members would “meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge,” as Mr. Schwarzman put it at the time. Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Well over 100 chief executives approached Mr. Schwarzman and the Trump transition team angling to be included. "

Everyone in this country’s going to say, ‘Oh, it’s so great.’ That’s not great. That’s not great.” A Coast Guard official on Thursday said the presence of the intelligence ship, called the Viktor Leonov, so close to American shores is not unprecedented, and is not a cause for alarm. The vessel has been traveling along the Eastern Seaboard and was spotted near the states of Connecticut, Virginia and Delaware. Capt. Andrew Tucci, who oversees Long Island Sound and coastal Connecticut, said the Coast Guard knew the Russian ship had been traveling from the Caribbean “for some time.” “This vessel was transiting all up the Eastern Seaboard, and the Coast Guard and other military and federal government agencies are aware,” Captain Tucci said.

But federal support has been getting leaner. The nation is spending about 60 percent of what it did 30 years ago on federal research and development as measured against the total economy. In other words, this spending is becoming a smaller percentage of the gross domestic product. That’s a big problem, because many of our global competitors in Europe and Asia have been ramping up their research spending with a goal of knocking us off our scientific and economic pedestal. Now President Trump is in the position to do something about it. During his campaign, he hammered away at the historically slow growth of the American economy during the Obama years. He repeatedly pledged to speed up the pace of that trajectory. Increasing investments in long-term scientific research, long a federal responsibility, can help him deliver on his pledge. The nonpartisan Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscored the importance of such investments when it noted that it ranked the United States only 10th on its global innovation index largely because of flagging support for long-term research. The funding pinch is causing us to become more risk averse and forgo wagers on transformational technologies — such as high-capacity multi-electron batteries — that could pay off in a big way if they succeed. It is also allowing our vaunted science and technology infrastructure to decay. The greatly oversubscribed Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for example, has been waiting almost a decade for a desperately needed second “target station” to meet the needs of materials research so critical to industry. But before President Trump takes the science plunge, he needs to get the best and most honest advice he can. He should start by appointing his own science adviser, someone he trusts who has the professional stature, respect and breadth of knowledge commensurate with the complexities of the job and holds sensible views on climate change. He also needs to fully staff the Office of Science and Technology Policy, as every president has since Gerald Ford. And he should maintain the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology that has reported directly to every president since George H. W. Bush. Not only do those two offices ensure that a president receives quality analysis and timely professional advice, but they also insulate him from lobbyists. "

But political leaders around the world are not at all shy about interfering with what the central banks do. Mr. Trump’s executive order reflects a global mood.

We are conscious, however, that a central tenet of the declaration has all but been forgotten over the intervening decades: respect for the status of (Arab) Palestinians. The increasing inability of Israel to address this condition, coupled with the expansion into Arab territory of the Jewish settlements, are major factors in growing anti-Semitism around the world. If this situation is to have a chance of being neutralized, Israel must respect the United Nations resolutions (the same United Nations that gave Israel legitimacy 70 years ago) and look to allow the Palestinians their own state. Of course, this will mean disruption and Israeli political upheaval, and it’s disappointing that this week President Trump looked more like Janus on the issue. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu owes this to the millions of Jews around the world who suffer essentially because of the results of internal Israeli politics, as well as to the unenfranchised Palestinians. Thus, we don’t believe that the declaration centenary can be properly celebrated this year unless progress is made, and soon.

333,Why Thornton Wilder Matters in the Trump Era,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/theater/the-skin-of-our-teeth-thornton-wilder-trump.html?searchResultPosition=47,2017/02/16,THEATER,"When Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin of Our Teeth” had its Broadway premiere in 1942, directed by Elia Kazan and starring a dream cast led by Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March, the critic Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it “one of the wisest and friskiest comedies written in a long time.” When it returned in 1955, with Helen Hayes and Mary Martin, Mr. Atkinson deemed it simply “perfect.” After that, though, the play’s fortunes fell. On its third and most recent Broadway outing, José Quintero’s 1975 revival starring Elizabeth Ashley, the Times critic Mel Gussow dismissed it as “simplistic.” Boundary-breaking in its day, it has long been scarce on professional stages. So Arin Arbus’s new Off Broadway production for Theater for a New Audience, in previews at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn, is a rare chance for re-evaluation. With a cast of 35 (!) and original music by César Alvarez (“Futurity”), it follows the members of the Antrobus family of suburban New Jersey through the ice age in Act I (their pets are a mammoth and a dinosaur; freezing refugees clamor at the door) and into a great flood in Act II. The third act opens amid the ruins of a war. With each calamity, the Antrobuses have to figure out whether and how to survive. Jeffrey Horowitz, the founding artistic director of Theater for a New Audience, said he didn’t choose the play with topicality in mind. But Wilder had his own suspicions about when it resounds most powerfully. As he explained in the 1950s, in a preface to his collection “Three Plays”: “It was written on the eve of our entrance into the war and under strong emotion, and I think it mostly comes alive under conditions of crisis.” Several admirers of the play spoke recently about why “The Skin of Our Teeth” endures, what makes it problematic and why this could be a ripe time for its resurgence. Here are edited excerpts from those interviews.  "

President Trump’s potential Russian ties, coupled with his cavalier and unthinking attitude toward security and our allies, have put the safety of our country in peril. If Congress will not mount a strong independent investigation, I suggest that there are five people whose patriotism is unquestioned, even though I did not vote for all of them. I suggest that former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, the two Bushes and Barack Obama issue a joint bipartisan statement demanding investigation by an independent leader or group. That might convince even some Republican members of Congress about the desperation of our situation. It would certainly awaken the notice of almost every thinking person in this country regardless of political stance. I still believe that is where the true power to fix our course exists. I can only hope that it will be exercised before the cataclysm occurs. JOAN G. HAUSER  Oak Ridge, Tenn. To the Editor: The Trump administration is throwing our intelligence agencies into turmoil.

The White House, under presidents of both parties, has generally restricted direct contact with the Justice Department about prospective investigations to avoid the appearance of politicizing law enforcement. Typically, if an agency believes that classified material from its own records was improperly disclosed, it will make a referral to the Justice Department, which decides whether to open an investigation. Mr. Trump appeared particularly incensed at public reports about his rancorous phone conversations with foreign leaders, including telling the president of Mexico the he might send American troops to stop “bad hombres down there,” and berating the prime minister of Australia over an Obama-era deal to resettle refugees and then cutting the call short. He also expressed frustration over leaks about federal surveillance that picked up pre-inaugural phone calls between the Russian ambassador and Michael T. Flynn, who resigned under pressure this week from his role as national security adviser. "

Then came 20th Century Fox’s latest movie promotion tactic, for which it created fake news sites with plausible names like The Houston Leader and The Salt Lake City Guardian and populated them with partisan headlines involving Lady Gaga, President Trump, vaccinations and mental health. Many of the articles on the sites, which were apparently produced in collaboration with a fake news creator the company declined to identify, were shared by people on Facebook who apparently did not know they were part of a stunt meant to publicize the film “A Cure for Wellness.” Marketers have long been known to twist the truth to serve their interests, but many in the industry thought 20th Century Fox and Regency Enterprises, a producer of the film, had crossed a line. The film studio apologized for the strategy on Thursday. “Fake news is not a cute or silly subject,” said Susan Credle, global chief creative officer of the ad agency FCB. “When you start to tear down media and question what’s real and what’s not real, our democracy is threatened.” “I think this is a hot enough subject that most marketers would understand that taking advantage of a vulnerable public is dangerous,” she added.

Not President Trump’s recent blame-the-press conference; the Marc Jacobs show. Maybe we should have expected it. This designer’s singular skill, after all, is discerning which way the wind is blowing and capturing that moment in cloth. On Thursday, Mr. Jacobs brought New York Fashion Week to a close with a disconcertingly depressing if very well-merchandised ode to the documentary “Hip-Hop Evolution” and a moment in time when everything changed. (Speaking of dress, of course.) In the cavernous 67th Street Armory, empty but for two long lines of folding chairs set up to form a corridor-cum-runway, Mr. Jacobs turned off the sound: The show was absent both music and the clicks of cellphones. Guests had been asked not to take pictures, because the chief executive, Sebastian Suhl, said before it all began, “Marc wants everyone to experience the show” with their own eyes, as opposed to through the eye of the camera. Mostly, everyone complied. They used their own eyes to see the silent, unsmiling girls do the walk of, not shame, exactly, but kind of, in thigh-high dresses that ranged from ribbed knits to beads, sequins and lace, all under granddad jackets in plaid or cord. Sometimes they had shearling collars; sometimes, fur arms. They were largely in shades of brown and rust. There were some slouchy flares, but mostly it was just jackets and dresses, all the way down — and hats (bowlers and paperboy caps with exaggerated crowns), boots (stacked heel, sometimes platform), bags (scrunchy or frame or even dangling on a chain around the neck) and big old costume jewelry. All together it was a look. Taken apart and in the shop, it will add up to a lot of product, a lot of it good. But any excitement generated was crushed under the general Weltanschauung. Sound familiar? Afterward everyone shuffled silently out the door, where it turned out the models were all perched on a Park Avenue sidewalk, special matching cellphones trained on the exiting invitees, as what would have been the show soundtrack blared from some speakers. Mr. Jacobs himself disappeared around the corner, trailing an insinuation in his wake: Hah! Fooled you! See what it feels like? Yeah. Try that one on for size. "

340,A HUD Official Once Criticized Trump. Now He’s an Ex-Official.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/shermichael-singleton-housing-urban-development.html?searchResultPosition=40,2017/02/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — A top aide to President Trump’s housing secretary nominee, Ben Carson, was fired and led out of the department’s headquarters by security on Wednesday after writings critical of Mr. Trump surfaced in his vetting, according to two people briefed on the matter. Shermichael Singleton, who was one of the few black conservatives in the Trump administration, had been working at the Department of Housing and Urban Development since Jan. 23 as a senior adviser. He was preparing a cross-country tour for Mr. Carson, who is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this month. But according to the two people briefed, Mr. Singleton’s background check had not been completed. As it was being finished this week, Mr. Trump’s advisers turned up public writings by Mr. Singleton that appeared during the later stages of the campaign in which he was deeply critical of the candidate. “My party in particular has allowed itself to be taken over by someone who claims to be a Republican but doesn’t represent any of our values, principles or traditions,” he wrote in The Hill in October 2016. The firing was reminiscent of the decision by the White House to block a senior Republican foreign policy adviser, Elliott Abrams, from becoming deputy secretary of state. The move came after Mr. Abrams’s anti-Trump writings came to the president’s attention. Mr. Abrams had been the choice of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. A person close to Mr. Singleton said an initial vetting of the 26-year-old by HUD and White House personnel had come up with his criticism. He answered a number of questions regarding the article and expressed remorse for the piece and support for Mr. Trump. But a second look may have done him in. On Wednesday, Mr. Singleton was presented again with the piece and told it was the reason for his termination. Reached by phone, he would say only, “I can’t talk about that.” A spokesman for HUD confirmed Mr. Singleton’s position and said only that, “As of Feb. 15, 2017, he is no longer with the department.” Mr. Singleton plans to return to a previous job he held as a vice president with Howard Stirk Holdings, a media company run by Armstrong Williams, a conservative media personality and close friend of Mr. Carson’s.

An Israeli reporter wanted to know about the rise of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States and concerns that the new administration was encouraging xenophobia and racism. For a normal American politician, the moment offered a perfect opportunity for a home run. Condemn the behavior and make a sincere pledge to do everything possible to stop it. There is no question that hate crimes and malicious speech have accelerated since the presidential campaign, with Jews among the prime targets. The Anti-Defamation League says anti-Semitic talk in the United States has reached levels unseen since the 1930s. And there have been bomb threats against Jewish centers across the country. Mr. Trump, alas, is not that politician. He lacks the principles and moral understanding that most Americans want to see in their presidents. In fact, his answer summed up just how far we have traveled from normal. As is so often the case, he began with a focus on himself and skirted the issue. “Well, I just want to say that we are, you know, very honored by the victory that we had — 316 Electoral College votes,” Mr. Trump said. “We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270. And there’s tremendous enthusiasm out there.” It was as if his brain had short-circuited or someone had hit some internal replay button in his brain. "

Now we have the outline of that plan, and it looks as if it would redirect federal support away from poorer Americans and toward people who are wealthier. A white paper drafted by House leadership and the staff of the House and Senate committees that oversee health policy details a structure that could replace large sections of the Affordable Care Act. Crucially, the proposal largely contains provisions that could be passed through a special budget process that requires only 50 Senate votes, and fulfills President Trump’s promise that the repeal and replacement of the law would take place “simultaneously.” The plan would make major changes in how health care is financed for Americans who don’t get coverage from work. It would greatly expand the number of Americans who could benefit from federal help in buying health insurance, but it would change who benefits most from that support. Obamacare, as the A.C.A. is known, extended health coverage to 20 million Americans through two main mechanisms. It expanded Medicaid coverage to Americans below or just above the poverty line in states that participated, and it offered income-based tax credits for middle-income people to buy their own insurance. Obamacare was a redistributive law, transferring money from rich to poor. The Republican plan would alter both of those programs, changing the winners and losers. It would substantially cut funding for states in providing free insurance to low-income adults through Medicaid. And it would change how tax credits are distributed by giving all Americans not covered through work a flat credit by age, regardless of income. "

The provocative — many said racist — campaign was kicked off last month by retired Israeli generals and senior officers to shake Israelis out of apathy. President Trump accomplished something similar over the course of just a few seconds on Wednesday, when, standing beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, he declared that he was “looking at two-state and one-state” formulas for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “I like the one that both parties like,” he added, seemingly overturning decades of American policy centered on the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Purposefully or not, Mr. Trump had suddenly implied that the long-proposed solution of two states did not really matter. By Thursday, Israelis and Palestinians were feverishly debating what might come next, still confused about American policy after Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, reasserted that the administration “absolutely” supported two states. "

Speaker Paul D. Ryan and two House committee chairmen stood with the new secretary of health and human services, former Representative Tom Price of Georgia, preparing Republican lawmakers for a weeklong Presidents’ Day recess that promises to be dominated by angry or anxious questions about the fate of the health law. But the talking points they provided did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs. It also included no estimates of the number of people who would gain or lose insurance under the plan, nor did it include comparisons with the Affordable Care Act, which has extended coverage to 20 million people. With the House proposal’s rollback of Medicaid payments to the states, it appears likely that the number covered would be smaller. House Republican leaders asserted in a document describing their plan that they would not “pull the rug out from anyone who received care under states’ Medicaid expansions.” "

The accusations center on Medicare Advantage, a program through which people 65 or older agree to join private health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.s, whose costs the government reimburses. The program was created in 2003 after UnitedHealth and other insurers said that managed care could help contain the overall cost of Medicare, which has strained the federal budget by rising faster than the rate of inflation. Instead of slowing Medicare costs, UnitedHealth may have improperly added excess costs in the billions of dollars over more than a decade, according to the lawsuit, which was unsealed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles. A spokesman for UnitedHealth disputed that assertion, saying it was based on faulty interpretations of Medicare rules. “We reject these more than five-year-old claims and will contest them vigorously,” said the spokesman, Matthew A. Burns. He said the company served millions of Medicare Advantage members and was “proud of the access to quality health care we provided, and confident we complied with the program rules.” "

Here is a list of some of the most important. Mr. Trump won 306 Electoral College votes (and ended up with 304 officially), well above the threshold needed to secure the presidency but well behind several of his most recent predecessors. President Barack Obama won 332 Electoral College votes in 2012 and 365 four years earlier. President Bill Clinton received 370 Electoral College votes in 1992 and 379 in 1996. And President George Bush won 426 Electoral College votes in 1988. When a reporter pressed Mr. Trump on the claim, he laid the blame elsewhere. “I was given that information,” he said. Mr. Trump said the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld a temporary restraining order on his targeted travel ban, was “in chaos.” "

Instead, the administration will start from scratch, issuing a new executive order, the department said. Last Thursday, a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked the key parts of the original executive order, which suspended the nation’s refugee program as well as travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The panel said the original ban was unlikely to survive constitutional scrutiny. The Justice Department said that the panel’s decision was riddled with errors but that the flaws it noted would be addressed in the new executive order. “Rather than continuing this litigation,” the Justice Department’s brief said, “the president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.” “In so doing,” the brief said, “the president will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation.” In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the new executive order would be issued next week. In its brief, the Justice Department urged the appeals court to await the new order and then vacate last Thursday’s decision. "

Trump was campaigning for president, he said that he wanted “to put H&R Block out of business” by simplifying the income tax laws. But tax simplification isn’t a simple task, and while Mr. Trump singled out the company again on Wednesday, saying it would not be happy with what he had in mind, changing the tax code isn’t something he can do by himself. The tax law, which has thousands of sections and subsections, is just that: law. A new law, or a change to an existing one, must be passed by both houses of Congress before it is signed by the president. There is not much doubt that some changes are coming to the tax code, though the all-important details aren’t clear. The House Republican leadership released a tax plan outline last year, while Mr. Trump has said that he will work with Congress to pass what he calls the Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act, provisions of which he proposed in September. On Thursday, he said that “tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly” but that dealing with the Affordable Care Act had to come first. He said that would happen next month. The two plans differ — for instance, on whether to limit deductions for real estate taxes and mortgage interest. The changes that may actually result are still a mystery. "

Boehner of Ohio, in 2014 to a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code proposed by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee — and a member of his own party. Republicans remain united in their desire to cut taxes, simplify the system and recover some of the $2 trillion in untaxed profits that American companies have stashed overseas, out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. And the possibility of a once-in-a-generation makeover of the rules governing both business and personal taxes provides powerful motivation. Still, despite their grip on power, they are far from united in how to accomplish those goals. “Just because there’s an ‘R’ in the White House, an ‘R’ in the House and an ‘R’ in the Senate doesn’t mean they’re from the same alphabet,” said Douglas Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae. This time around, the speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Ways and Means chairman, Kevin Brady of Texas, have both taken ownership of a House blueprint for transforming the tax code, currently a masterpiece of complexity, inefficiencies and inequities. But several Republicans have misgivings about specific provisions, not to mention the cost. As for the White House, the most predictable response is unpredictability. The president said his administration would release a “phenomenal” tax plan in a couple of weeks. Mr. Brady has indicated that he wants to introduce comprehensive legislation by March and pass a bill before the August recess — perhaps suggesting the existence of an alternate congressional universe with no gridlock.

He pledged that he would push Facebook, which has more than 1.8 billion users worldwide, in a direction that would help convince individuals and governments that “progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.” The letter comes close to a political statement by a chief executive who, as the leader of a global company, is essentially arguing against a tide of isolationism that is rising across the world. Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, chose to make the statement as an update to his original founder’s letter, which was published in 2012 when Facebook went public.

Workers Try to Block Pruitt in Show of Defiance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html?searchResultPosition=28,2017/02/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Employees of the Environmental Protection Agency have been calling their senators to urge them to vote on Friday against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s contentious nominee to run the agency, a remarkable display of activism and defiance that presages turbulent times ahead for the E.P.A. Many of the scientists, environmental lawyers and policy experts who work in E.P.A. offices around the country say the calls are a last resort for workers who fear a nominee selected to run an agency he has made a career out of fighting — by a president who has vowed to “get rid of” it. “Mr. Pruitt’s background speaks for itself, and it comes on top of what the president wants to do to E.P.A.,” said John O’Grady, a biochemist at the agency since the first Bush administration and president of the union representing the E.P.A.’s 15,000 employees nationwide. Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer who heads the union in the Chicago area, said: “It seems like Trump and Pruitt want a complete reversal of what E.P.A. has done. I don’t know if there’s any other agency that’s been so reviled. So it’s in our interests to do this.” The union has sent emails and posted Facebook and Twitter messages urging members to make the calls. “It is rare,” said James A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. “I can’t think of any other time when people in the bureaucracy have done this.” "

At a hastily organized White House event — ostensibly to announce a new nominee for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta — Mr. Trump engaged in an extended attack on the news media and insisted that his new administration was not a chaotic operation but a “fine-tuned machine.” Any challenges, he said, were not his fault. “To be honest, I inherited a mess,” he said. In addition to his cabinet announcement, the president revealed that he had asked the Justice Department to investigate government leaks and said he would sign an executive order next week restricting travel to the United States. He promised to produce by March a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, followed by another plan to overhaul the tax system. But his 77-minute news conference was dominated by an extraordinarily raw and angry defense of both his administration and his character. At times abrupt, often rambling, characteristically boastful yet seemingly pained at the portrayals of him, Mr. Trump kept summoning the spirit of his successful campaign after a month of grinding governance to remind his audience, again, that he won. For a president who has already lost a court battle, fired an acting attorney general and a national security adviser, and lost a cabinet nomination fight, Mr. Trump was eager to demonstrate that he was still in command. He attacked judges for blocking his original travel order and Democrats for obstructing his nominations. He denied being anti-Semitic even when no one accused him of it. With the latest Pew Research Center poll showing that just 39 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing, Mr. Trump at one point plaintively pleaded for understanding. “The tone is such hatred,” he said, referring to the commentary about him on cable television. “I’m really not a bad person.” "

Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live analysis. TRUMP: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well. And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of labor. And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, “never Trump.” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. It’s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. "

But I’ll bet you didn’t actually have “worry about collapse of the government” written down on your schedule for February. Americans who went into a state of shock after the election are now floating in new, hitherto-uncharted realms of worry. We’ve learned that Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, talked with the Russians before the inauguration. And, sources told The Times, other Trump associates also talked with Russian intelligence officers during the campaign. What about Trump himself? Any chance that he encouraged Flynn to chat with the Russian ambassador about policy before he was president? Wouldn’t that be, um, super-illegal? Wow. If you thought a successful President Trump was the worst possible scenario, imagine an egomaniac who feels threatened with being a “loser,” back to the wall. In the interest of public tranquillity we will not dwell on the nuclear codes in his office. From the start, the Trump administration was a dark combination of mean and inept. But it was, on occasion, at least sort of mesmerizing. For instance, on Wednesday the nominee for secretary of labor went down the drain. Because somebody thought it was a good plan to go for a cabinet member with a history that includes employing an illegal immigrant housekeeper and an ex-wife who once went on “Oprah” to talk about spousal abuse. Things are so dire, people are feeling sympathy for Kellyanne Conway. Did you see that poor woman trying to answer questions about Flynn on the “Today” show? She looked as though she’d been hit over the head with a skillet. "

358,‘When We Rise’: Stories Behind the Pain and Pride of Gay Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/arts/television/when-we-rise-abc-dustin-lance-black.html?searchResultPosition=66,2017/02/16,TELEVISION,"PASADENA, Calif. — Fifty years ago next month, CBS broadcast “The Homosexuals,” an unsettling documentary about a subject “that people find disturbing,” as Mike Wallace, the anchor, put it. For nearly an hour, viewers saw a gay man in shadows describing the tragedy of his life, psychiatrists who depicted homosexuality as a debilitating mental illness and a harrowing clip of a distraught 19-year-old soldier being driven to jail after his arrest on a charge of soliciting sex in a public restroom. “The average homosexual — if there be such — is promiscuous,” Mr. Wallace told his audience. “He is not interested in, nor capable of, a lasting relationship like that of a heterosexual marriage.” A more contemporary examination of gay life in America comes to network television later this month, in an eight-hour avalanche of prime time spread across four nights, and with a decidedly different take on the subject. Written by a prominent gay filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, “When We Rise” is a 50-year history of the gay rights movement beginning on Feb. 27, told through four characters who suffer — and often triumph over — family rejection, landlord discrimination, gay-bashing, police harassment, legislative defeats and AIDS. But the world is a different place than it was when ABC first commissioned the project four years ago. Barack Obama was in the White House, and gay leaders were celebrating a series of court and statehouse victories, which would soon include the Supreme Court’s recognizing a constitutional right to marry by same-sex couples. After President Trump’s election, questions that seemed largely settled about gays in American society — same-sex marriage, equal treatment in the workplace and in housing — suddenly seem in doubt. Mr. Trump is hardly a champion of gay rights, and Mike Pence, his vice president, has a record of explicit opposition to gay rights measures. Mr. Trump could well end up altering the ideological composition of the Supreme Court that handed down the marriage decision. "

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) J.W. Paine, a truck driver in Hollister, said his car windows were broken and his house egged after he put Donald Trump signs in his yard. Nathan Morton, wearing a #buildthewall shirt, said he was approached by a man and woman and cursed out in the clubhouse of his Santa Rosa apartment complex. Corrin Rankin, a Redwood City business owner who led California’s African-Americans for Trump coalition, said she’s been shunned by people in town she had considered friends. “It’s definitely turned me into a homebody,” she said. It’s not easy being a Trump supporter along California’s liberal coast. In a number of interviews with Trump supporters in deep blue parts of the state, they described feeling under siege. It is common, they said, to face hostile questioning from strangers at grocery stores, school drop-offs or other public spaces. In extreme cases, people have been physically attacked. "

You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. For everyone alarmed by Donald Trump’s rise, James Comey and Senator John McCain — two Republicans who hate being seen as partisans — were deeply disappointing figures in 2016. The details of both stories are familiar by now. Comey is the F.B.I. director who made the dubious decision to focus national attention on Hillary Clinton’s email server just 11 days before the election. McCain is the once-maverick senator who, despite being personally maligned by Trump, rallied to his side in the campaign. And both Comey and McCain have emerged as central players in the emerging Russia scandal. In an Op-Ed, the journalist Tim Weiner calls them the two people who have “the power and the will” to compel testimony from Michael Flynn, Trump’s deposed adviser, over his Russian contacts and Trump’s. Comey is in this role because an F.B.I. investigation of Flynn helped cause his downfall and the investigation has reason to continue. McCain is in the role because he is “a Cold Warrior who dislikes the idea of cozying up to the Kremlin and is preparing for hearings on Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election,” Weiner writes. Comey and McCain obviously aren’t the only people with the power to investigate the extent of the collaboration between Russia and Team Trump. Other Republicans, including Senate leaders and committee chairmen, have that power, as well. Like Comey and McCain, they now face another character test. A foreign country, and not a friendly one, appears to have accumulated undue influence at the highest levels of American government. Because Republicans control both houses of Congress, only they really have the power to address the situation, which is as alarming as any political situation in a long time. Will they be willing to do so? For more, Charles Blow, Nick Kristof and the Editorial Board all write about Russia today. "
361,Kushners Won’t Buy Miami Marlins if Seller Gets Ambassadorship,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/kushner-miami-marlins.html?searchResultPosition=63,2017/02/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The family of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, said it would pull back from buying the Miami Marlins baseball team — for now — after it emerged that the current owner is likely to be named President Trump’s ambassador to France. Within days, the Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria is expected to be announced for the post, a diplomatic plum among the political appointments that presidents make, according to a person briefed on the process. Mr. Loria was a six-figure donor to Mr. Trump’s joint fund-raising effort with the Republican National Committee during the campaign, and a job in the administration has been a priority of the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus. But there is a hitch: Mr. Loria has been in discussions with Mr. Kushner’s father and brother-in-law to sell the team. The Kushners are not keen on the appearance of an ambassadorship-for-baseball-team swap. When word of Mr. Loria’s pending appointment became public in recent days, the Kushner family decided to remove itself from the list of possible buyers of the Marlins, at least for now. In a statement Wednesday night from Jared Kushner’s brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer, the family made clear that it would not proceed with the deal. “Our family has been friends with Jeff Loria for over 30 years, been in business together and even owned an AAA baseball team together,” Mr. Meyer said. “Although the Kushners have made substantial progress in discussions for us to purchase the Marlins, recent reports suggest that Mr. Loria will soon be nominated by the president to be ambassador to France,” he said. “If that is true, we do not want this unrelated transaction to complicate that process and will not pursue it,” he said. “The Kushners remain interested in purchasing a team and would love to buy the Marlins at another time.” Aides to Mr. Trump declined to respond to an email seeking comment. The overlap of official government work and private businesses of Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump has been one of concern for ethics watchdogs. "
362,Netanyahu Feels at Home at the White House,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/opinion/netanyahu-feels-at-home-at-the-white-house.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/02/16,OPINION,"JERUSALEM — The Benjamin Netanyahu on the White House podium Wednesday was the Netanyahu of old. Though politically weakened at home, the Israeli prime minister seemed uncharacteristically relaxed and self-confident. The smiles, the handshakes, the joking reference to President Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal” and the prime minister’s grandfatherly banter with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, this was the Netanyahu whom Israelis have not seen in years. By opening the news conference with a reference to the Jewish people’s painful history, President Trump afforded the prime minister an opportunity to do what he does best, what he did when he first took the world stage as Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in 1984. The president gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a chance to make the case for the legitimacy of the Jewish people’s return to their ancestral homeland. That was more than a rhetorical opportunity. For Mr. Netanyahu and many Israelis, Palestinian denial of that legitimacy is the real reason for the failure of the peace process. From the White House and in the presence of a sympathetic president, the prime minister was finally able to assert that the Palestinian commitment to a two-state solution has long been a hoax, that the Palestinians have employed two narratives, one for international consumption and another for Palestinians at home. Despite his international protestations, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority (like Yasir Arafat before him), has consistently denied that the Jews have a historic connection to the Temple Mount. Far more than arcane arguments over historical minutiae, the Arafat-Abbas tradition of denying a longstanding Jewish link to Jerusalem is the Palestinian’s inimitable way of saying that the Jews are simply the latest wave of Crusaders, that Israel is nothing but a colonialist presence in the Middle East. Just as the crusaders and colonialists of the past ultimately departed, the argument goes, so too will the Jews. The belief that President Abbas sees the two-state solution as a steppingstone to a one – Arab – state solution leaves many Israelis cynical about the peace process and tiring of the rhetoric about two states. Mr. Trump may have shifted that momentum. "
363,Rex Tillerson Meets Russian Counterpart in First Trip as Top U.S. Diplomat,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/world/europe/rex-tillerson-russia.html?searchResultPosition=61,2017/02/16,EUROPE,"BONN, Germany — By the time Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson decided that he wanted to join his counterparts at an important global gathering in Bonn — his first trip overseas as America’s top diplomat — all the good hotel rooms in this small German city had been taken. So Mr. Tillerson and his entourage of temporary State Department helpers took rooms at a rambling health clinic and spa next to a public bathhouse in the picturesque town of Bad Neuenahr, more than 20 miles outside the city — a bit like holing up in Beltsville, Md., for a conference in Washington. The remoteness of the location fit with the growing distance between the Trump administration and its European counterparts on such issues as immigration, refugees, defense and trade. Indeed, so much uncertainty has crept into what had been close relations that Mr. Tillerson largely dispensed with the usual gushing and grinning news conferences with his counterparts on Thursday at the gathering of foreign ministers from countries in the Group of 20. The meeting was called to lay the groundwork for the summit meeting of leaders of G-20 countries in Hamburg in July. With the Russians, though, Mr. Tillerson repeated what has become an increasingly hard line in the administration against the kind of warming ties that President Trump presaged in his campaign. In brief remarks after meeting the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, Mr. Tillerson said that Russia needed to honor its commitments to “de-escalate the violence in Ukraine.” In a separate statement with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea, Mr. Tillerson also denounced North Korea’s latest ballistic missile test and promised that the United States would defend its allies with the “full range of its nuclear and conventional defense capabilities.” In his own remarks, Mr. Lavrov emphasized that Russia and the United States could cooperate in some areas, and said that while the issue of sanctions was not discussed, those pushing sanctions should weigh “how much the artificial desire to politicize this subject meets the interests of the countries concerned.” "

After the presentation by Ms. Downey, a nanny in Philadelphia, Ms. Mathurin took the microphone. “I want you to stand up and close your eyes,” Ms. Mathurin said in her singsong Caribbean accent. “I want you to picture yourself exactly how you see yourself, and I want to tell you some things about yourself. “I want you to know that you are beautiful. I want you to know that you are enough.” Some of the nannies called out in agreement. “I want you to know that you are all woman. And while you are doing this, I want you to exhale.” Ms. Mathurin, 43, is the founder of My Nanny Circle, a grass-roots group that focuses on the training and empowerment of caregivers. The organization is not political, but on this particular Saturday, it was impossible to ignore the events that had unfolded in Washington the day before. President Trump had signed an executive order curtailing immigration, and anxieties were high. According to the Economic Policy Institute, a research organization in Washington, about 38 percent of nannies in New York State are non-naturalized immigrants. "

I asked him if he ever made it to the United States. He said he had been deported several years ago and couldn’t return. He was caught smuggling black-tar heroin in his shoes at the Tijuana-San Diego border crossing, he said. Wasn’t much — not quite a kilo. He did this to raise the money to buy a couple of cows, or a tractor. In Sinaloa, he said, cobblers do a thriving side business cutting compartments in the soles and heels of shoes and filling them with heroin. There’s a market for this work because so many farmers and ranchers — conservative folks, respectful of tradition — subsidize their small-time agriculture with drug money. Almost every other farmer for miles around did the same, he said. He had smuggled drugs 50 times before he was caught. He spent two years in federal prison and then was deported. As he spoke, I thought about the wall Donald J. Trump wants to build at the Mexican border. Today we struggle with a national epidemic of opioid and opiate addiction, first to narcotic painkillers overprescribed by doctors and now to heroin. As I’ve toured America talking about our opiate scourge, I’ve encountered many people who believe a wall will stop heroin from coming north. Walls, in fact, have been shown to stop people. Illegal crossing has all but ceased in Tijuana because of two walls, including one that starts in the Pacific Ocean and runs for more than 14 miles before hitting a mountain. "

The president “respectfully declined,” ESPN said in a statement. Andy Katz of ESPN basketball told The Washington Post that “the bracket idea worked because President Obama follows basketball and is passionate about the sport.” Mr. Trump has not shown the same passion about basketball, though he did tweet about Bobby Knight in the closing days of the campaign: When the leader of the free world speaks, or writes, or tweets, people listen. Was listening to the picks of Mr. Obama a smart move or not? "

In the New York region and around the country, many cooks, carpenters, plumbers and grocery store owners decided to answer it and not work on Thursday as part of a national “day without immigrants” in protest of the Trump administration’s policies toward them. The protest called for immigrants, whether naturalized citizens or undocumented, to stay home from work or school, close their businesses and abstain from shopping. People planned for it in restaurant staff meetings, on construction sites and on commuter buses, but the movement spread mostly on Facebook and via WhatsApp, the messaging service. No national group organized the action. “It’s like the Arab Spring,” said Manuel Castro, the executive director of NICE, short for New Immigrant Community Empowerment, which works primarily with Hispanic immigrant day laborers in Jackson Heights, Queens. “Our members were coming to us, asking what the plan was. Frankly, it kind of came out of nowhere.” But what began as a grass-roots movement quickly reached the highest levels of federal government. In Washington, the Pentagon warned its employees that a number of its food concessions, including Sbarro’s, Starbucks and Taco Bell, were closed because immigrant employees had stayed home and that they could expect longer lines at restaurants that were open. Restaurants, from San Francisco to Phoenix to Washington, D.C., were some of the most visible spots affected, with well-known chefs closing some of their eateries for the day in support. Rick Bayless, the Chicago chef and owner of the Frontera Grill, closed several of his restaurants and said he would give a portion of the revenue from the ones that remained open to an immigrant and refugee rights group. “What really makes our country great is the diversity we experience here,” Mr. Bayless said in an interview. “I can’t say enough about the lack of respect and the fear-mongering and hate-mongering that I’m sensing around us these days.” "

In a speech that ran to over 8,000 words, a mere 214 of them were devoted to education. Mr. de Blasio promoted the city’s high school graduation rate, which reached a record high of 69.6 percent last year. He boasted about his successful expansion of prekindergarten and cited progress toward his goal of bringing Advanced Placement courses to all high schools. And he alluded to his effort to build new schools in overcrowded neighborhoods. He did not mention that black and Hispanic students still graduate from high school at far lower rates than their white and Asian counterparts — 64.6 percent and 63.5 percent, compared with 80 percent and 83.3 percent. Or that only half of the students who do graduate are prepared for college-level work, according to the standards of the City University of New York. Nor did he argue for the importance of renewing mayoral control of schools, which is set to lapse on July 1 if Albany does not extend it, or of the state providing the city the additional $1.6 billion in annual school funding that it is owed under a 2006 court ruling. There was not a word about his $760 million school turnaround program, known as Renewal. Aaron Pallas, a professor of sociology and education at Columbia University Teachers College, said he interpreted the decision to focus the speech narrowly on affordable housing and jobs as an effort to target the economic concerns that appear to be foremost in the minds of voters in the city and nationally. But he said it could also reflect that the mayor doesn’t have a distinct vision for the schools heading into a possible second term. In Mr. de Blasio’s first term, the prekindergarten expansion, which he first proposed as a mayoral candidate, was “clearly the major policy to be implemented, and I think that has been successful,” Professor Pallas said. “But in other respects I don’t think there’s been a very clear agenda with regard to the direction of the school system.” "

Trump became the 45th president of the United States, a flurry of executive orders, court rulings, presidential nominations and confirmation hearings have brought questions about the roles of the three branches of government to the center of national discourse. Even teenagers think “civics is cool” again, according to this Times article: In this lesson, students use current events to analyze how our constitutional system of checks and balances works, and they investigate executive orders to see how these particular presidential actions fit within that system. How are you teaching this topic? Let us know. _________ Before moving forward with this lesson, students need to understand some basic concepts about the U.S. government. To gauge how much background you will need to teach, you might first ask your students to do a K/W/L chart listing what they know, or think they know, about this topic already. In short: The principle of separation of powers is the underlying reason the federal government is divided into three branches (executive, legislative and judicial), with each branch wielding different powers established in the Constitution. This division of powers among the three branches operates as a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power. For example, the president can negotiate a treaty with a foreign government, but the Senate has to approve it for the treaty to become binding. And, if a president commits treason or bribery, Congress can impeach him or her. The Government Publishing Office provides a primer on the three branches and the system of checks and balances. This diagram offers a helpful illustration, and the Crash Course video above can provide more depth. You can find many more resources online, such as this lesson from the National Archives and this one from EDSITEment, that include activities like studying the grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence (to understand the colonists’ desire to prevent another kingship), watching Schoolhouse Rock’s “Three-Ring Circus,” and analyzing past events to see how checks and balances have operated in history (such as during school desegregation in the 1950s and the declaration of war after the attack on Pearl Harbor). Once students have an understanding of checks and balances, they are ready to do the activities described below. "

In a Twitter rant that extended into work hours, Mr. Trump at once dismissed the entire Russia story as “fake” and made up, and pledged to hunt down the officials in the government who have supplied the details. He demanded an apology from the “failing” New York Times and accused the news media of making up stories and sources, even as he said he wanted those sources apprehended. The posts, which started around 7 a.m. and stretched past 9 a.m., appear calculated to antagonize intelligence agencies and keep supporters trained on the news media. The president is planning a campaign rally in Florida on Saturday. Republican leaders may be growing weary. In an interview with the conservative Weekly Standard, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Mr. Trump’s approval ratings — abysmal for a new president at around 40 percent — would be “10 to 15 points higher if he allowed himself to stay on message.” Mr. McConnell singled out the president’s Twitter comments. “What he’s saying makes everything harder,” the majority leader said.

One of the most maddening things about the constant contact between the Trump Administration and Russian officials before the election, says Mr. Rosenthal, is that President Trump and his team are trying to make this about leaks. “This is not just about the leaked email at this point, Mr. President. This is about your national security adviser undermining the foreign policy of the United States before and giving a serious adversary a little heads-up, in private, about a matter of grave national security.” Last, the good news. Mr. Rosenthal says the positive point is the press. “It is great to see invaluable and irreplaceable news organizations like The Washington Post and The New York Times doing their vital work without pause,” continuing to uncover the truth about Michael T. Flynn’s phone calls and contacts between other Trump officials and the Russian security apparatus. Susan Lehman is host. "

Absent sanctions, Mr. Poroshenko argues, President Vladimir V. Putin would have no reason to stop supporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine, and Russian aggression could spread through Eastern Europe and beyond. President Trump’s attitude toward Moscow has been one of the major questions during his campaign and his first days in office. What little is known of Mr. Trump’s phone conversations with Mr. Putin and Mr. Poroshenko offers little enlightenment; nor is it fully clear what Michael Flynn said to the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, that cost Mr. Flynn his job as national security adviser. In the heat of the furor over Mr. Flynn, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, declared on Tuesday that Mr. Trump has made it clear he expects Russia to “de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea.” Mr. Trump, he said, “has been incredibly tough on Russia.” What that really means, however, is evidently not entirely clear in Moscow or Kiev, and the Kremlin, for one, has wasted no time in testing his resolve.

373,Trump’s Nominee for Israel Envoy Apologizes for ‘Hurtful Words’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/david-friedman-trump-nominee-israel-envoy-apologizes.html?searchResultPosition=51,2017/02/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer with no diplomatic experience, apologized on Thursday for his language during the “highly charged presidential campaign,” an apparent reference to his comments comparing liberal American Jews to the Jews who aided the Nazis in the Holocaust. Appearing before senators for his confirmation hearing, Mr. Friedman — a former campaign adviser who has aligned himself with the Israeli far right and questioned the need for a two-state solution — spoke broadly of regretting his language and promised to be “respectful and measured” if confirmed. “The inflammatory rhetoric that accompanied the presidential campaign is entirely over,” he said. Mr. Friedman came under fire last year for an op-ed he wrote for the website of Arutz Sheva, an Israeli news organization, in which he said supporters of the liberal Jewish lobbying organization J Street were “far worse than kapos,” the Jews who cooperated with the Nazis. As prolific as he is provocative, Mr. Friedman has also drawn condemnation for lobbing accusations of anti-Semitism against President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and others. And among his criticisms of sitting senators — who now stand in judgment of his fitness for the post — he once slammed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, for not doing enough to derail the Iran nuclear deal, saying Mr. Schumer was “validating the worst appeasement of terrorism since Munich.” Despite his expression of contrition, several Democratic senators criticized him as unsuited to a diplomatic post, let alone one as critical as the ambassadorship to Israel. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s top Democrat, pressed Mr. Friedman on his apology, pointing out that his remarks during the campaign were written, meaning he would have had time to carefully choose his words.

Some readers questioned whether the actions of Mr. Trump’s campaign staff and associates were treasonous. “I’m trying to figure out one scenario where the Trump campaign having repeated contacts with Russian intelligence during the campaign is NOT treasonous. Either they were collaborating with the Russians or they were private citizens engaging in foreign diplomacy. Neither is OK.” — Dan in Atlanta “These Russian contacts could, potentially, be treason. That puts this at a whole other level. Things are moving at warp speed by D.C. standards. Something big is happening, very big.” — RBS in Maine _____ But many readers were more concerned about United States officials disclosing information about the contacts with Russian intelligence officials. “Why are intel officers leaking classified investigations?

Mr. Mattis’s rejection of stronger ties, made during a NATO meeting in Brussels, came amid a flurry of mixed messages about the outlook for improvement in the American-Russian relationship under the Trump administration. He spoke as Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the top United States military officer, was meeting with his Russian counterpart for the first time in almost three years. And it came on the same day that President Vladimir V. Putin called for Russian intelligence agencies to bolster ties with the American intelligence community in the fight against terrorism. “Restoring dialogue with the special services of the United States and other NATO members is in our mutual interest,” Mr. Putin told the country’s F.S.B. intelligence agency in a televised speech. His comments, coming as Mr. Trump was using his Twitter account to denounce leaks from the American intelligence community, were greeted with surprise among some United States officials. Mr. Mattis, for his part, made clear that his criticism of Russia had not changed. Appearing before reporters, Mr. Mattis, a former Marine general, said Russia needed to “live by international law like we expect all mature nations on this planet to do.” There was no doubt, he added, that Russia had “interfered or attempted to interfere in a number of elections,” implying, although not specifically saying, that the Russians had meddled in the process that led to his own boss’s election as president.

376,"Hearing for Neil Gorsuch, Supreme Court Nominee, Is Set for March",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate-hearing.html?searchResultPosition=48,2017/02/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Senate hearing on Judge Neil M. Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court will begin on March 20, the Judiciary Committee said on Thursday, setting the stage for one of the most contested judicial confirmations in a generation. Democrats, still angry that Republicans refused to allow President Barack Obama to fill the seat over the last 11 months of his presidency, have vowed tough questioning of Judge Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump on Jan. 31. Despite the judge’s strong legal credentials, some Democrats are likely to oppose him, with many people on the left demanding that they push back against Mr. Trump in any way they can. Democrats have also argued that the court seat was effectively stolen by Senate Republicans, who refused to hold hearings or a vote on Mr. Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Republicans hold a 52-seat majority in the Senate, but they would need some Democratic votes to reach 60 and break a possible filibuster. That raises the prospect that Republicans could change Senate rules to prohibit, for the first time in two centuries, the use of the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. Mr. Trump has encouraged Republicans to employ this so-called nuclear option. The vacancy that Judge Gorsuch would fill, left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, is on track to be the longest opening on the court since the 1860s. Justice Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016, and the March 20 date means that the hearing would begin 401 days later. Questioning of Judge Gorsuch will begin on March 21, and the hearing will last three or four days. A confirmation vote by the full Senate would not be held any earlier than April. The longest Supreme Court vacancy in the past century and a half was 391 days, after the resignation of Justice Abe Fortas in 1969. If not for the blocking of Judge Garland, Judge Gorsuch, 49, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, might not be considered a contentious choice. Democrats who have met with him say he has failed to sufficiently answer some basic questions they believe are critical to making a proper assessment of him, including whether he would serve as a check on what they view as Mr. Trump’s overreach. “The judge was clearly very smart, articulate and polite, with superb judicial demeanor,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, wrote in an Op-Ed in The New York Times. “But over the course of an hour, he refused to answer even the most rudimentary questions.” In the last 25 years, the closest Supreme Court confirmation vote was 58 to 42, for Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006 "

Feinberg, a billionaire investor and a member of his economic advisory council, to lead an assessment of spy operations. The possibility has top intelligence officials on edge and fearing that a review by a Trump ally with no intelligence experience would stifle their independence. The president has blamed leaks from the agencies for the departure of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, and for reports that aides met repeatedly with Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 campaign. Russia dismissed those reports. • American foreign policy takes shape. During a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump said that he could “live with” a one-state option for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, discarding the approach that underpinned the U.S. role in Middle East peacemaking for decades.

Mr. Mulvaney was confirmed to lead the White House Office of Management and Budget by a vote of 51 to 49, narrowly making the cut over a unified front of Democrats, joined by Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee who accused Mr. Mulvaney of being antimilitary. Mr. McCain was angered by Mr. Mulvaney’s support for firm spending limits on the Defense Department. “I will vote to oppose Congressman Mulvaney’s nomination because it would be irresponsible to place the future of the defense budget in the hands of a person with such a record and judgment on national security,” Mr. McCain said. Mr. Mulvaney enters the job with a busy agenda, because the administration must prepare a budget and address raising the debt limit in the coming weeks. The Trump administration has also promised to roll out a tax plan in short order. Mr. Mulvaney’s views favoring drastic changes to Medicare and raising the eligibility age for Social Security put him at odds with Mr. Trump, who campaigned as the candidate who would protect those popular entitlement programs. Mr. Mulvaney was blamed by Democrats and some Republicans for orchestrating a government shutdown during the Obama era. His stands on spending may also clash with Mr. Trump’s promises of big, new investments in the military and infrastructure. "

I’ve been telling you for like a year! There’s something weird going on between Trump and the Russians!” Mr. Colbert said. It’s a bold claim, but two days after the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser, the topic was too big for the late-night shows to avoid.

Since the election of Donald Trump, the Republican Party has embarked on a concerted attack on organized labor and public education. Republican senators have introduced a “right to work” bill that would extend the anti-union provisions common in Southern states to the rest of the country. Betsy DeVos, the newly confirmed secretary of Education, is a strong advocate of privatizing public schools. At the same time, Republican statehouses are redoubling their efforts to gut public universities. Take Iowa, where we live, and where Republicans control both branches of the state legislature. On Thursday, lawmakers passed a bill that, if signed into law by Gov. Terry Branstad, would drastically reduce the collective bargaining rights of most of the state’s public employees. The proposed law would allow government agencies to unilaterally reduce or eliminate the health insurance and other employment benefits of more than 180,000 public servants, including nurses, schoolteachers and college instructors. The bill is similar to an anti-union push by Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, which by some accounts reduced public-sector workers’ take-home pay by about 10 percent. At the University of Iowa, where we are graduate students and unionized public employees, this assault on organized labor threatens not only our compensation, but also the quality of our education and that of our students. The Iowa Writers’ Workshop and the nonfiction writing program, where we are students, have put our state on the global literary stage. Together, the programs have produced numerous Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award and Man Booker Award winners. This remarkable record is possible in part because Iowa, unlike many universities, offers M.F.A. students a living wage, excellent health care and a full scholarship. This funding package allows the university to recruit some of the world’s most promising writers and ensures that Iowa remains accessible to students from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. "

Mr. Trudeau, who talked about the “important bedrock of common values” of peace and justice shared by Canadians and Europeans, did not once mention Britain, the Commonwealth (of which Canada is a member) or the United States in the prepared text of his 1,500-word speech. It was a subtle indication, perhaps, of the reshaping of the trans-Atlantic order, and the world itself, by the political events of 2016. Mr. Trudeau’s speech here in Strasbourg, a potent symbol of the French-German alliance that is at the core of the European Union, came a day after the European Parliament ratified a landmark trade deal that many economists and other observers see as a counterweight to the protectionist policies supported by Mr. Trump. Seven years in the making, the deal slashes tariffs on industrial and agricultural products and opens up the services sector in areas like cargo shipping, telecommunications and financial services. And yet it nearly fell through: In October, Mr. Trudeau had to postpone a trip to Brussels until concessions were made by the Belgian government, including promises to protect farmers that put the deal back on track. Mr. Trudeau indirectly alluded on Thursday to the anxieties that have propelled populist movements, especially immigration, which is a major worry for the British voters who decided to leave the European Union and for the American voters who put Mr. Trump, a political outsider, into the White House.

Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general. In Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump has chosen a nominee with deep experience in labor relations, law and education. The pick answers concerns about the lack of diversity in the Trump administration, in that Mr. Acosta would be the first Hispanic in the president’s cabinet. And his chances of being confirmed appear relatively high, since Mr. Acosta, currently the dean of Florida International University’s law school, has made it through the Senate process three times for different roles. “Alex is going to be a key part of achieving our goal of revitalizing the American economy, manufacturing and labor force,” Mr. Trump said as he called on the Senate to confirm Mr. Acosta swiftly. A Miami native, Mr. Acosta’s most relevant experience to the job of labor secretary is his time at the National Labor Relations Board, where he was a member from 2002 to 2003, under President George W. Bush. Mr. Bush later tapped Mr. Acosta to be assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil rights division, one of the highest positions at the agency. He went on to become the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where his office prosecuted the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the terrorism suspect Jose Padilla and founders of the Cali cartel. He achieved the conviction of Charles Taylor Jr., the son of Liberia’s former leader, for torture. His official biography said his office also prosecuted several bank-related cases and targeted health care fraud. Mr. Acosta’s record and writings will undergo close scrutiny in the weeks before his confirmation hearing. But some of the most outspoken skeptics of the previous labor nominee, the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder, have already expressed optimism and open-mindedness about Mr. Acosta. "

That uncomfortable question came to mind as I read articles over the past week of the growing numbers of raids, roundups, the knocks on the door, the flooding of “target-rich environments,” a phrase an anonymous immigration official used in speaking to The Washington Post. What’s a target-rich environment? “Big cities,” the official explained, “tend to have a lot of illegal immigrants.” Clearly, with President Trump’s executive orders having expanded the category of immigrants deemed worth pursuing and deporting, the gloves are off. There’s been plenty of news coverage of this development, but few reminders of the context in which the pursuers have been freed from previous restraints. So it’s worth noting that the union representing some 5,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents actually endorsed Mr. Trump in September, the first time the union endorsed a candidate for president. In an inflammatory statement posted on the Trump campaign’s website, Chris Crane, president of the union, the National ICE Council, complained that under President Obama, “our officers are prevented from enforcing the most basic immigration laws.” The statement went on to say that while Mr. Trump had pledged in a meeting to “support ICE officers, our nation’s laws and our members,” Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan was “total amnesty plus open borders.” That everything in that statement except for the reference to Mr. Trump was untrue is not the point. (Far from failing to enforce the law, the Obama administration deported more than 400,000 unauthorized immigrants a year, and Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival endorsed neither total amnesty nor open borders.) Rather, the statement is evidence of how openly these law enforcement officers have been chafing at the bit to do their jobs as they please. "

The issue splits traditional Democratic constituencies. It pits groups with competing material interests against each other, but it also brings those with vested psychological interests into conflict as Hispanics, African-Americans, labor and liberal advocacy groups clash over their conception of territoriality, political ownership and cultural identity. In the fall of 2015, as the presidential campaign began to heat up, Hillary Clinton broke with the Obama administration over its ongoing deportation of undocumented immigrants. During an appearance on Telemundo on Oct. 5, Clinton told María Celeste Arrarás that Obama’s policies were too punitive: Clearly, Clinton’s attack on Obama’s relatively stringent deportation policy was devised to maximize Hispanic turnout in the 2016 election. Did the strategy work? The evidence is mixed. A comparison of national exit polls from 2008, 2012 and 2016 shows that Hispanic turnout grew slightly, from 9 percent of the total vote in 2008 to 10 percent in 2012 to 11 percent in 2016. But any gain that might have accrued to Clinton from the increase was eliminated by the fact that her margin of victory among Latinos, 66 percent, was 5 points below Obama’s haul in 2012. In any analysis of the 2016 vote, it is difficult to separate the issues of immigration and free trade. In an October 2016 report, Pew found that Trump voters were decisively more hostile to both free trade agreements and immigration than the general public, and much more hostile than Clinton supporters. A detailed analysis of exit polls in four key states that helped deliver the election to Donald Trump — Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — produced interesting findings not only about Hispanics, but also African-Americans — who are less supportive of liberal immigration policies than other core Democratic constituencies — and whites. In each of these states, opposition to immigration was higher than the national average. "

The remarks, delivered at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, caused anger and bafflement among Palestinians. “This is going to give Israel a free hand to do what it wants,” an academic in Gaza said. _____ • In Brussels, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called on European allies to spend more on their militaries. “Americans cannot care more for your children’s future security than you do,” Mr. Mattis said in his first speech to NATO partners.

They go together like mac and cheese. Twitter and Trump. But not at a 120-year-old, six-story apartment building with low- and moderate-income tenants on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The basement boiler and electrical switchgear were flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and as winter approached that year, the building’s 30 apartments were without power, heat and hot water for weeks. “Everyone sheltered in place,” said Richard Ramirez, a senior property manager at the Lower East Side People’s Mutual Housing Association, the nonprofit that owns and manages the building at 334 East Eighth Street, near Tompkins Square Park. “Where else were they going to go?” The association, which runs 37 buildings in the area, did not want a repeat. So it installed a new gas-fired boiler, this time putting it in an enclosure on the roof. The boiler began supplying heat and hot water last month. Across the country, cellar-dwelling utilities are being moved farther and farther upstairs. In new buildings going up in identified flood plains, mechanical systems are being constructed at least several feet above expected flood levels. Even in existing buildings, plenty of retrofitting is underway. “These buildings are so precious,” said Laurie J. Schoeman, the national program director for resilience at Enterprise Community Partners, which helped finance a rehabilitation of 334 East Eighth Street in 1993. “You’re not going to be able to replace this affordable housing for low-income residents.” "

The rally, to be held in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla., is an indication that Mr. Trump, who has sometimes felt isolated in the White House, is eager to get outside of Washington and relive the rapturous reception that greeted him during the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump exulted in large crowds assembled at cavernous venues throughout his 2016 bid, and spent the first days of his presidency quibbling over how many Americans attended his inauguration. On Wednesday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump answered a question about whether his administration was flirting with xenophobia and racism in part by noting the support he received in the election. “I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had — 306 Electoral College votes,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s tremendous enthusiasm out there.” Not long after, in a posting on Twitter, Mr. Trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the Saturday evening event, which will take place just up the coast from his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach where he plans to spend the weekend. It will be his third weekend in a row on Florida’s Gold Coast. “We are going to put America back to work,” a message accompanying the posting said. “We are going to put people before government.” "

But the show had another Clinton figure all along: Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), who hired, befriended and ultimately fell out with Alicia. A leonine liberal not allergic to money or a highball of fine Scotch, she rose in a boy’s club through alliances, compromise and knowing how much of herself to conceal. Diane begins “The Good Fight” ready for a change. Like certain other people of her political persuasion recently, she meets a less happy kind of change than she was expecting. But for her — and for this improbable but promising spinoff — it ends up being an invigorating new start. The series opens a year after the end of “The Good Wife,” in which Diane hauled off and smacked Alicia for revealing, in order to win a court case, that Diane’s husband, Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), had had an affair. Now, Diane is leaving her Chicago law firm and shopping — alone — for a retirement vineyard in Provence. That sounds like the premise of a typical TV spinoff (Frasier moving to Seattle, Rhoda to New York). But “The Good Fight” does not find Diane struggling to grow a decent carignan or getting to know her quirky Provençal neighbors. Her nest egg was invested with two of her oldest friends, Henry and Lenore Rindell (Paul Guilfoyle and Bernadette Peters), who plowed it into a Ponzi scheme. Effectively broke and jobless, she’s forced to start over. "
394,Jordan Peele on a Truly Terrifying Monster: Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/movies/jordan-peele-interview-get-out.html?searchResultPosition=75,2017/02/16,MOVIES,"No serious fan of the sketch comedy show “Key & Peele” will be surprised that Jordan Peele (the shorter half of its starring duo) is making his directorial debut with a horror film. Their acclaimed Comedy Central series may have been best known for President Obama’s “anger translator,” but it often lampooned scary movies with a specificity that could come only from a connoisseur of things that go bump in the night. (No one has made a funnier parody of “The Shining.”) In his new movie, “Get Out,” he plays the scares straight, writing and directing the rare horror movie that tackles racial politics head on. In a scenario that has been described as “The Stepford Wives” meets “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), an African-American photographer, is about to meet his white girlfriend’s parents for the first time when he’s rattled to learn that she has not told them he is black. His anxiety increases when her father goes out of his way to tell him that he would have voted for Mr. Obama for a third term and when the forced smiles of the parents’ exclusively black servants start seeming a little uncanny. Racial micro-aggressions and ominous signs (bad dreams, dead animals) mount, as this fish-out-of-water story takes a foreboding turn. “Get Out” is not the first horror film to confront race. In 1968, right after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “Night of the Living Dead” resonated with audiences and some critics by presenting a black man’s torment by a mob of white zombies before he is killed by law enforcement. Other horror movies like “Candyman” and “Ganja & Hess” have explored miscegenation and assimilation, but Mr. Peele said he set out to make a movie that exposed “the lie” of a post-racial America, one that grew after the election of Mr. Obama. In an interview at a hotel bar near Columbus Circle, Mr. Peele, who turns 38 this month, recalled the time his white girlfriend took him to meet her parents, discussed why he wanted to make a horror movie for black audiences and explained why the movie takes aim at, in his words, the “liberal elite.” Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What do horror and comedy have in common? The best comedy and horror feel like they take place in reality. You have a rule or two you are bending or heightening, but the world around it is real. I felt like everything I learned in comedy I could apply to this movie. "

After moving to start rolling back the Affordable Care Act just days after President Trump was sworn in last month, Republican lawmakers and Mr. Trump have yet to deliver on any of the sweeping legislation they promised. Efforts to come up with a replacement for the health care law have been stymied by disagreements among Republicans about how to proceed. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said his administration was running like a “fine-tuned machine” and he promised health care legislation would be offered in March, followed by a tax code overhaul. The large infrastructure bill that both Democrats and Mr. Trump were eager to pursue has barely been mentioned, other than a very general hearing to discuss well-documented needs for infrastructure improvements. Even a simple emergency spending bill that the Trump administration promised weeks ago — which was expected to include a proposal for his wall on the Mexican border — has not materialized, leaving appropriators idle and checking Twitter. At this point in Barack Obama’s presidency, when Democrats controlled Washington, Congress had passed a stimulus bill totaling nearly $1 trillion to address the financial crisis, approved a measure preventing pay discrimination, expanded a children’s health insurance program, and begun laying the groundwork for major health care and financial regulation bills. President George W. Bush came into office with a congressional blueprint for his signature education act, No Child Left Behind. But in the 115th Congress, the Senate has done little more than struggle to confirm Mr. Trump’s nominees, and Republicans ultimately helped force his choice for labor secretary, Andrew F. Puzder, to withdraw from consideration on Wednesday in the face of unified Democratic opposition. "
396,"Fake News, Fake Ukrainians: How a Group of Russians Tilted a Dutch Vote",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-fake-news-dutch-vote.html?searchResultPosition=73,2017/02/16,EUROPE,"THE HAGUE — Harry van Bommel, a left-wing member of the Dutch Parliament, had persuasive allies in convincing voters that they should reject a trade pact with Ukraine — his special “Ukrainian team,” a gleefully contrarian group of émigrés whose sympathies lay with Russia. They attended public meetings, appeared on television and used social media to denounce Ukraine’s pro-Western government as a bloodthirsty kleptocracy, unworthy of Dutch support. As Mr. Van Bommel recalled, it “was very handy to show that not all Ukrainians were in favor.” Handy but also misleading: The most active members of the Ukrainian team were actually from Russia, or from breakaway Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine, and parroted the Kremlin line. The Dutch referendum, held last April, became a battering ram aimed at the European Union. With turnout low, Dutch voters rejected the trade agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, delighting Moscow, emboldening pro-Russia populists around Europe and leaving political elites aghast. It is unclear whether the Ukrainian team was directed by Russia or if it was acting out of shared sympathies, and Mr. Van Bommel said he never checked their identities. But Europe’s political establishment, already rattled by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the election of President Trump in the United States, is worried that the Netherlands referendum could foreshadow what is to come. With elections slated for France, Germany and possibly Italy this year, officials across Europe are warning that the Russians are actively interfering, echoing the Central Intelligence Agency’s assertions that Moscow meddled in the United States presidential election.

397,The Ultimate Pursuit in Hunting: Sheep,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/sports/bighorn-sheep-hunting.html?searchResultPosition=72,2017/02/16,SPORTS,"ROCKY BOY’S RESERVATION, Mont. — For the herd of bighorn sheep, the rocky cliffs were a safe place, with 360-degree views and plenty of nooks to blend into the gray rocks. The ground was sprinkled with scat, and the air carried a scent like a barnyard. Thousands of feet below, the landscape unfurled into a smooth checkerboard of ranch land that stretched to the horizon. The only threat up here would be to newborn lambs, susceptible to being plucked away by eagles. Crouched behind a stand of rocks last spring, Brendan Burns, a 38-year-old with a growing reputation as sheep hunter and guide, peered over the edge, careful not to be seen or heard. Wild sheep have acute senses, and when they spook, they bolt as one, like a flock of birds. But the sheep were not home. Amid the panorama below, Burns spotted a constellation of tiny dots in a faraway meadow. The horns gave them away. “There aren’t a lot of circles in the wild,” Burns whispered. “When you see something curved — and they kind of shine, they have this kind of glow to them — you learn to pick them up. You just train your eye to it.” He pulled a high-powered Swarovski scope from his pack and aimed it downhill. Eight years before, there were no sheep here. Then 21 ewes and five juvenile rams were transplanted to the Rocky Boy’s Reservation of the Chippewa Cree, which straddles part of the Bears Paw Mountains, an islandlike rise on the plains. The herd quickly grew to 100, and 40 were relocated to South Dakota. It has again grown over 100, and another 40 are likely to be transplanted this spring, part of broad attempts to replant sheep populations that are a fraction of what they once were in the West. “There’s obviously no coyotes around, for them to be that low and feel comfortable,” Burns whispered. “This is a nice day to be a sheep.” "
398,Letter of Recommendation: Presidential Biographies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-presidential-biographies.html?searchResultPosition=79,2017/02/16,MAGAZINE,"Late last year I started reading a biography of Chester A. Arthur. Quickly, I began to feel as if I’d wandered into the plot of a Philip K. Dick novel, or succumbed to an especially unnerving fever dream. The book, by Zachary Karabell, tells the story of a deeply unpopular and untrustworthy New Yorker who, against all odds, achieves the presidency. Arthur, a mutton-chopped emblem of the political-patronage culture of the day, was never even elected to the highest office. His ascent was made possible by Charles J. Guiteau, the man who gunned down President James Garfield in a railroad station, thus promoting Arthur from the vice presidency. To contemporaries, the situation seemed dire. Arthur’s administration surely would be defined by unprecedented greed and corruption, full of woefully underqualified appointees lacking any experience in government. Even the most optimistic American could hardly have imagined that Arthur’s presidency would be a success. But as I continued reading, I was astonished to discover that Arthur redeemed himself. He championed civil-service reform, hobbling the “spoils system” with which he had been so closely associated. He restored faith in the presidency, and faith in what the presidency can restore in its occupants. “No man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur,” wrote the Gilded Age journalist Alexander K. McClure, “and no one ever retired ... more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe.” I finished the biography in late 2016, but found myself still carrying it with me as Donald J. Trump prepared to take office. I wasn’t rereading it, not exactly. Sometimes, when my dog lingered by a particularly intriguing tree, I’d open it up to a passage I’d marked. Other times, it served as a base for my phone, as if it were in conversation with the disquieting tweets I scrolled through. And during those notably edgy moments in late January, I’d hold onto it tight, like a security blanket, or just want it nearby, so that I could occasionally tap on it like a talisman. As an American historian, I’ve long relied on presidential biographies for edification and pleasure. If I’m using biographies to write a book or an essay, I have them propped up on a stand, next to my highlighters, pencils, Post-it Notes and paper clips. But now my work doubles as an antidepressant; these books are rife with the kind of horrors that led half of the country to believe, at any given time, that they were living out the end of the American experiment.

He placed a small white flag at the end of every 16th row to show his employees where they should place his beehives. Every so often, he fingered the buds on the trees. “It won’t be long,” he said. Mr. Adee (pronounced Ay-Dee) is America’s largest beekeeper, and this is his busy season. Some 92,000 hives had to be deployed before those buds burst into blossom so that his bees could get to the crucial work of pollination. But it is notable that he has a business at all. For the last decade, a mysterious plague has killed billions of bees every year. “Every year at this time of year, we wonder are there going to be enough bees,” said Bob Curtis, director of agricultural affairs at the Almond Board, a trade group for almond growers. Pollination services, as the bees’ work is known in the industry, has risen this year to between $180 to $200 a hive from an average of $154 a hive in 2006, Mr. Curtis said. "

Now, in the wake of President Trump’s broad executive orders on deporting undocumented immigrants, Suffolk County police officials are wrestling with a conundrum facing police departments across the country: how to shut down a violent gang when the immigrants they will need as witnesses and tipsters may be afraid to come forward. “The last thing I want is a fearful community,” the Suffolk County police commissioner, Timothy Sini, said in a recent interview. “Whether it’s fear of criminals or fear of law enforcement. We solve crimes based on people coming to us. It’s that simple. If people think they’re going to get deported every time they speak to a police officer, it’s not helpful.” Part of the issue is that Mr. Trump wants local police officers to act as immigration agents, threatening to withhold federal funding from those departments that do not cooperate. So Mr. Sini is far from alone in trying to balance public safety with the threat of losing millions of dollars in funding. Last month, the International Association of Chiefs of Police issued a statement saying that it would “strongly oppose any initiative that would mandate that state and local law enforcement agencies play a role in the enforcement of federal immigration law.” The chiefs urged “clear guidance” on how, or even whether, to make local policy changes. Sanctuary cities, which limit their agencies and local law enforcement officials from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, are facing a similar question. "

But when she showed up this month at David Geffen Hall to see the Budapest Festival Orchestra, she was barred from attending when she refused to remove an 8-by-11-inch sign affixed to the back of her jacket. It read: “NO! In the name of humanity we refuse to accept a fascist America.” Ms. Heinz, 72, said she had been wearing the sign since she attended a protest outside Trump Tower in November. Though she had been looking forward to seeing the orchestra, partly because one of its cellists was almost stopped from entering the United States by President Trump’s travel ban, she said that, given a choice between the performance and the sign, she chose the sign. “At what point does one draw the line?” she said recently by phone. “We’re talking about freedom of expression.” Officials at Lincoln Center refunded Ms. Heinz’s ticket, but this week they declined to discuss why she had been blocked from the performance. Ms. Heinz, though, said in an interview that during a later meeting she had with center officials — arranged by the civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel — the institution’s vice president for concert halls and operations, Peter Flamm, told her that signs were not allowed inside the performance halls or on the plaza outside. The dispute seems to illustrate the conflict between those who view cultural institutions as bastions of free thought that should embrace activism and those who think that, to protect the primacy of the performance, political statements should be limited to those made by the artists and the art.

But a few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and saw a new shot of my mom, grim of face and wet of hair, wrapped in a silvery warming blanket, in front of a row full of gym lockers. “Had to take refuge outside from pool during call-in threat that caused J.C.C. evacuation,” she’d written. “Pool and nursery school evacuated.” I went to my Facebook page to share Fran’s post and asked if anyone had more information. People did, but not just from Connecticut, where my mom was swimming at the Jewish community center in West Hartford. “Second time in two weeks down here at the J.C.C. in Delaware. My kids go to the preschool and have been evacuated both times,” one friend wrote. Another said: “I just got an alert that the J.C.C. in Marin, Calif., was evacuated due to a threat. The hate seems to be spreading like wildfire.” And another: “At 11:45 they evacuated our J.C.C. in West Bloomfield, Mich. I live directly across the street, and all seems quiet there.” On the day my mom was forced to get out of the pool, Jan. 18, 26 J.C.C.s in 17 states were the targets of bomb threats. Even if my mom hadn’t posted her wet-faced selfie, it would have felt personal. I’ve probably spent an entire year of my life in the J.C.C. in West Hartford. When I was 3 years old, I went to preschool there. When I was 15, I spent six weeks in Israel on a trip run by the J. When my first book was published, one of the first places to invite me to speak was my Jewish community center. I’ve now spoken in J.C.C.s from San Diego and San Francisco to St. Louis to Atlanta. My nanna spent the last months of her life in the Meer Apartments, on the campus of the J.C.C. in West Bloomfield. Every time I visit my mom, we drive to West Hartford to work out and swim. If synagogue is where Jews feel the most Jewish — praying in a foreign language, celebrating holidays that aren’t always on the office calendar — the J.C.C. is where many of the nation’s estimated 5.3 million Jews feel the most Jewish American. It’s the place they go to do all kinds of nonreligious stuff. "

Jim Mattis, now secretary of defense, carries a copy of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations” on deployments. All of these brilliant minds shaped failing strategies in our unending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

No, not by creating it. That dark art seems to emanate from other, even more opaque branches of the Russian government. Rather, Maria V. Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, unveiled a new section on its website meant to highlight articles that it considers to be fake news, including one by The New York Times. Just in case anybody missed the point, each article on the Foreign Ministry website carried a big red label reading “FAKE” in English and a line saying that the information in the article “does not correspond to reality.” Russia actually announced something of a fake news double whammy, since the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told Parliament on Wednesday that the military had created a special task force assigned to wage information warfare, although he did not provide any details. That was no surprise to officials in the United States and Europe, who have been grappling with the Kremlin’s information warfare for at least the last two years. The Foreign Ministry’s new venture in singling out fake news seemed to fit a pattern identified by many analysts of creating alternative realities meant to sow confusion in people’s minds, in that way discrediting all news sources. It was hard for some critics to take the ministry’s fake news detector seriously, and some suggested that inclusion there was something of a badge of honor, an indication that the article had hit close to home.

Now, to satisfy a presidential campaign promise playing to America’s worst fears, we are terrorizing these contributors to our economy and breaking up families. Given that employers must certify worker eligibility under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, I suspect that only collusion or tacit government approval explains how we accumulated so many illegal foreign workers in the first place. Deporting dangerous criminals is one thing, but let’s not kid ourselves about the role that most of the people being demonized fill in our society. Given that President Trump’s own businesses have needed to import help, why can’t our representatives address this issue honestly and intelligently to achieve win-win outcomes for both employers and people simply seeking a better life? KATHLEEN CLARK Doylestown, Pa. To the Editor: I am a member of the National Guard and a lawyer practicing immigration law in Minnesota. In 2013, President Obama, at the express request of the Defense Department, created a program for military families to prevent the deportation of military spouses, parents and children. This program alleviated a major source of anxiety and fear for service members and their families. I have personally experienced the hardship of deployments to combat zones, and know the incredible importance of family stability during that trying time. This week, this administration rescinded the Parole in Place program, harming thousands of military families across the country. This is another example of the careless excess of the administration’s immigration policy. It is unconscionable to reverse a policy that strengthens our military and our veterans. That the program was not even named in the memo demonstrates either a lack of awareness, or worse, a casual disregard of the effect that this will have on those most vulnerable members of our military.

If you are divorced and both you and your ex are willing to be interviewed for this series, please fill out our submission form.  For Christine Langlois, 64, and Terry Langlois, 69, a midlife marriage hit roadblocks as optimism was crushed beneath old behaviors. For him, it was a fifth marriage, for her, a second. Still, as each recovered, they continued to mine their behavior for clues about future relationships while valuing a deep friendship, which endures. Where did they grow up? Terry grew up in Michigan, part of a blended family that he says didn’t blend. He worked in factories to put himself through college. Christine also grew up in Michigan, in a wealthy suburb; her father was a neurosurgeon and the family was well off, but her parents’ marriage wasn’t a happy one. They divorced after she left home. “But compared to Terry,” she said, “my upbringing was a walk in the park.” How did they meet? It was 2004, and they lived on the same street in Grand Rapids. One day while cycling she saw him with a friend on his porch. She stopped to say hello and a friendship blossomed, then a romance. He was dating someone else at the time, but soon stopped to have a relationship with her. They had a two-year courtship during which they broke up several times. What did they like about the other? “Terry is really smart, extremely funny, very giving, and the sweetest man you could ever meet,” she said. She also said “everyone in his presence feels better for being around him.” They laughed a lot, and were very attracted to each other. “Christine is classy, very intelligent and a life learner,” he said, noting that he admired her curiosity especially.

Six years later, his company, Moven, has opened only 60,000 of those new bank accounts. Mr. King has now transitioned to selling his software to the banks he once scorned, who use it as a component of their mobile apps. “We realized that if you want millions of users as a bank, it is a very different proposition than building a social media network,” he said. Silicon Valley has upended a growing number of industries, and it had seemed not too long ago that Wall Street would soon be next. A flurry of financial start-ups rose quickly and grabbed billions of dollars in investments. Mr. King is just one of the many technology entrepreneurs who have since recently run into the enormous moats that surround and protect the existing financial industry. "

Biden Jr. is pleading again with the voters of Delaware. His brow furrowed and his voice urgent, he urges them in a new television commercial to rouse themselves to the polls. “This race is consequential,” the former vice president says in the ad. “It’s all about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be O.K.’” He won Delaware seven times as a candidate for the United States Senate and twice as Barack Obama’s running mate, but Mr. Biden has now thrown himself into a contest fought on the smallest of political stages: an off-year special election for a seat in the Delaware State Legislature. With his party’s control of the small state in peril, he has returned to the campaign trail, barely a month after leaving office, with a zeal that has surprised even local Democrats: Mr. Biden has raised money for Stephanie Hansen, the Democratic nominee in a State Senate contest this Saturday, and appeared in her radio ads and knocked on doors alongside her. Last weekend, he bounded around a neighborhood in Newark, Del., hugging voters, grasping them by their elbows and imploring them to support Ms. Hansen, a former county legislator. “We need her to control the Senate!” Mr. Biden, 74, told one person on Saturday. He goaded another: “We’ve got to get Stephanie in here. Come on, help us out, O.K.?” "

Then there is Valeant Pharmaceuticals. It is trading near its record low, at around $16 per share, and at levels not seen in seven years. That has meant big financial trouble for one of its largest shareholders, Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund company managed by the billionaire William A. Ackman, whose efforts to salvage Valeant — and his reputation as a savvy investor — are looking increasingly desperate. While Mr. Ackman hailed Mr. Trump’s victory in a November interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times, he cannot be pleased that Valeant has been left behind in the latest round of market euphoria. Valeant has had a very rough 18 months or so: several management changes at the top; scandals involving Philidor, its specialty pharmacy subsidiary (two executives were indicted in November); and the scrutiny of a congressional panel on its practice, not unique in the industry, of driving up the prices of lifesaving drugs. What was once a market darling, favored by the best and brightest hedge fund managers, has fallen on some hard times. In August 2015, the stock reached over $260. Just a few months before hitting that milestone, Mr. Ackman’s Pershing Square, worth roughly $11 billion, had poured some $3.2 billion into Valeant’s stock, at an average price of around $190 per share. Pershing Square still owns around 18.1 million shares, a 5.3 percent stake, currently worth about $301 million. At its peak, Mr. Ackman’s stake in Valeant was worth around $4 billion. Valeant’s collapse has put a serious dent in the publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings’ 2016 performance, which was down 13.5 percent, net of fees. During the same 12 months, the Dow was up 13.4 percent, and the broader market index, Standard & Poor’s 500, was up nearly 12 percent. In 2015, Pershing Square Holdings’s returns plummeted 20.5 percent. Needless to say, this is not the kind of performance investors pay top dollar to receive. (Known for his flamboyant, and frequent, television appearances, as well as lengthy public presentations about his latest investments, Mr. Ackman seems to be taking a different approach so far this year. Without disclosing their names, he has made two large investments recently, equal to 13 percent of his capital, or around $1.4 billion. The first one, he informed investors, is already up 22 percent through Jan. 24.) At first, Mr. Ackman’s involvement with Valeant made him look like a genius. But it also raised serious — and still unresolved — questions that could come back to haunt him. "
412,Rex Tillerson Arrives in Mexico Facing Twin Threats to Relations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/world/americas/rex-tillerson-mexico-border-relations.html?searchResultPosition=68,2017/02/22,AMERICAS,"MEXICO CITY — The Trump administration calls the visit a step toward mutual understanding, a way to move the relationship forward. But as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson arrived in Mexico on Wednesday, twin threats hung over the frayed relationship between the two nations: President Trump’s new orders to round up and deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally, and a separate effort to take a hard look at all American aid to Mexico, possibly using it to pay for a border wall instead. By Friday, American officials are required to finish calculating all the money and grants that the United States provides to Mexico, a task that Mr. Trump first demanded in the executive order he signed last month directing the construction of a border wall. The Trump administration, which set the Friday deadline in an internal State Department memo this month, has not explicitly said why it ordered the review. But its inclusion in the executive order mandating that a wall be built suggests that Mr. Trump has linked the two issues — and may be looking for more leverage in negotiations with Mexico. The timing adds to the deep tensions between the two countries. Mr. Tillerson, the top American official to visit Mexico since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, arrived with John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, only a day after the Trump administration released documents ordering a crackdown on immigration in the United States. Newspapers here have described the Trump administration’s new deportation policies in apocalyptic terms, saying in some cases that they represented “war” on the millions of Mexicans in the United States.

He was 88. A family spokesman, A. Larry Ross, confirmed the death, adding that Mr. Coe had been hospitalized briefly after having a heart attack and a stroke. Under Mr. Coe’s guidance, the National Prayer Breakfast, begun in 1953, grew to become a Washington institution, attended by every sitting president since Dwight D. Eisenhower. President Trump spoke to religious leaders there on Feb. 2. Guest speakers have been as diverse as Mother Teresa and the Irish rock singer Bono. Mr. Coe was regarded by many political and business leaders as a spiritual mentor who blurred the line between religion and philosophy. Many in his orbit, including presidents and members of Congress of both major parties, described him as a quiet organizer who used spirituality to build relationships, often with unlikely allies. In her 2003 memoir, “Living History,” Hillary Clinton recalled Mr. Coe as “a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone, regardless of party or faith, who wants to deepen his or her relationship with God and offer the gift of service to others in need.” As a senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton was also a frequent attendee of a smaller weekly prayer group for members of Congress that Mr. Coe led personally for years.

In the face of such grim numbers, a stark question confronts the world’s most powerful: Why in 2017 can’t they avert such a seemingly archaic and preventable catastrophe? Secretary General António Guterres of the United Nations raised the alarm Wednesday afternoon about the risk of famine in northern Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. And this week, the United Nations declared famine in a patch of South Sudan. “In our world of plenty there is no excuse for inaction or indifference,” Mr. Guterres said at a news conference, flanked by the heads of his aid agencies. Each country facing famine is in war, or in the case of Somalia, recovering from decades of conflict. Famine is a rare and specific state. It is declared after three specific criteria are met: when one in five households in a certain area face extreme food shortages; more than 30 percent of the population is acutely malnourished; and at least two people for every 10,000 die each day.

Two lobbying groups representing auto manufacturers have written letters urging the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, to reverse a decision last month by the Obama administration to move forward with tougher fuel-economy standards that carmakers are supposed to meet by 2025. Automakers contend the gas-mileage targets will be difficult and expensive to hit and will force them to produce more high-mileage cars at a time when most Americans are buying sport utility vehicles, trucks and other roomy models that are less fuel-efficient and more profitable. The Obama administration’s fuel-economy targets “threaten to depress an industry that can ill afford spiraling regulatory costs,” Mitch Bainwol, the chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, wrote in a letter on Tuesday. The group represents 12 manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. A second letter was sent by the Association of Global Automakers, which represents 12 foreign car companies with significant operations or sales in the United States. Environmentalists said the lobbying groups overstated the difficulty and cost of reaching the 2025 targets, which require an average fuel-economy rating of 54.5 miles per gallon across a company’s entire fleet sold in the United States. That number is based on a complicated formula, and automakers estimate it is the equivalent of about 40 miles per gallon in real-world driving. "

He called for his longtime partner, Heather Lindsay, to come outside. Someone had spray-painted an anti-black slur across it, Mr. Charles, who is black, said. But instead of scrubbing it off, he and Ms. Lindsay, who is white, decided to leave it up to make a very public point about intolerance. Six weeks later, the graffiti, which faces High Clear Drive, remains. Residents have started to complain, and officials in Stamford, a diverse coastal city about 30 miles northeast of New York City, recently directed the couple to remove it. Leaving it up only brings satisfaction to the vandal, the city said. On Feb. 7, after the slur had been up three weeks, the city issued the couple a citation for blight and a warning: Remove it, or face a $100-a-day fine. The police chief visited the home and offered to clean the garage door. The mayor said he would help. The couple refused their offers and ignored the citation. It is not the first showdown between Stamford and the couple over the property, which was first cited for blight in 2012 for debris. The city sued Ms. Lindsay the following year for disregarding that citation, and the fees, which continue to accumulate, exceed $130,000. The city is now trying to acquire the property in a foreclosure lawsuit scheduled to go to trial on March 7. "

Mr. Awlaki, an American-born cleric who had become a leading propagandist for Al Qaeda, told the man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, that “the attack should occur on board a U.S. airliner,” according to the account Mr. Abdulmutallab gave the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Abdulmutallab told F.B.I. agents that he “was resolved to killing innocent people and considered them to be ‘collateral damage.’” With “guidance” from Mr. Awlaki, he said, he had “worked through all these issues.” Newly released documents, obtained by The New York Times after a two-year legal battle under the Freedom of Information Act, fill in the details of a central episode in the American conflict with Al Qaeda: Mr. Abdulmutallab’s recruitment by Mr. Awlaki and his failed attempt to blow up an airliner approaching Detroit on Christmas in 2009 using sophisticated explosives hidden in his underwear. The documents’ detailed account of Mr. Awlaki, who stars in Mr. Abdulmutallab’s story as both a religious hero and a practical adviser on carrying out mayhem, is particularly important. The government allegation that Mr. Awlaki was behind the underwear bomb plot — never tested in a court of law — became the central justification that President Barack Obama cited for ordering the cleric’s killing in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.

To the right of him, on the Texas side, sat a row of moldering barbecue equipment and a feral cat. To the left, the tall brush of Mexico swayed in a too-faint breeze. Unlike most political trips to the border, including President Trump’s as a candidate, there was no phalanx of cameras trailing Speaker Paul D. Ryan on his first visit here. Reporters had not been allowed on the tour, and until Tuesday evening, Mr. Ryan’s office would not even confirm he was coming. But by 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, there he was: the congressional steward of Mr. Trump’s promised wall, wading through a narrow passage of the natural border, mostly undocumented. The furtive visit came as the Trump administration set off this week to reshape the nation’s immigration policy, authorizing the expulsion of undocumented immigrants who have committed even minor offenses and making it easier to deport people immediately. Yet the centerpiece of the president’s plans, the border wall that helped define his campaign, will rise or fall in places like this — a waterway where many experts believe a physical barrier is unwise — and with people like Mr. Ryan, who control the purse strings on Capitol Hill and have not always echoed Mr. Trump’s hard line.

No doctor’s appointments for some, no school for others. No driving, period — not when a broken taillight could deliver the driver to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It is happening on Staten Island, where fewer day laborers haunt street corners in search of work; in West Phoenix’s Isaac School District, where 13 Latino students have dropped out in the past two weeks; and in the horse country of northern New Jersey, where one of the many undocumented grooms who muck out the stables is thinking of moving back to Honduras. If deportation has always been a threat on paper for the 11 million people living in the country illegally, it rarely imperiled those who did not commit serious crimes. But with the Trump administration intent on curbing illegal immigration — two memos outlining the federal government’s plans to accelerate deportations were released Tuesday, another step toward making good on one of President Trump’s signature campaign pledges — that threat, for many people, has now begun to distort every movement. It has driven one family from the local park where they used to play baseball in the evenings, and young men from a soccer field in Brooklyn where pickup games were once common. It has kept Meli, 37, who arrived in Los Angeles from El Salvador more than 12 years ago, in a state of self-imposed house arrest, refusing to drive, fearing to leave her home, wondering how she will take her younger son, who is autistic, to doctor’s appointments. “I don’t want to go to the store, to church — they are looking everywhere, and they know where to find us,” said Meli, who asked that her last name not be used out of fear of getting caught. “They could be waiting for us anywhere.

O’Neill. In a letter to members of the New York delegation to Congress seeking reimbursement for the Police Department’s expenses, Commissioner O’Neill noted that it had cost the police about $24 million to provide security to President Trump and his family in New York as well as to guard Trump Tower during the two and a half months between Election Day and Inauguration Day — a figure well below the $35 million that the police had initially estimated. The letter, dated Tuesday, includes detailed estimates about the Police Department’s expenses associated with presidential security. On days when Mr. Trump is not in the city, the department estimates that it costs $127,000 to $146,000 a day “to protect the first lady and her son while they reside in Trump Tower.” On days when Mr. Trump is in New York City — he has not yet returned since his inauguration — the Police Department anticipates “an average daily rate of $308,000.” That would come out to about $50 million a year if Mr. Trump avoided returning to Manhattan, or just over $60 million if he began returning on weekends. Mr. O’Neill’s letter did not provide an itemization of the costs associated with providing presidential security, but a good chunk of it appears to be payroll costs associated with maintaining a police presence around Trump Tower, which is on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th streets. Mr. O’Neill’s letter notes that “Trump Tower itself now presents a target to those who wish to commit acts of terror against our country, further straining our limited counterterrorism resources.” So far, the federal government has reimbursed the city for about $7 million.

Gen. H. R. McMaster, President Trump’s new national security adviser, is considering a reorganization of the White House foreign policy team that would give him control of Homeland Security and guarantee full access to the military and intelligence agencies. Just days after arriving at the White House, Mr. McMaster is weighing changes to an organization chart that generated consternation when it was issued last month. One proposal under discussion would restore the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to full membership in a cabinet-level committee, according to two officials who discussed internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity. Another likely change would reincorporate the Homeland Security Council under the National Security Council, the way it was during the administration of President Barack Obama, the officials said. The decision to separate the Homeland Security staff, they said, was primarily a way to diminish the power of Mr. McMaster’s predecessor, Michael T. Flynn, who resigned last week. Now that Mr. Flynn is out and Mr. McMaster is in, both councils may report to him. Left uncertain is what, if anything, will happen regarding Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, who has played a major role in shaping foreign policy. Under the original organization plan last month, Mr. Bannon was invited to attend any National Security Council meeting led by the president and was made a regular member of the so-called principals committee of cabinet secretaries. One senior official supportive of Mr. Bannon’s position said it would not change under any reorganization. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said this week that Mr. McMaster would have full authority to organize his staff, but that any change in Mr. Bannon’s status would have to be approved by the president.

We elected a mess.” Mr. Fallon began NBC’s “The Tonight Show” in bronzeface as Mr. Trump, squinting and head-bobbing, hitting many of the same highlights, but much less pointedly. “We inherited a mess,” he said. “It is such a mess. Not even a giant Roomba could clean it up.” Drinking from a water glass held in a tiny prop hand, he added: “I’ve just made my new secretary of labor Beyoncé. Who knows more about going into labor than someone carrying twins?” When Mr. Colbert moved to CBS from Comedy Central a year and a half ago, he was the one struggling to adjust. How could he transition from the scathing political comedy of “The Colbert Report” to broadcast TV, where Mr. Fallon had shown, like Jay Leno before him, that audiences just want to escape after a long day?

Duncan Jones, the late musician’s son, accepted the trophy and dedicated it to “all the kooks and all the people who make the kooks.” Mr. Bowie, he said, had “always been there supporting people who think they’re a little bit weird.” Adele’s most recent album, “25,” which swept the Grammys this month, won the same Brit last year, while Beyoncé, the most nominated artist at this year’s Grammys, was only up for best international female artist on this night. (She won, but did not attend the ceremony or provide a video message accepting the honor like her international male counterpart, Drake.) The absence of such pop titans allowed the Brits, Britain’s top pop music prize, to focus more on smaller, more localized acts, such as the pop group Little Mix (who won best British single for “Shout Out to My Ex,” which they also performed) and the singer Rag’n’Bone Man (who took home the British breakthrough act award). The Scottish singer Emeli Sandé won best British female solo artist and the electro-pop stars the 1975 won best British group, beating Radiohead, who have oddly never won a Brit Award. “People in pop are told to stay in their lane when it comes to social issues,” said Matt Healy, the 1975’s singer, in his acceptance speech. “But if you have a platform, don’t do that.” "
426,Some Fed Officials Support Moving Faster to Raise Interest Rate,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/business/economy/federal-reserve-minutes.html?searchResultPosition=92,2017/02/22,ECONOMY,"WASHINGTON — The American economy appears to be avoiding the kind of winter swoon that has become an annual event in recent years, a turn for the better that could encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising its benchmark interest rate sooner. At the Fed’s most recent meeting, on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, “many participants” wanted to increase the benchmark rate “fairly soon” if the economy continued to grow, according to minutes published Wednesday. But the minutes stopped short of suggesting a rate increase was likely at the Fed’s next meeting, in mid-March. They said that a core group of Fed officials remained cautious about the economic outlook, seeing balanced risks of faster and slower economic growth. “The committee has been quite patient, and I believe that has served us well,” Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, said in separate remarks on Wednesday. But now, the risks seem more in balance, he said, and “I see it as appropriate to gradually tighten policy as long as the economy continues to behave roughly as expected.” The minutes of the Fed meeting, published after a standard three-week delay, portrayed an economy that appears to be gaining strength, although it is still far from booming. The unemployment rate was little changed in the last year, standing at 4.8 percent in January, even as the economy added an average of 190,000 jobs a month in the second half of 2016, indicating that more people were returning to work. The minutes also cited “a high level of optimism” among business executives, which was attributed to “the expectation that firms would benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policy.” For the most part, however, companies were still waiting for Washington. Although a few companies had reported increased capital spending, the minutes said that most, “while optimistic, intended to wait for more clarity about federal policy initiatives before adjusting their capital spending and hiring.” "

Had he been on American soil, there’s no question constitutional principles could be invoked in seeking justice for his death. Should those principles not apply because he was standing on the other side of the border? That was the question the Supreme Court considered on Tuesday, during oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by Sergio’s parents, who believe they should have a right to get justice for his killing. The court’s decision in this case could have implications for President Trump’s travel ban, which targets noncitizens who are outside the country. On the day he was killed, Sergio, a Mexican citizen, was playing with friends in the culvert separating El Paso, Tex., and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The agent who shot him, Jesus Mesa Jr., claimed it was self-defense, but cellphone videos of the shooting refuted that account, showing that Sergio was 60 feet away, and unarmed, when Mr. Mesa shot him in the head. American prosecutors declined to charge Mr. Mesa because his bullet hit Sergio in Mexico. Mexican prosecutors charged Mr. Mesa with murder, but the Obama administration refused to extradite him. Sergio’s family filed a civil suit against Mr. Mesa for violating Sergio’s rights under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits the unreasonable use of lethal force, and the Fifth Amendment, which bars the taking of life without due process.

Trump wants to make good on his promise to improve the lives of American workers. Let’s imagine this White House, which came to power free from the political debts typically owed to unions or Wall Street, is genuinely focused on helping the nation’s miners, waitresses and Uber drivers. What, then, should President Trump do? The question might seem fanciful given the continuing chaos in Washington. But with Mr. Trump’s new choice for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, heading toward a likely confirmation, at some point the president’s cabinet will actually start governing. And then, it will face an unusual opportunity: the freedom to create policies potentially beholden only to the American workers who put Mr. Trump into office. This is a potentially transformative moment, not just within politics, but also inside millions of companies grappling with a changing economy and expanding worker demands. So over the past few weeks, I asked more than two dozen labor thinkers — from both the right and left; former officials and government skeptics; union leaders and strident capitalists — what kinds of federal innovations could remake American working life. I particularly asked for bipartisan ideas. In general, and surprisingly, there is broad enthusiasm about the future of American work (even as there are sharp disagreements about whether this president’s policies will help or hurt workers). “There are lots of new opportunities we wouldn’t have even dreamed about a few decades ago,” said Andy Stern, former president of the S.E.I.U., one of the largest labor unions. “There are great ideas out there, and people who want to experiment. But so much depends on what the government is willing to encourage.” "

But if you want to meet the voters who will decide the biggest political story of the 2018 congressional elections, you might have to fly right over the blue-collar workers of Youngstown, Ohio, and go talk to the real housewives of Orange County, Calif. Yes, it’s early. But if we’re already breathlessly checking in on Altoona, Pa., then add the O.C. to the mix. Orange County was the heart of Sun Belt conservatism and one of the most reliably Republican bastions of the 20th century. It voted Republican in every presidential election from 1936 until 2016, when it voted for Hillary Clinton by a nine-point margin. It’s hard to think of a place that was less relevant to Mr. Trump’s fortunes in 2016. Mrs. Clinton’s success in Orange County, and in well-educated and Hispanic areas elsewhere in the Sun Belt, helped her win the popular vote — though there was no payoff in the Electoral College. But it’s districts like these that will decide whether the Democrats can make a serious run at control of the House. There is no guarantee that the Democrats can put the House in play, even if Mr. Trump’s approval ratings remain as low as they are now or slip further. The Republicans have so many safe seats that they could even survive a so-called wave election like the ones that swept Democrats to power in 2006 and out of power in 2010. The Democrats need 24 seats to retake the House. "

But enforcement of that law in this country has always been full of ambiguity. On Tuesday, the White House said enforcement should be as unambiguous as the law. New policies released by the Department of Homeland Security call for the federal government to aggressively find, arrest and deport undocumented immigrants regardless of whether they’ve committed a crime. Being here illegally is now crime enough. On today’s episode: • The Trump administration outlines a sweeping plan to find and expel undocumented immigrants in the United States. Are 11 million people suddenly facing deportation? Two of my colleagues are here to help us understand what we know at this point: Michael D. Shear, a White House reporter at The New York Times, and Caitlin Dickerson, a national reporter who writes about immigration. • Mr. Trump wants to enlist local police officers in these deportations. Is this a job they want or can handle? We talk to Sheriff Mark Napier of Pima County, Ariz.

Major elements of the plan are in keeping with Mr. Trump’s promise to crack down on unauthorized immigration. But deportation is still a drawn-out process. • Bound by Iraq, and guiding security.

New York City has many theme songs. “Empire State of Mind” by Jay Z and Alicia Keys; “New York State of Mind” by Billy Joel; and “New York, New York (It’s a Helluva Town)” from the musical “On the Town” — you know, where the Bronx is up and the Battery’s down. But perhaps no song has captured New York’s spirit and imagination more than the tune popularly known as “New York, New York,” Frank Sinatra’s indelible ode to our city. (Its real title, we’d like to note, is “Theme From New York, New York.”) Mayor Ed Koch seemed to agree, and on this week in 1985, he proclaimed it New York City’s official song. Which, we’d also like to note, isn’t very official. The proclamation was never written into law, so our city technically remains anthem-less. Today the song is often paired with last call at a tavern, or the final strikeout of a Yankees game, and when it was belted out by Sinatra in 1978 at Radio City Music Hall, it instantly resonated with audiences, said James Kaplan, author of “Sinatra: The Chairman.” “Sinatra alchemized the bombast, the recalcitrant, yes, even boastful, up-all-night spirit of the city itself,” Mr. Kaplan said. While Ol’ Blue Eyes made it an anthem, it wasn’t always Frank’s tune. Written by the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb (the men behind the musicals “Cabaret” and “Chicago”), the song was first performed by Liza Minnelli in Martin Scorsese’s 1977 film “New York, New York.” "

Mr. Trump’s organization continued to file applications for new trademarks around the world during the presidential campaign. One of his companies applied for trademark protection in the Philippines more than a month after the election. The trademarks have covered all manner of potential products, including soap and vodka, and they offer clues about the international business ties that could prompt questions about potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump has also taken out a European trademark for “Numquam Concedere,” Latin for “Never Give Up,” which is part of the crest at one of his Scottish golf courses. Separately, Mr. Trump has directed his administration to enforce immigration laws more aggressively. Documents released by the Department of Homeland Security showed the scope of the president’s ambitions: to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants; to strip such immigrants of privacy protections; to enlist local police officers as enforcers; to erect new detention facilities; to discourage asylum seekers; and, ultimately, to speed up deportations. As a new age of mercantilism has emerged alongside Mr. Trump’s presidency, one deal that could have been a triumph of global capitalism has faded away. "

That’s up from 68 the year before. The report found that California had more hate groups than any other state — followed by Florida, with 63, and Texas, 55 — a result presumably of its sheer size. But the data also revealed a notable cluster of activity in the corridor between the Los Angeles area and San Diego, where at least 40 of the groups operate. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, suggested the presence of a heavy Latino population in Southern California played a part in fueling anti-immigrant sentiment. "

The Latino Victory Fund, a political action committee that works to elect progressive Hispanic leaders, will meet on Tuesday, as Mr. Trump speaks to Congress, to begin recruiting candidates at the federal, state and local levels who can push back against the president’s policies, including in cities and municipalities where they are having immediate impact. Those include in so-called sanctuary cities, which are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal authorities seeking to detain unauthorized immigrants. “As the president is outlining his plans to break up families, roll back civil rights protections and gut the environment, we are going to be finalizing our strategy to defeat him,” said Cristóbal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Project, a civic group affiliated with the Latino Victory Fund. Mr. Trump, he added, “literally started his campaign on Day 1 by attacking us, and his policies have reflected that, so we need to build up our power and fight back.” Attendees will include Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general; Thomas E. Perez, secretary of labor to President Barack Obama; and Julián Castro, Mr. Obama’s secretary of housing and urban development, as well as Latino elected officials from around the country, the organizers said. Mr. Alex said that of the 13 million to 14 million Latinos who voted in the 2016 election, 79 percent of them opposed Mr. Trump, and the proportion was even higher among women, at 86 percent. They helped elect a record number of Hispanics to Congress, including the first Latina in the Senate, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. “This is the silver lining on Trump’s victory, and we need to continue to build on it,” Mr. Alex said. The Trump administration’s new policies reject the sometimes more restrained efforts by Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush and their predecessors, who sought to balance protecting the nation’s borders with limits on the exercise of laws passed by Congress. But the new policies are likely to be welcomed by some law enforcement officials who have called for a tougher crackdown on illegal immigration, and by some Republicans in Congress who have said that lax enforcement encourages illegal immigration.

Not many writers I know can craft coherence while running through (in order, in the first 1,000 words) BuzzFeed, Gutenberg, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, Kafka, Goethe and Shakespeare. He then went on to rain bile on the “great American novel” for leading to “books so huge that, like large plastic bags, they ought to be issued with warnings of death by asphyxiation if you take them to bed to read.” Suddenly grateful (never again will I feel a need to read “The Recognitions”), I called Richard in Tasmania to discuss which pitfalls to watch out for as we expand our coverage of Australia and what to pursue with zeal. He’s far from the only person I’ve been talking to as our bureau gets going, but our conversation and his follow-up email stuck with me. His words were encouraging in terms of what we’re aiming to do, but also bracing, as he dished out a verbal shot of strong whiskey, aiming to correct the Americanist urge to assume that shared language and sunny weather signify shared history and simple commonalities. In addition to my regular roundup of recent Times articles, and a recommendation from our own Jacqueline Williams, both found below, I figured I’d share some of that conversation.

In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. That directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, “without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.” The question of how to address the “bathroom debate,” as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation. But Ms. DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Mr. Trump that she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions.

Koch to roll back environmental regulations, according to over 6,000 pages of emails made public on Wednesday. The publication of the correspondence comes just days after Mr. Pruitt was sworn in to run the E.P.A., which is charged with reining in pollution and regulating public health. Senate Democrats tried last week to postpone a final vote until the emails could be made public, but Republicans beat back the delay and approved his confirmation on Friday largely along party lines. The impolitic tone of many of the emails cast light on why Republicans were so eager to beat the release. And although the contents of the emails were broadly revealed in The New York Times in 2014, the totality of the correspondences captures just how much at war Mr. Pruitt was with the E.P.A. and how cozy he was with the industries that he is now charged with policing. “Thank you to your respective bosses and all they are doing to push back against President Obama’s E.P.A. and its axis with liberal environmental groups to increase energy costs for Oklahomans and American families across the states,” said one email sent to the offices of Mr. Pruitt and an Oklahoma congressman in August 2013 by Matt Ball, an executive at Americans for Prosperity. That nonprofit group is funded in part by the Kochs, the Kansas-born business executives who spent much of the past decade combating federal regulations, particularly in the energy sector. “You both work for true champions of freedom and liberty!” the note said. Environmental groups rushed to condemn the correspondence. “This extensive trail of emails reads like a yearslong chain of love letters between soul mates,” said Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group. Mr. Pruitt has been among the most contentious of President Trump’s cabinet nominees. Environmental groups, Democrats in Congress and even current E.P.A. employees have protested his ties to energy companies, his efforts to block and weaken major environmental rules, and his skepticism of the central mission of the agency he now leads. As soon as this week, Mr. Trump is expected to announce at least two executive orders directing Mr. Pruitt to begin rolling back and weakening a set of Obama-era E.P.A. regulations aimed at limiting emissions that cause global warming, and at pollution in the nation’s rivers, streams and wetlands.

An angry supporter of President Trump was compiling a list of businesses openly hostile to customers who voted for him. The question: Was Finch Knitting “an anti-election establishment?” Ms. Morgenthau searched her brain. Her four-year-old store, which is bright and cozy, had never endorsed a political candidate. She had, however, listed the store on the Pussyhat Project site, offering knitting supplies like pink yarn and knitting needles along with instructions on how to knit the cat-ear caps that were popular at the Women’s March in Washington. Still, she had not publicized the march itself in her store or on the shop’s Facebook page. “The business is my baby,” Ms. Morgenthau said. “I was immediately worried about it being threatened.” Big retailers including L. L. Bean, New Balance and Nordstrom have recently been caught in the cross hairs of polarizing politics that have affected sales.

442,The Joys of Propaganda,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/t-magazine/joys-of-propaganda.html?searchResultPosition=97,2017/02/22,T MAGAZINE,"When it comes to facts, some leaders, like many a florid narcissist, will build a palace and gardens around their anxieties and swear allegiance to the flag flying above them. They supplant what is true with what they wish to be true and simply deny the evidence. This is a crude modern business and has very little to do with great propaganda, which relies on something much more systematic and more artful in the organization of human wishes. The good news, however, is that propaganda is back. I don’t mean the unfragrant mob of internet miscreants — hacking is to propaganda what stalking is to romance. I mean the impulse to choose a side and press its case with wily elegance. Those of us who grew up in the Cold War have rather missed it — the persistent, well-designed, all-encompassing salesmanship of Life’s Correct Path, backed up with textbooks, posters and unspeakable stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Last November, in the weeks après le deluge, in downtown Manhattan, the Russian chess grandmaster Sergey Karjakin went head-to-head with Norway’s Magnus Carlsen. The event was as 1970s as Farrah Fawcett; as 1970s as encyclopedias and Tupperware. If I had the requisite amount of hair, I would have feathered it for the occasion. Karjakin is Kremlin-backed, as we spy-watchers like to say, and in fact Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, could be seen hanging around at the Fulton Market Building. This game was important to Putin because he believes in selling the Russian way of life, the Russian character and Russian power, a need that has outlasted both Communism and the Soviet Union. If you, dear reader, happen to be under 40, you might find it bizarre that a foreign leader would care so much about a chess match, but for the rest of us it provides a warm, fuzzy feeling. What is “a way of life”? For example, the American way of life. What is it? Is it a series of values, traits and skills that others might do well to emulate, or a set of selfish boasts and vices that make the world a darker place? You decide. Or, rather: You don’t decide, but an imaginative use of propaganda will decide for you. Manipulating human belief might sound like an alarming project for governments and designers to undertake, but it’s one of the oldest professions in the book, and corporations, religions, entertainers and doctors, to say little of politicians, are dedicated to the art of making you think what you ought to think. Populism is based on the notion that people can think for themselves, but most people can’t and don’t want to; they need team colors and a direction of play that is worked out by other people. It’s almost heretical to say so, but when “the people” have spoken they often don’t know what they’ve said. For good or for ill, the art of propaganda must set out to persuade them of what they think. At the time of World War II, this wasn’t so much resented as it might be today, and was considered by most of the Allies to be something of a gentle and spirited approach to the survival of the species. Everybody was at it, from sign writers and shopkeepers to gardeners and movie-makers. When Laurence Olivier climbs on a cart in “Henry V,” addressing his soldiers with hopeful passion, it wasn’t just Shakespeare, it was Shakespeare fitted up as propaganda, and sold to a nation fighting a good war in 1944: "

The news media has added plenty to the overwhelming coverage, but President Trump may be the first major public figure to arise in the age of social media saturation. Even President Barack Obama entered the White House before Facebook was a household name. As a result, Mr. Trump has been the subject (or target) of an amplification of news that very likely no one has experienced before. Go on Facebook, and your friends are probably sharing pro- or anti-Trump news. And the few who aren’t are probably making a show of avoiding Trump news. "

He’ll finally get his chance this Sunday, the first time in nearly a decade that a working late-night star will be M.C. of the Oscars. Mr. Kimmel, 49, is taking on this award show in a year when there doesn’t seem to be much mystery about which major nominees will win. And he’ll have to find a way to connect with a nationwide audience at a fractious time, when political tempers are running high. So, no pressure there. As Mr. Kimmel said in a recent telephone interview, speaking from the El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles where “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is produced: “I’ve come to terms with the fact that someone is going to be disappointed in me at the end. I just don’t know who it will be yet.” Days before he steps onto the Dolby Theater stage, in front of tens of millions of people, Mr. Kimmel spoke about the challenges of making this show while still working his day job and trying to find a sweet spot between a program with too much political content and one with not enough. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. "
445,The Democratic Base Isn’t Enough,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/opinion/the-democratic-base-isnt-enough.html?searchResultPosition=102,2017/02/22,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. One of the hoariest clichés in politics is “move to the center.” Journalists who think of themselves as nonideological often urge both parties to move to the center, as if the center of the political spectrum were devoid of ideology. So I enjoyed the Op-Ed yesterday, “Move Left, Democrats,” by Steve Phillips, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. But I’m not sure I agreed with it. Phillips argued that Democrats lost more Obama voters to third parties — and to staying home from the polls — than they did to Donald Trump. When the Democratic National Committee chooses its new leader this weekend, it should pick one who avoids the temptations of the political center, Phillips wrote. I’m skeptical for two main reasons. The first is that the presidency isn’t the only political office that matters. As Barack Obama noted in his last interview as president, with Pod Save America, Democrats have to win back the Senate and the House if they want to address climate change, inequality and civil rights. Winning back the House and Senate requires doing better in heavily white, nonmetropolitan America, which tends to be conservative. One of the reader commenters on the piece, Matt in Washington, made a version of this point: “This is a prescription for a party that can win the White House but which cannot win control at the state level.” The second reason is that we still don’t yet know exactly who turned out and who didn’t in 2016. Phillips uses exit-poll data. But exit polls offer imprecise, and frequently misleading, estimates, especially when they’re sliced to look at demographic groups. A better portrait will emerge in coming months, as analysts get access to data from the voter-registration files and the census. There is precedent here too: In 2012, misleading exit-poll data helped fool Democrats into thinking they could win the presidency while losing the white vote badly, as Nate Cohn documented in a prophetic June 2016 Upshot analysis. Everyone knows how those delusions of demographic destiny turned out. Phillips is right that the Democrats would be crazy to alienate the growing voting groups, such as millennials, Latinos andAsian-Americans, that now support the party so strongly. The answer for the party is almost surely more complex than simply moving to the right. Instead, it likely revolves around an economic message that appeals to both center and left. But if Democrats want to return to power — not just in the White House, but in Congress and at the state level too — they need a strategy that appeals to more white voters.

Mr. Woolery’s second act (or third, if you count his short-lived singing career, in which he tried psychedelic pop and covered “Delta Dawn”), sure shocked me when I recently stumbled across his “Blunt Force Truth” podcast. The new Mr. Woolery, who some may remember as the original host of “Wheel of Fortune,” is a firebrand who takes particular delight in fricasseeing liberal celebrities. Forget about buying a vowel. As Mr. Woolery said recently about movie stars who have protested President Trump: “You couldn’t find a group outside of an insane asylum more detached from reality than actors. Why would people want to take advice from a group of people who pretend to be other people for a living?” The 75-year-old Mr. Woolery may have slipped from some of our minds since his days gently guiding “Scrabble” players through that odd tile-dropping process. (“Connie from Cleveland, back to defend her crown!”) But he has not exactly been hiding. Had I been watching more Fox News last fall — oh, fine: any Fox News — I might have seen him chatting with Tucker Carlson about his support for the Republican presidential ticket. (“I will pray that Mike Pence will have a great impression on Donald Trump and make him more conservative,” Mr. Woolery said in one appearance.) “Blunt Force Truth,” which Mr. Woolery hosts with a like-minded friend, Mark Young, has been around since late 2014, at times rising to the Top 10 on the podcast charts. But wrapped in the ultraliberal cocoon that is moviedom, with social media feeds filled with producers rhapsodizing in unison about Democratic politicians and seemingly every television tuned to CNN or MSNBC, it was easy to not notice him.

447,Trump Made Me Eat It,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/nyregion/weight-gain-and-trump.html?searchResultPosition=31,2017/02/23,NEW YORK,"My Greenwich Village Weight Watchers group skews left, and one of the problems people have been talking about lately is “Trump weight.” You understand how this works, right? President Trump wakes up, reaches for his cellphone and tweets, “Our legal system is broken!” And that morning a few million blue state people reach for a chocolate croissant instead of their zero-fat yogurt. At lunch you learn that Mr. Trump is sparring with North Korea and because the world is going to end any minute, you have a tuna melt. At dinner, you remember that he does not believe in global warming, and as the waters will soon be rising, you figure you might as well send out for pizza. Better do it now before the brick-ovens are flooded. Your million-dollar West Village co-op, too. Goodbye equity. Make it double cheese and pepperoni on that pie. Excuse me, I have an I.M.: Wadler, you elitist fake-news monger, how dare you claim people are getting fat because of the president? If people are gaining weight, it’s because they lack will power, particularly when it comes to eating in Mexican joints, 80 percent of which are run by illegal immigrants. Reply: My apologies. I should have mentioned that many factors cause people to become tense and overeat: For instance when the presidential adviser Stephen K. Bannon says the media should “keep its mouth shut” or the White House policy adviser Stephen Miller says the powers of the president to protect our country “will not be questioned.” Hearing this, who hasn’t thought of self-medicating with a bag of warm doughnuts and hightailing it to a sanctuary city? You know what they say: America runs on Dunkin’. You know what else may be contributing to blue state weight gain? Trudeau Envy. You look at Canada’s adorable little prime minister, making what appear to be well-considered remarks, saying Canada will welcome those fleeing persecution, terror and war, and you find yourself thinking: What a decent fellow. I’ve made fun of Canada’s indiscriminate niceness for years, but I now see our friends to the north have more than thick-cut bacon going for them. Canadian bacon really is delicious. I especially like it as a winter snack, broiled in brown sugar and maple syrup and accompanied with a glass of icy Champagne. What’s the president tweeting today? “Our legal system is broken.” Leave the bottle. "
448,Everyday Muslims of New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/nyregion/everyday-muslims-of-new-york.html?searchResultPosition=32,2017/02/23,NEW YORK,"The first Muslims in New York City date back to the 17th century, and the first small, short-lived Islamic prayer room appears to have opened in 1893, near Madison Square Park. When researchers from the blog A Journey Through N.Y.C. Religions set out to count every mosque in the five boroughs in 2015, they found 285, up from 175 just five years earlier. Muslims, in all their diversity, are a longstanding and hardy part of New York life. That diversity runs through a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York called “Muslim in New York: Highlights From the Photography Collection,” which gathers the work of four photographers taken from the 1940s to the present. Like many developments in these early days of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, the exhibition came together in a hurry, said Whitney Donhauser, the museum’s director (two weeks, to be exact). “We believe in looking at history or art to understand what’s happening in current times,” Ms. Donhauser said. “And we wanted to show the importance of this community within the overall fabric of New York City. It shows that there are people in the city who have everyday lives and contribute to the vibrancy of New York City.” The images avoid the exoticism that sometimes colors photographs of cultural practices, and are striking less for their shared traits than for their differences: the Pakistani boys improvising a cricket field in a Brooklyn park and the highly formal mother of a Palestinian groom sternly guarding the wedding cakes while her daughter-in-law lights up the room, her head jeweled and uncovered; the young women honing their karate skills; men bowing in prayer before the annual Muslim Day parade, which livens up Madison Avenue every September. For all their differences they have one thing in common: New York would not be the same without them. "

General Motors’ Cadillac division is about to find out. On Sunday, its new advertising campaign will make its debut during the Oscars broadcast on ABC, which is, after the Super Bowl, the biggest showcase for national television ads. (ABC said it had sold out the broadcast, taking in about $2 million per 30-second spot.) In an effort to distinguish the company from its German and Japanese rivals in the luxury car segment, Cadillac’s advertising slogan for the past three years has been “Dare Greatly.” In the opening line of its new 60-second ad, that’s just what Cadillac seems to be doing. Over footage of a street demonstration, the narrator says bluntly, “We are a nation divided.” “We had to get the elephant out of the room,” Uwe Ellinghaus, Cadillac’s chief marketing officer, told me this week when I visited Cadillac’s sleek headquarters in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood for a preview of the ads. “You can’t deny this. At the same time, you hear this, and you stop immediately. It gets your attention.” The opening line ends with a subtle but important qualifier: “That’s what they tell us, right? This chasm between us.” It then moves swiftly to a far more positive and inclusive message: What “they don’t tell us” is that “we carry each other forward, no matter who we are, or what we believe, or where we come from.” "

The New York Times has the biggest newsroom at 620 Eighth Avenue. But not the only one. Most Times employees would be surprised to learn that on the 18th floor of our headquarters is another newsroom that looks like the rest of our space. It’s furnished identically. The journalists maintain their desks with equal fastidiousness. The resemblance ends there. This is the New York bureau of The Asahi Shimbun, a venerable and influential Japanese newspaper and website. Four correspondents, three assistant reporters and an office manager are stationed here. They cover, for their readers who are primarily back in Japan, American society, politics, business, culture, immigration policy, terrorist incidents and mass shootings, supplementing the work of their colleagues in Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco. It sounds like a very contemporary kind of arrangement: two large international media companies sharing quarters. In fact, it goes back 89 years.

In this podcast, the opinion columnist Andrew Rosenthal talks about the news — the good, the bad and the most maddening. What is Times columnist Andrew Rosenthal mad about this week? President Trumps’ response to the increase in anti-semitic attacks since he was elected. Mr. Rosenthal says the President stumbled, three or four times, before he could say something decent and caring about the rise in anti-Semitic acts since he was elected; and, when the President finally managed to say something about the problem, he offered what the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect rightly called “crumbs of condescension”: He said the anti-Semitic threats and attacks were, to quote the president, “a reminder of ‘the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.’” “No, Mr. President,” says Mr. Rosenthal, “they are a reminder of all the work you and your team did to encourage hate and prejudice and evil.” The worse recent news, Mr. Rosenthal says, is the announcement that Mr. Trump will be following through on some of his promises to send what he calls his “deportation forces” against undocumented immigrants. Mr. Rosenthal says that deporting many millions of people — including those who pay taxes, educate their children and pose no threat — “will inevitably create injustice, make the lives of legal immigrants harder, because they will be constantly under suspicion, break up families and drive undocumented people even further underground.” Mr. Rosenthal adds that mass deportation will not create new jobs for Americans — unless, that is “they want to be deportation agents or work in the for-profit prison industry.” Last, the good news. Mr. Rosenthal says that not everyone is buying into the Trump agenda of intolerance and rage. Citing angry constituents who showed up at town hall meetings around the country and allies around the world who are “wondering whether America has taken leave of its senses,” Mr. Rosenthal gives special recognition to Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump and his policies. Susan Lehman is host. "
452,Dismal Voucher Results Surprise Researchers as DeVos Era Begins,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/upshot/dismal-results-from-vouchers-surprise-researchers-as-devos-era-begins.html?searchResultPosition=39,2017/02/23,THE UPSHOT,"The confirmation of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education was a signal moment for the school choice movement. For the first time, the nation’s highest education official is someone fully committed to making school vouchers and other market-oriented policies the centerpiece of education reform. But even as school choice is poised to go national, a wave of new research has emerged suggesting that private school vouchers may harm students who receive them. The results are startling — the worst in the history of the field, researchers say. While many policy ideas have murky origins, vouchers emerged fully formed from a single, brilliant essay published in 1955 by Milton Friedman, the free-market godfather later to be awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics. Because “a stable and democratic society is impossible without widespread acceptance of some common set of values and without a minimum degree of literacy and knowledge on the part of most citizens,” Mr. Friedman wrote, the government should pay for all children to go to school. But, he argued, that doesn’t mean the government should run all the schools. Instead, it could give parents vouchers to pay for “approved educational services” provided by private schools, with the government’s role limited to “ensuring that the schools met certain minimum standards.” The voucher idea sat dormant for years before taking root in a few places, most notably Milwaukee. Yet even as many of Mr. Friedman’s other ideas became Republican Party orthodoxy, most national G.O.P. leaders committed themselves to a different theory of educational improvement: standards, testing and accountability. That movement reached an apex when the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 brought a new focus on tests and standards to nearly every public school nationwide. The law left voucher supporters with crumbs: a small demonstration project in Washington, D.C. But broad political support for No Child Left Behind proved short-lived. Teachers unions opposed the reforms from the left, while libertarians and states-rights conservatives denounced them from the right. When Republicans took control of more governor’s mansions and state legislatures in the 2000s, they expanded vouchers to an unprecedented degree. Three of the largest programs sprang up in Indiana, Louisiana and Ohio, which collectively enroll more than a third of the 178,000 voucher students nationwide. "
453,Trump Will Lose the Fight Over Bathrooms for Transgender Students,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/trump-will-lose-the-fight-over-bathrooms-for-transgender-students.html?searchResultPosition=37,2017/02/23,OPINION,"On Wednesday evening, the Departments of Education and Justice, at the direction of President Trump, withdrew important guidance that required schools to treat transgender boys and girls like other boys and girls under Title IX, the 1972 federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. In a one-and-a-half-page letter, the government unceremoniously retreated from a position — that transgender students may not be excluded from restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity — that the Department of Education had held for at least four years. Despite those years of experience, the government claims that it needs to “further and more completely consider the legal issues involved.” But there is nothing new about the idea that sex discrimination includes discrimination against transgender people. To the contrary, courts have repeatedly reached that conclusion over the past 15 years in decisions that involve prisons, banks, the workplace and, yes, schools. That’s because it’s impossible to take into account someone’s transgender status or gender identity — their internal sense of being male, female or something else — without taking into account their sex. Indeed, transgender people are defined by the fact that their gender identity does not match the sex given to them at birth. By insisting that more study is warranted to decide whether transgender students should be treated fairly, the government has sent a deeply disturbing message to transgender students that they are less than other students and unworthy of protection. That would be a damaging thing for the Department of Education to do to anyone. But it is especially troubling here, given that transgender students already are subject to more violence and harassment — both by other children and by adults — than their peers. These obstacles help explain why many transgender students drop out of school, why nearly half of transgender children have considered suicide and why at least a quarter of them have attempted it. What’s more, discrimination in schools has far-reaching and lifelong consequences for transgender people — psychologically and financially. Although the letter notes that the law protects transgender students, like all students, from discrimination, bullying and harassment, requiring transgender students to use separate facilities from those used by other students is itself a form of discrimination. It’s humiliating and degrading to be told that your very presence in a restroom is unacceptable. "
454,The New American Anti-Semitism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/the-new-american-anti-semitism.html?searchResultPosition=38,2017/02/23,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. My late father and I had a friendly running debate about anti-Semitism. He had experienced some nasty anti-Semitic teasing as a child in the 1950s. And when a high-profile incident happened in the United States during his adult life, he’d often express a concern that it signaled the start of a resurgence. I’ve experienced no meaningful anti-Semitism in my life, save the occasional hateful reader email. When he expressed alarm, I would reply with optimism: Wide-scale American anti-Semitism was a thing of the past, I’d say. I was wrong, and he was right. Social media was filled with anti-Semitism last year: Journalists who said they had never been subject to bigotry before came to expect it, usually from Trump supporters. The neo-Nazi symbol Pepe the frog was gleefully spread by Donald Trump Jr. Schools and synagogues have been defiled with anti-Semitism. More recently, Jewish community centers have received bomb threats, and a Jewish cemetery was desecrated last week. In an Op-Ed today, Jennifer Weiner talks of the role that Jewish community centers have played in her life and many other lives. She also calls out President Trump’s reluctant denunciation of anti-Semitism. “The president’s silence, and his day-late and dollar-short declaration, made their own statement,” Weiner writes. “They said that American Jews did not deserve his reassurance, that the threats against places where we lift weights and send our kids to finger-paint weren’t important enough to require his swift condemnation, like Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor ratings, or that time the cast of “Hamilton” addressed Mike Pence during a curtain call.” She’s right (and I encourage you to read the full piece). Given how quick Trump is to denounce many things, and how much of the new American anti-Semitism comes from his supporters, his one denunciation doesn’t count as permanent. If the anti-Semitism continues, so must the president’s rejection of it. He, more than anyone else, has the responsibility to make everyday religious bigotry again feel like a part of the country’s past. "

As a Democrat in the House minority, that is about all he can do these days. He heard from one attendee who recalled the division that led to the Civil War and wondered if something similar was happening today. Another asked about requiring a psychiatrist to be on hand at the White House. A third offered vivid imagery. “I kind of feel like we’re sitting in the dining room watching a presentation about how the backyard’s going to get reworked,” she said, “and meanwhile, vandals had set the roof on fire.” Mr. Kind, who has served this district that hugs the Mississippi River since 1997, took it all in. “Our institutions of democracy, I think, are going to be tested severely in the coming months and the coming years,” the congressman said at a town hall-style meeting on Wednesday, promising that he would do his best to act as a check on President Trump and any “darker impulses” that might need to be countered. Numerous Republicans who have held such  meetings over the past week have faced packed rooms, shouts and jeers. Democrats are drawing crowds, too, as voters brim with concerns about the early days of the Trump presidency and wonder what their lawmakers can do to help. But as constituents unburden themselves, Democrats must calibrate the extent of their condemnations — given the risk that overzealous denouncements of Mr. Trump could be dismissed as knee-jerk and partisan. “It’s still early,” Mr. Kind said. “It’s only been one month.” "

It’s called “The Greatest Show on Earth” — until it folds its tent for good. The goodbye tour of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus rolls through Barclays Center in Brooklyn tonight through March 3. Its final show is set for May 21 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. Dwindling ticket sales, which dropped even more after the use of elephants was phased out last year, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus “an unsustainable business for the company,” Kenneth Feld, the chief executive of Feld Entertainment, the producer of Ringling, wrote in a statement. In true fashion, readers of The New York Times responded to our coverage of Ringling with their own memories and thoughts. Here’s a selection: A Joy for Children “One of the highlights of my childhood was looking forward to going to the circus at the original Madison Square Garden and for many years afterward. The three rings of acts were magical. I loved watching three trapeze shows simultaneously. The excitement of the audience during the triple somersault was palpable. Clowning was also an art. I will always cherish these memories.” — Melanie Sloan, 65, Los Angeles “As a child, I enjoyed the wire walkers, trapeze artists, acrobats and clowns, as well as the overall spectacle — the colors, lights, costumes. I am 100 percent behind removing animal acts from circuses, but there is really something wonderful about a circus, even without animal acts, especially for children.” — Jennifer Zogott Levy, 58, Brooklyn "

But when it comes to finance, instead of trying to overthrow traditional players, start-ups have instead begun working with them. What’s the difficulty? There are a few factors: • Start-ups have not managed to displace banks, even as financial services change rapidly. • Banks are absorbing new ideas from the world of technology. • The venture capitalists who invested billions of dollars in new financial technology are still waiting for a breakout star. Their window of opportunity is shrinking, though, because the Trump administration wants to roll back financial regulations in a move that would give big banks more free rein. Post-crisis regulations had forced lenders to reduce their risks, providing an opening for companies willing to fill the gap. Bad behavior at Uber had, until this week, only been whispered about in Silicon Valley. Then Susan Fowler, an engineer who left the company in December, published a blog post detailing discrimination and sexual harassment by her managers, which she said was shrugged off by the human resources department.

As long as there are jets and Boeing, business would seem to be steady. But even here workers are bracing for bumps and economic uncertainty over the gritty details of where aviation parts get made and who makes them. President Trump has talked about border tariffs and new trade deals that many people in aerospace fear could raise the cost of American airplanes bought by foreign airlines or governments. And if Boeing’s sales or profits suffer, its nerve-system supply chain — more than 13,000 companies across the United States, and more than 1.5 million jobs — would most likely feel the pain, too. At SmartCells, 50 full-time employees and a few dozen temporary workers stamp out cushion pads on heavy machines. Executives work in a red building everyone calls the barn, and first names are the rule. Washington feels far away, but it is on just about everybody’s radar. “Let’s hit it with a two-by-four and see how it reacts, then get a plan,” said Bob Bishop, the chief operations officer at SmartCells, describing Mr. Trump’s hard-charging style. “That doesn’t always work.” The anxiety, said Mr. Bishop, 46, a former deputy county sheriff who voted for Mr. Trump, centers not so much on politics as economics, specifically the intense competition with the French airplane maker Airbus, which competes toe to toe with Boeing for jet orders in countries around the world in a delicate game of narrow cost differences and giant contracts. Mr. Trump has said he would seek a 45 percent tariff on imports from China, for example, to protect American jobs, and a 20 percent tariff on goods from Mexico. If business costs for Boeing go up as a result, the company — the nation’s single largest exporter by dollar volume — probably would not be able to raise prices on its airplanes to make up the difference, because then it would lose customers to Airbus. For workers and suppliers, the fallout could be brutal. "
461,President Trump Breaks a Promise on Transgender Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/president-trump-breaks-a-promise-on-transgender-rights.html?searchResultPosition=28,2017/02/23,OPINION,"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump broke with Republican Party orthodoxy by vowing to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans from violence and oppression. Soon after taking office, President Trump announced that he intended to continue enforcing an executive order his predecessor issued to protect L.G.B.T. people from workplace discrimination. “President Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the L.G.B.T.Q. community,” the White House said in a statement on Jan. 31. Then along came Attorney General Jeff Sessions. During his first week in office, Mr. Sessions halted the Justice Department’s efforts to defend in court the legality of the Obama administration’s guidance to school districts on how to provide a safe and inclusive environment for transgender students. A key part of that guidance advised school officials to allow transgender students to use restrooms based on their gender identity. This week, Mr. Sessions and the Department of Education rescinded the guidance entirely. His baffling rationale was that it added to the confusion around an issue that has prompted spirited debates and legal fights around the country. In fact, it did the opposite. Next month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who has been fighting his Virginia school district for the right to use the boys’ restroom on campus. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice took the position that existing federal law already confers that right. Mr. Sessions has reversed the government’s course. "

But a federal jury in Manhattan disagreed. It took jurors three hours on Wednesday to determine that there was not enough evidence to support a civil forfeiture lawsuit filed by federal prosecutors. The jury, in ruling in favor of the Efans Trading Corporation, ordered the government to return the luxury cars and $3 million in cash that was also seized from a company bank account. “We are grateful that the jury saw this case for the government overreach that it was,” said Benjamin J. Razi, a partner with the law firm Covington & Burling, which represented Efans. “Even with the victory they deserved, this case took a tremendous toll on our client.” Efans, based in Memphis, is owned by Yifan Kong and Erxin Zhou, a husband and wife who are Chinese immigrants. The government action effectively forced the couple to shut their car export business, although they still operate a tire importing company. It was a rare courtroom defeat for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. It represents something of a conclusion to an aggressive crackdown by federal law enforcement on a cottage industry of auto export companies that used middlemen and “straw buyers” to buy luxury cars from dealerships in the United States and quickly resell them for big profits in China. The auto export companies sought to take advantage of the demand for luxury cars in China and get around efforts by manufacturers to control the number of cars sold in China and other countries. "

464,Trump Deportation Order Risk: Immigrants Driven Underground,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/world/trump-migrants-deportation.html?searchResultPosition=11,2017/02/23,WORLD,"New deportation rules proposed by the Trump administration risk creating an American underclass with parallels to others around the world: slum residents in India, guest workers in oil-rich Persian Gulf states and internal migrant workers in China. Those groups provide a cautionary tale for what could happen if the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, as well as their family members, are forced deep into the shadows. Stuck in a gray zone outside the legal system, they are vulnerable to exploitation, including wage theft and sex trafficking. Because they are denied formal protections or services, informal alternatives take their place — creating an ideal space for corruption, gangs and other forms of criminality. The result is often the precise opposite of what the administration is seeking: not a cohesive society but a fragmented one, not less crime but more, and, rather than ending undocumented immigration, deepening the secrecy that makes it difficult to manage. In the United States, undocumented immigrants have always lived in limbo, officially illegal but often tolerated. But President Trump’s new rules, aimed at reconciling that contradiction, risk deepening it. As a result, they could increase the burdens on undocumented migrants and, more broadly, on society. This kind of underclass begins with a gap between law and reality. India’s slums, for instance, are often portrayed as emblems of the country’s struggle with poverty. But they also signal India’s failure to keep up with its rapidly growing urban populations. People who migrate to cities, unable to find sufficient affordable housing, improvise sprawling settlements that become more permanent. "

Concerned even a minor run-in with the authorities could lead to deportation, some are bunkering down in their homes, forgoing trips to churches, stores, parks and doctors’ offices. The immigration rules, along with an effort to reconsider American aid to Mexico, cast a cloud over a visit to the U.S.’s southern neighbor from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly offered conflicting signals on whether the military was part of the border security efforts. _____ 2.

The deportation was only the third such mass expulsion to Afghanistan since last fall, and in combination with new antiterrorism measures, it was a clear sign of the stiffening political headwinds that have made Europe, like America, a less welcoming place for migrants. Across the Continent, Europeans find themselves increasingly caught up in a debate over the treatment of migrants as rising hostility to newcomers clashes with long-held values of tolerance and openness. Many governments are restricting their welcome to strangers. Sweden tightened immigration rules last year. Britain is leaving the European Union in large part to stem the flow of foreigners. Italy has embarked on a plan to train Libyans to scoop up migrant boats off their shore. Hungary sees the shift against migration as affirming the “correctness” of its decision to build its own wall to seal its border. Then there are some states, like Germany, that are taking more assertive steps to ensure that those who have been denied asylum actually leave, like the 18 Afghans deported Wednesday. That has not always been the case. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, itself facing a tough election challenge this year, is taking steps to speed up deportations after some terrorism suspects were found to be immigrants who had been designated to be sent home.

When it was taken at the Trump SoHo hotel in New York, Mr. Trump was 32 years old and playing a growing role inside the Trump Organization. He was also looking to step outside the shadow of his father, Donald J. Trump, and make his own mark. In the photo, he stands with three associates involved in ventures he was considering, including potential opportunities in South America. The picture first appeared with an article in a Colombian newspaper, El Espectador. In the article, published in 2010, Mr. Trump discussed business opportunities the Trump Organization was eyeing in Colombia. Today, his father is the president, and the younger Mr. Trump has become one of the highest-profile business figures in the United States. He and his younger brother Eric now run the Trump Organization on a day-to-day basis. As Mr. Trump recently discussed, he is aware that his future business partners and any deals he strikes with them will face intense scrutiny. Yet little is known about his business past, aside from an ill-starred investment in South Carolina. A look at the people in the seven-year-old image provides a peek at some of his past associates, how they interacted with him and what they are doing today. One filed for personal bankruptcy, another faces $100,000 in unpaid tax liens, and another is focused on real estate and construction in Miami. Mr. Trump declined to be interviewed for this article.

Mr. Grimm looked a little flustered. “Absolutely humbled,” he pronounced himself, as his admirers thanked him for being brave. With Mr. Trump’s decision this week to rescind protections for transgender students that allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, the next stop is the Supreme Court, where Mr. Grimm — an engaging yet slightly awkward young man — is the lead plaintiff in a case that could settle the contentious “bathroom debate.” Amid a thicket of conflicting state laws and local school policies on bathroom use, the suit, which pits Mr. Grimm against his school board in Gloucester County, Va., could greatly expand transgender rights — or roll them back. Mr. Trump has portrayed the issue as one of states’ rights, and already the country’s transgender students face differing realities depending on their school. Some are restricted to the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. Others are not. Then there are the students like Mr. Grimm, who have had separate facilities set aside for them. At issue in Mr. Grimm’s case is whether Title IX, a provision in a 1972 law that bans discrimination “on the basis of sex” in schools that receive federal money, also bans discrimination based on gender identity. President Barack Obama concluded that it did. Despite Mr. Trump’s action, lawyers for both Mr. Grimm and the school board said Thursday that they expected the case to go forward, with oral arguments set for March 28 and school officials across the country awaiting the result.

Sweden is already celebrated for its generous welfare state, including 480 days of paid parental leave, universal health care and a common ritual of coffee and pastry, known as fika, which is considered sacrosanct. Per-Erik Muskos, a 42-year-old councilman from the northern town of Overtornea, wants to add to those benefits, by offering the municipality’s 550 employees the right to subsidized sex. In introducing his proposal this week, he told fellow members of the town council that it would give a nudge to the dwindling local population, add spice to aging marriages and improve employee morale. The idea quickly got attention all over Sweden, where for at least some, it was a welcome distraction from President Trump’s vague reference to problems the country was having with immigration, which were strongly denied by baffled Swedes. Noting that “sex is also a great form of exercise and has documented positive effects on well-being,” Mr. Muskos suggested that local municipal employees could use an hour of the workweek already allotted for fitness activities to go home and have sex with their spouses or partners instead. The motion, which is expected to be voted on in the spring, needs a simple majority to be passed by the 31-member council. As of now, opinion on the council is divided. “We should encourage procreation. I believe that sex is often in short supply. Everyday life is stressful and the children are at home,” Mr. Muskos explained in his motion in Overtornea, a town of about 4,500 in the picturesque and remote Torne Valley. “This could be an opportunity for couples to have their own time, only for each other.” "

Kelly, was saying the opposite, trying to tamp down fears of a military operation and to assure the public that American soldiers would not be used to police the border. “I repeat: There will be no use of military in this,” Mr. Kelly said at a news conference on Thursday, appearing with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. “At least half of you try to get that right, because it continues to come up in your reporting.” Mr. Trump has a penchant for dropping unwelcome surprises during visits between the United States and Mexico. Last month, on the first day of a trip to Washington by Mexico’s foreign minister, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to build a wall between the two countries. Then, this week, just before Mr. Kelly and Mr. Tillerson touched down in Mexico, his administration released policies that vastly expanded the potential for deportation of undocumented immigrants. "

The mayor is again seeking needed permission from Albany to impose the tax on luxury developments. This highly progressive, 2.5 percent marginal tax proposal is on home sales over $2 million. The fiscal year 2016 average sales price affected by this proposed levy is $4.5 million. That is a luxury housing tax, plain and simple. The funds generated — an estimated $336 million in the coming fiscal year — will help the low-income elderly stay in the neighborhoods they love. The tax was first proposed by the mayor in 2015, and “locked” revenue to support affordable housing. It deserves to pass now, not only because of President Trump’s threats to cut federal funding to New York City, but also because it’s good policy. Mr. Uhlfelder also doesn’t mention the city’s $8.2 billion investment in affordable housing or its Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, which puts an obligation on developers to build affordable housing and is creating permanently affordable housing in the five boroughs.

We’d meet in the same spot and chat for an hour, before homeroom began. We’d gossip and giggle, swoon over Justin Timberlake and sip from our coffee cups, which made us feel so adult. It was our version of Central Perk on “Friends.” I felt like any other student, just one of the girls, until one morning when a vice principal, who had always looked at me curiously, blocked me as I followed my friends into the girls’ restroom. The administrator told me to come with her. We walked to the nurse’s office, a five-minute trip from my homeroom, where she pointed to a single-stall restroom. “This is where you go,” she said to me. I walked into the restroom in silence. The vice principal and the nurse looked on. I was only 15, and I obediently used that restroom for the rest of the year. I didn’t know then that I had agency and could defend myself from authority figures. I was also used to making compromises so that the adults around me felt comfortable. That was 1998. Nearly two decades later, President Trump’s administration has rescinded guidelines put in place by the Obama administration that directed schools to allow transgender students to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity. But not without a fight. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was resistant to the retreat on the restroom policy at first. The classical singer Jackie Evancho, who sang the national anthem at Mr. Trump’s inauguration, requested a meeting with the president to discuss transgender rights with her sister Juliet, a trans teenager. Activists protested Wednesday night in front of the White House, alongside Gavin Grimm, a transgender 17-year-old student from Gloucester, Va., whose case for using the boys’ restroom at his high school will be argued by the American Civil Liberties Union at the Supreme Court in March.

They’ve left and they’re coming back. They have to come back.” Mr. Trump has yet to outline specific proposals for overhauling the tax and regulatory systems, rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure or reshaping the work force, all of which would be essential to accomplishing his ambitious employment goals. He told the group that his campaign pledge to create jobs had played a major role in his winning the White House, and on Thursday he dispatched his cabinet and senior staff members to gather input from the executives on what those packages should look like. The meetings unfolded less than a month before Mr. Trump plans to submit a budget blueprint that is expected to include a health care package to replace the Affordable Care Act, and to unveil a sweeping plan to cut taxes. But the president suggested his job-creation strategy was still something of a blank slate. “We’re going to then go through the room very, very carefully,” Mr. Trump said to the executives as reporters were escorted out of the State Dining Room so that he and the business leaders could meet privately. “We’re going to find out how we bring more jobs back.” Manufacturing executives appeared elated to be asked. “Thank you for the opportunity in bringing the language of business back to the White House,” said Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical. “I’m here to make chemistry sexy again.” "

The new Treasury secretary says the postelection rally in the equities market reflects faith in President Trump and his promises for tax changes and fiscal stimulus. Both plans need approval from Congress, and may be accompanied by higher inflation. Anti-immigrant and trade policies could also mute market gains. Secretary Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday that he hoped to have a tax-overhaul bill passed by Congress by August. That is an ambitious timetable, even with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House. There are major differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate, which will most likely come up with a separate proposal. One senator said current House tax proposals would be lucky to draw 10 votes out of 100. The administration will use its own rosy growth forecasts rather than the Congressional Budget Office estimates on which lawmakers rely. Congress already has a full agenda. Its first priority is repealing and replacing Obamacare, but lawmakers have yet to present a plan as disagreements continue. The Senate is also considering Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who needs 60 votes to beat a filibuster. Republicans are eight votes shy of that number. Lawmakers are already considering pushing President Trump’s plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure to next year, and Secretary Mnuchin did not highlight it on Thursday. Yet investors betting on a fiscal stimulus and tax overhaul have pushed the S.&P. 500-stock index up by more than 10 percent since the November election. Secretary Mnuchin said the performance reflected confidence in President Trump’s policies. “This is a mark-to-market business, and you see what the market thinks,” he said. Carrying out President Trump’s campaign pledges could spur inflation, which is already creeping up. Consumer spending has been healthy, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported last week that inflation expectations hit 1.92 percent. That is still shy of the central bank’s 2 percent target but higher than the 1.6 percent reported at the end of December. Rising inflation could put the Fed on a quicker path for raising interest rates. While action on taxes and infrastructure remains iffy, President Trump’s concrete moves to crack down on immigration and pull out of trade deals will hit the economy. When stock prices fall, as stock prices do, Secretary Mnuchin may find claiming credit for the market’s rise was a risk not worth taking. "

But senior Democratic officials concede that the blueprint has already been chosen for them — by an incensed army of liberals demanding no less than total war against President Trump. Immediately after the November election, Democrats were divided over how to handle Mr. Trump, with one camp favoring all-out confrontation and another backing a seemingly less risky approach of coaxing him to the center with offers of compromise. Now, spurred by explosive protests and a torrent of angry phone calls and emails from constituents — and outraged themselves by Mr. Trump’s swift moves to enact a hard-line agenda — Democrats have all but cast aside any notion of conciliation with the White House. Instead, they are mimicking the Republican approach of the last eight years — the “party of no” — and wagering that brash obstruction will pay similar dividends. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said there had been a “tornado of support” for wall-to-wall resistance to Mr. Trump. Mr. Inslee, who backed a lawsuit against the president’s executive order banning refugee admissions and travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, said Democrats intended to send a stern message to Mr. Trump during a conference of governors in the nation’s capital. “My belief is, we have to resist every way and everywhere, every time we can,” when Mr. Trump offends core American values, Mr. Inslee said. By undermining Mr. Trump across the board, he said, Democrats hope to split Republicans away from a president of their own party. “Ultimately, we’d like to have a few Republicans stand up to rein him in,” Mr. Inslee said. “The more air goes out of his balloon, the earlier and likelier that is to happen.” "

This is not only meanspirited and misguided, but it is also dangerous. Transgender young people already experience bullying and harassment at alarming rates, along with increased rates of depression and suicide. Removing these protections further stigmatizes these students. As a psychiatrist, I have witnessed firsthand the negative effects of such discrimination. Next month, the Supreme Court will also bear witness to them as Gavin Grimm, a transgender student from Virginia, brings his case to the court. Transgender young people deserve our protection and respect. Instead, President Trump has decided that political capital is worth more than the lives of transgender students. JEREMY D.

But it’s also entirely possible that Mr. Kristof has it backward: President Trump is not the true enemy; his voters are. Donald Trump is an unabashed bigot, a baldfaced liar and someone who bragged about groping women. But as nightmarish as it seems to have those qualities in the White House, sooner or later his presidency will come to an end. And when it does, we will be faced with the true American nightmare: that almost 63 million of us, knowing full well who Donald Trump was, voted for him anyway. They will not be smarter than they were in 2016 — they will have spent the interim being lied to constantly — and they will not be less angry, because the Trump presidency will certainly have failed them. As all reasonable people know, trashing trade deals won’t bring industrial jobs back; building walls won’t make us safer; and market forces won’t deliver health care or educate our children. So while Donald Trump is certainly the enemy of both reason and compassion, I’m much more frightened of the 63 million people who either didn’t know they were voting against everything this country stands for, or didn’t care. DAVID BERMAN New York To the Editor: I don’t understand why Nicholas Kristof encourages us to be magnanimous to Trump voters. Yes, they are clearly not all bigots. Still, they elected to the highest office in the land, and arguably the world, a man who ginned up his campaign crowds by encouraging racism, sexism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, vilification of the press and violence. Many of them purposefully set their consciences to sleep and pulled the lever for a man I suspect that they know is morally bankrupt. If Donald Trump continues to be the president he has been thus far — one who makes up facts, hires his cronies from Wall Street, refuses to vet his cabinet nominees even as much as immigrants are now vetted, rails against the press and shoots from the hip on some of the most delicate of the world’s problems — will they take responsibility for their votes? LINDA CARLSON Gaylordsville, Conn. To the Editor: Assuming that one were inclined to give economically stressed Trump voters a pass, I wonder what justification Nicholas Kristof would attribute to those who voted for Donald Trump who were middle class, wealthy or super-wealthy other than bigotry and greed.

What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. On Wednesday’s “Tonight Show,” Jimmy Fallon offered a twist on the party game “two truths and a lie,” saying, “I heard that they have their own version of the game at the White House. So I thought it would be fun to try out their version. It’s time for ‘two truths and an alternative fact.’” Here are a few of Mr. Fallon’s alternative facts: Both Mr. Fallon and Stephen Colbert, over on “The Late Show,” continued to beat up on President Trump for calling the news media an “enemy of the American people.” For some reason, each host expressed his dismay with a food item: "

Here’s what you need to know: • There are more signs of turbulence inside the White House. President Trump rescinded Obama-era protections for transgender students, siding with Attorney General Jeff Sessions over the objections of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. Newly released emails show that Mr. Trump’s top environmental official, Scott Pruitt, worked closely with major oil and gas companies and political groups to roll back environmental regulations when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general. In the not-so-surprising department: News coverage of Mr. Trump has probably eclipsed that of any other single human being. _____ • The focus is on Mexico as the ramifications of Mr. Trump’s new immigration orders begin to play out on border security and trade. Some police officers fear the orders may hinder efforts to fight gangs. And fearing deportation, many immigrants are hiding in self-imposed house arrest. "
482,The Anti-Vaccine Movement Gains a Friend in the White House,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/the-anti-vaccine-movement-gains-a-friend-in-the-white-house.html?searchResultPosition=63,2017/02/23,OPINION,"Vaccine opponents, often the subject of ridicule, have found fresh energy in the election of a president who has repeated discredited claims linking childhood immunizations to autism and who has apparently decided to pursue them. With President Trump’s support, this fringe movement could win official recognition, threatening lives and making it urgent that health officials, educators and others respond with a science-based defense of vaccines. Vaccines have saved lives by protecting children and adults from diseases like measles, polio, smallpox, cervical cancer and whooping cough. And there is no evidence whatsoever that vaccines or a preservative used in flu shots cause autism. Scientists have also shown that parents who refuse to immunize their children are threatening to undo decades of public health gains. Yet, activists like Robert Kennedy Jr. continue to push pseudoscience about immunizations. The terrifying thing is that they appear to have Mr. Trump's ear. After a meeting with the president last month, Mr. Kennedy said that the president would name him to head a new committee on vaccine safety; the government already has an advisory group that is meeting this week. And last week, during a news conference with Robert De Niro, Mr. Kennedy offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who could prove that vaccines are safe for children and pregnant women. Of course, countless studies show that vaccines are safe and effective — more than 350 health groups compiled a list for Mr. Trump — but they haven’t penetrated the reality distortion field created by Mr. Kennedy and his fellow travelers. The biggest danger is that their movement will sow enough doubt that more parents will refuse to let their children be immunized. In some states like Texas the number of children who do not receive vaccines has risen sharply over the last decade and is now in the tens of thousands. Not only does this increase the risk of infections to the youths who don’t get shots, but it also threatens infants who are too young and children who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. This phenomenon has already led to outbreaks of measles and mumps. Some parents are understandably anxious about autism. But scientists say there are several possible explanations for why more children have been found to have autism spectrum disorders in recent years, and none of them are linked to vaccines. Doctors have gotten better at identifying those conditions. Genetic factors could be at play, as well as fetal brain defects that develop during pregnancy because of exposure to chemicals and infections. "
483,The Death of Compassion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/the-death-of-compassion.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/02/23,OPINION,"Folks, we have been here before. After Ronald Reagan, a celebrity-turned-politician, carried 49 states in his devastating defeat of Walter Mondale in 1984, Democrats were whining and moaning, shuffling their feet and scratching their heads. Reagan had done particularly well with those who would come to be known as Reagan Democrats — white, working-class voters, particularly in the Rust Belt, whom a New York Times contributor would later describe as “blue-collar, ethnic voters,” who were drawn to Reagan’s messages of economic growth and nationalistic pride. But just like Donald Trump’s path to victory, Reagan’s was strewn with racial hostilities and prejudicial lies. While Trump’s tropes involved Mexicans and Muslims and that tired euphemism of disastrous inner cities, Reagan used the “welfare queen” scare, as far back as his unsuccessful bid for president in 1976. As I have written before, Reagan explained at nearly every stop that there was a woman in Chicago who “used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans’ benefits for four nonexistent, deceased veteran husbands, as well as welfare. Her tax-free cash income alone has been running $150,000 a year.” But it was not as it seemed. As my colleague Paul Krugman wrote in 2007: “Reagan repeatedly told the bogus story of the Cadillac-driving welfare queen — a gross exaggeration of a minor case of welfare fraud. He never mentioned the woman’s race, but he didn’t have to.” "

That provoked a vehement reaction. “Sorry,” Jason tweeted back, “but if someone is supporting a racist ignoramus who wants to round up brown ppl and steal my money, I’m gonna patronize.” “This is normalization of a hateful ideology and it’s shameful,” protested another. “My tone isn’t patronizing,” one person responded. “It’s hostile. Intentionally. I won’t coddle those who refuse to recognize my humanity.” “What a great idea!” another offered. “Let’s recruit a whole bunch of bigoted unthinking lizard brains because we could possibly ‘WIN!’” And so the comments went, registering legitimate anxieties about President Trump — but also the troubling condescension that worried me in the first place. I fear that the (richly deserved) animus toward Trump is spilling over onto all his supporters. "

We bring you this list as a public service. It’s easy to be distracted by all the strange/contradictory/awful things the president says. For instance, a lot of people were stunned when he responded to a question about anti-Semitic attacks in the United States by citing his winning numbers in the Electoral College. Then, when the question came up again and he yelled at the reporter who asked it. Much, much later, Trump did read a statement denouncing racism and anti-Semitism. But even that seemed … worrisome. It’s not just that an elected official should know how to answer that question without a lot of prep work. Everybody should know how to answer that question. Your 3-year-old nephew. Your Uber driver. Uncle Fred who gets drunk at Thanksgiving. Nobody gets to ask for a script. Maybe he keeps talking crazy to divert attention from the fact that he doesn’t have anything else to report. In Washington, outside of the ongoing disaster that is immigration policy, actual changes have been sparse. A lot of the departments don’t have new staffs yet — and some never will if Trump keeps insisting on only hiring people who never said anything negative about him during the campaign. However, some little gremlins have been busy on the government websites, clearing out unpleasant information on issues like climate change. The Department of Agriculture has taken down its list of violators of the Animal Welfare Act, including “puppy mills” rife with dangerous and unsanitary conditions. The justification for that one seemed to involve concern that the list violated the privacy of people who are terrible to little dogs. It’s hard to say for sure, since no one is picking up the phone at the headless Department of Agriculture. But if you’ve got a Republican member of Congress, be sure to go to the next town meeting and yell, “What about the puppies?” Trump, who likes to be thought of as a decider, showed his stuff this week, resolving a dispute between two of his top appointees. It was a surprising development — who knew there were enough cabinet members in place for a fight? The battle featured Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in an argument over transgender rights. "
486,President Trump Takes Aim at the Environment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/president-trump-takes-aim-at-the-environment.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/02/23,OPINION,"President Trump brandished executive pen and fresh hyperbole last week in blessing the coal industry’s decades-old practice of freely dumping tons of debris into the streams and mountain hollows of America’s mining communities. “Another terrible job-killing rule,” Mr. Trump declared at a signing ceremony that struck down the Obama administration’s attempt to regulate surface mining wastes. He insisted he was saving “many thousands of American jobs” in sparing coal companies the expense of cleaning up their environmental messes. The signing ceremony was not just an insult to the benighted coal hamlets of Appalachia, where the industry’s dumping of debris down the mountainsides has created a wasteland. It also ignored two truths. One is that by official estimates the rules, while helping the environment, would in fact cost very few jobs — 260 on average a year offset by almost the same number of jobs for people hired to comply with the rules. What’s been costing jobs in the industry for years — and this is the second and larger truth — is a shifting global market in which power plants have turned to cleaner natural gas. In cynically promising the resurgence of King Coal, Mr. Trump might as well have been signing a decree that the whaling industry was being restored to Nantucket. Americans can expect more such delusional signing ceremonies in the days ahead as Congress avails itself of a little-used statute known as the Congressional Review Act to strike down environmental rules that are vulnerable to reversal because they were enacted in the waning months of the Obama administration. Any such rule labeled “job killing” or “executive overreach” seems doomed, especially if seen as a threat to campaign donors in the fossil fuel industry. It matters little that the rule may be widely supported by the public. A case in point is a rule that seeks to reduce wasteful emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, at thousands of oil and gas wells across the West. Though the industry cries bankruptcy, the Interior Department calculates the cost of the rule at less than 1 percent of revenues. Another target is an Interior Department rule that would invite greater public input in designing resource management plans across the West to achieve a fair balance between conservation and commercial development. Representatives Rob Bishop of Utah and Liz Cheney of Wyoming — two reliable industry supporters — have managed to persuade their colleagues that this would undercut state authority, which is nonsense.

Two crucial elections are coming up, in France this May and in Germany this September, and it’s high time we assess this dangerous cleavage. It’s not “us versus them.” It’s “us versus us”: an intra-Western clash of ideologies. That clash pops up in different ways, but it is fundamentally about what world the citizens of the West would rather live in. Call it a “Lennon world” versus a “Bannon world.” Neither is sustainable. The Lennon world is that of the liberal cosmopolitans, summed up in the John Lennon song “Imagine”: “Imagine there’s no countries,” he sings, “a brotherhood of man.” The Bannon world is the opposite: a place of walls and rules, run by uncompromising strongmen. To the extent that in American cities and large parts of Europe, at least, Lennon world is already a reality, advocates of a Bannon world are the revolutionaries. As its eponym, President Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, explained, “I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.” Nowhere is this split playing out as clearly as in Germany, where a rising Bannonist right has positioned itself against both the center-left Social Democrats and the center-right Christian Democrats, both of which tend toward a version of the Lennonist worldview. Unlike in France, here the center left is robust; unlike in the United States, here the center right has no interest in co-opting, or being taken over by, the far right. Of course, Germans have also learned from the American and British experiences in 2016, a crucial lesson being that it’s a mistake, politically and morally, to discount the entire far-right voting base as “deplorable.” A compromise must be found, not only to win in September but also to govern afterward.

489,Learning to Love Our Robot Co-Workers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/magazine/learning-to-love-our-robot-co-workers.html?searchResultPosition=55,2017/02/23,MAGAZINE,"The robots were Joe McGillivray’s idea. The first one arrived at Dynamic Group in Ramsey, Minn., by pickup truck in two cardboard boxes. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, McGillivray watched as a vendor unpacked two silver tubes, assorted blue-and-gray joints and a touch screen and put them all together. When he was finished 10 minutes later, McGillivray beheld an arm that, had its segments not all been able to swivel 360 degrees, might have belonged to a very large N.B.A. player or a fairly small giant. Its “shoulder” was mounted to a waist-high pedestal on wheels. If it were to hail someone across the room, its “elbow” would reach eye level. Below its “wrist,” which was triple-jointed for extra dexterity, there were sockets for various attachments. McGillivray, not sure yet if he wanted to keep the contraption, stuck a piece of clear tape to the wrist and drew a happy face on it, which made the arm look a bit as if it were putting on a puppet show. He hoped that this would help it look nonthreatening. McGillivray is the 38-year-old chief executive of Dynamic, a maker of molds for the mass production of small plastic and metal parts, from 3M Scotch-tape dispensers to bullets. The company was founded 40 years ago by his father, Peter, and Peter’s friend Dave Kalina, both tool and die makers, in Kalina’s basement. Machining like theirs is labor-intensive. Even as the business expanded to more than 100 employees in two warehouses in Ramsey — a manufacturing town founded by French traders and settled in the 1850s on the banks of the Mississippi River — many of its customers switched to competitors overseas, induced by improvements in the technologies of developing nations coupled with falling trade barriers. But McGillivray and Kalina found a lucrative niche making molds for the most intricate medical products. Orthodontic braces, for example, use brackets that have unique shapes based on the angles of the teeth to which they will be affixed; the bracket molds, which are injected with powdered steel, must be cut to a degree of precision 40 times thinner than a hair. Thanks largely to the skill of Dynamic’s machinists, the company did more than survive; it prospered. Then came the Great Recession. For the first time, McGillivray and Kalina, once able to offer bonuses, struggled to make payroll. To keep going, they needed to produce more molds or cut costs, or both. Last month, on a damp, gray day, Joe McGillivray took me on a tour of one of Dynamic’s facilities, a former steel factory adjacent to a railroad track. The walls were painted cream with green trim, and the thick hum of motors made the cavernous space feel almost cozy. He led me to an injection press the size of a bakery oven. Inside, a nozzle moved up and down, shooting molten plastic into a mold, where it cooled around the end of a catheter tube. The resulting piece, when the tube was placed in a patient, would be used as a connector by a surgeon threading tools like scopes or stents into his or her body. A young man in a hairnet, gloves and goggles sat at a table facing the press. The robot was beside him. Before the robot arrived, McGillivray told me, four people worked the press. One inserted the catheter tubes into a frame that held them still; one set the frame on a mold, ran it through the press and took it out; one removed the finished tubes from the frame and trimmed away excess plastic; and one inspected the final products. The process was unforgiving: If an operator hit the stop button an instant too late, the plastic burned, ruining the part. Inevitably, even the nimblest foursomes produced lots of scrap. Now, as we watched, the operator inserted two tubes into a frame and put it on a rack. The robot, which had a sensor and a magnetic pad attached to its end, tapped the frame with its pad to pick it up, pivoted and gently placed the frame on a mold inside the press. Then it cocked its wrist and nudged a button with one of the pad’s corners. A wheel inside the press spun like a lazy susan, 180 degrees, positioning the mold beneath the nozzle and bringing around a second mold with a frame of cooled catheters. Next the robot lifted this frame and moved it to a trimmer that ejected the catheters. Finally, it stacked the empty frame beside the operator. The cycle took 35 seconds. All the while, the operator examined finished catheters and inserted tubes into frames at a steady but unhurried pace. It wasn’t the robot’s speed that was revolutionary, McGillivray said; other automated machines could do the same things faster. The innovation was its “collaborative” ability: This robot is safe to work with. If it bumps into someone, it stops. (McGillivray, a father of three young daughters whose standards of personal responsibility are marked even by Minnesotan standards, tested this feature on himself first: “Let’s just say it hit a fleshy part of my body, and I didn’t like it. But it didn’t leave a bruise.”) This meant that he didn’t have to build an expensive, semi-permanent safety cage around it. And because the robot is easy to move and reprogram, it can quickly be reassigned to whatever unique processes are required to fill the one-off orders Dynamic typically receives. "
490,Nikki Haskell Learns the Social Cost of Supporting Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/style/nikki-haskell-donald-trump-supporter-socialite.html?searchResultPosition=58,2017/02/23,STYLE,"Nikki Haskell has packed many lives into her 75 years. She has been a real estate broker, a party planner, a pioneering stockbroker, a cult talk-show host, a Studio 54 regular, a diet and fitness guru, and a socialite. Through it all, she has depended on her brains, her enthusiasm and her skill as a social connector to power her through the tough times. But now she is facing what may be the most difficult challenge of her life: maintaining her position in the social hierarchies of liberal New York and Los Angeles while serving as a cheerleader for one of her oldest friends, Donald J. Trump, whom she first encountered in 1974 at Le Club, a defunct members-only nightspot on East 55th Street in Manhattan. Ms. Haskell said she had a wonderful time at the black-tie, pre-inauguration dinner held for Mr. Trump at Union Station in Washington on Jan. 19. But over the weekend, in a three-bedroom suite at the Mandarin Oriental, she seemed to be wavering a little. Glued to the television on the morning of Jan. 22, she watched the coverage of the women’s marches in various cities across the country, as well as footage from the more raucous demonstrations of Jan. 20, during which protesters smashed windows, set a limousine on fire and clashed with the police not far from the Mandarin Oriental. After watching this stuff all day on many different channels, Ms. Haskell thought an uprising might be underway. “You see what’s going on in the streets, all these people rioting, all these women?” she said in a phone conversation. “Nothing ever happened like this. They never had these riots — every street, every city, all across the world. When there’s crowds and craziness like this, you never know what’ll happen. It’s horrifying.” Given what she was seeing on television and in her social media feeds, she was worried that her vocal support for the new president would make her a pariah. "
491,Divisions of Labor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/magazine/american-working-class-future.html?searchResultPosition=53,2017/02/23,MAGAZINE,"The working class, or at least the white part, has emerged as our great national mystery. Traditionally Democratic, they helped elect a flamboyantly ostentatious billionaire to the presidency. “What’s wrong with them?” the liberal pundits keep asking. Why do they believe Trump’s promises? Are they stupid or just deplorably racist? Why did the working class align itself against its own interests? I was born into this elusive class and remain firmly connected to it through friendships and family. In the 1980s, for example, I personally anchored a working-class cultural hub in my own home on Long Island. The attraction was not me but my husband (then) and longtime friend Gary Stevenson, a former warehouse worker who had become an organizer for the Teamsters union. You may think of the Long Island suburbs as a bedroom community for Manhattan commuters or a portal to the Hamptons, but they were then also an industrial center, with more than 20,000 workers employed at Grumman alone. When my sister moved into our basement from Colorado, she quickly found a job in a factory within a mile of our house, as did thousands of other people, some of them bused in from the Bronx. Mostly we hosted local residents who passed through our house for evening meetings or weekend gatherings — truck drivers, factory workers, janitors and eventually nurses. My job was to make chili and keep room in the fridge for the baked ziti others would invariably bring. I once tried to explain the concept of “democratic socialism” to some machine-shop workers and went off on a brief peroration against the Soviet Union. They stared at me glumly across the kitchen counter until one growled, “At least they have health care over there.” By the time my little crew was gathering in the ranch house, working-class aspirations were everywhere being trampled underfoot. In 1981, President Reagan busted the air traffic controllers’ union by firing more than 11,000 striking workers — a clear signal of what was to come. A few years later, we hosted a picnic for Jim Guyette, the leader of a militant meatpacking local in Minnesota that had undertaken a wildcat strike against Hormel (and of course no Hormel products were served at our picnic). But labor had entered into an age of givebacks and concessions. Grovel was the message, or go without a job. Even the “mighty mighty” unions of the old labor chant, the ones that our little group had struggled both to build and to democratize, were threatened with extinction. Within a year, the wildcat local was crushed by its own parent union, the United Food and Commercial Workers. Steel mills went quiet, the mines where my father and grandfather had worked shut down, factories fled south of the border. Much more was lost in the process than just the jobs; an entire way of life, central to the American mythos, was coming to an end. The available jobs, in fields like retail sales and health care, were ill paid, making it harder for a man without a college education to support a family on his own. I could see this in my own extended family, where the grandsons of miners and railroad workers were taking jobs as delivery-truck drivers and fast-food restaurant managers or even competing with their wives to become retail workers or practical nurses. As Susan Faludi observed in her 1999 book “Stiffed,” the deindustrialization of America led to a profound masculinity crisis: What did it mean to be a man when a man could no longer support a family? It wasn’t just a way of life that was dying but also many of those who had lived it. Research in 2015 by Angus Deaton, a Nobel laureate in economics, with his wife, Anne Case, showed that the mortality gap between college-educated whites and non-college-educated whites had been widening rapidly since 1999. A couple of months later, economists at the Brookings Institution found that for men born in 1920, there was a six-year difference in life expectancy between the top 10 percent of earners and the bottom 10 percent. For men born in 1950, that difference more than doubled, to 14 years. Smoking, which is now mostly a working-class habit, could account for only a third of the excess deaths. The rest were apparently attributable to alcoholism, drug overdoses and suicide, usually by gunshot — what are often called “diseases of despair.” "
492,The Retraining Paradox,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/magazine/retraining-jobs-unemployment.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/02/23,MAGAZINE,"When Nathan Kecy graduated from Plymouth State University in New Hampshire a decade ago with a bachelor’s degree in communications, he found himself with about $10,000 in debt and few clear career options. He first found work as a door-to-door salesman (“a pyramid scheme,” he recalls) and then in telemarketing. Finally he landed a job as an infrastructure specialist for Datamatic, a Texas-based water-meter-technology company. He was traveling across the country installing meters, making a decent salary. But he lost his job after the company restructured in 2012, he said, and soon he found that his skills weren’t easily transferable to a new field; Datamatic’s technology was proprietary, and his expertise in the company’s installation program wasn’t appealing to employers outside that particular industry. He tried going into business with a friend, but the relationship soured. By then he had a baby and a fiancée, and he felt stuck. Now 32, Kecy is a few months away from finishing a six-month certificate program in advanced composites manufacturing at Great Bay Community College in Rochester, N.H. The program operates out of a satellite campus that opened in 2013, with aid from a Labor Department grant meant to help community colleges reach “trade displaced” workers who need help training for new careers. The unemployment rate in southern New Hampshire is low, less than 3 percent. At one state job fair last summer, just 350 people showed up for 1,200 available jobs. In Strafford County, where Rochester is located, the largest employers include the University of New Hampshire and Liberty Mutual, but also manufacturers like Turbocam and Contitech. Kecy’s classmates include veterans, recent high-school graduates and older workers whose careers had reached dead ends. All of them are looking for hope and a decent paycheck by acquiring a new set of skills. “Within six months, I’m going to go from regular guy to working in the aerospace community,” says Tommy Florentino, a disabled veteran with a background in construction and automotive manufacturing. He has friends who went to Boston College or Suffolk University, “and they’re waiters and waitresses.” The college’s 27,000-square-foot Advanced Technology and Academic Center is at the edge of a nondescript shopping center. The complex also houses a Dollar Tree, a J.C. Penney and a Kmart, where a banner out front reads, “Now hiring.” Cashiers there earn close to minimum wage. But Kecy expects to earn at least $16 an hour when he graduates and to move up quickly from there. Composites is a broad field in manufacturing, with applications including automotive parts, sporting goods and prosthetics, as well as in the locally prominent aerospace industry. The state’s department of economic development bills its seacoast region as “the emerging composites region,” and it points to Great Bay’s program as a reason for more aerospace and defense businesses in particular to relocate there. “I’ve got some options, which is something I’ve never really experienced before,” Kecy says. There’s a strange disconnect between two of the big narratives about the American blue-collar work force right now. In one story, there is a population of unemployed and underemployed working-class adults for whom well-paying work seems increasingly out of reach; their jobs have gone overseas or become automated, and they find themselves working retail, or not working at all. But an apparently conflicting story comes from American employers, which have been insisting for years that they have a hard time finding workers to fill many skilled blue-collar jobs. A 2015 report from the Manufacturing Institute, for example, found that seven in 10 manufacturing executives said they faced shortages of workers with adequate tech skills. A high proportion of existing skilled workers is also nearing retirement, which means a bigger gap is looming soon. By 2025, the report warned, two million jobs will be going unfilled. (Health care, also a big focus of retraining programs, is another rapidly expanding field.) The tantalizing promise of government-funded job training is that it can bridge the gap between those narratives in a way that benefits individual workers, employers and the country as a whole. Hard-working Americans get good jobs, employers get skilled labor and the economy benefits from their mutual good fortune. The image of that virtuous cycle has made the promotion of training programs appealing for politicians on the left and the right. Hillary Clinton proposed retraining former coal-industry workers in new careers as part of a $30 billion package meant “to ensure that coal miners and their families get the benefits they’ve earned and respect they deserve.” Even as Republicans have voted to cut funding for training in recent years, they have paid it lip service as a way to put Americans back to work.

Pro Golfers Say Absolutely,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/sports/golf/a-tee-time-with-trump-pro-golfers-say-absolutely.html?searchResultPosition=48,2017/02/23,GOLF,"Ernie Els, known as the Big Easy, created a little strife on social media this month by playing golf with President Trump and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla. As the PGA Tour moves this week to PGA National Resort and Spa, a six-mile drive from Trump National, it was natural to wonder: How many of Els’s peers on the tour, if extended the same invitation, would say yes? At Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles last week, I asked more than one-third of the Genesis Open field that question, granting the respondents anonymity so they wouldn’t risk the wrath of their Twitter followers or, in the case of at least one pro, the fury of his wife. The players range in age from the early 20s to late 40s. They represent nine countries and make their homes in 14 American states, including four that voted overwhelmingly Democratic in last year’s presidential election. Of the 56 players polled, 50 — or 89.3 percent — said they would play golf with Trump if asked. Only three said they would not. The remaining three declined to answer. The results were hardly surprising. The clubhouses at PGA Tour stops have long trended Republican, and the sport’s target demographic — rich, mostly white men — is far different from the women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims who have at times been the most offended by the president’s statements and positions.

495,Trump Vowed to Protect the Safety Net. What if His Appointees Disagree?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/politics/social-security-safety-net-trump.html?searchResultPosition=49,2017/02/23,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Two days before Election Day, Donald J. Trump traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, and proclaimed that he was the protector of federal programs aimed at helping elderly and low-income Americans. It was Hillary Clinton, he said, who was an untrustworthy steward of the working class and who would slash vital benefits. “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,” Mr. Trump said. “You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago.” The pledge followed earlier promises to enact a new paid-maternity-leave benefit and not to make cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. When President Trump addresses Congress this Tuesday and follows the speech with a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, his White House will finally address in concrete numbers one of his central contradictions: He campaigned as the populist protector of programs for the working class, yet he has pledged to control the budget deficit, cut spending and cut taxes. Moreover, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with traditional small-government conservatives bent on cutting back or eliminating many of the programs he has championed. Many of his aides and cabinet members have expressed views that are fundamentally opposed to those he campaigned on. Former Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, for example, the new White House budget director, has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and helped engineer a government shutdown to cut spending. As House Budget Committee chairman, Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services, supported converting Medicaid to strictly capped block grants to the states and turning Medicare into a voucherlike program for future recipients. Ben Carson, the president’s nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has repeatedly said government programs to help the poor lead to dependency. The disparity between Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the government’s largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor.

That is the conclusion of a new survey of 1,571 political scientists. Almost all said that the United States performed well on some of the most important measures of democracy: free and fair elections, freedom of speech and judicial limits on executive power. But fewer than two-thirds said other important standards of democracy were being met: no interference with the press and respect for judicial independence by elected branches of government. And a minority said the United States was succeeding at equal rights or basic behavioral norms of civil discourse. The survey was the first to be conducted by Bright Line Watch, a new project formed by four researchers — two from Dartmouth and one each from Yale and the University of Rochester — to study democratic performance in the United States after the 2016 election of Donald J. Trump, and to compare it with other countries. The researchers said the survey was devised to try to avoid political bias, although before the election three of them wrote an open letter saying Mr. Trump threatened democracy. "

The Jan. 27 executive order barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days, banned refugees for 120 days and put an indefinite pause on Syrian refugee admissions. The revised order will retain fundamental elements and will be released “very soon,” Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, said in an interview on Fox News. For example, Mr. Miller indicated that immigration restrictions would apply to the same seven countries, which he characterized as appropriately targeted. “We’ve had dozens and dozens of terrorism cases from these seven countries, case after case after case,” Mr. Miller said. Some White House assertions about the travel ban — nonexistent terrorist attacks in Kentucky and Sweden, for example — had brief, albeit prominent, shelf lives. Others, like Mr. Miller’s assertion about the seven countries, are already being repeated. Here are some of the more misleading claims Mr. Trump and his administration have made about the first iteration of the travel ban. "
498,The Jobs Americans Do,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/magazine/the-new-working-class.html?searchResultPosition=52,2017/02/23,MAGAZINE,"Forget the images of men in hard hats standing before factory gates, of men with coal-blackened faces, of men perched high above New York City on steel beams. The emerging face of the American working class is a Hispanic woman who has never set foot on a factory floor. That’s not the kind of work much of the working class does anymore. Instead of making things, they are more often paid to serve people: to care for someone else’s children or someone else’s parents; to clean another family’s home. The decline of the old working class has meant both an economic triumph for the nation and a personal tribulation for many of the workers. Technological progress has made American farms and factories more productive than ever, creating great wealth and cutting the cost of food and most other products. But the work no longer requires large numbers of workers. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the work force. By 1950, a half-century later, those two sectors employed 36 percent. In 2014, they employed less than 10 percent. For more than a century, since the trend was first documented, people have been prophesying a dire future in which the working class would no longer work. In 1964, a group of prominent liberals wrote President Johnson to warn of a “cybernation revolution” inexorably creating “a permanent impoverished and jobless class established in the midst of potential abundance.” Machines have taken the jobs of millions of Americans, and there is every indication that the trend will continue. In October, Budweiser successfully tested a self-driving truck by delivering beer more than 120 miles to a warehouse in Colorado. In December, Amazon opened a small convenience store near its Seattle headquarters that has no cashiers. Customers — for now, Amazon employees only — are billed automatically as they leave the store. In January, Bank of America opened branches in Denver and Minneapolis that are staffed by a lone employee, A.T.M.s and video terminals. And Americans are making a growing share of purchases online: about 8.4 percent of retail sales in 2016. These changes are driven by consumer preferences, not just by corporate cost-cutting imperatives. People like shopping in bed in the middle of the night. People like that computers make fewer mistakes. And people grow accustomed to computers. A few years ago, I watched a woman walk up to a bank teller and ask where she could find an A.T.M. The teller asked if she could help. No, the woman said, she just needed to withdraw some money. But the forecasters were wrong in the most important respect. Workers continue to find work, but now the jobs are in service. Taking care of aging baby boomers, in particular, has become by far the largest driver of job growth in the American economy. Among the occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to grow most rapidly over the next decade: physical-therapy assistants, home health aides, occupational-therapy assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, occupational-therapy aides, physician assistants. ... You get the idea. Nine of the 12 fastest-growing fields are different ways of saying “nurse.” In 1950, service work made up about 40 percent of working-class labor in the United States. By 2005, that share had climbed to 56 percent, according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M.I.T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich. The available evidence, Autor said, suggests that this trend has continued “very rapidly” over the last decade, increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries. "

Any plan that could zoom through the House would hit roadblocks among Senate Republicans, many of whom have resisted a wholesale repeal of the health law without a robust replacement plan. But after weeks of loud protests, boisterous town hall meetings and scores of quieter meetings between members of Congress and health care professionals, patients, caregivers and hospital managers in their districts, it is becoming increasingly likely that a consensus in the House will be just as hard to reach. The most conservative House members are pushing for a fast repeal of the health law with only a bare-bones replacement to follow: possibly just bigger incentives for people to open health savings accounts to fund their own health needs. Other Republicans are more interested in taking their time to come up with a replacement plan that, as of now, they have failed to cobble together beyond a menu of options. Among the increasingly concerned lawmakers are those who represent the 24 Republican congressional districts that Hillary Clinton won in the presidential election — roughly the edge Republicans hold over Democrats in the House — and another dozen in districts that President Barack Obama took in 2012 but President Trump won in November. If 25 conservative hard-liners oppose any robust replacement plan, and 30 swing-district House members demand a more generous plan, passage of a compromise bill will be in jeopardy. “For the first time, Republicans need to demonstrate what they are for and not just being against Obamacare,” said Doug Heye, who served as the deputy chief of staff to former Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia when he was majority leader. Mr. Cantor and House Republican chairmen labored in 2014 to bring a replacement bill for Republicans to get behind, Mr. Heye said, and got nowhere, even with no stakes. "
500,A Debate: Should the Justice Department Police the Police?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/justice-department-police-law-enforcement.html?searchResultPosition=82,2017/03/01,U.S.,"Blue lives matter. That is, in essence, what Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been saying since he took office, promising to protect the lives of police officers, stop undermining them as (he implied) the Obama administration had, and let them get back to enforcing law and order. For some in law enforcement, the message has done what it intended to do: mollify, soothe, inspire. With vilification on the street, who needed vilification from the top? But to others, it is as shrill and jarring as a traffic whistle, threatening to undo years of work toward dismantling policies that led to mass incarceration and the erosion of trust in the police. We asked two experts to weigh in. In the first camp is Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County, outside Detroit, who explains the perspective of street-level officers facing hostility and scrutiny by cellphone cameras as they perform a dangerous job. On the other side is Ronal W. Serpas, former chief in Nashville and New Orleans, who counters that not just civilians, but officers themselves, are safer when policing is done more fairly — sometimes at the insistence of the federal government. Sheriff Bouchard answered questions by phone, and Dr. Serpas by email. Their responses were edited for clarity and length. Michael Bouchard: I think that police agencies are expecting and capable of handling scrutiny. But I think that the tone and the rhetoric did in fact diminish it. It almost — in many situations — came from a “You’re broken,” adversarial position rather than “You’re a professional, occasionally you’re going to have situations that need rectifying and we want to work together to make sure that happens.” "

In Hungary, where the movement has reached a fever pitch, supporters of Prime Minister Viktor Orban are vilifying “foreign-funded” N.G.O.s — especially those succored by George Soros, the liberal American billionaire — and accusing the groups of wanting to flood Europe with Muslim refugees and transform “Christian” nations into multicultural stews of left-wing globalism. Earlier this week, Zoltan Kovacs, Mr. Orban’s chief international spokesman, described the organizations as “foreign agents financed by foreign money.” Macedonia’s former autocratic prime minister, Nikola Gruevski, has called for a “de-Sorosization” of society, labeling opponents “Soros-oids” and inspiring a “Stop Operation Soros” movement in January. Poland’s governing party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, says Soros-funded groups want “societies without identity,” and backs fresh efforts to regulate them. In Romania, where hundreds of thousands of anticorruption protesters took to the streets in recent weeks, the leader of the governing party charged that Mr. Soros “financed evil” and has vowed to defeat him. Similar efforts have begun or accelerated in Serbia, Slovakia and Bulgaria since Mr. Trump’s victory. “These organizations must be pushed back with all available tools,” Szilard Nemeth, vice chairman of Hungary’s governing Fidesz party, told journalists. “I think they must be swept out, and now I believe the international conditions are right for this with the election of a new president.” For more than a half-century, as Europe first struggled from the ashes of World War II and then shrugged off its Soviet shackles, American-backed nongovernmental organizations have been active across Europe, often called upon to explain the West’s style of democratic capitalism to people who have known neither. Their presence often annoyed the Continent’s more authoritarian-minded leaders, who regard many of the groups to be irritants at best, and threats at worst. Traditionally, United States administrations of both parties have promoted the spread of democracy and stubbornly defended these advocacy groups. But Mr. Trump has said he will not press America’s political system on other countries and has embraced some of Europe’s far-right leaders. He also has criticized the European Union and made disparaging remarks about some democratic principles — including his frequent criticism of the news media. "

Howard, said, adding that he had given “particular weight” to the backing from law enforcement officials. In a phone call late Wednesday, during a two-hour ride from the detention center to his home in West Frankfort, Mr. Hernandez said he was relieved, tired and grateful. The ride was in a vehicle lent by a West Frankfort car dealer. Donations had come in to help with the bond. “I’m amazed by the support I’ve gotten — amazed,” said Mr. Hernandez, 38, who is the longtime manager of La Fiesta, a restaurant in West Frankfort. "

Mr. Trump’s speech — which was broadcast in prime time on all the major cable news channels and the four broadcast networks — had about 16.4 million more viewers than President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address last year. But it trailed the 52.4 million viewers that watched Mr. Obama’s first address to a joint session in 2009. More than 20 percent of the total viewers for Tuesday’s address were watching Fox News, which had 10.4 million viewers between 9 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. NBC led the broadcast networks with roughly nine million viewers. The network probably benefited from its 8 p.m. lead-in, the return of “The Voice,” which was the No. 1 broadcast network show of the night, with more than 11 million viewers. Among the cable channels, MSNBC had the smallest audience, with 2.6 million viewers, compared with CNN’s 3.8 million. Univision had 3.4 million viewers, 2 percent more than for Mr. Obama’s 2009 address. The viewership for Mr. Trump’s address was much larger than the audience for his inauguration, which drew about 31 million viewers. The figures from the inauguration and Tuesday’s address do not include streaming data. Mr. Trump’s viewership was higher than President George W. Bush’s first address, which had 40 million viewers. The two most-viewed speeches — either State of the Unions or other addresses to joint sessions of Congress — were President Bill Clinton’s first to a joint session in 1993, with 66.9 million viewers, and Mr. Bush’s 2003 State of the Union, which occurred a few weeks before the Iraq war and drew 62 million viewers.

It is far too late to fool us by putting on sheep’s clothing. President Trump used an expanded vocabulary in his speech in an effort to sound presidential, admittedly with some success. But beneath the artificial veneer still lies the soul of a man who lacks compassion and is grandiosely self-promoting. One speech does not a president make. We still cannot see the president’s tax returns, his multiple conflicts of interest have not been properly addressed, and a full investigation of possible Russian ties will likely never happen with a Republican-controlled Congress. President Trump failed to convince me that he is working for the American people. His desire for rollbacks related to food and drug protections, clean water and financial regulations shows a man who is anything but a servant of and for the American people. I for one remain skeptical that a man whose whole life has been about feathering his own nest could have our best interests at heart. PATRICIA WELLER

Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos. Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter’s lows; financial markets are shrugging off — or even rallying at the possibility of — imminent Fed rate increases; and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump’s presidency. An economy that seemed locked in some form of “secular stagnation” or “new normal” is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an “old normal.” The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn’t looking quite as scary and may even be ending. There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations. Long-term interest rates remain low by historical standards across most of the world, suggesting that global bond investors aren’t fully buying into a return to stronger, more consistent growth. "

Gen. H. R. McMaster. Because General McMaster is still on active duty, and the Senate votes on any major change in assignment for general officers, it will take up the matter on Tuesday. The Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a closed-door executive session, at which General McMaster will appear, before the panel votes on his appointment and sends it to the Senate floor. Such a procedure was not necessary for former officers who have served as national security advisers, including Michael T. Flynn, a retired three-star general who held the job for 24 days before President Trump forced his resignation over a call with Russia’s ambassador. The last time an active-duty officer served as national security adviser was during Ronald Reagan’s second term, when Colin L. Powell, then a three-star general, ran the National Security Council. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, crafted the process for General McMaster to mirror how the Senate handled Mr. Powell’s appointment, and negotiated it with the committee’s Democrats. General McMaster has earned bipartisan praise. But by holding the hearing behind closed doors, the committee may head off a public grilling about Mr. Trump’s foreign policy choices. "

Mr. Dogan, who also owns a pair of towers bearing the Trump name and is one of the Trump family’s main business partners in Turkey, was told to attend a court hearing for a case in which he stands accused of running a fuel-smuggling ring. The charge was leveled almost a year ago, but this is the first time Mr. Dogan has been ordered to attend court. There was no immediate suggestion that the dispute was connected to Mr. Dogan’s relationship with President Trump. The order came just a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Mr. Dogan’s flagship newspaper, Hurriyet, of “impudence” for publishing a headline that suggested that there was a disagreement between Mr. Erdogan and the Turkish Army. “Everyone should know their place,” Mr. Erdogan said in response to the article on Tuesday, leading analysts to wonder if he might seek to punish the newspaper. Mr. Erdogan added, “Whoever tries to play us against ourselves will pay a heavy price.” “And so they are,” said Amberin Zaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington think tank, in an online analysis written shortly after Mr. Dogan’s summons. A spokesman for Mr. Dogan’s company did not respond to an email requesting comment. He has denied any wrongdoing. Since the election of Mr. Trump, the Erdogan government has been uncharacteristically mild in its reactions to his perceived Islamophobia. Mr. Erdogan has expressed his hope that the Trump administration will abandon President Barack Obama’s plan to arm Syrian Kurdish militias, which Turkey considers to be an arm of a Turkish terrorist group. Mr. Dogan’s summons is the latest in a series of disagreements with Mr. Erdogan. Though Mr. Dogan’s newspapers have recently made management changes that were seen as olive branches to Mr. Erdogan, their editorial positions have historically been unfavorable to his government. In 2009, Mr. Dogan’s media company was fined billions of dollars for tax infractions, which some perceived as retribution for reports published by his newspapers and broadcast by his television channels. This week’s disagreement stems from the publication of an article that suggested that the army’s leadership was “uncomfortable” with the government, in particular over the recent decision to lift a longstanding policy that prevented women in the military from  wearing  head scarves. The subject of military intervention is a particularly sensitive one in Turkey, where the government narrowly defeated an attempted coup last July. "

Trump and Russians — across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn’t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators. American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials — and others close to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin — and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence. Separately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates. The disclosures about the contacts came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s ties to the Russians. According to a former senior American official, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, twice in the past year. The details of the meetings were not clear, but the contact appeared to contradict testimony Mr. Sessions provided Congress during his confirmation hearing in January when he said he “did not have communications with the Russians.” Mr. Sessions said in a statement late Wednesday that he “never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.” "
510,Outsourcing the Constitution,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/opinion/outsourcing-the-constitution.html?searchResultPosition=78,2017/03/01,OPINION,"So the Trump administration is putting the welcome mat back out for private prisons, just as candidate Donald Trump said he would do, reversing the Obama administration’s policy of phasing them out for federal prisoners. It’s no wonder that shares in some of the nation’s biggest for-profit prison companies soared by double digits the day after the presidential election, making them among the biggest winners in the immediate postelection rally. A decision on Feb. 21 by the federal appeals court in Chicago came just in time to remind us that privatization is a really bad idea. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed a federal district judge’s dismissal and sent back for trial a case with the most appalling facts, brought by a dead prisoner’s mother against the company to which the Indiana Department of Corrections had outsourced its inmates’ medical care. The opening paragraph of the opinion by Chief Judge Diane P. Wood tells the story: “Nicholas Glisson entered the custody of the Indiana Department of Corrections on September 3, 2010, upon being sentenced for dealing in a controlled substance (selling one prescription pill to a friend who turned out to be a confidential informant). Thirty-seven days later, he was dead from starvation, acute renal failure, and associated conditions.” Starvation in a state prison? Mr. Glisson was not on a hunger strike. Rather, before his imprisonment, he had suffered from serious medical problems, including cancer of the larynx. Radical surgery and radiation made it difficult for him to swallow, speak or even hold his head up without a neck brace, a device that somehow never made it to his cell. Despite these obvious problems, and despite a letter submitted at sentencing from his doctor warning that he was unlikely to survive in prison, Mr. Glisson, 50, received no medical review or care plan during his first 24 days in custody. After that, although employees of Corizon, the company Indiana entrusted with inmate medical care, noted his alarming symptoms and his increasing emaciation, his care remained disjointed until he was found dead in his bed less than two weeks later. The Indiana prison system has policies in place to require coordination of care in the treatment of inmates with chronic medical conditions. Corizon, which has contracts in 27 states and is the country’s biggest provider of outsourced prison medical care, didn’t follow those policies. Exactly what went wrong will presumably now come out at trial, unless Corizon settles this case, Glisson v. Indiana Department of Corrections, as it did a case in California two years ago. The $8.3 million  paid in the California case to a dead inmate’s family by Corizon and Alameda County was the biggest civil rights wrongful-death settlement in the state’s history. "
511,Trump Moves to Become Master of His Own Messages,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/trump-news-media.html?searchResultPosition=77,2017/03/01,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — He joked with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos after filleting him in public, brought up a recent “60 Minutes” episode with CBS’s Scott Pelley and shook hands with Jake Tapper of CNN, the cable network that the commander in chief loves to hate. All presidents lunch with major news anchors. But this week’s White House gathering was different. The president kept his guests 30 minutes beyond the allotted hour, was gracious and spoke so much that he left his peekytoe crab salad untouched — a recognition, those close to him say, that he must sell himself to the Washington news media because he believes the people who work for him cannot. Mr. Trump, after all, had conceded only the day before on national television that “in terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C-plus.” In the same interview, on “Fox & Friends,” the president described his press secretary, Sean Spicer, as “a fine human being.” The language struck close Trump associates as a dismissive turn from a man who relishes hyperbole. Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Mr. Trump who visited him in the Oval Office on Wednesday, said that the president was experiencing “a lot of angst” about his negative coverage. But Mr. Trump, he said, was feeling energized after his speech to Congress on Tuesday. “He said to me, ‘People tell me that it was the best speech I ever gave,’” Mr. Ruddy said. “He seemed really pleased.” A master media manipulator and storyteller, Mr. Trump went without a traditional press secretary during the presidential campaign, preferring to field queries on his own. Now he is increasingly taking command of his administration’s message making, and privately expressing frustration with a White House press office under siege amid leaks and infighting. John Catsimatidis, the Manhattan businessman and a Trump friend of three decades, said he would counsel Mr. Trump to give better directions to the press office. He should “sit down with them and tell them, ‘You have to explain things to people in a way where it’s completely understandable to everybody.’” "
512,<div>Jon Huntsman Is in Running to Be Ambassador to Russia</div>,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/trump-russia-jon-huntsman.html?searchResultPosition=76,2017/03/01,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Eight years after he was sent to China by a Democratic president, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor and Republican presidential candidate, is under consideration to be President Trump’s ambassador to Russia, people briefed on the deliberations said. And like eight years ago, there is a political dimension to the choice: Sending Mr. Huntsman to Moscow would remove him as a primary challenger to Utah’s 82-year-old Republican senator, Orrin Hatch — just as when former President Barack Obama chose him for Beijing in 2009, it was seen as a way to keep him off the field during the 2012 presidential campaign. Mr. Huntsman ended up running for the Republican nomination to challenge Mr. Obama anyway, failing to emerge from the pack in a primary that produced Mitt Romney. There is no telling whether he will emerge as Mr. Trump’s choice, given the sensitivity of the Russia post and the president’s propensity for auditioning people for jobs. The White House declined to comment, as did Mr. Huntsman. Mr. Huntsman’s name had already circulated for secretary of state and, more recently, for deputy secretary. But a person briefed on the talks, which were first reported by CNN, said the Moscow ambassador’s post was a more genuine prospect. Mr. Huntsman spoke with Mr. Trump last week and met on Monday with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The Moscow job is a less obvious fit for Mr. Huntsman than Beijing was. A Mormon missionary in Taiwan as a young man, Mr. Huntsman speaks Mandarin; he and his wife, Mary Kaye, adopted a girl from China. He was ambassador to Singapore under former President George H.W. Bush. While Mr. Huntsman’s family company owns manufacturing operations in Russia, and he was involved in the company’s early business dealings there, people who know him say that he has never claimed any particular expertise on the country. In the past, when Mr. Huntsman has taken a federal job, he has divested himself of family business holdings to avoid a conflict of interest. "
513,Devices Seized in Yemen Raid Offer Some Clues to Qaeda Tactics,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/middleeast/yemen-intelligence-raid.html?searchResultPosition=75,2017/03/01,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — Computers and cellphones seized during a deadly Special Operations raid in Yemen in January offer clues about attacks Al Qaeda could carry out in the future, including insights into new types of hidden explosives the group is making and new training tactics for militants, according to American officials. But it is still unclear how much the information advances the military’s knowledge of the plans and future operations of Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, although it may give a glimpse of its evolving tactics, the officials said. The Trump administration has been eager to defend itself against assertions that the raid of a Qaeda safe house, in which a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 was killed, was a failure because little meaningful intelligence material was seized. A military investigation was also ordered to determine whether women and children died in the raid. In his address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump called the raid “highly successful” and said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had assured him that it had yielded “large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.” The raid is a delicate issue in the Trump administration because the president authorized it five days into office, over dinner at the White House with Mr. Mattis and several other senior officials. But in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday, Mr. Trump seemed to distance himself from the operation, saying that responsibility for the decision to go forward rested with his generals. “This was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do,” he said. The information contained in the cellphones, laptop computers and other materials scooped up in the raid is still being analyzed, but it has not yet revealed any specific plots, and it has not led to any strikes against Qaeda militants in Yemen or elsewhere, officials said.

514,"Now, About That Role as Commander in Chief ...",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/opinion/now-about-that-role-as-commander-in-chief.html?searchResultPosition=74,2017/03/01,OPINION,"President Trump’s first address to Congress checked nearly all the domestic policy boxes that dominated his public statements during the campaign and his few short weeks in the White House — jobs, immigration, taxes, medical care. But there was one gaping omission: foreign policy. Here was his moment to assert understanding of the foreign policy threats and opportunities facing the country, and his vision of his role as commander in chief with a wider understanding of America’s role in the world. He failed to grasp it. He boasted about plans to throw billions more dollars at the Pentagon, without a word about how this will advance national security. He spoke at length about his plans to bar and expel immigrants he regards as dangerous, but far less about the very real threats from the Islamic State and other extremist groups. There was no coherent idea about major continuing challenges in Afghanistan and Syria. In fact, the words Afghanistan and Syria — as well as North Korea (with its growing nuclear arsenal) — never crossed his lips. China and Iran got passing mention; climate change — a major global challenge — zero. So how did he deploy his energies and display his concern? Chiefly by recognizing the widow of Senior Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a member of the Navy SEALs who was killed in January in a botched raid in Yemen, which Mr. Trump blamed on “the generals.” Thus ensued several agonizing minutes as Carryn Owens struggled gamely to keep her composure while the audience gave her a standing ovation to which Mr. Trump added a grotesque coda, announcing that Chief Owens would be “very happy because I think he just broke a record” by drawing sustained applause. None of this could erase the fact that Chief Owens’s father had earlier demanded an investigation into what he called a “stupid mission” and refused to meet Mr. Trump. Or that Mr. Trump, asked about Mr. Owens’s criticism on “Fox & Friends,” refused to accept responsibility, as most commanders in chief would do, and instead blamed the military commanders for the operation.

515,Lyft Is Said to Seek New Funding as Its Rival Uber Stumbles,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/technology/lyft-funding-uber.html?searchResultPosition=69,2017/03/01,TECHNOLOGY,"Lyft, the second-largest ride hailing company in the United States, is trying to raise more money just as Uber, its bigger rival, grapples with questions about its culture and leadership. Lyft is talking with investors about new fund-raising that would put the company’s value around $6 billion, according to three people briefed on the financing who asked to remain anonymous because the proceedings are confidential. One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion. The company was valued at $5.5 billion early last year after investors, including General Motors, poured about $1 billion into it. It is unclear how far along Lyft is with the new fund-raising and whether the round will be completed. Lyft, which is based in San Francisco, declined to comment. The funding effort was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. The fund-raising may bolster Lyft competitively, given that Uber has been caught up in an escalating series of internal problems. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, has been under scrutiny this year for his participation in an economic advisory council for President Trump amid a social media campaign for people to delete their Uber app. Mr. Kalanick eventually stepped down from the council. Uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks, after a former employee published an account of her year at the company, which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. In addition, Uber was caught misleading journalists about an accident caused by one of its self-driving cars. And Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, sued Uber last week, claiming it had used technology stolen by one of its employees. This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced. Lyft has long been the underdog to Uber. Lyft operates only in the United States while Uber is a global company. The two have previously engaged in pricing wars and have bad-mouthed each other. In August, Lyft held discussions with General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing about selling itself. The company could not agree with potential buyers on a price. Yet Lyft’s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive. As Uber struggled with its ties to President Trump’s administration in January, Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lyft’s app subsequently soared to the top of the Apple app store’s download list. Neither Lyft nor Uber has emerged as a financially sound business. Their battle has led them to lower prices and offer deals to lure new customers and maintain their market share. It has been hard for either company to raise prices enough to cover costs. Both Lyft and Uber are still unprofitable and depend on private investment capital to fund their operations. "
516,"Republican Unity on Health Care Is Elusive, Despite Trump’s Support",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/affordable-care-act-health-care-trump.html?searchResultPosition=70,2017/03/01,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday night buoyed House Republican leaders who were hopeful that his leadership would unite fractious lawmakers around a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. But fundamental disagreements still divide Republicans on one of the central promises of their 2016 campaigns: repealing the health law. While Mr. Trump appeared to back a health plan being drawn up by Republican leaders, it became clear Wednesday that lawmakers were continuing to argue over its details. Republican senators emerged from a closed-door meeting on health care tight-lipped. Some have balked at a proposal to require workers to pay taxes on particularly generous employer-provided health benefits. Some are worried about the future of Medicaid. But the central dividing line appears to be over how the federal government would help people purchase health insurance. House Republican leaders would offer to help people buy insurance on the free market with a tax credit that, for some low-income households, could exceed the amount they owe in federal income taxes. Some of the most conservative Republicans say the tax credit should not be more than the amount of taxes consumers owe. If the government makes payments to people with little or no tax liability, they say, that would amount to a new entitlement program, replacing one kind of government largess from President Barack Obama with another from Mr. Trump.

517,"In Speech, Trump Tests a New Tactic: Toning It Down",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/trump-speech-congress-conciliatory.html?searchResultPosition=71,2017/03/01,U.S.,"WASHINGTON — President Trump loves the song “My Way,” bristles at the slightest alterations in his daily routine, and lashes out when the world won’t accept him on his own terms. Then, when that doesn’t work, he tries something completely different. Mr. Trump’s well-received address to Congress on Tuesday night, a conciliatory speech in which the word “we” outnumbered the word “I” by three to one, represented precisely that kind of shift. Just last week, Mr. Trump shouted himself hoarse branding the news media “enemies of the American people” at a time when he was working on an address that invoked the better angels of his own nature, national unity and an “end to trivial fights.” This does not represent a pivot, it is not a fundamental change of approach, and it does not mean that Mr. Trump plans to abandon his tweet-first-and-ask-questions-later style. But it is a recognition by the White House, from Mr. Trump on down, that what it had been doing was not quite working and that a softer sales tactic was needed to sell the same hard-edge populist agenda he campaigned on, people close to Mr. Trump said. “It was not a reset speech,” the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump’s team basked in its best news cycle since he took office 41 days ago. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a Trump ally and adviser, said, “The thing people don’t get about Trump is how quickly he learns — he moves fast — so he’s going to be using different approaches.” "

Shortly after the 2004 debut of the fashion company that bears her name, Ms. Burch was profiled in The New York Times, with the reporter noting that if reserve could be bottled, Ms. Burch would probably “have a blockbuster fragrance.” So it may come as something of a surprise that the campaign she was promoting on Tuesday morning by phone from her office in the Flatiron district does not have a couple of starlet models photographed by the ubiquitous Mario Testino, but is instead a stark, black-and-white video, a public service announcement that takes on a thorny issue that dominated the last presidential campaign and has divided people on the right and left. Making its debut next Wednesday, on International Women’s Day, the campaign, called “Embrace Ambition,” features Julianne Moore, Melinda Gates, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jamie Lee Curtis, Anna Wintour, Reese Witherspoon and other famous people (both male and female) talking in front of a scrim about reclaiming a word that has often been used to vilify women. “We embrace ambition,” Ms. Paltrow says. “I can think of a lot of dirty words,” Ms. Witherspoon says. “Ambition is not one of them.” All the proceeds from the sale of accompanying bracelets and T-shirts will go toward a foundation Ms. Burch started in 2009 to help female entrepreneurs.

The change in venues prompted the predictable laments stateside. But to wax rhapsodic about the good old days when golfers decamped to Florida for the month of March to gear up for the Masters is to turn a blind eye to the game’s evolution. Since 1999, when the inaugural World Golf Championships event was held outside San Diego, the game has gone global. At that first match-play event, 39 of the 64 participants, or 61 percent of the field, were from the United States, and five of the top 10 golfers in the world rankings were Americans. This week, 29 of the 70 participants, or 41 percent of the stroke-play field, are from the United States, and four of the top 10 are Americans. “Everything kind of evolves and moves on in the world, and I think golf’s so stuck in tradition and things,” said Adam Scott of Australia, who won the Doral event last year. “I think we’re a bit sentimental with some things and we have to move on and let it go and take it for what it was.” Four years before he became the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump bought the Doral resort, a regular tour stop since the early 1960s, and spent $250 million on renovations to the grounds, only to lose the tournament when Cadillac’s sponsorship contract ran out last year. Grupo Salinas, a Mexico City-based collection of companies primarily involved in retail, television and telecommunications, signed on as a sponsor in a seven-year deal and brought the tournament to Club de Golf Chapultepec.

The sequins covering the wool dinner jacket and skirt: too flashy. The price: at $4,595 for the skirt and $4,995 for the jacket, too high. Some online commenters deemed the entire look inappropriate for Congress. Others, like the actress Alyssa Milano, highlighted the price tag. "

No giant concepts. No reinventions.” The universe did as it was bade to do. The very next day, Mr. Ruffalo was offered the leading part in Arthur Miller’s “The Price,” after John Turturro dropped out. That his wish was answered by Arthur Miller seems particularly heaven-sent: In the almost 11 years since he last appeared on Broadway, in a revival of Clifford Odets’s “Awake and Sing!,” Mr. Ruffalo has crammed an enormous amount of social activism into his busy career, which has garnered him three Oscar nominations (most recently for “Spotlight,” from 2015) and his family life (he and his wife, Sunrise, have three children, aged 15, 11 and 9). So the playwright’s examinations of economic and class struggles resonate beyond the script for Mr. Ruffalo. “Art is activism. My [acting] teacher used to say: ‘We should pay to go to church, and the theater should be free. That’s where we learn about ourselves,’” Mr. Ruffalo said. In 2011, he stepped to the front of the movement against drilling for natural gas in upstate New York; recently, he helped deliver solar panels to the people of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation who were protesting the pipeline; and he helped organize and address a rally in New York City the night before the inauguration of President Trump (“We got 27,000 people within four hours!”). “A lot of the anti-fracking movement was giving a platform to people who were living with the horror of fracking in their communities. Why aren’t we hearing from the people? When you start to know your neighbor at a human level, it’s hard to want to hurt them, even if you don’t agree with them. It’s hard to say, ‘That person’s water should be contaminated because I need to heat my house.’” "

That generation has now helped power one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited stock market debuts in recent memory, making billionaires of the founders of the disappearing-message service Snapchat. Investors, attracted by Snapchat’s hold on its millennial users — who check the app on average more than 18 times a day — flocked to the initial public offering, pushing the parent company, Snap Inc., to a valuation of nearly $24 billion. The stock sale sets Snap up as the most valuable American technology company to go public since Facebook nearly five years ago. And it may herald a coming wave of unicorns — technology start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private investors — that are expected to hit the public markets in the next few years. Snap’s offering was priced on Wednesday at $17 a share — a dollar more than the previously expected pricing range. The pricing came on a day when the stock market surged to another high, fed by raised expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Shares of the social media companies Facebook and Twitter also rose. Those buying into Snap’s offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company, based in California. It lost more than $500 million last year, and its explosive user growth appears to have hit a speed bump. And in a decision that has angered some large investors, the shares will have no voting rights, leaving control in the hands of the company’s founders, who can retain that power for years even after leaving Snap.

Later, as an Eagle Scout, he traced how railroad oil spilled into the Whitefish River and watched as a single spark set that waterway on fire. “The project,” he wrote in his 2016 book, “promoted a lifetime of conservation values.” President Trump has tapped Mr. Zinke, 55, a House member and fifth-generation Montanan who grew up in this timber-and-tourism community, to be secretary of the interior. He was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday by a vote of 68 to 31. The position puts Mr. Zinke in control of 500 million acres of United States land — roughly a fifth of the nation — and charged with balancing the department’s contradictory duties of conserving land and mining it for resources at a time of intense pressure from energy producers, environmental activists, state lawmakers and his own boss, who made fossil fuel jobs a crucial part of his campaign platform. Mr. Zinke’s portfolio includes not only the country’s 59 national parks but also millions of acres rich in coal, oil, timber and natural gas, as well as the management of land and services for 567 native tribes. Here in the West, where officials like to say the interior secretary’s power is second only to that of the president, many are training a careful eye on Mr. Zinke’s past, searching for clues to how he will chart their future. While he has cast himself in an uncommon role — a conservative conservationist — his critics say he is less of a friend to the environment than he would like to think. "

He also announced the sudden departure of another co-chief executive, Jon Rubinstein, a former senior executive at Apple who was once a deputy to Steve Jobs. Mr. Rubinstein, who joined Bridgewater 10 months ago, is the third top-level executive in recent years to leave the firm after spending less than a year on the job.

He added that he had come up with the idea before the travel ban was announced, as part of his efforts to establish an international ensemble to cooperate with the United Nations in giving concerts around the world. But when asked whether he hoped that “A Concert for Unity” would send a particular message in the Trump era, Mr. Gilbert said that was very much on his mind. “Absolutely, I’m not going to shy away from that question,” he said. “I do think that this sense of division, and creating an ‘us and them’ mentality, is absurd. I think the world is a smaller place, and we should embrace that, and not sow division and build walls. The old cliché that music is the international language: It couldn’t be more true.” Mr. Gilbert, whose parents both played in the Philharmonic, is stepping down as music director after eight seasons; he will be succeeded in 2018 by Jaap van Zweden. He first spoke publicly about his hopes for establishing a new international ensemble in December, when he conducted the Philharmonic on the floor of the General Assembly to celebrate the United Nations’ outgoing secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon. He said that he was still raising money for that project, but that the signs were very encouraging. For his Philharmonic finale in June, he has invited musicians from orchestras in Australia, China, Cuba, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, Venezuela, the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the United States to join the musicians of the Philharmonic in Mahler’s Symphony No. 7, a work that progresses from darkness to light. And throughout the three-concert run he plans to bring in prominent guest artists, including the cellist Yo-Yo Ma on June 8 and the trumpet player Wynton Marsalis on June 9. “More than anything, I hope it is a positive, feel-good moment,” he said, “when musicians from different backgrounds and countries and cultures can share the stage and point to a positive future.” "

For the past three years, China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to weaken in value compared with the American dollar. On paper, that should bolster Chigo’s profits. Half of its $1.2 billion in annual sales come from abroad, mostly in dollars, and a weaker renminbi gives Chinese companies an advantage when they sell their products in other countries. Yet the renminbi’s slide has provided only a marginal benefit, said Li Xinghao, the company’s founder and chairman. Big Western department store chains have learned to pit manufacturers against one another — and China is full of air-conditioner manufacturers. When the renminbi weakens, the chains simply tell factory bosses to cut their prices or lose the business to another Chinese factory. “It only brings benefits for the first month,” Mr. Li said. “For the next month, clients are recalculating what they’ll pay. The supply is much greater than demand, so profits can’t go up.” The renminbi is likely to be a major topic behind closed doors as Chinese lawmakers gather beginning on Sunday for the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, the top lawmaking body in the country. President Trump had heavily criticized China during the campaign, saying that Beijing for many years used an artificially weak currency to unfairly help its businesses and steal American jobs. Mr. Trump has not acted on a campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator, and Steven Mnuchin, the new Treasury secretary, has said the administration is conducting a standard review of China’s currency policy. Still, Mr. Trump has kept up his rhetoric. "

Until he went off script. Unlike his freewheeling news conferences and rallies, Mr. Trump’s prepared text contained few outright falsehoods. But when he talked up his own achievements in NATO negotiations and military spending, his claims were at times exaggerated and misleading. Here’s an assessment of some of them. This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump’s proposal to add $54 billion to the Pentagon’s budget amounts to a 10 percent increase, a significant but not historic rise. Todd Harrison, the director for defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, posted this chart on Twitter, showing at least 10 higher increases since the 1977 fiscal year and four since 2002. And this calculus does not take into account Overseas Contingency Operations, a separate bucket of money used to fund wars. Factoring in war spending, Mr. Trump’s claim is even less credible. "

The series stars Kiefer Sutherland as Tom Kirkman, who was a nondescript cabinet member until the Capitol was blown up during the State of the Union address. As the highest-ranking member of the federal government still alive, he became president, and he has since had to deal with an insurrection by the governor of Michigan, a bioterrorism attack, a standoff over a planeload of immigrants, staff intrigues and the pursuit of a terrorist suspected in the bombing that put him in office. And there’s also the question of whether Kirkman’s son is or is not his biological child.

532,How Trump’s ‘Merit-Based’ Immigration System Might Work,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/immigration-trump.html?searchResultPosition=72,2017/03/01,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump spent his first weeks in office vowing to crack down on illegal immigration with deportations and other get-tough proposals. But when he went before Congress on Tuesday to lay out his agenda, he offered a far broader plan that echoes an approach long favored by mainstream Republicans for reshaping the nation’s immigration laws. Mr. Trump’s call for a “merit-based” immigration system — one that puts a priority on skills and employability over family ties — revived a central element of the broad immigration compromise sought in 2007 by President George W. Bush, which paired stricter border enforcement with an eventual grant of legal status for many of the estimated 11 million immigrants illegally living in the United States. In a conversation with television news anchors at the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said  he would be open to such a deal, although he did not mention that in his speech to Congress. Mr. Trump’s remarks in the speech focused instead on the merit-based system. “It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially, yet in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon,” Mr. Trump said. “Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.” But such a system is viewed with skepticism by some Republicans who fear it would harm the economy by shutting out less-educated immigrants who fill vital jobs, such as farm and kitchen workers. “It sounds great just to bring the total brainiac, most skilled people here, but when you look at the economy, it’s not that simple — you need the brainiacs, but you need the low-skilled people as well,” said Tamar Jacoby, the president of ImmigrationWorks USA, who advises Republicans on immigration issues. Democrats and those on the left have an even more sinister view of the idea, arguing that Mr. Trump’s emphasis on choosing the most skilled immigrants is a backdoor way to re-engineer American laws to filter out certain ethnicities and nationalities.

American advisers were about three miles away when the Russian strike occurred. The episode pointed to the risk of unintended clashes among the myriad forces operating on a fluid battlefield in Syria, as the American command looks toward the fight to retake Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital in the country. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the American-led task force that is fighting the militants in Iraq and Syria, said the strike by Russian and Syrian government planes led to casualties among the Syrian fighters, but he declined to say how many were hurt or if any were killed. He added that the Russian attack appeared to have been a mistake: The Russian military thought it was bombing villages held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, when in fact they were recently occupied by Syrian Arab fighters. “We had some Russian aircraft and regime aircraft bomb some villages that I believe they thought were held by ISIS,” General Townsend said in a video news conference with reporters at the Pentagon. “Actually on the ground were some of our Syrian Arab coalition forces.” "

But last night, the president revealed that this obsession goes even deeper than his constant tweets about poll numbers would suggest. During his address to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump paid tribute to Senior Chief Petty Officer William (Ryan) Owens, a Navy SEAL who was killed during a raid in Yemen in January. “Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom,” he said. “We will never forget him.” When the audience gave Carryn Owens, Chief Owens’s widow, a standing ovation, Mr. Trump added, “Ryan is looking down right now, you know that, and he’s very happy, because I think he just broke a record.” He was referring, presumably, to the length of the applause. Mr. Trump has been praised in some quarters for Tuesday’s address, during which he took a more conciliatory tone than he has in recent public appearances. But his comment about Chief Owens showed that even if his language changes slightly, his fundamental outlook stays the same. In fact, the comment offered a useful peek into the president’s psyche: When he imagines a deceased veteran gazing down from heaven at his widow, the president and the assembled Congress, he sees that veteran measuring the length of his own ovation, and patting himself on the back for breaking a record. In other words, when asked to take the perspective of someone who has “laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom,” Mr. Trump assumes that what would gratify such a person is the same thing that gratifies him: adulation.

Andrew M. Cuomo will make a quick trip to Israel this weekend, at a moment when the handling of Jewish issues is percolating through the national political debate. The announcement of the trip, made on Wednesday during a speech to Orthodox Jewish students in Albany, came on the heels of several events in which Mr. Cuomo has sought to present himself as a proactive fighter of anti-Semitism. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo went to a Jewish community center in Albany to denounce such behavior, citing a series of threats and acts of racist vandalism across the state, calling them “repugnant to everything we believe as New Yorkers.” Word of the Israel trip leaked shortly after. In his remarks to students, the governor said the short trip would be focused on economic development. But its timing also seems ripe politically. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has been rumored to have higher political goals, and he has increasingly spoken out on national issues like middle-class economic relief. Last week, he traveled to Washington and rubbed elbows with fellow Democrats at the National Governors Association winter meeting. The Israel trip also comes as President Trump navigates a surge in anti-Semitism and his recent acknowledgment that he would consider a so-called one-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.

The decision tried to bring some clarity to the tangled question of what role race can play in drawing voting districts. But the Supreme Court decided very little, leaving it to the trial court to apply a slightly refined definition of racial gerrymandering. “The upshot of all of this is that not much has changed with these cases,” Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in a blog post. “The fight will be over the details and application to particular cases.” Marc E. Elias, a lawyer for the challengers in the case, disagreed, calling the decision a “major victory” that will help Democrats. The case, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, No. 15-680, concerned a dozen voting districts drawn after the 2010 census, each with at least a 55 percent population of black residents of voting age. The Supreme Court has said race cannot be the predominant reason in creating legislative districts. In 2015, a divided three-judge panel of Federal District Court in Richmond, Va., upheld 11 of the challenged districts because, it said, race had not been the primary factor in drawing them. Since the districts could be justified under traditional redistricting criteria like compactness, contiguity, incumbency protection and political considerations, the court said, race could not have been the predominant reason for drawing them.

In fact, as Tuesday night’s speech to Congress demonstrated so clearly, the president is actually a master of the art of diminished expectations. On Tuesday night, we are told, he looked sober and presidential, when all he actually did was read a speech from a Teleprompter without veering off into one of his incoherent rants. It’s hard to believe that even the ill-disciplined and narcissistic Trump would have stood in the well of the House of Representatives and tried to lead a chant of “lock her up” or slapped journalists with the “enemy of the people” label that has been a favorite of dictators for more than a century. Americans are supposed to be delighted, or at least relieved, that Trump began his speech by denouncing anti-Semitic threats and attacks, which have proliferated since he took office. But it took the president long weeks to make that simple statement, and just a few hours before his speech in the Capitol, he was suggesting to a group of state attorneys general that anti-Semitic attacks might actually have been carried out by people who want “to make others look bad” (in other words, his political opponents). At one point, Republican lawmakers in the chamber leapt to their feet, cheering in sycophantic approval, when Trump announced that he was going to put an end to the “uncontrolled entry” into the United States of people “from places where proper vetting cannot occur.” This is a classic Trumpian stunt, inventing a problem and then promising to fix it. There is no free access for refugees to this country — it takes about two years to clear the vetting process — and none of the fatal terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 have been committed by people from the seven countries Trump targeted with his anti-Muslim visa ban. If Trump did nothing about immigration, he could cross “uncontrolled entry” off his list because it’s not happening and it never has. Under Trump’s leadership, there won’t be any flying pigs, either, and Bigfoot will finally be prevented from tracking his muddy footprints through the Capitol Rotunda. "

He outlined a five-point plan for health reform that was largely aspirational, and probably consistent with the goals of nearly every Republican listening. But the issue of tax credits is actually an important dividing line in the Republican caucus. And it represents a break from Mr. Trump’s own position during the campaign. Mr. Trump did not go into detail on this subject, saying merely that “we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits.” Yet those words were a signal to Republicans fighting over two options about how the government should pay for health insurance. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and the leaders of the House committees overseeing health care, want to fund health insurance with something called an advanceable, refundable tax credit. That functions sort of like a gift card; people can use it to buy health insurance regardless of their income. Another group, led by the conservative Republican Study Committee and the House Freedom Caucus, believes that insurance benefits should be funded through the more common tax deductions, which allow you to subtract an amount from your income before paying taxes. Tax deductions are most valuable for people in the highest tax brackets. They’re less like a gift card, and more like a coupon. "
540,Austerity? Not on This Saudi Itinerary,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/middleeast/saudi-king-indonesia-wealth.html?searchResultPosition=102,2017/03/01,MIDDLE EAST,"LONDON — You could call it bling diplomacy. As part of a monthlong tour in Asia to promote economic ties, King Salman of Saudi Arabia arrived in Indonesia on Wednesday to great fanfare, accompanied, the news media said, by a retinue with a net worth in the billions of dollars, including about 1,500 people, among them 25 high-ranking princes, 10 ministers and more than 100 security personnel. Over the last two weeks, they arrived in six Boeing passenger jets and one Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a military transport aircraft, carrying 506 tons of cargo, including two Mercedes-Benz S600 limousines and two electric elevators for the king’s personal use. An Indonesian freight company told the Antara news agency that it employed 572 workers just to deal with the delegation’s luggage. The king, 81, used a golden-hued escalator to descend from a jet painted with the words “God Bless You.” Pageantry is hardly unusual for any royal family, even less so for the Saudis, who are famously extravagant spenders even as their citizens are struggling under a government austerity program. Details about his entourage made headlines around the world, and appeared to overshadow the purpose of his trip. But the size and pomp of the king’s entourage may indicate efforts to strengthen trade ties with Asia at a time of falling oil prices, experts said: A demonstration of wealth can be a show of power. It involves “stroking egos and putting on a show: The Saudis are in town,” said Peter Salisbury, a research fellow at Chatham House in London. “When that number of people show up, it creates a stir. It’s symbolism.” There’s also an economic benefit to a visit by a delegation that is bigger and more opulent than average, Mr. Salisbury said, as the visitors are likely to splurge on dinners, shopping, luxury villas in Bali and other extravagances. (“I wonder if King Salman and his 620-strong entourage will sample the delights of hedonistic Kuta?” a Twitter user asked, referring to a beach on Bali famous for its alcohol-drenched night life. It was unclear whether the person was being sarcastic.) "

At rallies last year across the country, Mr. Trump said over and over again that he would use the nation’s schools to fix what he described as failing inner cities and a virtual education crisis that most hurts black and Hispanic children. In North Carolina, he called school choice “the great civil rights issue of our time.” In Florida, he declared that “every disadvantaged child in this country” should have access to school choice. And, at a Washington gathering of conservatives, he said that under his administration, “money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family.” In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump reiterated those pledges, and in doing so backed his controversial education secretary, Betsy DeVos, who has built her career on promoting voucher programs. “I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children,” Mr. Trump said during the joint session of Congress, to applause from many Republican lawmakers. “These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.” In a statement, Ms. DeVos praised the president and said he “delivered on his promise to support school choice and offer students access to quality options.” A Department of Education official said on Wednesday afternoon that Mr. Trump and Ms. DeVos were considering a number of ways to create a federal school choice program that would offer tax credit scholarships. That would allow individuals and corporations to make tax deductible donations to nonprofit networks of private schools, which then provide tuition scholarships to students. The administration is also considering allowing schools to directly access Title I funds from the Education Department that are used to help support low income students. "

Caterpillar has been dogged by accusations that it slashed its domestic tax bill by shifting corporate profits from the United States to a subsidiary in Switzerland. A 2014 congressional investigation concluded that a scheme to move cash between the company’s American and foreign subsidiaries cut its tax bill in the United States by $2.4 billion over 13 years. The United States attorney’s office for the Central District of Illinois, the Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation division, and two other agencies led the search of Caterpillar buildings near Peoria, Ill., where Caterpillar is based, said Sharon Paul, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney. Corrie Heck Scott, a Caterpillar spokeswoman, confirmed that the raids were occurring. “Law enforcement is present in various Peoria-area Caterpillar facilities executing a search warrant,” she said in a statement. “Caterpillar is cooperating.” The company later said that it believed the warrant was related to the investigation into its tax practices. Its stock dropped 4.2 percent on the day. The report of the 2014 investigation said that Caterpillar, which makes heavy construction and mining equipment, worked with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, now PwC, to use sham transactions to transfer $8 billion in profits to a Swiss subsidiary from 1999 to 2012.

Mr. Trump, who has railed against illegal immigration and talked tough about tightening borders, said adopting that kind of system would cost American taxpayers less and help increase wages for poor workers. But in Canada, immigration is not just about selecting newcomers based on their skills. It is part of a system that promotes both the economy and the country’s multicultural society, which has arguably become as much a part of Canadian identity as hockey. And it is largely seen as a way to increase immigration, not reduce it. “Canadians are more likely than citizens of any other industrial country to think immigration is essential to the economy and the future of the country,” said Jeffrey Reitz, a professor of ethnic and immigration studies at the University of Toronto. Canada, a country of 35 million, aims to take in 300,000 immigrants this year — 0.85 percent of its population, compared with the United States’ 0.3 percent — and polls show Canadians are happy with this. In fact, the finance minister’s advisory council on economic growth wants 150,000 more. Part of that enthusiasm is the country’s recognition that, with an aging population, immigration is essential to economic growth. Add to that Canada’s geography — a long border with the prosperous United States to the south and the Arctic to the north — and illegal immigration is less of an issue. And finally, Canadians have a wholehearted belief in the merit-based immigration system, which creates a positive feedback loop. "

Municipalities around the country should “increase their ability to resist an armed attack against Sweden from a qualified opponent,” the letter from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency said. The planning was also intended to respond to natural disasters, oil spills or cyberattacks that could disrupt power and water supplies. But there is no doubt that the Swedish authorities are nervous, given Russia’s more assertive posture and the mounting uncertainties about the future of Europe’s alliance with the United States. On Thursday, the government announced that mandatory military service — abolished in 2010 — would be introduced starting next year. Four thousand men and women will be drafted into the defense forces. If not quite returning to a war footing, Sweden is at least reviving a level of preparedness that many thought had gone the way of the Cold War. “For two decades, our contingency planning was low,” Mr. Stoltz said in a recent interview. “Now, we need to look at our plans.” "
546,Trump Win Probably Didn’t Cause Canadian Immigration Website’s Crash,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/world/canada/canada-immigration-website-crash.html?searchResultPosition=35,2017/03/02,CANADA,"OTTAWA — Many people thought it was no coincidence in November when the website of Canada’s immigration department crashed just as the election returns in the United States were beginning to show that Donald J. Trump was winning the presidency. Government officials said the problem was because of a flood of requests to the site, and news organizations around the world swiftly reported social media speculation that the crush of traffic had come from unhappy Americans who would rather emigrate than live under a Trump administration. But it turns out that the computer crash may really have been just a coincidence after all. According to internal government documents obtained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, widespread problems with government computer systems generally and an impending deadline for non-American visitors were probably to blame for the website’s crash. Indeed, the problems that eventually crippled the digital public face of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada began to cause temporary crashes around 2 p.m. Eastern time — hours before the polls would begin to close in the United States. The department had been bracing for a surge in web traffic on that day, but not because of the American election. There were only two days to go before a program took effect requiring foreign travelers to Canada, other than Americans, to go online and buy an electronic travel authorization ahead of their visit. When the slowdowns and crashes started on Nov. 8, one public servant, whose name has been removed from the documents, wrote in an email that “it looks like the eTA is starting to experience significant volumes a few days earlier than planned.” The abbreviation refers to the electronic travel authorization program. That afternoon, as matters grew worse on the website, the department contacted Shared Services Canada, the government’s centralized computer services agency, but apparently got little satisfaction. “S.S.C. has indicated that ticket is pending and there’s nothing that can be done,” an immigration official wrote in the afternoon; that official’s name also was removed. By 11 p.m., the website had buckled under the mounting problems. Shared Services Canada has been plagued with problems since it was set up by the previous Conservative government to take over computer operations that had been run separately by each government department. A new payroll system it established has left thousands of public servants overpaid, underpaid or not paid at all. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have also complained about a sharp increase in serious computer problems, including shutdowns of a national criminal database used by all police forces in Canada. “Its ‘one size fits all’ I.T. shared-services model has negatively impacted police operations, public and officer safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system,” Commissioner Bob Paulson, the head of the police agency, wrote in a memo obtained earlier this week by the C.B.C.

That decision followed a day in which Republicans mostly closed ranks around Mr. Sessions, a well-liked former Senate colleague, amid revelations that he spoke with the Russian ambassador last year, seemingly contradicting testimony from his confirmation hearing in January. Initially, the fallout seemed to spawn fissures among Republicans: Several, including Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Susan Collins of Maine, were quick to call for Mr. Sessions’s recusal, defying party leaders — including President Trump — who had said earlier on Thursday that they saw no reason for it. But by day’s end, consensus appeared to have been restored: Mr. Sessions would step aside in any investigation. And that, Republicans suggested, would be enough, at least for now. None joined the chorus of Democrats, led by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, demanding Mr. Sessions’s immediate resignation. "
549,Senate Confirms Rick Perry as Energy Secretary,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/senate-confirms-rick-perry-as-energy-secretary.html?searchResultPosition=32,2017/03/02,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Rick Perry on Thursday as the head of the Energy Department, an agency he had once pledged as a presidential candidate to eliminate. The vote was 62 to 37. Mr. Perry, a former Texas governor, will lead an agency that, despite its name, is largely focused on overseeing the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, as well as a network of 17 national scientific laboratories. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Perry told senators that he regretted his call in the 2012 campaign to eliminate the agency. His inability to remember the name of the Energy Department in a 2011 debate, even as he called for getting rid of the agency, was widely seen as helping to sink his campaign. People close to Mr. Perry said that at the time he had believed that the Energy Department was largely focused on developing and promoting the nation’s energy resources. At his January confirmation hearing, Mr. Perry told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after “being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy,” he now supported its mission. The agency does play some role in the nation’s energy policy: Its laboratories conduct research into energy technologies that could help fight climate change. Mr. Perry, who has long called climate change a hoax and mocked the science of human-caused climate change, said he had also changed those views, telling senators: “I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man-made activity.” "
550,Corporations Show Support for Transgender Boy in Supreme Court Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/transgender-boy-gavin-grimm-corporations-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=68,2017/03/02,U.S.,"Dozens of companies, including Amazon, Apple, IBM and Microsoft, have signed on to a Supreme Court brief supporting a transgender boy’s fight against his school district over which school bathrooms he may use. The businesses, 53 in all, joined a brief that the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit organization supporting gay rights, planned to file on Thursday. The advocacy group is urging the Supreme Court to side with Gavin Grimm, a transgender student represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, in his case against the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia. “These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America’s leading businesses have their backs,” Chad Griffin, the Human Rights Campaign’s president, said in a statement announcing the support. With oral arguments scheduled for the end of the month, Mr. Grimm’s case is progressing at the Supreme Court as the rights of transgender youth face increased scrutiny nationwide. In January, the Boy Scouts of America reversed a century-old stance, opening the door to transgender members. Last week, President Trump rescinded rules put in place less than a year earlier allowing transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Mr. Grimm’s case could settle the bathroom issue once and for all. The signatories of the Human Rights Campaign brief include a number of tech companies, like Airbnb, eBay, Intel, LinkedIn, PayPal, Salesforce, Twitter, Yahoo and Yelp. But businesses from several other industries have signed on, too. They include Gap, MAC Cosmetics, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Warby Parker and Williams-Sonoma. It is not the first time that big businesses have lent their support to the fight for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights. Last year, for example, the chief executives of dozens of major corporations wrote a letter to Pat McCrory, the North Carolina governor at the time, urging the state to repeal House Bill 2, which curbed legal protections for the gay community. A bipartisan effort has begun to repeal that bill. "
551,DeVos and Tax Credit Vouchers: Arizona Shows What Can Go Wrong,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/upshot/arizona-shows-what-can-go-wrong-with-tax-credit-vouchers.html?searchResultPosition=31,2017/03/02,THE UPSHOT,"Steve Yarbrough is one of the most powerful men in Arizona. As president of the State Senate, he has promoted a range of conservative policies, including a tuition tax credit system that provides over $100 million per year to finance vouchers for private schools. In his speech to Congress this week, President Trump singled out a young woman who attended private school using a tax credit-financed voucher. The president urged Congress to pass legislation that would provide similar benefits to millions of students. But Mr. Yarbrough is not just a champion of tax credit vouchers. He also profits from them personally. The story of how that happened raises questions about President Trump’s campaign promise to spend $20 billion to increase school choice. There’s a strong chance that he’ll do that through tax credit vouchers — a mechanism that Betsy DeVos actively campaigned for before she became Mr. Trump’s education secretary. State tax credit voucher programs have grown rapidly in recent years. The number of students receiving them increased to 256,000 this year, from about 50,000 in 2005. Arizona has one of the oldest and largest programs. It allows taxpayers who donate money to nonprofit voucher-granting organizations to claim a 100 percent, dollar-for-dollar credit against their state taxes (up to a certain limit). In other words, if a married couple donates $1,000 to a voucher-granting nonprofit, their tax bill is reduced by $1,000. The nonprofit then gives the money to families who use it to pay tuition at private schools. The Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization (Acsto) is one of the state’s largest voucher-granting groups. From 2010 to 2014 (the latest year recorded in federal tax filings), the group received $72.9 million in donations, all of which were ultimately financed by the state. Arizona law allows the group to keep 10 percent of those donations to pay for overhead. In 2014, the group used that money to pay its executive director $125,000. His name? Steve Yarbrough. Forms filed by the organization with the I.R.S. declare that he worked an average of 40 hours per week on the job — in addition, presumably, to the hours he worked as president of the State Senate. "
552,State Dept. Official Praises Mexican Efforts in War on Drugs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/world/americas/drug-narcotics-mexico-state-department.html?searchResultPosition=30,2017/03/02,AMERICAS,"WASHINGTON — One of the few senior Obama administration appointees still at the State Department delivered a ringing endorsement on Thursday of Mexico’s efforts to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States, just as the Trump administration is examining whether to slash money supporting those efforts. William R. Brownfield, assistant secretary for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, said in a conference call with reporters that the United Nations and decades of patient diplomacy had put the United States in a much better position to police the international flow of narcotics than at any point in the last three decades. “We’ve still got major challenges ahead to address the opioid crisis here in the United States of America,” Mr. Brownfield said. Referring to an annual report on international narcotics released on Thursday, he added, “but in my humble opinion, this report suggests that we’re in a far better place to address those challenges now than we would have been 20, 30 or 40 years ago.” President Trump has criticized Mexico as a source of dangerous illegal immigrants and drugs, and his pledge to build a wall along the southern border of the United States has infuriated Mexican officials. Mr. Trump also referred to the United Nations on Twitter as “just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.” The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic that is now killing more people than traffic accidents, and at least 90 percent of the heroin consumed in this country comes from Mexico. Mr. Brownfield said the opioid crisis had been caused by, among other factors, doctors’ prescribing habits and soaring patient demand in the United States and by Mexican drug traffickers’ increased efforts to meet that demand. “The United States and Mexico have shared responsibility for this problem, and that requires shared solutions,” he said, adding that cooperation between the two governments to attack the problem was at “historically high levels.” Mr. Brownfield said that Mexico and the United Nations were vital allies in the fight against international drug trafficking. The Merida Initiative, a bilateral partnership with Mexico begun in 2007 that is focused on fighting organized criminal groups, “makes us more able to interdict drug trafficking than ever before,” he said. “In a sense,” he added, “we have developed a law enforcement cooperative wall.” The Trump administration is compiling a list of continuing American aid to Mexico, possibly in hopes of identifying money that could be diverted to help pay for a border wall. The Merida Initiative is the review’s biggest target. Asked if he planned to resign, as many Obama appointees have, Mr. Brownfield said, “I am in the job for which I was confirmed by the United States Senate in the year 2011 and will remain here until I am no longer in this job.” The Trump administration continues to rely on Obama appointees like Mr. Brownfield because of a slow appointments process.

553,Top Trump Advisers Are Split on Paris Agreement on Climate Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/climate-change-trump.html?searchResultPosition=29,2017/03/02,CLIMATE,"WASHINGTON — The White House is fiercely divided over President Trump’s campaign promise to “cancel” the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, is pressing the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord, according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate. But, they say, he is clashing with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who fear the move could have broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications. Mr. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to tear up President Barack Obama’s global warming policies, and on the home front he is moving aggressively to meet those pledges with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a new E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is a skeptic of climate science. Next week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama’s E.P.A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from coal-fired power plants. Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration’s program to meet the nation’s obligations to reduce climate emissions under the Paris agreement. While the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a 194-nation accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the four-year process to withdraw the world’s largest economy and second-largest climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming. Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic, throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and, diplomats say, the credibility of the United States. But it would also demonstrate to his supporters that Mr. Trump is a man of his word, putting American coal interests ahead of a global deal forged by Mr. Obama. "
554,A Young Immigrant Spoke Out About Her Deportation Fears. Then She Was Detained.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/immigrant-daca-detained.html?searchResultPosition=28,2017/03/02,U.S.,"A 22-year-old woman who came to the United States from Argentina as a 7-year-old child and was allowed to remain in the country under an Obama-era program was detained by immigration authorities after speaking at a news conference in Mississippi about her fears of being deported, her lawyer said on Thursday. The woman, Daniela Vargas, was picked up on Wednesday when the car she was riding in was pulled over by officers shortly after leaving the news conference at City Hall in Jackson, Miss., the lawyer, Abigail Peterson, said in a telephone interview. The event was organized by lawyers, church leaders and the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance to raise awareness about the impact deportation and President Trump’s immigration policies have on families. An officer placed Ms. Vargas in handcuffs after telling her, “You know what we are here for,” Ms. Peterson said. Ms Vargas was taken into custody and transferred to a detention center in Louisiana, where she was being held on Thursday without bond. Ms. Peterson said the authorities informed her on Thursday that Ms. Vargas would be processed as a “visa waiver overstay,” which means she would not be given a hearing and would be flown to Argentina. “That could be in a few weeks,” said Ms. Peterson. Ms. Vargas’s story is one of many that have circulated of families affected by immigration policies since Mr. Trump took office. Under the visa waiver program, Ms. Vargas and her family were allowed to stay for only 90 days. By staying longer, they became ineligible for an immigration hearing, L. Patricia Ice, the M.I.R.A. legal project director, said. But then, in 2012, Ms. Vargas was allowed to stay in the United States under a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program, started by former President Obama, allows immigrant children who had mostly grown up in the United States to become eligible for work permits and grants permission to stay temporarily. "
555,Betsy DeVos’s Power Over Black Colleges,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/betsy-devoss-power-over-black-colleges.html?searchResultPosition=27,2017/03/02,OPINION,"Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, deserved the hammering she received for her widely reviled comments characterizing historically black colleges and universities (H.B.C.U.s) as early examples of “school choice.” But when it comes to the fate of H.B.C.U.s under the Trump administration, her apparent misunderstanding of their history is a distraction. The fate of these institutions in the coming years will hinge not on her words, but on her decisions about their funding. In February, after only a few days on the job, Ms. DeVos made headlines for visiting Howard University, a historically black college founded in 1867. Then, after a meeting with H.B.C.U. leaders Monday, she released a statement calling H.B.C.U.s the “real pioneers when it comes to school choice.” That description was widely criticized as a dishonest attempt to distance these institutions from the segregated past that necessitated them and to awkwardly reposition them as talking points for the school choice movement. But her misguided remarks have diverted attention away from something more urgent: She now oversees the federal agency that is responsible for roughly three-fourths of the annual federal revenue to H.B.C.U.s. In ways that are much more consequential than any statement she could make, this power will allow her to determine how the schools fare under the Trump administration. Tuesday, President Trump issued an executive order moving the White House Initiative on HBCUs (WHI-HBCUs) from the Department of Education to the Office of the White House. Some H.B.C.U. advocates supported this move because of their impression that it would strengthen the administrative authority of the initiative and elevate the stature of its executive director. However, moving the WHI-HBCUs from the Department of Education to the White House distances the initiative from the source of essential funding for H.B.C.U.s. That’s because the Education Department is responsible for the distribution of approximately $700 million annually in grants, contracts and appropriations to those schools. But when it comes to annual revenue to H.B.C.U.s, the Office of the President is directly responsible for zero dollars. "

It’s now a cocktail bar downstairs from a cookie shop. “We could get a cookie,” Ms. Osborne said, shrugging. She had started her Dylan tour at Cafe Wha?, where Mr. Dylan performed as a New York neophyte in 1961. Reading from an online guide, she circled down to a townhouse at 94 Macdougal, where Mr. Dylan once lived, that is, until he got into a fistfight with a neighbor who had been going through his trash. “If you’re trying to be incognito, this is the last place you would buy a house,” she said. “So I don’t know what that was all about.” Ms. Osborne, best known for her 1995 single “One of Us,” has had Mr. Dylan on the brain. Through March 11, she is performing an all-Dylan cabaret set at Café Carlyle, which has lately hosted such eclectic talents as Debbie Harry and Isaac Mizrahi. The show is a reprise of her Carlyle debut last year, which also had a Dylan theme. The Carlyle had invited her to perform after she saw her friend Buster Poindexter play there. “It’s kind of like being an actor doing Shakespeare,” she said of her Dylan dive. “There’s a deep well.” Not that she’s the world’s biggest Dylan obsessive. Growing up in small-town Kentucky, she was turned off by his “more vicious songs” such as “Like a Rolling Stone,” she said. “It seemed like it was about some girl who had dumped him, and it was just unnecessarily nasty.” She was more into the Spinners and Led Zeppelin. Around 1983, when she was 20, she moved to New York for film school (she idolized François Truffaut and Bob Fosse) but dropped out when she ran out of tuition money. Instead, she fell in love with the blues. "

Instead, one of the four, Jairo Saenz, a leader of the local clique of a transnational gang with Salvadoran roots, grinned, swiveled in his chair and hardly looked at the crying relatives from El Salvador in the back of the courtroom. Mr. Saenz, 19, was one of five people arrested Thursday morning in Suffolk County on Long Island as part of a federal sweep that targeted 13 adult members of the gang, MS-13. An additional three people were charged as juveniles, and their records were sealed. As of Thursday evening, 14 people were in custody, with two yet to be arrested. In a midday news conference at the federal courthouse here, Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, announced the indictments and the arrests made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Long Island gang task force. “For far too long on Long Island, MS-13 has been meting out its own version of the death penalty,” Mr. Capers said. In the back of the courtroom — on the opposite side from the gang members’ families — sat Evelyn Rodriguez, the mother of Kayla Cuevas, 16, who, along with Kayla’s friend Nisa Mickens, 15, the government said was killed by the men. Ms. Rodriguez sat stoically. "

Nearly 50 years ago, Ruth Rosen and her friends sat in a Berkeley, Calif., living room and tried to imagine how their lives would have been different if they had been born as men. The stories spilled forth: a father who would not pay for college because girls didn’t need a degree; a nurse who told how the doctor treated her like a little girl; a woman who mused about an 11th Amendment to the Bill of Rights sparing women from cleaning toilets. “We’d go around the room,” Ms. Rosen recalled. “For a year, we discussed one injustice after the other. Then we began to see the commonality, wherever you were there was some difference because you were a woman. People began to realize, ‘I’ve never thought about it that way before.’ ” It’s a long way from that Berkeley living room to a bar in this conservative suburb of St. Louis, where a small band of women (and a handful of men) gathered to plot the way forward in the age of President Trump. But as women emerge among the most active standard-bearers of the resistance to this presidency, they are drawing on tactics honed in the 1960s-era consciousness raising groups that awakened women to their thwarted aspirations and power. One by one, the women in Ellisville recounted their own awakenings, how the election had jolted them out of mostly comfortable suburban lives. Many had tried keeping their opinions to themselves, outnumbered as they were in a red state and bound by the ethos of “Midwestern nice.” They spoke of their children and their fears about the future they would face. Some felt shame for failing to act earlier in causes like Black Lives Matter, with the city of Ferguson so close at hand. “I just can’t be complacent any more,” said Megan McCarthy, who organized the Ellisville meeting, one of the nearly 5,000 “huddles” convened last month that the organizers of the Women’s March on Washington hope can channel the protesters’ fervor into sustained political action. The latest effort will be “a day without a woman,” a general strike called for Wednesday. Many of the women who marched — and many who attended the Ellisville meeting — are new to activism; about a third told march organizers they had never attended a protest before. So as leaders try to translate this enthusiasm into tangible political change, they are updating consciousness-raising for a new age. "

Flynn, then Donald J. Trump’s incoming national security adviser, had a previously undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador in December to “establish a line of communication” between the new administration and the Russian government, the White House said on Thursday. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and now a senior adviser, also participated in the meeting at Trump Tower with Mr. Flynn and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. But among Mr. Trump’s inner circle, it is Mr. Flynn who appears to have been the main interlocutor with the Russian envoy — the two were in contact during the campaign and the transition, Mr. Kislyak and current and former American officials have said. But the extent and frequency of their contacts remains unclear, and the disclosure of the meeting at Trump Tower adds to the emerging picture of how the relationship between Mr. Trump’s incoming team and Moscow was evolving to include some of the president-elect’s most trusted advisers. The White House has repeatedly sought to play down any connections with Mr. Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions acknowledged this week that he had met twice with him during the campaign, despite previous denials. The New Yorker reported this week that Mr. Kushner had met with Mr. Kislyak at Trump Tower in December. Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, confirmed on Thursday that Mr. Flynn was also at the meeting in response to questions from a New York Times reporter. It is common and not improper for transition officials to meet with foreign officials. But all meetings between Trump associates and Russians are now significant as the F.B.I. investigates Russian interference in the American election and whether anyone close to Mr. Trump’s campaign was involved.

Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. Global modernism is gradually finding a place in the permanent collection galleries of the Museum of Modern Art, notably with the recent installation of work by artists from Iran, Iraq and Sudan in response to President Trump’s executive order regarding immigrants. Yet certain international artists may lie too far outside the MoMA-approved notion of modernist style to be candidates for inclusion. Among them is a group of South Asian painters who created lyrical, smooth-lined paintings that merge European academicism with Indian content. Y. G. Srimati (1926-2007) was one of these artists, as seen in the beautiful and important small show, “An Artist of Her Time: Y. G. Srimati and the Indian Style,” at the Met. Born in Mysore and raised in Madras (now Chennai), Ms. Srimati studied several classical South Asian art forms, becoming an expert instrumentalist, vocalist, dancer and painter. Deeply involved in the Gandhi-led anti-colonialist movement, she repurposed the illustrational naturalism taught in British-founded art schools by filtering it through older indigenous styles like those found in the sixth-century Buddhist murals at Ajanta and in Rajput miniatures. All these ingredients merge in the handful of watercolors brought together, from the Met’s collection and loans, by John Guy, the museum’s curator for the arts of South and Southeast Asia. The earliest pictures are impressive formal accomplishments in a difficult medium. And in work spanning 40 years, Ms. Srimati’s choreographic take on naturalism makes everyday subjects — a woman dressing, a family riding to market — look heroic, and images of deities and saints look approachably human. In the end, she’s a devotional artist, in the religious or spiritual sense: Her 1947-48 painting of the Hindu goddess Saraswati was originally displayed on her family’s home altar. And this is yet another factor likely to keep her from mainstream modernist acceptance. Religious art is still something that MoMA, and other Western-centric modern museums, have no idea what to do with, though the time may come when they will. HOLLAND COTTER Through April 8. Hauser & Wirth, 548 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-790-3900, hauserwirth.com. A group show of serial art is a dicey idea. Putting the photos of Roman Opalka, who documented the slow ravages of time with daily close-ups of his own face, next to the date paintings of On Kawara, who immortalized many of the days he lived through in sans-serif type, risks diminishing the austere grandeur each project has when encountered on its own terms. But works by Kawara, Opalka and two-dozen other Conceptual relatives do make an enlightening if somewhat grandiose background to the perennially renewable photographs of August Sander. For Sander, formal repetition wasn’t an end in itself but a conveniently stable framework for the slippery individuality of his subjects. Thirty-six original prints from his encyclopedic typology “People of the 20th Century,” chosen by Sherrie Levine and thoughtfully arranged by Sander’s grandson Gerd, include a priest, a member of Parliament, circus performers, and a fatuously solemn Nazi storm trooper. Each is given his or her own moment of eternal attention. "

It was central to the diplomatic dance surrounding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent visit with President Trump. Now the issues of Israeli sovereignty are revisited in two new films. Shimon Dotan’s documentary “The Settlers” gives the headlines a firm grounding in context. While any explanation of this fraught phenomenon feels like an oversimplification, Mr. Dotan sorts out the forces and personalities that shaped the movement, going back to the 1967 Six-Day War that provided the territorial gains that enabled some Israelis, with a range of ideologies, to stake out newly occupied lands. The film takes viewers into the living rooms (and, in one case, the yurt) of Jews who have moved onto Palestinian land. Packed with maps and facts, the documentary pointedly notes that the approximately 400,000 settlers stand in the way of peace by ensuring that the land will not revert to Palestinian control. Some of today’s settlements of spacious homes with swimming pools have tunnels that allow residents to zip to Israel proper. Keeping settlers safe, the film notes, is costly. Then there are the outpost dwellers, who strike out to build towns in as yet untouched occupied areas. Most settlers interviewed are united in their outspoken love of the land. Some talk about hating and hurting Palestinians. Mr. Dotan talks to Palestinians whose olive groves have been disturbed by settlers or who have seen their land gobbled up by the illegal construction of outposts by renegades. Their frustrated accounts illuminate some subtexts for the rock-throwing boys of the Palestinian uprisings. When the settlement movement began, David Ben-Gurion, one of the Zionist founding fathers and Israel’s first prime minister, was just leaving politics. “Ben-Gurion: Epilogue” is a refreshing and effectively edited documentary that has at its core a six-hour black-and-white interview conducted in 1968. Lost for decades, it was trimmed and shaped by the writer and director Yariv Mozer, and interleaved with news footage and other clips that contain everything from historic moments of oratory to charming shots of the elder statesman doing a headstand on the beach or sharing a piano bench with Ray Charles. Ben-Gurion’s message, in the sessions conducted five years before his death, is, at this point, largely a peaceful, nonexpansionist one that contrasts sharply with many of the Israeli voices in the settlement film. It conveys a satisfying, informative portrait of a well-read man who looks back at his life, good decisions and bad, with wisdom and intelligence. "

563,Rethinking Our Immigration System,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/rethinking-our-immigration-system.html?searchResultPosition=19,2017/03/02,OPINION,"TO THE EDITOR: Re “The Immigration Debate We Need,” by George Borjas (Op-Ed, Feb. 27): I have seen this issue from both sides. I served as an Immigration and Naturalization Service prosecutor during the 1980s and have specialized in immigration law for the past 30 years. There are many ways that our legal immigration system could be improved. First, since legal immigration to the United States is approximately one-third of 1 percent of our population and the baby boom is long over, there is no need to reduce immigration. If anything, it should be increased. Second, most immigrants today are chosen by whether they have close family members in the United States. This system is good for families, but it does not necessarily serve the interests of our country. Let’s get rid of the brother-sister category. Let’s also press “delete” on the program that allows 50,000 people to immigrate to the United States annually based on a lottery! Third, let’s get rid of “per-country quotas” for talented immigrants, which makes it take way longer for highly educated people to immigrate to the United States from countries like India, China and the Philippines than for people from other countries. Let’s give the green cards that are now reserved for the visa lottery and the sibling category to highly skilled immigrants who are doctors, nurses, cancer researchers and entrepreneurs. That would be in our best interest. CARL SHUSTERMAN, LOS ANGELES TO THE EDITOR: George Borjas contributes to a thoughtful debate on immigration, but he ignores, it seems, some major trends. The historical link between rising productivity and increasing wages has been severed. That more than anything may be the cause of wage stagnation for less skilled, non-college-degreed workers. Immigration did not cause or exacerbate that trend. Restricting immigration will not fix it. Because of the baby boomers, the nonimmigrant work force is aging and shrinking. Immigration ameliorates that. Without robust immigration, there may not be enough wage earners in a decade or so to support retirement benefits for those who have retired. Despite the so-called “ethnic enclaves,” most second-generation immigrants and first-generation immigrants who arrived as children (the “Dreamers”) are fully assimilated, well educated and integrated into the economic life of the nation. That helps avoid the retirement crunch down the road and decline in economic activity that results from a shrinking work force. Immigration, even of undocumented immigrants, is not what ails the American economy, and constricting it may do more long-term harm than short-term good. Pointing to immigration as a significant economic harm diverts attention from the real source of economic distress for working Americans, which is income inequality. The causes and fixes for that have little if anything to do with immigration, legal or otherwise. MICHAEL STARR, NEW YORK "

She blames everybody, including President Trump for enforcing the law, except herself. I am an immigrant, too. I am a legal immigrant. I came to this country with a student visa. After that visa expired, it would have been easy for me to stay on illegally. However, as a responsible person, I did not want to start my life in this country as a criminal. So I applied for a green card. I had to return to my home country and go through the application process there. When, after two years, my green card was granted, I returned to the United States as a legal immigrant, and later became a citizen. If Ms. Vizguerra’s isn’t a proper case for deportation, I don’t know what is. I feel very sorry for her children, who have to suffer from their mother’s irresponsibility and total disregard of the laws of this country. URS RUDIGER, LOS ALTOS, CALIF. "

Could Face Deep Cuts",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/trump-mnuchin-irs.html?searchResultPosition=16,2017/03/02,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has a rocky history with the Internal Revenue Service, which he has complained audits him with unfair ferocity. Now he wants to significantly cut the tax agency’s funding at a time when it has already been bleeding staff and struggling to keep up with a flood of returns ahead of Tax Day. The plans, revealed this week in documents associated with the White House budget outline, put Mr. Trump at odds with his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who has argued that the I.R.S. needs more money and a larger staff. Another round of cuts, tax experts say, could put one of the few federal departments that pay for themselves on life support. “This is an agency that has had every last drop squeezed out of it,” said Dennis J. Ventry Jr., a member of the I.R.S. advisory council and a law professor at the University of California, Davis. “I don’t know how it’s going to sustain itself.” The White House budget office has proposed a 14.1 percent cut to the I.R.S. for the fiscal year that begins in October, reducing the agency’s budget to $9.65 billion; six years ago, it stood at $12.1 billion ($13.6 billion when adjusted for inflation). If approved, the cuts would happen when the number of audits is down and customer service complaints are up as a result of the drop in funding. "

Some of the same dynamics found on the Democratic side have been present for Republicans: Only two candidates have officially begun active campaigns, with other potential rivals to Mr. de Blasio waiting in the wings amid the looming uncertainty of a federal investigation of the mayor’s fund-raising activities that has now appeared to enter its final stage. Republican Party officials have been vocal in their desire for the party to coalesce around a single candidate and prevent the sort of bruising and expensive primary battle that occurred in 2013 and left the victor, Joseph J. Lhota, severely hobbled in his race against Mr. de Blasio. “Everything I raised for the general, I ended up spending it in the primary,” said Mr. Lhota, adding that it left him effectively starting from scratch against Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who already enjoyed a lopsided voter registration advantage. In New York City, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans more than six to one. In recent weeks, the campaign of Paul J. Massey Jr., a millionaire former real estate executive and the de facto Republican front-runner, has pressed its efforts to head off a primary, quietly urging other declared and potential candidates to step aside.

568,"Welcome Refugees, Churches Say in a Public Challenge to Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/churches-welcome-refugees-trump.html?searchResultPosition=14,2017/03/02,U.S.,"The fight against President Trump’s executive orders to turn away refugees, deport undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the Mexican border is about to escalate in many American churches. A broad network of 37 Protestant and Orthodox Christian denominations will announce on Friday a campaign to mobilize its congregants — some 30 million Americans in all — to lobby the president and members of Congress to rescind the executive orders. In a declaration hammered out over the last month, church leaders call the orders “unjust and immoral” and say they run counter to “the values we as people of faith hold dear: to welcome the stranger and assist those most in need.” “It is imperative that we speak out against the notion that refugees are a threat to our safety,” the declaration adds. “They are not.” The president’s Jan. 27 executive order, which he called necessary for national security, barred people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the country for 90 days, stopped refugee admissions for 120 days and banned refugees from Syria indefinitely. The White House is expected to issue a revised order very soon. American Christians have been divided over Mr. Trump’s order, according to a poll released last month by the Pew Research Center. White evangelical Protestants supported the order by more than three to one, the poll showed, while white mainline Protestants supported it by a slim margin (50 to 47 percent), and three in five Catholics opposed it. The new campaign is being organized by the Orthodox and mainline Protestant churches affiliated with the National Council of Churches and Church World Service, a charity that resettles refugees. It calls on congregants and pastors to appeal to their elected officials, sign poster-size copies of the declaration displayed in their houses of worship, dedicate one Sunday in the next three months to honor refugees and immigrants, and raise $1 million to support them. Hundreds of churches and synagogues across the country have already offered to provide sanctuary or other support to undocumented immigrants in fear of deportation. And other faith-based resettlement agencies have spoken out against the refugee and travel ban, including World Relief, an evangelical agency; HIAS, a Jewish group; and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The president’s executive order gave preference to refugees who are Christians and other religious minorities, but the declaration opposes that move, saying it “actually places them at greater risk in some countries.” “This is so counterproductive,” said Erol Kekic, executive director of the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service. “It makes Christians and minorities in those countries an even bigger target, because the perception is already that they receive preferential treatment. And singling them out even more would probably not help.” "

He leaves for Chicago on Friday morning, goes to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Saturday, then heads to Los Angeles on Sunday. Earlier this week, he was in Washington, and over last weekend, Atlanta. That makes five cities in eight days, as Politico pointed out. A little bit of his traveling is typical mayoral business — the United States Conference of Mayors met in Washington on Wednesday, for instance — but a lot of it is rattling the cup for his re-election campaign, with fund-raisers scheduled in California, Florida and Illinois. On the one hand, it might seem strange for a New York City politician to be asking people across the country for money, particularly because he is facing no major opposition and has raised nearly more money than his nine opponents combined. After all, the Democratic Party is in tatters at every level; wouldn’t a well-heeled Democrat be better off spending money on uncelebrated legislative races in Idaho or Iowa or Ohio? Still, it is hard to imagine that an ambitious Democrat like Mr. de Blasio could resist the chance to jump into the bull market for political and liberal fund-raising set off by the election of President Trump. Moreover, while Mr. de Blasio may not have won the hearts and minds of New Yorkers, he can plausibly tell a story across the country of some liberal successes — universal prekindergarten — and the continued decline in serious crime at the same time that his administration finished dismantling the widely loathed stop-and-frisk program.

570,The Surprisingly Lively Home of a Controversial Artist,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/t-magazine/art/maggi-hambling-artist-home.html?searchResultPosition=38,2017/03/02,ART,"Maggi Hambling is an artist who has long been preoccupied by death — but her South London studio couldn’t feel more alive. The lobby, for starters, is painted an exuberant shade of ocher — and filled with small clusters of paintings, sketches and a large Rococo-style papier-mâché mirror. A wooden chair, carved in the shape of an elephant, guards the open-plan kitchen and living quarters — which are also home to toy parrots, Mexican masks, cowhide rugs and a contorted Euphorbia plant called Esmeralda. The two-story duplex is spirited, engaging and fiercely unusual — much like its owner. “So, you’ve spotted I’m not a minimalist,” roars Hambling, expelling a puff of smoke from a Marlborough Menthol cigarette. “I still occasionally think of throwing everything out, but can’t quite get around to doing it.” This is the first time the Suffolk-born painter and sculptor, 71, has opened the doors to her Clapham Old Town abode, which she purchased at the start of 1984 in search of “more space and light.” Even back then, the area was gentrified and filled with well-to-do individuals who surfed the nearby high street for ceramic knickknacks and artisanal bread on the weekends. “I always preferred to say I lived in Battersea because it had far more street cred,” Hambling confesses with a wry smile. “But in the end I just had to accept it.” Hambling shares the Victorian property with Tory Lawrence, her partner of 33 years, who is also an artist. Recently, it has become something of a city bolt-hole for the pair, who now spend most of the week at their 17th-century house in Saxmunham, a rural town in East Suffolk. “In London, everything seems to be concertinaed into one short bit of time,” Hambling says. “In Suffolk you get the sense of a whole day. Also, the light is better.” Invariably, the county’s bucolic landscape and dramatic coastlines have inspired much of her six-decade-strong oeuvre — from her large public sculpture “Scallop,” which was erected on Aldeburgh beach in 2003 as a tribute to the iconic composer Benjamin Britten, to her distinctive oil-on-canvas depictions of breaking waves and perturbed seas. Evocative portraits are perhaps her most popular — and controversial — works. She drew her former lover, Henrietta Moraes — a captivating beauty and notorious alcoholic, known as the Queen of Soho — shortly after her passing, once in the hospital morgue and then again in her coffin. Her dear friend George Melly was also the subject of a series of works that documented the British jazz singer on the precipice of death and after it. She speaks of these pieces in a lower, more serious register. “My art is a response to what happens in life. George Melly said I would go down in history as Maggi ‘coffin’ Hambling because of my habit of drawing dead people,” she says. “The truth is, I’ve found it rather therapeutic to go on painting them after death. It’s like grieving in a positive way, rather than just being negative.” "

Unidentified men carrying clubs attack a group of men who seem to have commandeered the freight train, and a fight ensues with sticks, hurled stones and a buzzing chain saw. The defenders of the train are getting the worst of it until an armed man arrives on the scene and fires a warning shot into the air, scattering the attackers. Tensions are rising along the border between Ukraine and the breakaway “republics” in the eastern part of the country as Ukrainian nationalists from the western part seek to choke off all railroad traffic in what they are calling a blockade. The war in eastern Ukraine, now entering its third year, has been the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. Despite the continuing clashes, however, the lucrative cross-border coal trade has been peculiarly unaffected. The blockaders, as they call themselves, are a relatively new movement but are already becoming relevant to the delicate politics of peace in Ukraine, seemingly a focus of the Trump administration as it seeks to establish warmer ties with Russia. Their primary goal is to cut off the trains carrying coal from the east that powers industry in the west but also is a major source of income for the Russian-backed eastern republics. The idea, which has animated Ukrainian nationalist circles, is to force the financing of the breakaway regions and their three million or so inhabitants onto Russia’s already weak economy by breaking ties with Ukraine’s industrial base.

572,"They’ll Always Have Paris, Despite What Trump Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/theyll-always-have-paris-despite-what-trump-says.html?searchResultPosition=37,2017/03/02,OPINION,"PANTIN, France — At least since Benjamin Franklin arrived here in 1776, Paris has represented for Americans a cherished ideal, a place where the pleasures of food, wine, sex, art, thought and conversation can be pursued as they cannot in the United States. A host of American writers, from Henry James and Edith Wharton, to Henry Miller and Ernest Hemingway, bloomed in Paris. African-American writers Richard Wright and James Baldwin felt far freer of the weight of racism in Paris than they did at home. President Trump’s disparaging remark last Friday, that Paris was not what it used to be, would be something of a jolt to many American expatriates, who are more concerned about what was happening back home than in their beloved adopted city. Mr. Trump was speaking at a conservative conference when he referred to “Jim,” who he said was a “a very, very substantial guy” who stopped visiting Paris four or five years ago because “Paris was no longer Paris.” He let the audience imagine why with the story’s punch line: “We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.” Among those who have learned what Trump means by stopping terrorists was the distinguished French historian Henry Rousso. Hardly a “radical Islamic terrorist” — in fact, he’s a Jew born in Egypt — Mr. Rousso said that he was detained for more than 10 hours and threatened with deportation by American border agents when he arrived at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport last Wednesday to attend a conference at Texas A&M University. Mr. Rousso — who has visited the United States without incident for 30 years, and who has been invited to such institutions as Harvard University, Dartmouth College and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum — was cleared to enter the United States only after the university enlisted legal assistance. “What I know, loving this country for a long time,” Mr. Rousso wrote on Sunday, in the French edition of The Huffington Post, “is that the United States is no longer quite the United States.” "
573,"President Trump, an Unlikely Champion of Affordable Child Care",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/trump-child-care-gop.html?searchResultPosition=41,2017/03/02,POLITICS,"In his address to Congress Tuesday evening, President Trump leaned on some of his standard crowd pleasers: immigration, jobs, terrorism. But he also revived one of his more surprising proposals, first introduced on the campaign trail last year: “My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable,” he said. That rhetoric makes Mr. Trump sound more like Hillary Clinton than Ronald Reagan. And a potential debate over child-care policy could offer the rare opportunity for the president and Democrats to cooperate — or at least have a dialogue — over the coming year. Mr. Trump is not the first Republican president to demonstrate an interest in child-care policy. During his 1968 campaign, Richard Nixon promised to expand access to government-funded day care. But three years later, influenced by the rise of the Christian right, Mr. Nixon vetoed the only universal child-care bill to pass Congress. Although a few of today’s mainstream Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, have promoted child-care proposals, the official G.O.P. platform does not mention the issue. Conservatives tend to view government-funded child care as an expensive and unwanted intrusion into family life. The position of House Speaker Paul Ryan — whose support Mr. Trump would presumably need to enact a child-care plan — is a case in point. In his 2014 report on poverty, Mr. Ryan fretted over the results of research on Quebec’s public child-care program, which is known for its lax educational standards. Such subsidized care “encourages married women to enter the labor force,” the Ryan report said, leading to “a number of negative behavioral and health outcomes for the children.” (What Mr. Ryan didn’t mention: a competing body of research showing that high-quality day care helps children thrive academically.) Arguments about the wisdom of working motherhood tend to ignore the fact that working motherhood is the norm. More than half of American mothers work in the year after giving birth, as do 64 percent of women with children under the age of 6, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Working parents require child care, and the typical American family spends 29 percent of its after-tax income on child-care costs, compared with 10 percent or less in many other Western democracies, where child care is provided for or heavily subsidized by the state. Average annual tuition at an American day care center is nearly $10,000, and as much as $30,000 for a high-quality program in cities like New York and Los Angeles. "

His announcement, delivered at a terse news conference, came after a day of rapid-fire developments in a murky affair that has shadowed President Trump, jeopardized his closest aides and intensified pressure for a full inquiry into Moscow’s attempts to influence the election as well as the policies of the new administration. Many top Democrats demanded Mr. Sessions’s resignation, and a growing number of Republicans declared that he should not take part in any investigation into the case, given his own still largely unexplained role in it. But Mr. Trump stoutly defended Mr. Sessions, one of his few early champions on Capitol Hill. “He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional,” he said in a statement, which accused Democrats of engaging in “a total witch hunt.” Mr. Sessions insisted there was nothing nefarious about his two meetings with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, even though he did not disclose them to the Senate during his confirmation hearing and they occurred during the heat of the race between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Sessions was advising on national security.

Jim Mattis once pleaded with Congress to invest more in State Department diplomacy. “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition,” he explained. Alas, President Trump took him literally, but not seriously. The administration plans a $54 billion increase in military spending, financed in part by a 37 percent cut in the budgets of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. That reflects a misunderstanding about the world — that security is assured only when we’re blowing things up. It’s sometimes true that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, as Chairman Mao said, but it also emerges from diplomacy, foreign aid and carefully cultivated good will. Military power is especially limited when threats come from new directions. More than four times as many Americans now die each year from opioids as have died in the Iraq and Afghan wars combined, but warships can’t defeat drug traffickers. To beat traffickers, we need diplomacy and the good will of countries like Mexico and Afghanistan. "

As the flight attendant read the choices aloud, a young man across the aisle said, “I don’t watch chick flicks!” I knew what he meant, and so did the woman sitting next to me. A “chick flick” is one that has more dialogue than car chases, more relationships than special effects, and whose suspense comes more from how people live than from how they get killed. I wasn’t challenging his preference, but I did question the logic of his term. After all, much of what we read as great literature in school may well have been called “chick lit,” especially if it had been written by women. Think about it: If “Anna Karenina"" had been by Leah Tolstoy, or “The Scarlet Letter” by Nancy Hawthorne or “A Doll’s House” by Henrietta Ibsen — if “The Invisible Man” had been “The Invisible Woman” — would they have been hailed as classics? Suppose Shakespeare had really been the Dark Lady who some people still think he/she was. I bet most of her plays and all of her sonnets would have been dismissed as ye olde Elizabethan chick lit and buried until they were resurrected by stubborn feminist scholars of today. Indeed, as long as men are taken seriously when they write about the female half of the world — and women are not taken seriously when writing about ourselves, much less about men and public affairs — the list of Great Authors will be more about power than talent, more about opinion than experience. Still, this was not the problem of the guy on the plane. He was just trying to find a movie he wanted to watch. His “chick flick” label might help him avoid certain movies, but shouldn’t he have a label to guide him toward movies he actually liked? "

He called for corporate tax reform and export incentives, and he lashed out at Nafta and China for draining America’s manufacturing base. Mr. Trump’s stance on trade is one of his most popular positions, but many economists and policy makers are skeptical: They say that rapid automation will negate any gains made in bringing manufacturing jobs back, while the tariffs and other policies he has suggested using will ignite disastrous trade wars. The doubters are wrong on both points. American manufacturing’s most advanced sectors remain big employers, and much of their payroll shrinkage stems from predatory competition from high- and low-wage countries, as well as offshoring by American multinationals. And the trade-war alarmists overlook the matchless, yet overwhelmingly neglected, leverage America holds over the global economy. Although cheap, labor-intensive goods often come to mind when Americans think of job-displacing imports, the more capital- and technology-intensive segments of manufacturing have hardly been immune. Sectors like motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, nonelectrical machinery (like machine tools, farm machinery and power-generating turbines) and industrial chemicals add up to nearly half of manufacturing’s enormous, chronic annual trade deficits nowadays. Such sectors still employ millions of Americans. For example, more than 947,900 jobs are currently found in automotive production (including 145,700 in the highest-value segments, like engines and powertrains and their parts), nearly 360,000 in semiconductor and related manufacturing, more than one million in machinery and more than 200,000 in pharmaceuticals. And a recent Commerce Department report indicates that in 2014 their trade shortfalls alone — leaving aside any impact from labor-saving technologies — cost more than 200,000 jobs, both in the industries themselves and throughout their American supply and logistics chains.

The figurines had once belonged to Edith Bouvier Beale, better known as Little Edie, a woman of many cats, who for years lived in the house with her mother, known as Big Edie. Both were former socialites and relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The figurines were among the many artifacts that Ms. Quinn, the journalist and author, kept when she bought the house from the younger Ms. Beale in 1979, paying $220,000 for what was then a place of almost unimaginable squalor. Restoring the home was not for the faint of heart, but Ms. Quinn was undeterred. In fact, she was smitten. “‘It’s yours,’” Ms. Quinn recalled Little Edie saying to her. “She did a little pirouette in the hall and said, ‘All it needs is a coat of paint.’” The home was long ago restored to its old Hamptons charm, and cleared of all cat smells — unless, Ms. Quinn said, you happen to stick your nose into a particular corner of the foyer after a rainstorm that lasts days. The house is decorated in soft blues and floral wallpaper and is dotted with plenty of fat-leaf potted plants. It is vibrant even in winter. "

President Trump and his supporters say that this has led to increased crime and other problems in that country and argue that this is a reason the United States should accept fewer immigrants, especially those coming from the Middle East. Official data show that Sweden has not seen a spike in crime, though the influx has heightened anti-immigrant sentiment there. To better understand that country’s experience, I spoke to Henrik Emilsson, an international immigration researcher at Malmö University. The interview has been edited and condensed. What has been happening in Sweden in recent years with regard to immigration? Sweden has always had more humanitarian migrants than the rest of Europe. For the last 10 years it has been seven or eight times the average in Europe. Since 2006, it has been a very high number of asylum seekers — first the Iraqis, then Somalis and Afghanis, and now, the latest wave from Syria. Is there any evidence that recent immigrants are having an impact on crime in Sweden? Not the recent ones. There is a huge debate in Sweden about immigration and crime. And we know from earlier statistics that the foreign-born commit three times as many crimes on average as native-borns. But these riots and crimes in the suburbs, they are related mostly to drugs and gangs. Those people are born and raised in Sweden. It has nothing to do with the recent immigration. It’s the children of migrants and maybe people that came when they were young. There has been this issue of sexual harassment. And there is some evidence that the new refugees are somewhat involved in this. But there are no official statistics on it. What about terrorism? Not particularly, because the people for example who have gone and fought for ISIS, they are also quite established — they are Swedes that have grown up here. Why would people who have been in Sweden for a while, or their children, become radicalized? Does it have anything to do with the circumstances in which they grew up? "
581,"Democracy, Disrupted",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/how-the-internet-threatens-democracy.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/03/02,OPINION,"As the forces of reaction outpace movements predicated on the ideal of progress, and as traditional norms of political competition are tossed aside, it’s clear that the internet and social media have succeeded in doing what many feared and some hoped they would. They have disrupted and destroyed institutional constraints on what can be said, when and where it can be said and who can say it. Even though in one sense President Trump’s victory in 2016 fulfilled conventional expectations — because it prevented a third straight Democratic term in the White House — it also revealed that the internet and its offspring have overridden the traditional American political system of alternating left-right advantage. They are contributing — perhaps irreversibly — to the decay of traditional moral and ethical constraints in American politics. Matthew Hindman, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University and the author of “The Myth of Digital Democracy,” said in a phone interview that “if you took the label off, someone looking at the United States would have to be worried about democratic failure or transitioning toward a hybrid regime.” Such a regime, in his view, would keep the trappings of democracy, including seemingly free elections, while leaders would control the election process, the media and the scope of permissible debate. “What you get is a country that is de facto less free.” Scott Goodstein, the C.E.O. of Revolution Messaging, has run online messaging for both the Obama and Sanders campaigns. When I spoke to him in a phone interview, he argued that the internet has been Goodstein noted, however, “a horrible development on the internet” last year: The use of digital technology in the 2016 election “represents the latest chapter in the disintegration of legacy institutions that had set bounds for American politics in the postwar era,” Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford, writes in a forthcoming paper, “Can American Democracy Survive the Internet?” According to Persily, the Trump campaign was “totally unprecedented in its breaking of established norms of politics.” He argues that "

Now President Xi Jinping, already the strongest Chinese leader in decades, may be maneuvering to bend those rules to retain a formidable ally — and create a precedent he could use to extend his own time in power. Mr. Xi, 63, who has shaken up many political norms, does not want to be shackled by an informal rule created by his predecessors, people close to senior officials have said. Whether Mr. Xi can get away with changing the age ceiling for staying in the party’s top rank, the Politburo Standing Committee, has become a bellwether of how far he can consolidate his grip on a new party leadership that will be chosen in the fall. Mr. Xi’s immediate goal appears to be opening the way to retaining Wang Qishan, who has led his signature anticorruption drive and become one of the most powerful and feared officials in China, those people and other observers said. Mr. Wang, who is 68, could be forced to step down this year if the informal age ceiling holds. But keeping Mr. Wang in place would also create an example that Mr. Xi could follow to stay in power after his two terms as president end in 2023. Already, news that Mr. Xi may delay choosing his successor has fanned speculation that he wants to prolong his hold on power. "

Doug Burgum signed into law four bills aimed at making it easier to control such protests. With a few strokes of a pen, he placed the state in the vanguard of an emerging backlash by conservative forces against political and social advocates who see demonstrations — however unruly — as free speech protected by the Constitution. In a season rife with demonstrations over immigration, pipelines, abortion, women’s rights and more, Republican legislators in at least 16 states have filed bills intended to make protests more orderly or to toughen penalties against ones that go awry. Republicans in two other states, Massachusetts and North Carolina, have said they will file protest-related bills. Those numbers include only bills whose sponsors have specifically linked them to protests, said Jonathan Griffin, a policy analyst who tracks the measures at the National Conference of State Legislatures. How many will be enacted is unclear; a few already have been pronounced dead in committee. Some sociologists and legal experts say the bills are in line with a general trend toward tougher treatment of protesters after especially disruptive demonstrations like the Occupy Wall Street movement in Manhattan and the 2014 violence in Ferguson, Mo. But interviews and news reports suggest that some of the measures are either backed by supporters of President Trump or are responses to demonstrations against him and his policies. After a Nashville motorist struck safety workers who were escorting anti-Trump protesters at a crosswalk, a Tennessee state representative introduced legislation that would relieve motorists of any liability should they accidentally hit someone deliberately blocking a street.

What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Alec Baldwin made a confession on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Wednesday. Or was it a humble brag? The first time the producers at “Saturday Night Live” asked him to impersonate Donald J. Trump, he said, he was completely unprepared. After more than a year, Mr. Baldwin thinks he has gotten deeper into the president’s head. Conan O’Brien went to Mexico on Wednesday (actually, he aired an episode that he taped there last month). Inevitably, talk turned to Mr. Trump rather quickly. Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president, made an appearance, and he had some unprintable words for Mr. Trump — emblazoned on a pair of cowboy boots. The late-show hosts took their shots at Mr. Trump’s speech Tuesday to a joint session of Congress. Most argued that despite the news media’s focus on its relatively measured tone, the speech did not depart from most of Mr. Trump’s controversial stances on the issues. “You could tell it was divisive,” Seth Meyers said, “not just from the policies, but the faces on Democrats.” "
585,Jeff Sessions Needs to Go,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/jeff-sessions-needs-to-go.html?searchResultPosition=40,2017/03/02,OPINION,"This article has been updated to reflect news developments. In the wake of Wednesday’s revelation that Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with Russia’s ambassador to the United States while working with the Trump campaign, despite denying those contacts during his confirmation hearings, Mr. Sessions recused himself from overseeing any Justice Department investigation into contacts between the campaign and the Russian government. Some members of Congress are saying that’s not enough; they want him to resign. It’s a bombshell of a story. And it’s one with a clear and disturbing precedent. In 1972 Richard G. Kleindienst, the acting attorney general, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing on his nomination by President Richard Nixon to be attorney general. He was to replace Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who had resigned to run Nixon’s re-election campaign (and who would later be sent to prison in the Watergate scandal). Several Democratic senators were concerned about rumors of White House interference in a Justice Department antitrust suit against International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, a campaign contributor to the Republican National Committee. They asked Kleindienst several times if he had ever spoken with anyone at the White House about the I.T.T. case. He said he had not. That wasn’t true. Later, after Kleindienst was confirmed as attorney general, the special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, and his team uncovered an Oval Office tape recording of a phone call in which Nixon told Kleindiesnt to drop the I.T.T. case. Kleindienst claimed that he thought the senators’ questions were limited to a particular period, not the entire time during which the case was pending. Jaworski didn’t buy it. He filed criminal charges against Kleindienst, who had earlier resigned as attorney general. Eventually Kleindienst pleaded guilty to failure to provide accurate information to Congress, a misdemeanor, for conduct that many observers believed amounted to perjury. He was also reprimanded by the Arizona State Bar. Last month, during Mr. Sessions’s confirmation hearing for attorney general, Senator Al Franken, Democrat from Minnesota, asked Mr. Sessions what he would do if he learned of evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign.

In the Obama administration’s last days, officials raced to preserve intelligence about Russian efforts to interfere in the American presidential election — and about possible contacts between associates of Donald J. Trump and Russians — fearing that it could be covered up or destroyed after power changed hands. And new questions are being raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is said to have met with the Russian ambassador twice in the past year. That would appear to contradict testimony he gave to Congress during his confirmation hearings. Democrats demanded late Wednesday that the attorney general recuse himself from an inquiry into contacts between the Trump team and Russia. Mr. Sessions denied having met with “any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.” • G.O.P. unity on health care is elusive. Republican lawmakers remain divided over plans to replace the Affordable Care Act, including how the federal government would help people buy health insurance. "
587,Richard Holmes: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/books/review/richard-holmes-by-the-book.html?searchResultPosition=53,2017/03/02,BOOK REVIEW,"The author, most recently, of “This Long Pursuit” has strong memories and deep feelings of discovering “On the Road” in 1960, “the book that made me fall in love with America aged 15.” What books are currently on your night stand? In my case it’s less of a night stand, and more of a night fall. Books tend to lie on the floor all round my side of the bed, frequently under it, and sometimes even in it (leading to mild complaints or occasional kidnappings). I like to have several on the go at once, according to mood. Currently it’s Andrea Wulf’s superb popular science biography “The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt’s New World,” which ranges across Europe and South America and the beginnings of environmentalism in the 19th century. Then, at a time when “fake news” is much under debate, the compelling memoirs by the veteran BBC foreign correspondent John Simpson, “We Chose to Speak of War and Strife,” which includes a history of this heroic, truth-telling eyewitness form, starting with the Battle of Waterloo. To balance all that local drama, I am studying the big picture as thrillingly projected in “Mapping the Heavens,” a strikingly lucid account of the expansion, not just of the universe, but the way we have tried to understand it, from the Babylonians to black holes and dark matter, all coolly narrated by the glamorous professor of astronomy at Yale, Priyamvada Natarajan. And finally, buried deep somewhere or other, my battered, priceless O.U.P. paperback of “Coleridge’s Notebooks: A Selection.” What’s the best classic novel you recently read for the first time? For a month last summer I sat on a garden bench under a cherry tree in France, and very slowly read Leo Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina.” All I can say is that it was an utterly transporting experience. I fell in love with Anna, and she joined my private pantheon of tragic 19th-century heroines: Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, Theodor Fontane’s Effi Briest and Henry James’s Isabel Archer (in “The Portrait of a Lady”). As a biographer, these books simply remind me of the matchless power of great fiction to create a permanent world and a unique life, that nonfiction can never really quite reach (though Elizabeth Gaskell’s biography of Charlotte Brontë comes close). It’s a humbling, but also uplifting, experience. I can still taste the cherries. What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of? “On the Road,” by Jack Kerouac. Yes, I know, I know. But very few readers nowadays can have heard of it as I did, in 1960, the book that made me fall in love with America aged 15. What makes for a good biography? Call it the imaginative handshake. The power to transport the reader to another time, another place, and another identity with absolute conviction; and then make them come away with the sensation “I really met that person — and I know how they felt about the world — and it was worth it.” The first writer to show me how this could be done was Michael Holroyd, with his “Lytton Strachey” (1968) set in England mostly before and after the First World War, and recreating the whole lost world and sensibility of Bloomsbury. For me it has been done many times since, and in many different ways: by the big epic of Robert Caro’s Lyndon Johnson; or the vivid celebration of Hilary Spurling’s Matisse; or the exquisite intellectual portrait of Hermione Lee’s Virginia Woolf; or the weird street encounter of Alexander Masters’s “Stuart: A Life Backwards”; or the airborne glamour of Stacy Schiff’s “Saint-Exupéry: A Biography”; or the zingy, sexy bohemian portrait of Edmund Gordon’s “The Invention of Angela Carter”; or the haunted journey into the labyrinthine inner world of an English opium eater recounted by Frances Wilson in “Guilty Thing: A Life of Thomas De Quincey.” The possibilities of good biography are so rich! What do you read when you’re working on a book? And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing? "

Selling for 48 million pounds after a valuation of at least £35 million, the painting was fought over by four telephone bidders, reflecting newly energized demand for works by the great names of 20th-century art. “This was a momentous night for the art market,” the auctioneer, Helena Newman, chairwoman of Sotheby’s Europe, said after her evening sale of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art, which brought a total of £194.8 million. It was the highest total for any auction staged in London, not accounting for inflation. This result, together with other strong prices achieved at the Impressionist and modern sale at Christie’s the previous evening, seemed to signal a strengthening of the international art market. High-end auctions of contemporary art will be tested in London next week. At least for the moment, “there’s a general sense of investor confidence” said James Roundell, a director at Dickinson, the London dealers. “Maybe it’s the Trump effect.” Before the auction, Sotheby’s bought Klimt’s flowery painting, “Bauerngarten (Blumengarten),” from its owner, David Graham, a Canadian collector who lives in London.

591,There Are No ‘Killers’ in Vladimir Putin’s Russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/there-are-no-killers-in-vladimir-putins-russia.html?searchResultPosition=49,2017/03/02,OPINION,"MOSCOW — When Bill O’Reilly interviewed President Trump last month and called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a killer, Mr. Trump did not object. He just responded that there are plenty of killers in America, too. At this point, we can only speculate about the true nature of relations between the American and Russian presidents. No matter what, Mr. Trump came up with the perfect answer — the one most likely to appeal to Mr. Putin. (The Kremlin demanded an apology only from Mr. O’Reilly; if Mr. Trump had said that Mr. Putin was not a killer, the Kremlin might have requested an apology from the White House, too.) In Russia during the Putin era, a remarkable phenomenon has emerged: Accusations have become decoupled from crimes. In an ordinary society, if a man is called a killer, he will either deny it or admit his guilt. Twenty-first-century Russia has chosen a third path: to take pride in one’s crimes while at the same time claiming to have no involvement in them. It’s a tactic of intelligence agents and spies, people who work in the shadows. In 2005, Vladimir Kvachkov, a retired colonel in the military intelligence who had become an outspoken nationalist, was arrested in the attempted murder of Anatoly B. Chubais, who at the time headed the Russian electricity monopoly and who in the 1990s had been a leading reformer in the government. Attackers tried to blow up Mr. Chubais’s car and sprayed it with automatic weapons. While many raised questions about the prosecution, evidence pointed at Mr. Kvachkov: A car used by the would-be assassins reportedly belonged to Mr. Kvachkov’s wife. A jury, though, acquitted him, citing insufficient evidence. (Mr. Kvachkov was later sent to prison on very separate charges: He was accused of being part of a right-wing coup plot.) It wasn’t Mr. Kvachkov’s acquittal that was remarkable about the case. It was his line of defense. On one hand, he denied a role in the crime; on the other, he argued that Mr. Chubais was an enemy of the Russian people and deserved to be killed. It’s unclear which argument proved more persuasive to the jury, but probably the second. Popular opinion in Russia holds Mr. Chubais responsible for the poverty that set in as a result of the neoliberal economic reforms, and at various times both the left and the nationalist opposition have condemned him. Mr. Kvachkov’s right-wing nationalist supporters deployed two mutually contradictory arguments: “He did not shoot; he’s not guilty” and “if he had shot, he would have been right to do so.” If the first argument saved the man from a prison term for attempted murder, the second made him one of the leaders of the radical nationalist movement.

It may have seemed just another popular turn toward right-wing demagogy in a time of receding faith in democracy. But that is not the case. This protest movement is, in fact, a signal to the world that in this corner of Europe, democracy and its ideals are alive and well — that the civic fabric destroyed during decades of Communist oppression has healed, and the people want to perfect their democracy, not to weaken it. The protests are aimed at an emergency ordinance from the government that would have reversed a national campaign against corruption, in which Romania has achieved significant but incomplete victories in recent years. Graft and nepotism still exist, and are blamed for high levels of poverty, polarization, social and economic injustice; those, in turn, have sent millions of young Romanians fleeing to other parts of the European Union, the United States or Canada. Still, enough young Romanians remained to take over the streets in freezing cold, and ultimately they forced the government to abandon the infamous ordinance. These are not the first spontaneous protests here in the name of popular power. Those began three years ago with the end of the discredited presidency of Traian Basescu. They continued in opposition to attempts by foreign corporations to extract gold from Roman-era historic sites in the mountains of Transylvania. And they resumed against the government of the prime minister at the time, Victor Ponta, after a terrible fire in a Bucharest nightclub. What Romania has been experiencing is an anti-elite political outpouring with a fury that resembles what we see in Europe and America, but whose origins and goals are 180 degrees opposite. These Romanian “indignados,” as the protesters are called, are not the blue-collar, rural, anti-globalization disgruntled who voted for Brexit or helped Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House. They are mainly young, urban, college-educated people with well-paid jobs at multinational corporations and banks, the main employers of local talent. So they are not protesting against globalization or the European Union. The solution they seek would be more globalization, a more solid Europe, more American and NATO involvement in our region. They are instinctively against any walls — physical or invisible — that may be erected in a vain effort to stop the free movement of people, ideas, capital or technology. Here, the tide of angry opinion rushes not toward fear of outsiders and tolerance for kleptocratic strongmen. It seeks instead to continue cleansing a political establishment still tied at many points to economic barons who divert public funding from desperately needed investments in health care, education and infrastructure. Such graft and cronyism are the very essence of their grievances. "

Such a step would allow military commanders to move more swiftly against terrorism suspects, streamlining a decision-making process that often dragged on under the Obama administration, frustrating Pentagon officials. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, called the proposal “a philosophy more than a change in policy.” He said that “the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off,” but added that Mr. Trump believed “these are the experts in the field.” Critics say that giving the military more authority could lead to more problematic outcomes like the Special Operations raid in January in Yemen, which left a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 dead, as well as about two dozen civilians. It could also leave the Pentagon to take the blame when things go wrong. But one Defense Department official pointed to comments by President Trump about the Yemen raid as a sign that military commanders would be held responsible for botched operations whether the president signed off on them or not.

It’s the summer of 2016, and President Obama is delivering a surprise address from the stately East Room, the same place where he announced the death of Osama bin Laden, among other events. “I’m speaking to you tonight to inform you that the United States is under attack,” the president says. “The Russian government at the highest levels is trying to influence our most precious asset, our democracy.” Russia had hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee, and was releasing the contents of its cyber-theft, in an attempt to influence the election, Obama explained. He was careful to present the behavior of the Trump campaign itself in the best light and to say that it deserved every benefit of the doubt. But the president wanted the American people to sit up and take notice of the attack. He wanted them to understand why the drip-drip-drip of WikiLeaks was happening. He wanted to call out the media for breathlessly reporting on WikiLeaks as if it were the product of great investigative reporting, rather than theft by a hostile foreign country. He wanted to put Russia on very public notice. None of this happened, of course. It’s a piece of alternate history, dreamed up by a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and described briefly in an excellent New Yorker article this week. The article tells the story of Russia’s campaign against the United States —under the all-star triple byline of Evan Osnos, David Remnick and Joshua Yaffa — and I recommend you set aside the time to read it. Lamenting the Obama administration’s low-key passive response to Russia’s attack obviously depends on 20/20 hindsight. Obama had reason to play it safe: As a Democratic president, he was rightly worried about politicizing national security and using his power to hurt the Republican nominee. But it seems likely that the administration would have nonetheless chosen a different route if it had realized that Donald Trump was a serious threat to win the election. There is also one lesson that remains very relevant today: The country is still not taking Russia’s actions nearly seriously enough. As Tom Friedman has written, Nov. 8, 2016, deserves to join Sept. 11, 2001, and Dec. 7, 1941, as infamous dates of attacks on America. We still need to learn the full story, through investigations by the F.B.I., Congress, the Trump administration and, especially now, an independent prosecutor. If you haven’t already read the latest news this morning, be sure to do so. "

Shares of Snap, the parent of Snapchat, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, and the company and its bankers will be hoping for a strong start. Will it dash to glory when the broader investment world gets its chance to buy up shares, like Alibaba? Or will it stumble out of the gate, like Facebook? Big investors have already weighed in. On Wednesday, Snap priced at $17 a share — a dollar more than the top of its expected range. The lofty valuation of nearly $24 billion suggests that investors see opportunity in Snapchat’s millennial user base. But that healthy pricing may also be the result of a successful strategy by its bankers, the Deal Professor writes. The bankers underestimated the price range, the argument goes, which built upward momentum. They also limited the number of shares available. There are still warnings signs flashing over the company: It lost more than $500 million last year. Its user growth appears to have slowed. And investors who buy the shares won’t get voting rights. On that last point, a Securities and Exchange Commission advisory committee will look at how much Snap will have to disclose to investors, according to Reuters. As Snap priced its offering, the stock market surged to another high, helped by expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. The optimism on Wall Street has also been helped by sunnier economic data. But there are some things to keep in mind about the rally and the so-called Trump bump, Neil Irwin notes. The economy is closing in on its full productive capacity. And if the government tries to increase deficits at a time of full employment, it could lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates, crowding out investment. "

Police reports asserted that officers had committed the killings in self-defense, but witnesses characterized them as “coldblooded murders of unarmed drug suspects in custody,” the rights group’s study said. “We think there’s a very strong case to be made in front of the I.C.C. that crimes against humanity have been committed,” Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said by telephone, referring to the International Criminal Court. She said the first step should be parallel investigations into Mr. Duterte’s antidrug campaign by the United Nations and by the Philippine Justice Department. In a statement on Thursday, Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for Mr. Duterte, said the report’s allegations were baseless. “A war on criminality is not a war on humanity,” he said. “On the contrary, it is a war precisely to protect humanity from a modern-day evil. To say otherwise is to undermine society’s legitimate desire to be free from fear and to pander to the interests of the criminals.” "

Mounted police escorted him a few blocks through Washington. Mr. Zinke, a fifth-generation Montanan who now oversees the country’s 500 million acres of public land, including 59 national parks, showed up to work to a grand reception. Officers from various agencies under the Interior Department lined the steps to the administration building. A drummer from his home state’s Northern Cheyenne tribe performed. The department is the liaison with federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native nations. Mr. Zinke, 55, served nearly two dozen years with the Navy SEALs before entering politics in 2008 as a Republican. After two terms in the Montana legislature, he was elected in 2014 as the state’s at-large representative in the House, before his nomination to the cabinet by President Trump. He was confirmed on Wednesday by the Senate with a vote of 68-31. His horseback journey on Thursday started around 9 a.m., when Mr. Zinke, wearing a cowboy hat and jeans, mounted Tonto, a bay roan. Tonto, a gelding, stands an inch more than 17 hands, or about 5-foot-9, and belongs to the United States Park police. He is kept in stables at the National Mall. Mr. Zinke rode several blocks to the entrance of the Interior Department on C Street NW, dismounted and then introduced himself to the staff inside, a department spokeswoman said. The department has 70,000 employees at 2,400 locations. “It was quite a neat reception,” said Greg Julian, a spokesman at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. "
599,Ben Carson Is Confirmed as HUD Secretary,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/ben-carson-housing-urban-development.html?searchResultPosition=42,2017/03/02,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Ben Carson, an acclaimed neurosurgeon-turned-politician, can now add a new title to his résumé: secretary of housing and urban development. The Senate voted 58-41 Thursday morning to confirm Mr. Carson after a rare show of bipartisanship. Unlike many other cabinet members chosen by President Trump, Mr. Carson, who has no experience running a large federal bureaucracy, did not face much pushback from Democrats during his confirmation process. The Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs unanimously voted his nomination out of committee in January, though several Democrats did question him about his belief that government assistance programs often lead to dependency. Mr. Carson will now head an agency with a $47 billion budget and a charge to assist millions of low-income renters, fight urban blight and help struggling homeowners stave off foreclosures. Mr. Carson, whose mother at times received food stamps to provide for her family, grew up surrounded by some of the housing assistance programs he will now oversee. Yet, rather than embrace the programs that once sustained his family and the families around him, he has adopted standard Republican beliefs that too much government help — both in desegregating neighborhoods and in lifting people from poverty — can discourage people from working hard. Mr. Carson was awarded a scholarship to Yale University, and at 33, he was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. He later became an author and a philanthropist supporting scholarships for young, often impoverished students. After his medical career, Mr. Carson turned to politics and competed with Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Carson’s views worry many of his critics, who believe the federal government should be doing more, not less, for the nation’s cities, where glittering downtowns and increasingly gentrified neighborhoods are often surrounded by areas of poverty and violence, with predominantly minorities. It is unclear how much Mr. Carson will seek to change housing policy. During his confirmation hearing, he would not commit definitively to avoid directing tax dollars to Trump businesses. He did agree to work with Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, to construct a system to identify properties tied both to the Trump family and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Carson also committed to telling senators about the department’s dealings with any businesses owned by Mr. Trump or his relatives. "
600,Why Republicans Can’t Do Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/why-republicans-cant-do-health-care.html?searchResultPosition=107,2017/03/08,OPINION,"After the 1976 election, the Democratic Party seemed to enjoy a commanding position in American politics, with Jimmy Carter ensconced in the White House, a Senate supermajority and an advantage of nearly 150 seats in the House of Representatives. Yet over the next four years the Democrats achieved little of consequence, Carter passed into history as a failure, and Ronald Reagan ushered in a lasting rightward realignment. I have compared Donald Trump to Carter before, but with the release of the House Republican “replacement” (I use that term loosely) for Obamacare, it’s worth returning to the analogy. It rests, in part, on the work of the political scientist Stephen Skowronek, who argues that certain presidencies are “disjunctive” — straddling a political order passing into history and another one struggling to be born. And “disjunctive” generally means ineffective, because the parties such presidents are leading are likewise trapped between past and future and unable to unify and act. Carter is Skowronek’s prime disjunctive example, and a variety of writers, including Corey Robin and Dylan Matthews on the left and Reihan Salam on the right, have recently argued that Trump fits the role as well. Just as Carter sensed that the New Deal-Great Society coalition was no longer viable and campaigned against certain liberal orthodoxies in ’76, so in 2016 Trump offered a vision of the G.O.P. as a nationalist “workers party” in which certain Reaganite pieties would no longer set the terms of conservative debate. But just as Carter’s mix of proto-New Democrat centrism and old-school liberalism never translated into a workable congressional agenda, Trump’s bridge to a new conservatism will crumble if his party can’t agree on policies that fit his vision. The health care debate makes this danger particularly clear. In the long Reagan era, the Republican Party was, in effect, the party of the health care status quo — bending to accept certain expansions of the welfare state (S-CHIP, a prescription drug benefit in Medicare) in order to forestall a larger government takeover of health insurance.

601,Why Women Are on Strike,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/why-women-are-on-strike.html?searchResultPosition=106,2017/03/08,OPINION,"On Wednesday, protesters around the world will celebrate International Women’s Day by showing their economies what a day without women’s work, paid or unpaid, is like. Inspired by two strikes last October — one successfully quashing a Polish parliament bill banning abortion, the other drawing tens of thousands to protest violence against women and girls in Argentina — organizers in more than 50 countries have coordinated a day of global action, including strikes, rallies and other gatherings. The United States strike will focus on “broadening the definition of violence against women,” says Sarah Leonard, spokesperson for the strike. In addition to protesting domestic, sexual and physical violence against women, Tithi Bhattacharya, a member of the strike’s organizing committee, says the strike on Wednesday focuses on rejecting the “systemic violence of an economic system that is rapidly leaving women behind.” “This is the day to emphasize the unity between work done in the so-called formal economy and the domestic sphere, the public sphere and the private sphere, and how most working women have to straddle both,” says Ms. Bhattacharya. “Labor is understood to be work only at the point of production, but as women we know that both society and policy makers invisibilize the work that women do.” The strike calls for women to withhold labor, paid or unpaid, from the United States economy to show how important their contributions are. The platform of the strike seeks to elevate the demands of the majority of women, not simply the demands of the loudest or most privileged women. “The language of feminism in recent years has been used to talk about ‘Lean In’ feminism,” says Ms. Bhattacharya. “We do not want a world where women become C.E.O.s, we want a world where there are no C.E.O.s, and wealth is redistributed equally.” This, she explains, is why they decided to convey their “new international feminist movement” around the socialist philosophy of “Feminism for the 99 Percent.” "

That, at least, is the view of Esmeralda Mosso. So on a soggy morning last week, she joined the scores of people who have been descending on the offices of the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Lower Manhattan to get the paperwork needed to ensure that whatever happens, she and her children will not be separated. Ms. Mosso is an undocumented immigrant who moved here 12 years ago from Guerrero State in Mexico. Two of her children, however, are American citizens. She was waiting in line to get official copies of their birth certificates, which she needed for passports and so they could apply for dual citizenship with Mexico. “I’m prepared to go, but with my children,” she said. “Without them, I’m not going. Even if they use a crane, I’m not going without them.” Her situation is hardly unique. Of the roughly 11 million people in the country illegally, some 33 percent — 3.3 million people — live with at least one child who is an American citizen, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group.

Gorsuch less than two weeks away, liberal activists are alarmed not only at the prospect of his lifetime appointment to the court, but at what they see as muted opposition from Senate Democrats. “We are not hearing from them the intensity that we are hearing from the grass roots,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, the organizer of a recent letter from 11 progressive groups urging Democrats to step it up. “The grass roots really understands this is a do-or-die nomination.” The tough criticism from the left underscores the Democrats’ difficult position. They need to keep their agitated and highly motivated base satisfied while not appearing to dismiss Judge Gorsuch, who has impressed members of both parties during private meetings, strictly out of political spite for the way Republicans stonewalled President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick B. Garland. In the past few days, Democrats have sought to show more organized resistance in advance of the coming confirmation showdown on March 20. They say the Gorsuch nomination, a topic that would capture attention in Washington just days before a hearing, is being overshadowed by the political upheaval accompanying President Trump’s occupancy of the White House. “I think there is a lot going on that makes it very hard to look at anything that they’re doing,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 3-ranking Senate Democrat, who said the Trump White House was following a “hide the ball” strategy. “And this is a serious nomination that should take serious consideration because this nominee would end up on this court for a very long time.” She joined two fellow Democratic senators and advocates for labor, disabled people and the education community on Tuesday to try to highlight what they viewed as anti-worker opinions by Mr. Gorsuch that they said should disqualify him from the court. On Monday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called on conservative groups that helped compile a list of Supreme Court candidates for consideration by Mr. Trump to release any communications they had with Judge Gorsuch or the Trump team about his consideration and selection.

We spent a week in line hearing their stories. Most didn’t give their last names, and some didn’t give their names at all, for fear of deportation. An Ecuadorean mother was in line to get a copy of her 3-year-old daughter’s birth certificate, and she said that many of her friends had done the same. To meet the demand, New York City’s Bureau of Vital Statistics had added extra hours during the week. So why the surge in requests? For dozens of undocumented immigrant families whom we spoke to last week, the answer was the same: President Trump. “The president says that if we’re not born here, then they’re going to deport us. That’s the problem,” the Ecuadorean mother said. "

He proved so once again last Saturday when he claimed he had been wiretapped by President Barack Obama, and called him a “sick guy” who had conducted a Watergate-style operation. There is no evidence that what Trump said is true, and a line of prominent officials, most notably the former director of national intelligence James Clapper, have stepped forward to cast doubt on the claim. Both Democrats and Republicans have spoken up to express their displeasure. This has been the main story line over the past few days: Feckless president makes baseless claim; establishment Washington revolts; media piles on. What’s missing is that Trump’s assertions, however overinflated, nonetheless echo certain aspects of The New York Times’s reporting from recent weeks. That, in turn, has allowed his administration to assert that the basis for his claims rests, in part, on reporting by The Times. On the surface, there are similarities. Both The Times and Trump have referred to wiretaps. Both have referenced White House knowledge of the investigations. And both have described efforts by officials from the Obama administration to involve itself in the continuing investigations of Trump and Russia. "
606,Ben Carson’s Gray Matter,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/ben-carsons-gray-matter.html?searchResultPosition=108,2017/03/08,OPINION,"I need Ben Carson in my head. In my hippocampus, to be exact. According to Carson, the human brain stores a perfect, indelible record of everything that it has seen, heard and done, and if he just drilled a hole through my skull and planted electrodes in the right region, bingo! I’d have access to the whole wondrous trove. Drill, baby, drill. I need the access. As things stand now, I lose 45 minutes every week to the retrieval of forgotten passwords, and I recently got three-quarters of the way through a mystery before realizing that I knew whodunit, how he dun it and why he dun it. I’d already read the book. Carson, our brand-new housing secretary, made an introductory, supposedly inspirational speech to federal employees this week, and while this kind of thing normally doesn’t wind up in the news, there’s nothing normal about Carson. During the speech, he went on the tangent about the brain that I just described, and while, granted, he’s a renowned neurosurgeon and I’m an expert on little more than semicolons, I do question his assertion that with proper cerebral stimulation, someone can “recite back to you verbatim a book they read 60 years ago.” Maybe “Green Eggs and Ham.” But “The Mill on the Floss”? Several of Carson’s fellow brain experts scoffed at this claim, though there was much louder scoffing at a subsequent stretch of his remarks that described America as a magnet for dreamers who arrived with “all of their earthly belongings in their two hands, not knowing what this country held for them.” "
607,Rising Tensions With North Korea,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/rising-tensions-with-north-korea.html?searchResultPosition=109,2017/03/08,OPINION,"The world has been wondering where President Trump will face his first national security crisis. This week it has looked as if North Korea might be the first hot spot. A series of ballistic missile tests and other provocative actions by North Korea, a nuclear-capable country, have heightened regional anxieties and stirred speculation about America’s reaction. The most recent tests involved the simultaneous launch on Monday of four missiles, which landed off Japan’s coast. The North Koreans have described the tests as drills for striking American bases in Japan, but the ultimate goal is assumed to be a strike on the United States. Some experts expect Pyongyang to have that capability within four years. This use of multiple missiles raised concerns that the North was trying out a new attack strategy that could overwhelm Japan’s limited defenses, analysts said. The tests almost certainly were a reaction to annual United States-South Korea military exercises, which began last week and which the North considers a threat. It is just three weeks since the North crossed another milestone by launching a solid-rocket missile, which is more efficient than the liquid-fueled missiles it had previously relied on; there were also tests in August and September. North Korea now possesses the fissile material for perhaps 21 nuclear weapons and is steadily improving its ability to deliver them with missiles. The country also has chemical weapons, which may have been used when the half brother of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, was assassinated in Malaysia last month. Malaysia has accused several North Korean citizens of using VX nerve agent to kill him, which seems plausible and underscores the lengths to which Mr. Kim is willing to go to eliminate perceived rivals. Adding to the tension is a decision to install an American-made antimissile system in South Korea. Although the system has been under discussion for some time, the two countries have expedited its deployment, which began on Monday and is expected to take two months. "

Equally uncertain are the fates of at least seven people in Iran, five of them American citizens. Four were imprisoned after the nuclear accord took effect and relaxed sanctions against Iran in exchange for its verifiable guarantees of peaceful nuclear work. Relatives of the imprisoned and their advocates have been speaking out, frustrated and wondering how Mr. Trump will deal with the problem. As a candidate, he promised to resolve the prisoner issue but since the inauguration has said little about it. “I’m trying to reach out to everyone I can to help,” said Babak Namazi, whose father, Baquer Namazi, 80, a former Unicef official, and brother, Siamak, 45, a businessman and advocate of stronger Iranian ties with the United States, are among the Americans languishing in prison. “Every day that goes by, my concern for my father and Siamak increases,” Mr. Namazi said this week in a telephone interview from Dubai, where he lives. He expressed particular anxiety about his father, who has a heart ailment, saying that an Iranian prison cell was “no place for an aging old man.” Last month, on the anniversary of the elder Mr. Namazi’s imprisonment, Unicef exhorted the Iranian authorities to release him. “After a lifetime of humanitarian service, he has earned a peaceful retirement,” a Unicef statement said.

609,State Secrets Privilege Invoked to Block Testimony in C.I.A. Torture Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/justice-department-cia-psychologists-interrogation-program.html?searchResultPosition=66,2017/03/08,U.S.,"The Trump administration has invoked executive powers in a bid to block the testimony of several top C.I.A. officials in a federal lawsuit against two psychologists who helped run the agency’s harsh interrogation program, along with portions of 172 internal agency documents. Hoping to prevent the officials, including Gina Haspel, the agency’s new deputy director, from being forced to testify, the administration is using the state secrets privilege, which means the executive branch is asking the judge in the case to keep information out of court by asserting that its disclosure would damage national security. The government rarely tries to use the extraordinary power, and this is among the first assertions of it by the Trump administration. At an earlier phase of the case in Federal District Court in Spokane, Wash., the Obama administration did not invoke the privilege — although in court filings last year, it did leave the door open to doing so at a later stage. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by two former detainees at C.I.A. secret prisons overseas and the representative of a third man who died in custody. If they prevail in the suit against the former military psychologists, James E. Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who helped devise and run the interrogation program, it would be the first time an American civilian court has held anyone accountable for a role in developing counterterrorism policies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The two former prisoners say they suffered lasting harm from their treatment at C.I.A. “black sites,” secret interrogation and detention centers that it operated overseas. Suleiman Abdullah Salim, a Tanzanian who may have been a victim of mistaken identity, was held in a darkened C.I.A. prison in Afghanistan and subjected to beatings, hanging in chains, sleep deprivation, and water dousing, which involves pouring ice water over detainees to create a sensation of drowning, according to a Senate report and interviews with him. Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, a Libyan also held in Afghanistan, who was likewise mentioned in the Senate report, described being slammed against a wall, shackled to the ceiling, locked in wooden boxes and also subjected to the ice water treatment. The third man, an Afghan named Gul Rahman, died in 2002 in a secret C.I.A. prison in Afghanistan after being left nearly naked and shackled to a wall in the cold. "

He was 86. His wife, Cristena Bach Yeutter, said the cause was metastatic colon cancer. A farmer from birth, Mr. Yeutter, who was secretary of agriculture under President George Bush and, earlier, the United States trade representative under Reagan, negotiated complex economic deals with a bluntness more common in pastures than in politics. Before he was confirmed as agriculture secretary in 1989, a profile in The New York Times called him “a burly, back-thumping, 58-year-old official with the voice of a hog caller.” Mr. Yeutter often employed that voice to argue for reduced restrictions on trade. Reagan appointed him trade representative in 1985, to succeed William E. Brock, who became secretary of labor. Over the next four years Mr. Yeutter — his last name rhymes with “fighter” — helped guide a 1988 trade bill through a Democratic Congress onto Reagan’s desk for approval. (The president had vetoed an earlier version.) He helped begin the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1986, which ultimately resulted in the creation of the World Trade Organization. And he persuaded the Japanese government to relax restrictions on American exports like citrus, semiconductors and beef in a series of aggressive negotiations. Perhaps his greatest legacy as trade representative was the negotiation of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, which was signed in 1988. The accord eliminated most tariffs and other barriers to trade and business between Canada and the United States. "

The missile is believed to have been moved in December from a test site in southern Russia to an undisclosed operational base. “We believe that the Russians have deployed a land-based cruise missile that violates the spirit and intent of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty,” Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee. “The system itself presents a risk to most of our facilities in Europe,” he added. “And we believe that the Russians have deliberately deployed it in order to pose a threat to NATO and to facilities within the NATO area of responsibility.” The New York Times reported last month that Russia had deployed a battalion of the prohibited missiles. A typical battalion has four launchers, each of which is equipped with six missiles. While senior Trump administration officials have not said where the new unit is based, there has been speculation in media reports that a missile system with similar characteristics is deployed in central Russia. The Times also noted that a second battalion was staged at a missile test range at Kapustin Yar, in southern Russia near Volgograd. Russia’s foreign ministry criticized the article as an example of “fake news.” The treaty Russia is accused of violating bans the testing, production and possession of American and Russian intermediate-range missiles based on land. Commonly called the I.N.F. treaty, it was signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, and is regarded as one of the cornerstones of arms control. "

If Mr. Kelly was speaking honestly — under oath, at the hearing on his nomination to be homeland security secretary — what has he been waiting for? Why is he not out there reminding all who will listen, but particularly his boss, President Trump, of the sensible things he told senators barely two months ago, explaining what a reasonable border and immigration policy might look like? Instead, Mr. Kelly is giving every indication that he and his vast department are fully on board with executing Mr. Trump’s fixation on protecting the nation from an imaginary siege at the southern border, while waging an all-out deportation campaign against millions of unauthorized immigrant workers and families who pose no threat to the nation. It’s a misguided, self-destructive direction to take the country. Mr. Kelly should be stepping on the brakes, not the gas. The latest evidence, first reported by Politico, is a draft Department of Homeland Security budget that would bulk up border spending at the expense of the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Coast Guard would be cut 14 percent, from $9.1 billion to $7.8 billion. Cuts to the T.S.A. and FEMA would be about 11 percent, to $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. The senselessness of such cuts is obvious if you understand some basic concepts. Like, the Coast Guard guards our coasts. It plays a major role in interdicting drugs at sea. The T.S.A. keeps bombs off our planes. FEMA helps people after disasters. If your goal at Homeland Security is security for the homeland, you recognize that the job is more complicated than contracting out one 2,000-mile wall. Mr. Kelly showed he understood this when he spoke to the Senate. On the wall: “As a military person that understands defense and defenses, a physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job.” "
613,Illegal Border Crossings Appear to Drop Under Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/trump-immigration-border.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/03/08,U.S.,"The number of undocumented immigrants caught along the southwest United States border fell significantly last month, which the Trump administration said Wednesday was a sign that its hard line on illegal immigration might already be discouraging border crossers. Roughly 840 people a day were caught or stopped from entering the United States from Mexico in February, according to Customs and Border Protection, a drop of about 36 percent from the previous February. Just as significant, the number was down about 39 percent from January, a reversal of a yearslong trend of apprehensions increasing in February as the temperature begins to rise and more people try to cross the border. The data is likely to please supporters of President Trump and could let him take credit for quickly making good on his promise to clamp down on illegal immigration. “The early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact,” John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement. The flow of people across the United States’ southern border has long depended on many factors, including the economy and violence in their home countries, and even the weather. But chief among them is America’s own immigration policy, and experts said they were not surprised to see a slowdown even before Mr. Trump’s executive orders on immigration have taken full effect or his signature wall has been built. “Deterrence through perception is central to these executive orders,” said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “Even floating the possibility of expanding detention at the border makes somebody less likely to come.” Since taking office, Mr. Trump has made clear that undocumented immigrants will have a tougher time getting into and staying in the United States. Beyond planning to build a border wall, a rallying cry during his campaign, he has expanded the authority of immigration enforcement officers and pledged to hire more of them; raised the threshold for entry to the United States based on claims of persecution back home; and called for more detentions and quicker deportations of those already in the country illegally. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors more limits on immigration, said all signs pointed to a decline in migration similar to that seen after the Reagan administration’s sweeping immigration reform law of 1986. It gave amnesty to many immigrants who had entered the United States before 1982, while promising tighter security at the Mexican border and tough penalties for companies hiring undocumented workers. “The talk of tougher enforcement can, in fact, lead to reductions in the flow, but only for a short period of time if the words aren’t backed up with action,” Mr. Krikorian said. During the Reagan years, he said, “the promises of tougher enforcement didn’t exactly pan out.” "

After first refusing to disavow Mr. Trump’s allegations, made in a series of Twitter posts, and instead calling for Congress to investigate them, the press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters, “There is no reason that we have to think the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever.” Mr. Spicer’s statement, which he read from a sheet of paper that was handed to him at the end of his briefing, reinforced the conundrum Mr. Trump’s tweets have created for the White House: Either the president’s assertions are baseless, or he may have implicated himself in a government investigation of contacts between his presidential campaign and Russia. Until Wednesday, Mr. Spicer had steadfastly declined to discuss Mr. Trump’s assertion that former President Barack Obama ordered wiretap surveillance of Trump Tower — an act that Mr. Trump condemned as a scandal comparable in scale to McCarthyism or Watergate. Early into Wednesday’s briefing, Mr. Spicer stuck to the policy he has followed since the storm broke over Mr. Trump’s posts. Asked whether the president was the target of a counterintelligence inquiry, he replied: “I think that’s what we need to find out. There’s obviously a lot of concern.” "
615,C.I.A. Scrambles to Contain Damage From WikiLeaks Documents,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/wikileaks-cia.html?searchResultPosition=60,2017/03/08,U.S.,"WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. scrambled on Wednesday to assess and contain the damage from the release by WikiLeaks of thousands of documents that cataloged the agency’s cyberspying capabilities, temporarily halting work on some projects while the F.B.I. turned to finding who was responsible for the leak. Investigators say that the leak was the work not of a hostile foreign power like Russia but of a disaffected insider, as WikiLeaks suggested when it released the documents Tuesday. The F.B.I. was preparing to interview anyone who had access to the information, a group likely to include at least a few hundred people, and possibly more than a thousand. An intelligence official said the information, much of which appeared to be technical documents, may have come from a server outside the C.I.A. managed by a contractor. But neither he nor a former senior intelligence official ruled out the possibility that the leaker was a C.I.A. employee. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation into classified information. The C.I.A. has refused to explicitly confirm the authenticity of the documents, but it all but said they were genuine Wednesday when it took the unusual step of putting out a statement to defend its work and chastise WikiLeaks. The disclosures “equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm,” said Ryan Trapani, a spokesman for the C.I.A. He added that the C.I.A. is legally prohibited from spying on individuals in the United States and “does not do so.” The leak was perhaps most awkward for the White House, which found itself criticizing WikiLeaks less than six months after the group published embarrassing emails from John D. Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton, prompting President Trump to declare at the time, “I love WikiLeaks.” "
616,A Democrat in Conservative Georgia Rides Opposition to Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/jon-ossoff-georgia-special-election.html?searchResultPosition=101,2017/03/08,U.S.,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — Jon Ossoff is a 30-year-old Democrat who has never served in an elected position, running for Congress in a decidedly conservative district. But thanks to his online pitch to voters — “Make Trump Furious” — he has improbably found himself awash in donations: roughly $3 million, his campaign says, while 11 Republican candidates are scrapping for attention. “Certainly, I’m the underdog. But in a special election, energy is everything,” said Mr. Ossoff, who, if he makes the runoff after the vote next month, will most likely face off against the leading Republican in the race to fill the congressional seat vacated by Tom Price, President Trump’s new secretary of health and human services. If Democrats have any hopes of recapturing the 24 seats needed to take back the House, they will depend on a lot of anti-Trump energy and underdogs like Mr. Ossoff. The race in Georgia, in a district Republicans have held for a generation, will be an early test of Democrats’ ability to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s polarizing presence — he barely won the district last year — and the ability of both parties to choose candidates within their divided ideological factions who can win a general election. Fueled by the conviction that affluent, educated suburban areas are at least trending toward competitive in the strange and shifting battlefields of Mr. Trump’s America, Democrats believe this is the kind of district where they have a shot. Republicans are confident that Democrats will be inclined to nominate candidates from the most progressive wing of the party, who may energize their base but prove a poor fit for general elections in even the most anti-Trump Republican districts. At the same time, Republicans are going to have to decide whether candidates who distance themselves from Mr. Trump or those who run as his mini-me are their strongest candidates. The outcome of the election here may provide clues to how Mr. Trump’s presidency might, or might not, be deployed in local races. That is particularly true in wealthy suburban districts where Mr. Trump did not fare particularly well in November — and where Republicans may be especially vulnerable in 2018. "
617,Don’t Roll Back the Vehicle Fuel Standards,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/dont-roll-back-the-vehicle-fuel-standards.html?searchResultPosition=110,2017/03/08,OPINION,"One of the signal achievements of the Obama administration was reaching an agreement with the auto industry to dramatically increase fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, doubling them to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The industry now wants to renege. At its behest, the Trump administration is expected to initiate a rollback. Weakening these standards would be a mistake for consumers, the environment and the auto industry itself. They are the most important action the United States has taken to address climate change and reduce the nation’s dependence on oil. From 2022-25 alone, they are projected to reduce American oil consumption by 1.2 billion barrels, cut half a billion metric tons of carbon pollution and save consumers millions of dollars in fuel costs, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The net benefits to society are estimated at $100 billion. And these gains are on top of those achieved through 2016 and expected through 2021. The standards also provide badly needed uniformity and predictability for the auto industry. When we adopted our strategy, car companies were facing the prospect of three different and conflicting sets of standards. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had traditionally set fuel economy standards. But in 2007, the Supreme Court held that the E.P.A. could regulate greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles under the federal Clean Air Act, adding another regulator to the mix. "
618,Ethics Questions Dogged Agriculture Nominee as Georgia Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/politics/sonny-perdue-georgia.html?searchResultPosition=100,2017/03/08,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — In Sonny Perdue’s telling, Georgians were growing weary of the corruption and scandals in their state when he took over as governor in 2003 — a time when he gave his own version of a “drain the swamp” pledge. “My first goal as governor is to restore public trust in state government by changing the culture of state government,” Mr. Perdue told a leadership conference at Kennesaw State University in April 2003. “Our form of government depends on a mutual bond of trust between the people and their government. But people have become cynical about their government.” But Mr. Perdue, a Republican who is awaiting confirmation to serve as President Trump’s agriculture secretary, became a target of frequent criticism that he was failing to honor his own ethics pledge during his eight years as governor. The criticism centers on the fact that, as Mr. Trump has, he continued to own or help run his family business ventures — four farming-related companies — while serving as governor. Mr. Perdue is one of the last cabinet members awaiting Senate confirmation. No date has been set for his confirmation hearing; a holdup in the release of paperwork accompanying his nomination by the federal Office of Government Ethics has been blamed for the delay. The office must examine Mr. Perdue’s proposal to avoid conflicts of interest while running the U.S.D.A., as the department is known, which may include selling off some of his farming assets. Before his tenure as governor ended in 2011, 13 complaints had been filed against Mr. Perdue with the State Ethics Commission, which on two occasions ruled that the governor had violated state ethics laws. The commission took the unusual step of fining Mr. Perdue while he was governor. There were numerous other questions, including some about the role of Mr. Perdue’s personal lawyer — also a state legislator — in pushing a bill through the legislature that included a special provision that gave Mr. Perdue $100,000 in state tax relief.

619,Russia’s RT Network: Is It More BBC or K.G.B.?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/europe/russias-rt-network-is-it-more-bbc-or-kgb.html?searchResultPosition=68,2017/03/08,EUROPE,"LONDON — The London newsroom and studios of RT, the television channel and website formerly known as Russia Today, are ultramodern and spacious, with spectacular views from the 16th floor overlooking the Thames and the London Eye. And, its London bureau chief, Nikolay A. Bogachikhin, jokes, “We overlook MI5 and we’re near MI6,” Britain’s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Bogachikhin was poking fun at the charge from Western governments, American and European, that RT is an agent of Kremlin policy and a tool directly used by President Vladimir V. Putin to undermine Western democracies — meddling in the recent American presidential election and, European security officials say, trying to do the same in the Netherlands, France and Germany, all of which vote later this year. But the West is not laughing. Even as Russia insists that RT is just another global network like the BBC or France 24, albeit one offering “alternative views” to the Western-dominated news media, many Western countries regard RT as the slickly produced heart of a broad, often covert disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about democratic institutions and destabilize the West. Western attention focused on RT when the Obama administration and United States intelligence agencies judged with “high confidence” in January that Mr. Putin had ordered a campaign to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,” discredit Hillary Clinton through the hacking of Democratic Party internal emails and provide support for Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate said he wanted to improve relations with Russia. The agencies issued a report saying the attack was carried out through the targeted use of real information, some open and some hacked, and the creation of false reports, or “fake news,” broadcast on state-funded news media like RT and its sibling, the internet news agency Sputnik. These reports were then amplified on social media, sometimes by computer “bots” that send out thousands of Facebook and Twitter messages. To many Americans, the impression that RT is an instrument of Russian meddling was reinforced when its programming suddenly interrupted C-Span’s online coverage of the House of Representatives in January. (C-Span later called it a technical error, not a hacking.) "

622,Behold the G.O.P. Civil War on Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/behold-the-gop-civil-war-on-health-care.html?searchResultPosition=93,2017/03/08,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. As people began to digest the Republican health care plan on Tuesday, a few things became clear: 1. “This isn’t an Obamacare repeal, it’s a Medicaid repeal,” as the political writer Jonathan Allen put it. Many Republicans have long viewed Medicaid — a health insurance program for the poor, the disabled and some elderly — with skepticism. This plan would make very large cuts to the program. The details are somewhat technical, and Edwin Park of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explains them. But the real-world effects will be concrete: Many people will lose coverage, and some kinds of care, if the bill becomes law. 2. Conservative policy experts hate the bill, and the criticisms come from both the far right and the center right. Peter Suderman of Reason had an excellent frame for understanding the right’s civil war over health care: Conservatives don’t even agree on what their goals are. Making health care less expensive? Reducing the government’s role? Ensuring that the poor receive fewer subsidies? Lacking this agreement, many Republicans have pretended that a magical health plan exists, one that would cover everyone, provide good insurance and cost less money. Wouldn’t that be nice! The most entertaining episode in the civil war happened after Charles C. W. Cooke tweeted, “I’ve yet to read a single positive analysis of the House’s Obamacare bill.” A conservative replied: “try going 2 a conservative source? Open up your reading habits 2 include those w/ whom u would naturally dismiss.” To which Cooke replied, accurately, “I’m the editor of National Review Online.” 3. To overcome the tensions, Republican leaders want to rush the bill through, before the Congressional Budget Office can release its independent estimates of the bill’s effects. “What a farce,” wrote Philip Klein, managing editor of the conservative Washington Examiner. For more on health care, see Paul Krugman’s blog post, Ross Douthat’s column, the Editorial Board’s take and an Op-Ed on the return of rationing. "
623,"Spanish Women, Advancing in Politics, Still Battle Sexism",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/europe/spain-women-sexism.html?searchResultPosition=92,2017/03/08,EUROPE,"MADRID — Teresa Rodríguez, the leader of the far-left Podemos Party in the southern region of Andalusia, was visiting an exhibition in the Chamber of Commerce of Seville when she ran into a member of the group she had never met before. In no time, the man, Manuel Muñoz Medina, pushed up against her and simulated kissing her on the mouth — before handing her his business card. Ms. Rodríguez, 35, said she was too upset and shocked to react at the time, just before Christmas. But she then took to social media and started legal action this year. Mr. Muñoz Medina, 72, later apologized for his behavior, saying he had been drunk, and resigned from the chamber’s board. Spanish women have made tremendous advances in recent years as the revolt against mainstream parties helped break down some old-boy networks. But that upheaval, the women say, has also laid bare the deeply entrenched sexism and machismo in Spain’s political establishment, which has at the very least been slow to adapt to changing times, intensifying a clash of both generations and genders. It has been less than a year since voters elected a Parliament with a record number of women for Spain: 139 out of 350 lawmakers. Within Podemos, which has become Spain’s third-largest party, women make up almost half of lawmakers. In Spain’s regions, far-left women now serve as mayors in both Madrid and Barcelona, Spain’s two largest cities. But women say they still face big obstacles as they try to make their way in Spanish politics, still predominantly a man’s world. Sexual harassment aside — and it is common — among the problems most commonly cited by women is that men expect their female colleagues to share their views, not have opinions of their own. "
624,Hawaii Sues to Block Trump Travel Ban; First Challenge to Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/trump-travel-ban-hawaii.html?searchResultPosition=91,2017/03/08,U.S.,"President Trump’s immigration policies faced a pair of new challenges in court on Wednesday, as the attorney general of Hawaii alleged that Mr. Trump had violated the Constitution with his redrawn executive order banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries. And in California, the city attorney of San Francisco asked a federal judge to issue an injunction blocking another executive order, which threatens to withdraw funding for so-called sanctuary cities that do not extensively cooperate with federal immigration enforcement officials. Both actions show how emboldened Mr. Trump’s opponents are to attack his policies through litigation, after a series of lawsuits brought by state attorneys general and nonprofit groups derailed his first travel ban last month. In the Hawaii case, the state attorney general, Doug Chin, a Democrat, claimed in a legal filing that Mr. Trump’s new order would damage the state’s educational institutions and private businesses, including its lucrative tourism industry, and discriminate against families with relatives overseas. Mr. Chin said in an interview that despite changes Mr. Trump made to his first executive order, the new one amounted to the same policy “dressed up differently.” He said Mr. Trump’s travel ban had stirred strong opposition in Hawaii, where people still recall federal policies that targeted Asian-Americans for discrimination, from the Chinese Exclusion Act to the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II. “This order brings back memories for a lot of people here,” Mr. Chin said. “Any time you have an executive order or some government decision that’s calling out people by their nation of origin or by religion, we’ve got to be a check against that.” "

Trump, women rallied against his administration on Wednesday, this time by skipping work, wearing red and refusing to spend money. But the protests were far smaller than the masses who turned the women’s marches on Jan. 21 into a phenomenon, keeping the question open of whether protesters’ fervor can be channeled into a sustained movement with demonstrable political results. In New York City, hundreds of people jammed into a Midtown block, and the Women’s March on Washington said 10 of its organizers were arrested there for blocking traffic. The municipal court in Providence, R.I., shut down because seven of the clerks and a deputy court administrator stayed home from work. Schools in Alexandria, Va.; Chapel Hill-Carrboro, N.C.; and Prince George’s County, Md., closed for the day because so many teachers stayed home. The strike was held on International Women’s Day, and President Trump weighed in early with a restrained statement, writing a message of respect on Twitter for women and the role they play in the economy. Later, in Washington, women rallied near the White House to protest the “global gag rule” banning federal funding for any organization overseas that discusses abortion as a family planning option. But Rebecca Wood, 37, who brought her 4-year-old daughter, said her complaints were broader. “I used to list so many things on a sign,” she said. “Now I have so many concerns, I just have a sign that says ‘RESIST.’” "

The Egyptian authorities said they would allow female prisoners an extra family visit this month. The events were all centered on International Women’s Day on Wednesday, and people and governments across the globe observed it in an outpouring of support for women’s equality and empowerment. But amid the celebrations, protests were brewing. Demonstrations were scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in dozens of cities across France. In Paris, protesters planned to march from the Place de la République to the Opéra Garnier. Unions, student organizations and feminist associations were calling for women to start striking at 3:40 p.m. — symbolically the time of day when Frenchwomen stop being paid, they argue, because of an average 26 percent pay gap with men. With the coming presidential election, the protest organizers unveiled a list of 20 demands, including salary increases, less temporary work and better enforcement of penalties for companies that discriminate against women, including when they are pregnant.

627,American Medical Association Opposes Republican Health Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/health/american-medical-association-opposes-republican-health-plan.html?searchResultPosition=88,2017/03/08,HEALTH,"The American Medical Association, a powerful lobbying group representing the nation’s doctors, announced on Wednesday that it opposed the House Republicans’ proposed legislation to replace the federal health care law, saying it was concerned the bill “would result in millions of Americans losing coverage and benefits.” The group, which provided crucial support for the Obama administration’s contentious health care legislation before it was enacted in 2010, also sent a letter to the two House committees responsible for drafting the Republicans’ bill, called the American Health Care Act. The group’s concerns echoed some others raised this week among industry organizations like hospital groups worried about the possible losses of coverage that could result from the proposed legislation that was released on Monday. All of the major hospital groups, including the American Hospital Association, also came out against the bill. “We are very concerned that the draft legislative proposal being considered by the House committees could lead to tremendous instability for those seeking affordable coverage,” the hospitals said in a letter to Congress. The hospitals also raised concerns about Republicans’ plans to significantly alter Medicaid, which they said could result in a loss of coverage and cuts to health care services. The doctors’ main concern focused on the Republicans’ replacement of the subsidies now available to millions of low-income Americans with a flat tax credit for low- and middle-income people that is adjusted by a person’s age. The A.M.A. emphasized the need for the credits to “be sufficient to enable one to afford quality coverage,” but it also emphasized that the credits should be closely tied to an individual’s income as a way of covering more people and being a better use of taxpayer money. The doctors also voiced their opposition to the proposed rollback of Medicaid. Even as the Republicans seemingly rush to pass a bill that would undo much of the current law, the doctors and hospitals urged them to be careful about whatever changes they made. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet weighed in with estimates of how many people the new legislation will cover and what the cost of the plan might be. “As you consider this legislation over the coming days and weeks, we hope that you will keep upmost in your mind the potentially life altering impact your decisions will have on millions of Americans who may see their public, individual or even employer-provided health care coverage changed or eliminated,” wrote Dr. James L. Madara, the association’s chief executive. The A.M.A. had earlier endorsed Dr. Tom Price as President Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, provoking a split with rank-and-file doctors and nurses who opposed his nomination.

On Tuesday, WikiLeaks released a huge cache of documents that detail how the C.I.A. has collected various types of cyberweapons, including so-called zero-day vulnerabilities that would expose iPhones, Android phones, Windows and Linux computers, internet-connected televisions and maybe even high-tech cars to hackers. The argument for the C.I.A. gathering these hacking tools would be that they are needed to counter the increasing technological sophistication of its targets. What’s more, by targeting the underlying software of a smartphone, the agency would be able to capture communications before they were encrypted by popular communications programs like Signal. It’s not yet clear how the C.I.A. obtained the malware, and at least some of it may be out of date. (Hint: Upgrade your phone’s software.) Some may have been discovered by government researchers. And many others may have been acquired in the growing online market for this troublesome code. Over the last year, The New York Times’s Nicole Perlroth has written extensively about cyberarms dealers. Whether it is through online brokerages, physical conferences or contracts obtained by companies based in Israel, Italy and other places, governments around the world have been spending big to obtain these hacking tools. As Ms. Perlroth reported late last year: “Zerodium, a zero-day-exploit broker that sells to governments, said it paid hackers $1 million for an Apple exploit in October. In mid-November, the brokerage firm said it would pay hackers $50,000 for an attack that could take over a victim’s machine through a Safari or Internet Explorer browser, and $80,000 for a similar attack through Google’s Chrome browser.” More tech news: Snap makes a bet on the supremacy of the camera: Our rising dependence on cameras is changing our language, and the company behind Snapchat is counting on the eventual dominance of visual culture.

Warner has taken to thinking like a Russian. The Virginia Democrat is losing himself in a book about the Romanovs, eager to absorb the country’s theories of war, teasing staff members for insufficient knowledge of Tolstoy and Nabokov. He has been sending messages over the encrypted app Signal, just to be safe. Then there was the ruckus outside Mr. Warner’s window late one recent afternoon, a curious thud against the building beside a giant American flag. “That may just be the F.S.B.,” Mr. Warner said flatly, referring to Russia’s primary intelligence and security agency. He appeared to be kidding. Probably. Such is the head space of Capitol Hill’s top Democrat investigating ties between President Trump’s orbit and Russian intelligence — a former rising star in the party, frozen in the ascent for years now. As Republicans resist calls for a select committee or special prosecutor to oversee the matter, the Democrats’ best hope for acquiring answers most likely remains an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Mr. Warner is vice chairman. The result, at the height of anti-Trump fervor and Wall Street-bashing progressivism in the Democratic Party’s base, is a spotlight trained brightly on a southern-state centrist with a nine-figure net worth, a decade-old itch to be president and, until recently, according to friends and former aides, a healthy disdain for the institution he serves.

630,‘Superstar Firms’ May Have Shrunk Workers’ Share of Income,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/economy/labor-share-economic-output.html?searchResultPosition=85,2017/03/08,ECONOMY,"For much of the last century it seemed that the slice of the total economic pie going to workers was — like the speed of light — constant. No matter what the economy’s makeup, labor could collectively depend on taking home roughly two-thirds of the country’s total output as compensation for its efforts. Workers’ unchanging share, the economist John Maynard Keynes declared in 1939, was “one of the most surprising, yet best-established, facts in the whole range of economic statistics.” But in recent decades, that steady share — which includes everything from the chief executive’s bonuses and stock options to the parking-lot attendant’s minimum wage and tips — started to flutter. In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor’s portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession. The decline has coincided with a slowdown in overall growth as well as a stark leap in inequality. “Labor is getting a shrinking slice of a pie that’s not growing very much,” David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., said. It is a development that is upending political establishments and economic policies in the United States and abroad. Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters. Alternate culprits include tax policies that treat investment income more favorably than wages; flagging skills and education that have rendered workers less productive or unsuited to an information- and service-based economy; or a weakening of labor unions that has chipped away at workers’ bargaining power and protections.

631,SoftBank Is Said to Be Selling a 25% Stake in ARM Holdings,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/softbank-arm-holdings.html?searchResultPosition=84,2017/03/08,DEALBOOK,"When SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant, bought the British semiconductor designer ARM Holdings last year for $32 billion, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder, said the deal would bring benefits like jobs and investment to Britain. Now, just six months later, SoftBank is in final-stage talks to sell a 25 percent stake in ARM, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The roughly $8 billion sale will be to a new $100 billion investment fund that Mr. Son has created with Saudi Arabia and other investors, raising questions about how politicians in Britain, the United States and elsewhere will respond to such investments in their national technology industries. Chips made by ARM power iPhones and millions of other mobile devices worldwide. Mr. Son met with President Trump before his inauguration in January about using the $100 billion fund to buy stakes in American tech companies, with the aim of creating thousands of new jobs. While British lawmakers remain sanguine about the proposed sale of ARM to Mr. Son’s investment vehicle, known as Vision Fund, it remains unclear whether American politicians will be as willing for the fund to scoop up stakes in American tech companies. Representatives for ARM and SoftBank declined to comment. The proposed sale of the ARM stake, which has yet to be completed, was reported earlier by The Financial Times. The move by SoftBank, which also owns Sprint in the United States, comes as it tries to secure further investment to reach the financial goal for Vision Fund. The investment vehicle will be based in London and run by Rajeev Misra, SoftBank’s head of strategic finance. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has pledged to invest $45 billion in the fund, while SoftBank has contributed $25 billion. Apple, the iPhone maker, and Lawrence Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle, also have made minority investments in Vision Fund. Mubadala Development, a state-owned investment company in Abu Dhabi, and the Qatari government are in talks to join the fund. The goal of Vision Fund, according to Mr. Son, is to invest in high-growth tech start-ups, though the fund also will spend on larger tech investments in the public and private markets. While the Vision Fund tries to reach its financial goals, SoftBank has already moved to spend its own cash on potentially lucrative deals. That includes recently buying Fortress Investment Group, the American private equity giant, for $3.3 billion, and having invested $1 billion late last year in OneWeb, a company providing internet connectivity through satellites.

Trump secured the Republican nomination for president, his recently installed campaign manager, Stephen K. Bannon, met with top officials from the Republican National Committee to discuss management of the general election. Mr. Trump’s staff had remained unusually small throughout the grueling primaries — a compactness, his advisers believed, that had given them a nimble edge. Now most Republican officials expected the Trump team to expand as it began to oversee the thousands of Republican staff members, state officials and consultants who would be ground troops in the coming political war. But when Mr. Bannon met with R.N.C. officials, he informed them that a major expansion was not going to happen. The Trump campaign, he said, intended to remain sparse and decentralized. Borrowing a Silicon Valley mantra from Facebook, he told his shocked listeners that “your job is to move fast and break things,” according to a person who was present. “Figure out what needs doing, and then just do it. Don’t wait for permission.” His audience was surprised. Conventional political wisdom advocated a robust and elaborate campaign hierarchy. But Mr. Bannon demanded the opposite. Winning, he said, required tactics and ideas — like distributed decision making; quick experimentation and execution rather than thoughtful deliberation; learning from left-leaning advocacy groups and video game companies — that were drawn from the management playbooks of Silicon Valley start-ups.

633,Chinese Mistake Satire on Trump for Real News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/asia/china-trump-media-satire.html?searchResultPosition=95,2017/03/08,ASIA PACIFIC,"BEIJING — The story dripped with intrigue. A frantic President Trump, holding court in a bathrobe, ordered his aides to wrap the White House telephones in tinfoil, several Chinese publications reported this week, citing The New Yorker. There was only one problem: The New Yorker article, by the comedian Andy Borowitz, was satire. That did not stop the story, purporting to describe the depths of Mr. Trump’s worry that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, was eavesdropping on him, from ricocheting across the Chinese internet. “Trump turns White House upside down looking for signs of Obama: ‘I know he’s still here!’ ” read headlines in respected publications like Caijing, a business magazine, and Sina, a news portal. Internet readers were puzzled. The state-run news media — and China’s army of censors — are not known for making jokes. Was this for real? “This is illness,” one user wrote about Mr. Trump on Weibo, a microblogging site. Others were more discerning. “This was made up and meant to be funny,” another user said. “Surprising it was treated as news. Editor, could you be more professional?” It was not the first time that American humorists have unintentionally duped the Chinese news media. In 2012, People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party, reported that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, had been named “Sexiest Man Alive for 2012.” The newspaper based its report on a satirical article in The Onion. And in 2013, Xinhua, the official news agency, mistook as fact a satirical report in The New Yorker about the purchase of The Washington Post by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief executive. (The New Yorker article said that Mr. Bezos had bought the newspaper by clicking on it by mistake. That piece was also written by Mr. Borowitz as part of his regular column, “The Borowitz Report.”) The satirical article about Mr. Trump was published on Saturday, and first picked up in China online and in print on Tuesday by Reference News, a newspaper that translates foreign news and is published by Xinhua. The newspaper removed the story from its website on Wednesday after the Chinese news media reported that it was false. Fake news articles, conspiracy theories and rumors are rampant on the Chinese internet, and media analysts say it is not surprising that Chinese outlets fall victim to jokes. “Fake news is undoubtedly a serious problem in China, as it is elsewhere in the world,” David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in an email.

In a letter to lawmakers, major hospital groups wrote, “As organizations that take care of every individual who walks through our doors, both due to our mission and our obligations under federal law, we are committed to ensuring health care coverage is available and affordable for all.” The groups, including the American Hospital Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Catholic Health Association of the United States and the Children’s Hospital Association, said they could not support the bill “as currently written.” The hospitals and the American Nurses Association joined the American Medical Association and AARP, which rejected the bill on Tuesday. House Republicans have been left scrambling to marshal support from businesses and other interests that stand to benefit from lower taxes if the bill passes. Insurers are on the fence, and other powerful forces like pharmaceutical companies remain largely on the sidelines. Squeezed between wary health care providers and angry conservatives who believe that the bill leaves too much of the Affordable Care Act in place, the Republican leadership and President Trump appear to be facing an uphill climb.

In this lesson, we ask students to imagine what feminism should look like in the United States today. Then, we encourage them to consider the role that intersectionality should play in the women’s movement, to analyze how women are represented in the media today, and to learn more about the issues central to feminism’s agenda. _________ Warm-Up 1: Defining Feminism Direct students to work in pairs and create a word web or semantic map to define the word “feminism.” You can use this edition of the Learning Network Throwback Thursday feature for ideas and resources about definitions through the ages. Next, invite students to share key words, examples or ideas related to “feminism” from their word webs. Create a collaborative whole-class semantic map on the board. "

As a businessman, Mr. Trump has amassed a vast portfolio of trademarks around the world, as he seeks to protect his brands and his products. Those trademarks, at times, clash with the vision of a populist president who has espoused an “America First” strategy. China has been among the biggest targets for his business prospects. Including the latest batch, his companies have filed for at least 130 trademarks in China since 2005 for restaurants, bars, hotels, brokerage services, advertising and management consulting. But as president, Mr. Trump has criticized China for its trade practices. On the campaign trail, he threatened to impose punitive tariffs against the country. The timing of the new trademarks could create a perception problem for Mr. Trump, coming so soon after he took office. In February, the Chinese government announced that it was granting Mr. Trump the right to protect his name brand for construction projects, after a decade-long legal battle. That trademark approval was announced just days after Mr. Trump pulled back from his challenge to China’s policy on Taiwan in a call with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. "

The pale sands of this once forgettable port alongside the emptiness of the Arabian desert have proved fertile ground for all manner of skyscrapers. They rise as if conjured by an obsession with Las Vegas and a jones for altitude. The Burj Khalifa, the tallest structure on the planet, reaches twice the height of the Empire State Building. Now, Dubai is about to gain another landmark. The Dubai Frame, set to open this year, is literally and figuratively a frame imposed on the overwhelming view — two parallel towers linked by an observation deck. It is a marker of how far the city has traveled, drawing the eye from the drab buildings of the old settlement along Dubai Creek to the riotous profusion of neon-draped skyscrapers stretching south to the Persian Gulf. It is a totem of Dubai’s ambitions. It may also be counterfeit. The Mexican-born architect whose initial design inspired the structure, Fernando Donis, has accused the Dubai municipality of breaching his copyright in a lawsuit filed in December in United States federal court. Nine years ago, Mr. Donis won an international competition to design the building, besting more than 900 other entrants. Yet he was not included in the project’s execution and was not compensated for his intellectual property, his lawsuit claims. “It’s shocking,” Mr. Donis said. “The Frame is mine, and they don’t want to grant that it is mine. The infringement doesn’t just victimize me. They have taken something from all architects — the protection of our ideas.” Raised as a monument to Dubai’s aspirations as a center of international commerce, the Frame is now a physical manifestation of the crude system that erected it.

639,A Girl Stands Firm on Wall Street,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/little-girl-statue-wall-street-bull.html?searchResultPosition=76,2017/03/08,OPINION,"There’s currently a bronze statue of a little girl standing in front of the charging bull on Wall Street. It really does have a great look — all the laws of mass and motion aside, you feel pretty confident the bull is going to wind up backing down. And it reminds you that while marching is important, sometimes you can make a difference by standing still. The Wall Street girl celebrates all the people who resisted by staying in place. A little bit to the north one of my all-time favorite heroines, Elizabeth Jennings Graham, won a place in history by refusing to move an inch. An African-American schoolteacher, Graham was on her way to play the organ at a church service in 1854, when her streetcar’s conductor demanded she get off and wait for a car for colored people. Unlike the little bronze girl on Wall Street, she did not stand up and put her hands on her hips, since that would have facilitated her removal. She stayed sitting, hugging the window, until she was dragged away kicking. She found a lawyer, filed a lawsuit, won the suit, and gave New York City integrated mass transportation a century before Rosa Parks held her ground. Marches are a great demonstration of solidarity: How many people will be telling their grandchildren they were at the women’s march after the Trump inauguration? But the little girl is a nice reminder that even if a crowd isn’t available, you have to do what you can. Even if it means standing down a bull, or refusing to get off a trolley. "

None of the three who broached the topic with Mr. Iger were actual shareholders, but were instead acting as proxies for groups of shareholders. “By staying on the economic council it looks like you are tacitly endorsing Trump’s policies,” added Mr. Azemun, who identified himself as Iranian-American. Mr. Azemun complained about “anti-women and anti-immigrant” policies and decisions by Mr. Trump. Mr. Iger objected strongly, saying that he had no plans to step down and that his involvement was “not an endorsement at all of the policies of the new administration.” The shareholder meeting was in Denver and was streamed live on the internet. On the topic of the Trump administration’s immigration plans, Mr. Iger said that he believed in “an open and a fair and a just immigration policy.” He added, “A policy that is open to the world is vital to the future success of the Walt Disney Company and to this country.” "

Buckley Jr. said he would rather be governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than by the faculty of Harvard. But one evening late last month, the Harvard Club in Midtown was as good a place as any to go looking for the intellectual future of conservatism. The occasion was the unveiling of American Affairs, a tweedy quarterly journal dedicated to giving intellectual heft and coherence to the amorphous ideology known, for lack of a better term, as Trumpism. Not that the words “Donald Trump” came up during the presentation, though Julius Krein, the journal’s 31-year-old founder and editor, did pay the man sideways tribute with a quotation from the French critic Roland Barthes’s classic 1957 essay “The World of Wrestling.” “Our politics, like Barthes’s wrestling, has become a spectacle of excess, which has no sense of time, and no logic of the future,” Mr. Krein said, drawing a chuckle from the crowd of more than 100. He then turned to a dead-serious matter: rethinking the entire post-Cold War policy consensus. “We in America no longer have any idea what the future should be, much less how to build it together,” he said. That’s big talk for a quarterly with an initial print run of 300 copies and whose first issue mixes articles on economics and international affairs with more abstract offerings like a disquisition on Hegel and work. But the history of modern conservatism is paved with journals whose influence belied their small circulations, including The Public Interest, which became the chief organ of neoconservatism in the 1970s and ’80s, and National Affairs, founded in 2009 to promote “reform conservatism.” "

Mr. Clayton, a longtime partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell who is President Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, has represented big banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays as well as prominent hedge funds and corporate executives, according to a financial disclosure form made public on Wednesday by the Office of Government Ethics. Some of the clients were listed on Sullivan & Cromwell’s website — and Mr. Clayton kept nine others confidential — but the filing reveals a number of previously unadvertised assignments, including work he has done for companies facing intense government scrutiny: Deutsche Bank, UBS and Volkswagen. Other well-known clients represented by Mr. Clayton, whose given name is Walter, include the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the film studio the Weinstein Company, Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn, and William C. Erbey, former head of the mortgage firm Ocwen. In the hedge fund sector, Mr. Clayton, 50, has represented William A. Ackman’s Pershing Square as well as Paul Tudor Jones. He has also represented Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a company in which Mr. Ackman is a major investor and which is being investigated by the S.E.C. over potential accounting irregularities. Mr. Clayton, who says he will recuse himself from certain cases involving former clients, has also personally invested in a number of hedge funds and private equity firms through special Sullivan & Cromwell investment vehicles, according to the filing. He earned $7.6 million from Sullivan & Cromwell over the past year or so and has investments in portfolios managed by Apollo Global Management, Bain Capital, J.C. Flowers and Perry Partners. His wife, Gretchen, who works at Goldman Sachs, has a number of investments in Goldman-managed funds as well as a small amount, described in his filing as being less than $1,001, with a retirement account once managed by Omega Advisors, a hedge fund now fighting S.E.C. charges. Mr. Clayton’s disclosures offer a rare glimpse into his client list and family wealth — a sum of at least $50 million, his filing shows — and may reinforce a view among consumer groups and Democratic lawmakers that he could have conflicting interests as a Wall Street regulator. Although he is expected to broadly support the agency’s enforcement efforts, he has made statements suggesting that he will probably move to ease at least some of the Obama-era regulations weighing on Wall Street clients.

But then, this leading showcase of contemporary American art feels refreshed in other ways, too. In a generational shift, the Whitney has chosen two young curators for this always anticipated exhibition: Christopher Y. Lew, 36, and Mia Locks, 34. It’s also the first time that the biennial’s curators are both people of color. After months on the road, they have boiled down the art of the last few years into a survey that, for all its energy, doesn’t overwhelm the museum. The biennial will always be a show people like to fight about. But before the arguments and debates begin, let me tell you about a walk I took with the pair through the in-progress installation. What follows is a user’s guide to the 78th Whitney Biennial, which opens to the public on March 17. (My colleague Roberta Smith will publish her review on that date.) The show is ambitious, but it’s tight. There are 63 participants, which puts it back on the scale of the 2010 and 2012 biennials after the hundred-artist-plus blowout of 2014. Though it occupies only two floors of the new building, and much of the lobby, the exhibition enjoys more square footage than in its previous, Marcel Breuer-designed home. The curators have also capitalized on the Whitney’s enviable cityside balconies, which will feature art both massive (a suite of red laminated glass boxes by the West Coast veteran Larry Bell) and invisible (a sound work by the young artist Zarouhie Abdalian). Even the floor-to-ceiling windows of the building’s fifth floor have been overtaken by a riotously colorful composition from the artist Raúl de Nieves, which will be visible from the street after nightfall.

The departure of some of the group’s leadership does not mean that the battle to take Raqqa will be easy, the official said. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 fighters remain in the city. To provide more firepower for the looming battle, a United States Marine artillery unit is being deployed in Syria, mimicking the approach the United States has taken to support Iraqi troops fighting to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But the flight of some Islamic State leaders indicates that their loss of Raqqa would not signal the end of their struggle to preserve their pseudo-state. The group’s fighters are expected to fight on in Deir al-Zour, a Syrian province south of Raqqa, and in Iraqi towns along the Euphrates River, as well as to try to administer their self-proclaimed caliphate from those places. A detailed assessment of Islamic State fighting capabilities was provided by the American defense official, who could not be identified under the ground rules for the Pentagon briefing. "

Gothamist.com, its flagship site in New York City, will serve as the official blog for DNAinfo, the company said — covering food, arts and viral stories while serving to promote the news stories churned out by DNAinfo’s network of neighborhood reporters. Its sister site, Chicagoist, will do the same for DNAinfo’s Chicago site. The three other websites in the Gothamist network — in Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles — will include DNAinfo stories when relevant and may be used as launchpads for future DNAinfo sites, according to a statement from Gothamist. “By joining forces with Gothamist, DNAinfo will be able to do an even better job of fulfilling its longstanding mission, which is to bring people the most relevant and interesting news and information about their neighborhoods,” Mr. Ricketts said in a statement. The move represents a significant consolidation of two of the more visible players in the local news business in New York City: Gothamist, which helped shape the mold for local news aggregation and coverage on the internet when it was founded in 2003, and DNAinfo, a start-up that, after its founding in 2009, moved aggressively to fill a void as the city’s newspapers cut back on local news coverage. But the publications differ in fundamental ways. Whereas DNAinfo, which is owned by a prominent conservative, has become known for its neighborhood-specific focus, Gothamist features snappy writing and reporting on issues that appeal to the left-leaning populations in the cities it covers.

Since then, this concern has grown. Even within the space of a few weeks, the demands of the presidency have magnified his erratic patterns of behavior. In particular, we are struck by his repeated failure to distinguish between reality and fantasy, and his outbursts of rage when his fantasies are contradicted. Without any demonstrable evidence, he repeatedly resorts to paranoid claims of conspiracy. Most recently, in response to suggestions of contact between his campaign and agents of the Russian government, he has issued tirades against the press as an “enemy of the people” and accusations without proof that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, engaged in partisan surveillance against him. We are in no way offering a psychiatric diagnosis, which would be unwise to attempt from a distance. Nevertheless, as psychiatrists we feel obliged to express our alarm. We fear that when faced with a crisis, President Trump will lack the judgment to respond rationally. The military powers entrusted to him endanger us all. We urge our elected representatives to take the necessary steps to protect us from this dangerous president. JUDITH L. HERMAN

Republicans who are hoping for a full House vote next week on the plan to replace the Affordable Care Act are facing resistance from conservative members of their party and skepticism from moderates. Some critics of the bill, which maintains many of the act’s mandates and basic benefits, called it “Obamacare lite.” Analysts say that millions of people would be at risk of losing their health coverage under the new legislation, especially those in their 50s and 60s. We also look at how the Republican plan could affect Medicaid. • WikiLeaks divulges cyberweaponry. The latest trove, labeled Vault 7, appears to show a catalog of  C.I.A. tools to break into smartphones, computers and internet-connected TVs, although there has been no public confirmation of the documents’ authenticity.

WikiLeaks released documents on Tuesday that appeared to show that the Central Intelligence Agency had acquired an array of cyberweapons that could be used to break into Apple and Android smartphones. It also put another fissure in the relationship between intelligence agencies and Silicon Valley — a relationship that had already fractured when Edward J. Snowden disclosed that the federal government was hacking major technology companies. Relations also cracked after Apple resisted a Justice Department request for help accessing the iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Denelle Dixon-Thayer, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox browser and which was mentioned in the WikiLeaks files, said that the C.I.A. and WikiLeaks were undermining the security of the internet. “The C.I.A. seems to be stockpiling vulnerabilities,” she said, “and WikiLeaks seems to be using that trove for shock value rather than coordinating disclosure to the affected companies to give them a chance to fix it and protect users.” Investment bankers and Saudi officials are pushing ahead with the potentially huge initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company. But for many investors, there are still more questions than answers. Is the company worth the $2 trillion that the Saudis insist it is? Or just a small fraction of that, as some bankers and international oil experts say? Will the royal family allow the kind of transparency that investors are demanding? "
652,A Ticket to Hell,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/a-ticket-to-hell.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/03/09,OPINION,"Donald Trump has spent his whole life overselling an overinflated vision of himself and his success. He was the outer-borough boy whose father’s “boxlike office” was on Avenue Z in Brooklyn; he always dreamed of making it to Manhattan and breaking into the big league. With a hustler’s spirit and some sleight of hand, he made it, but not in total. He made the move, made the money and made his mark on New York’s skyline, but he never quite made it into the inner sanctum of New York high society. I’m convinced that this is part of his obsession with former President Barack Obama. Obama was quickly granted the thing Trump never had: upper-class acceptance and adulation. For Trump’s part, his sin was even worse than being new-money: He was tacky rich. No amount of money or success could completely rid him of the odiousness of being coarse and crass. He upset social conventions. For him, things had to be gilded to be glamorous. All modesty — either real or contrived to guard against exposure — was absent from the man. He was a glutton for attention and adoration. He chased the spotlight and pimped celebrity for profit. He valued flaunting over philanthropy. "

But at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Chelsea, on the second Thursday of January, audience members did not seem confused as to why they were sipping beer in a dark cellar, awaiting the first act of the monthly comedy night staged by Reductress, the soon-to-be four-year-old satirical online magazine. The self-selecting crowd appeared, like the site’s readership, to be made up of liberal-minded women. “That does mean we have to castrate all men before they leave the basement,” Nicole Silverberg, the website’s associate editor, said before introducing the performers, who included writers from “Broad City,” “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” The crowd could take a joke. But online, some people still don’t get Reductress, which Sarah Pappalardo and Beth Newell started as a blog in April 2013 and which now receives more than one million unique views a month. In a segment that she calls “Meet the Commenters,” Ms. Silverberg highlights the unconversant readers who troll the site’s social channels, asking where they can find the (nonexistent) print edition, questioning the objectivity of its “reporting” and more. “We have certain articles that sort of eclipse our normal readership, and that’s when we’ll start to get a flooding in of people who a) don’t understand what it is that we do and are not aware that it’s satire, or b) are very hateful of whatever idea we’re trying to communicate,” Ms. Silverberg, 26, said after the show, which she hosts. That the site registers as sincere to some readers could be seen as a mark of its skill, akin to Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, retweeting The Onion. Reductress’s editors excel at parodying lifestyle articles (beauty tips, first-person experiences, personality quizzes — anything you might find in the pages of Cosmopolitan or on Bustle). At the same time, mistaking humor for journalism may be a sign of the times, as fake news continues to thrive online. "
654,E.P.A. Chief Doubts Consensus View of Climate Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/politics/epa-scott-pruitt-global-warming.html?searchResultPosition=34,2017/03/09,CLIMATE,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said on Thursday that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming, a statement at odds with the established scientific consensus on climate change. Asked his views on the role of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas produced by burning fossil fuels, in increasing global warming, Mr. Pruitt said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so, no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.” “But we don’t know that yet,” he added. “We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” Mr. Pruitt’s statement contradicts decades of research and analysis by international scientific institutions and federal agencies, including the E.P.A. His remarks on Thursday, which were more categorical than similar testimony before the Senate, may also put him in conflict with laws and regulations that the E.P.A. is charged with enforcing. His statements appear to signal that the Trump administration intends not only to roll back President Barack Obama’s climate change policies, but also to wage a vigorous attack on their underlying legal and scientific basis. A report in 2013 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of about 2,000 international scientists that reviews and summarizes climate science, found it to be “extremely likely” that more than half the global warming that occurred from 1951 to 2010 was a consequence of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

655,"Trump Weighs Cuts to Coast Guard, T.S.A. and FEMA to Bolster Border Plan",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/politics/trump-budget-coast-guard.html?searchResultPosition=36,2017/03/09,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering deep cuts in the budgets of the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency as it looks for money to ratchet up security along the southern border, according to a person familiar with the administration’s draft budget request. The goal is to shift about $5 billion toward hiring scores of additional agents for Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as toward infrastructure to support a crackdown on illegal immigration at the border. A significant portion of the money would go toward erecting a wall along the border with Mexico, one of President Trump’s signature campaign promises. To fund those efforts, though, the plan would seek significant reductions in other areas, including a 14 percent cut to the Coast Guard’s $9.1 billion budget and 11 percent cuts to both the T.S.A. and FEMA. The three agencies have played high-profile roles in the Department of Homeland Security’s post-Sept. 11 security architecture. All told, the plan would increase the department’s budget by 6.4 percent, to $43.8 billion, for the 2018 fiscal year, also using savings from other executive branch departments to fund it. News of the proposal, which was first reported by Politico on Tuesday, has befuddled longtime veterans of the Department of Homeland Security. Lawmakers in both parties indicated they would scrutinize, and perhaps even oppose, a slew of potential cuts they argued would not only expose new weaknesses but also undermine Mr. Trump’s own strongly stated goals of curtailing terrorism, narcotics and illegal immigration. “It’s a little bit like putting an extra lock on the front door and none on the back door,” said Michael Chertoff, who led the Homeland Security Department for four years. “You are not really protecting the house.” "

The increase, which includes a team of Army Rangers and a Marine artillery unit that have already arrived in Syria, represents a near-doubling of the number of American troops there. The United States military has declined to say how many troops it has deployed in Syria. The formal troop cap is 503, but commanders have the authority to temporarily exceed that limit. The Rangers’ presence became apparent last weekend when they were seen driving around the northern Syrian town of Manbij in Stryker vehicles and armored Humvees. The Washington Post earlier reported the deployment of the Marine artillery battery. “We are preparing logistical and fire support to enable a successful assault on Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of ISIS,” said Col. John L. Dorrian, a spokesman for the American-led command that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “The exact numbers and locations of these forces are sensitive in order to protect our forces, but there will be approximately an additional 400 enabling forces deployed for a temporary period to enable our Syrian partnered forces to defeat ISIS in Raqqa,” Colonel Dorrian added.

The controversy has worsened ahead of an April referendum in Turkey on a new Constitution that would vastly expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His allies want him to campaign in Germany, where 1.5 million Turks live and are eligible to vote. Mr. Erdogan has accused Germany of using “Nazi practices” to block him from campaigning. Germany is agitated about Turkey’s crackdown on civil liberties and the detention of a Turkish-German journalist, Deniz Yucel. Norbert Lammert, the president of Germany’s Parliament, has warned that the referendum could pave the way for “an increasingly autocratic state that is growing more removed from European values and standards.” In remarks to Parliament this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel called the Nazi comparison “completely unacceptable.” She said that the remarks were “sad and incredibly misplaced,” and that they trivialized the suffering of victims of the Nazis. Ms. Merkel said that it was in Germany’s interest not to distance itself from Turkey, but that the dispute involved fundamental principles like the freedom of the press, speech and assembly. "

Many Americans over the age of 60 would have to pay more for health insurance under the Republican health care plan. Many low-income families would lose their insurance. Many disabled people, hepatitis patients and opioid addicts, among others, would no longer receive treatments that they do now. Care to guess where the billions of dollars in savings from these cuts would go instead? They would go largely to the richest 1 percent of households, those earning at least $700,000 a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. A disproportionate amount of the savings would go to the richest of the rich — those earning in the millions. The Republican health care bill is, in no small measure, a tax cut for the wealthy. If you’re wondering how Republican leaders can defend cutting benefits for older, sicker and poorer Americans to pay for a top-end tax cut, House Speaker Paul Ryan offered a revealing non-answer, as Jonathan Chait noted in New York Magazine. At a news conference, a reporter asked Ryan why the bill cuts taxes for the rich. Ryan laughed, waved the question away, told the reporter to read the bill and then moved on to another question. Evidently, he can’t defend the tax cut. In related news, the list of groups opposing the bill now includes AARP, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Catholic Health Association of the United States and the Children’s Hospital Association.

A four-leaf clover is not a symbol of Ireland. It is just a plant. On Wednesday afternoon the hats disappeared from Mr. Trump’s online store. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to questions about why the hats were taken off the website.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California’s biggest lake, about 350 square miles, is dying. It’s not the first time. The Salton Sea, straddling the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, is the latest incarnation of a body of water that has been drying and refilling over eons with water from the Colorado River. Native Americans once fished and camped on Lake Cahuilla, a prehistoric and larger version. The Salton Sea was born in the early 1900s after a canal burst sent water from the Colorado flooding into the valley over a period of two years. Beginning in the 1950s, entrepreneurs transformed it into a tourist mecca, building marinas and resorts. There were beauty pageants and boat races. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra visited. But in time, runoff pollution, drought and blistering heat conspired to end the fun. As the saline lake evaporated, its salt concentration soared, killing fish en masse. The blooming and decomposition of algae had a powerful stench. Today, the Salton Sea is surrounded by abandoned buildings. For people fighting to revitalize it, there are two big concerns, said Michael Cohen, a researcher with the Pacific Institute, a water-policy think tank. "

There are East Room meetings, evening dinners and sumptuous lunches — even a White House bowling soiree. Mr. Trump is deploying the salesman tactics he sharpened over several decades in New York real estate. His pitch: He is fully behind the bill to scotch President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, but he is open to negotiations on the details. In so doing, Mr. Trump is plunging personally into his first major legislative fight, getting behind a bill that has been denounced by many health care providers and scorned by his base on the right. If it fails, Mr. Trump will find it difficult not to shoulder some of the blame. “He understands the power he has as president to drive the legislative process,” said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina and a top House vote counter, who was part of a meeting with Mr. Trump in the East Room on Tuesday. “He made it clear that this is his priority, that it has to get done, and he made clear that he has to get it through before he moves on tax reform,” Mr. McHenry added.

Details shmetails. “We can act now or we can keep fiddling around and squander this opportunity to repeal Obamacare, and begin a new chapter of freedom for the American people,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of another committee that’s pushing the bill through at lightning speed.

664,New York City to Get Less Federal Aid for Housing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/nyregion/new-york-city-to-get-less-federal-aid-for-housing.html?searchResultPosition=32,2017/03/09,NEW YORK,"President Donald J. Trump has yet to put his mark on the federal budget, but in a possible harbinger of leaner times to come, officials in New York City are already contending with declines in federal financing for programs that assist some of the city’s poorest residents. Two city agencies that provide subsidized housing were told in letters sent last month that they would receive less from the federal government. In all, the funding shortfalls at the two agencies, the New York City Housing Authority and the Housing Preservation and Development agency, could total more than $58 million by the end of the year. Mayor Bill de Blasio has for weeks insisted that the city would not make pre-emptive adjustments to its budget to account for what could amount to major cuts to federal funding for city programs. New York City received about 10 percent of its budget, or about $8.8 billion, from the federal government in the 2017 fiscal year. “We also are not going to say to folks in Washington, go ahead and cut us because we have so much money to put in — we don’t,” the mayor said Wednesday during an unrelated news conference about the city’s coming ferry service. “Our reserves could be eaten up very, very quickly if the magnitude of budget cuts that’s possible here was to play out.” The decline in funding to the housing agencies does not affect only New York and was not initiated by the Trump administration. Nor does it represent a budget cut in the usual sense: a new federal budget has yet to be introduced in Congress. The federal government and all its programs are currently operating on the basis of a continuing resolution, which keeps the funding levels flat. That translates in some cases into a de facto decline because of rising costs. But rather than a simple cut, the decline in funding received by New York City was the result of a new formula adopted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington in anticipation of what is likely to be a dramatic change in the federal budget from a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.

665,Israel Says Dissenters Are Unwelcome,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/israel-says-dissenters-are-unwelcome.html?searchResultPosition=57,2017/03/09,OPINION,"A new Israeli law, approved Monday, will bar entry to any foreigner who supports the B.D.S. movement (boycott, divestment and sanctions) against Israel for its occupation of the West Bank. It’s a strong statement by the Israeli right wing, intended to characterize supporters of the movement as enemies of Israel. But it changes little on the ground. Israeli border authorities already had the authority to turn back people the government deemed hostile to the Jewish state, which they did most recently with Omar Shakir, an American working for Human Rights Watch. No doubt there are haters of Israel among B.D.S. supporters. But there are also many strong supporters of the Israeli state, including many American Jews, who ardently oppose the occupation of the West Bank and who boycott products of the Israeli settlements in occupied territories. Publicly declaring all of them to be haters of Israel is unjust and counterproductive. Counterproductive because the law projects an image of Israel as hostile to anyone who disagrees with the occupation and settlements, encouraging louder calls for boycotts every time a visitor is turned back at the airport. In fact, the occupation has been a source of passionate debate within Israel itself and in the Jewish diaspora from the time Israel first took control of the territories in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Many Israelis who are fully devoted to their country believe the occupation, and the settlement construction on it, undermine the democratic ideals on which Israel was founded and thus pose a threat to the state. As for foreign critics, one of Israel’s most compelling responses has always been to urge them to come see the land for themselves. Visiting the country, witnessing the challenge of ensuring its security, traveling in Israel and the Palestinian territories and participating in open and impassioned debates may not persuade visitors to support the settlements, but it will demonstrate that Israel is not afraid of allowing people to see the problems and conflicts firsthand. The new law, by contrast, proclaims, “You’re with us or against us.” The United States, Israel’s strongest military supporter, has consistently criticized the building of settlements in the occupied territories as detrimental to seeking a lasting peace. Even President Trump publicly asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the Israeli leader’s visit to Washington last month to “hold back on the settlements.” Unfortunately, the Israelis who called for barring advocates of B.D.S. seem emboldened by the Trump administration. An American president who has closed doors to Muslim refugees may not be in a position to question the Israeli law. But it should be condemned by all who value Israel’s tradition of debate and dissent and who support the search for a lasting peace. "

More Americans — some 3,600 — died as Northern and Southern armies clashed at the Battle of Antietam, in western Maryland, than on any other single day before or since, even more than on Sept. 11. One hundred and fifty years later, as the National Park Service commemorated the terrible loss at Antietam, I stood on the stage in a large tent on the battlefield before several hundred eager tourists, curious locals and enthusiastic Civil War buffs of every age and origin. We had gathered to discuss a documentary made by Ric Burns based on a book I had written about death and the Civil War, a chronicle of the experiences of more than 700,000 Americans who died between 1861 and 1865, leaving a nation of mourners in a world profoundly altered by the scale of such human tragedy. The audience posed questions to Ric and me about history, about war, about patriotic sacrifice, about American identity, about the meanings of life and death and human mortality — and about how all those things were both different and the same across the century and a half that separated us from our Civil War ancestors. Ric’s film, and the moving discussion it generated, were made possible by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Reports suggest that the Trump administration’s coming budget will defund the endowment. I would wager that few readers of this newspaper, and probably few Americans anywhere, are untouched by an N.E.H.-sponsored project or program. In 1990, for example, Ric Burns and his brother Ken produced an 11-and-a-half-hour documentary on the Civil War that was broadcast over five consecutive nights and seen by more than 40 million viewers. For much of the nation, it was an early form of binge-watching. The humanities endowment made that film possible. "

But it’s hard to imagine a more turbulent transition than the current one, which has been marred by assertions that the administration has tried to both politicize and marginalize intelligence gathering. No White House likes it when intelligence agencies — such as the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency — deliver bad news, or when that information undercuts the executive’s preferred policies or political positions. But I can’t remember another White House so quick to dismiss those agencies’ judgments or so willing to discredit them as dishonest or incompetent. We’ve seen presidential tweets with “intelligence” in accusatory quotation marks, a kind of dog whistle that equates intelligence assessments with news reporting that the president condemns as “fake.” In addition to lumping the intelligence agencies in with the “dishonest” mainstream media, the president has compared his espionage services to Russians, Nazis and WikiLeaks. Last weekend, Mr. Trump accused President Barack Obama of ordering phones at Trump Tower tapped during the 2016 campaign, a claim so outrageous that James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, denied it a day later. (So did the F.B.I. director, James Comey, according to this paper.) And last month, Mr. Trump blamed the intelligence community, along with the press, for the downfall of his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, saying on Twitter that “information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes and @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (N.S.A. and F.B.I.?).” As the former director of both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., I know that leaks are a real problem that can endanger national security. But why would the administration reflexively and punitively blame its own services for leaks, since we do not yet know who is responsible for them? The president has asserted that the leaking will stop “because now we have our people in,” a choice of words that creates more than a little shudder in the ranks of intelligence professionals, who prefer to work in the background for presidents, Democratic or Republican.

670,Connecting Trump’s Dots to Russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/connecting-trumps-dots-to-russia.html?searchResultPosition=53,2017/03/09,OPINION,"I enjoyed the show “House of Cards” but always felt that it went a bit too far, that its plot wasn’t plausible. After seven weeks of President Trump, I owe “House of Cards” an apology. Nothing seems impossible any more. That includes the most towering suspicion of all: that Trump’s team colluded in some way with Russia to interfere with the U.S. election. This is the central issue that we must remain focused on. There are a lot of dots here, and the challenge is how to connect them. Be careful: Democrats should avoid descending into the kind of conspiratorial mind-set that led some Republicans to assume Hillary Clinton was a criminal about to be indicted or to conjure sex slaves belonging to her in a Washington pizza restaurant. Coincidences happen, and I think there has been too much focus on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, not enough on Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager. Here are 10 crucial dots: 1. President Trump and his aides have repeatedly and falsely denied ties to Russia. USA Today counted at least 20 denials. In fact, we now know that there were contacts by at least a half-dozen people in the Trump circle with senior Russian officials. 2. There’s no obvious reason for all these contacts. When Vice President Mike Pence was asked on Jan. 15 if there had been contacts between the Trump campaign and Kremlin officials, he answered: “Of course not. Why would there be?” We don’t know either, Mr. Vice President. 3. There were unexplained communications between a Trump Organization computer server and Russia’s Alfa Bank, which has ties to President Vladimir Putin. These included 2,700 “look-up” messages to initiate communications, and some investigators found all this deeply suspicious. Others thought there might be an innocent explanation, such as spam. We still don’t know. "
671,Donald Trump’s Political Stew,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/donald-trumps-political-stew.html?searchResultPosition=52,2017/03/09,OPINION,"Reader, guess when this paragraph was written: These words appeared in The New York Times Magazine in May, 1970. The quote comes from Kevin Phillips, the originator of Richard Nixon’s election-winning Southern strategy. In fact, the problems that plagued the Democratic Party 50 years ago continue to do so. The 2016 election and its aftermath have produced turmoil on the right while once again forcing into public view worrisome long-term trends in the Democratic electorate. On Feb. 27, The Conversation, an academic website, published “The Democratic Party is Facing a Demographic Crisis,” by Musa al-Gharbi, a Lazarsfeld fellow in sociology at Columbia. Al-Gharbi challenges a widespread Democratic assumption (succinctly articulated in a recent book by Ruy Teixeira, “The Optimistic Leftist”) that guided the two Obama campaigns as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 bid. From that vantage point, the party is the beneficiary of demographic destiny: A swelling population of single women, knowledge workers, minorities and millennials guarantees the emergence of a majority left coalition. Instead of a “Rising American Electorate,” al-Gharbi describes a party on a steady downward trajectory over the last three presidential elections. “In 2008, Barack Obama beat John McCain by 192 Electoral College votes and 8.54 million popular votes,” al-Gharbi writes: Based on his examination of exit poll data, al-Gharbi points out that His conclusion: One of the mainstays of Democratic optimism is the conviction that a growing body of young voters — more liberal than their elders — will soon dominate elections, just as the baby boomers did before them. In point of fact, however, millennials are slowly, incrementally becoming a less reliable Democratic constituency. Ronald Brownstein, writing in the Atlantic, found “there’s no guarantee Democrats can reap big benefits from millennial mistrust of Trump.” As Brownstein notes: Clinton did less well than Obama in 2012 among millennial voters, winning them by 19 points compared to Obama’s 23-point margin.

672,"Profitable Companies, No Taxes: Here’s How They Did It",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/business/economy/corporate-tax-report.html?searchResultPosition=48,2017/03/09,ECONOMY,"Complaining that the United States has one of the world’s highest corporate tax levels, President Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly vowed to shrink it. Yet if the level is so high, why have so many companies’ income tax bills added up to zero? That’s what a new analysis of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies that earned more than $3.8 trillion in profits showed. Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group in Washington, found that 100 of them — nearly 40 percent — paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. Eighteen, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E, incurred a total federal income tax bill of less than zero over the entire eight-year period — meaning they received rebates. The institute used the companies’ own regulatory filings to compute their tax rates. Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe. The institute’s report cites these examples: Multinational corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Abbott Laboratories and Coca-Cola have ways of booking profits overseas, out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. (Those companies were not among the 258 whose rates were calculated by the institute, which said it could not verify the breakdown of their profits between the United States and other countries.) Citing evidence in the report, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, introduced a bill on Thursday to eliminate tax loopholes that encourage companies to shift activities offshore. “The truth is that we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations,” Senator Sanders said. “Offshore tax haven abuse has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now the ‘home’ to more than 18,000 corporations.” "

674,Arrest of ISIS Suspect in Rural Town Puts Australia on Edge,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/australia/isis-terrorism-haisem-zahab-australia.html?searchResultPosition=44,2017/03/09,AUSTRALIA,"YOUNG, Australia — On a rural road about two hours’ drive from the nearest major city, the small Australian town of Young has long been known for cherries and little else. But in recent years, the once largely white, working-class community has seen a steady influx of Lebanese Muslim families, many who say they have relocated from Sydney for a better and safer life. Among them are members of the Zahab family. Now one of them, Haisem Zahab, a 42-year-old electrician, is accused of using the internet to try to help the Islamic State develop a guided missile. Officials suspect that some of his relatives traveled to Syria to join the extremist group, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. The allegations about the Zahab family have rattled many residents of this town, who have long taken pride in its peaceful multiculturalism. They have also stoked some of the worst fears about homegrown links to terrorism in a country that is grappling with immigration policy and labor shortages. “One argument developing is that Muslims cannot be trusted, they are all bad, and with so many in our town, it was only a matter of time before trouble raised its head,” Craig Thomson, editor of The Young Witness, the local newspaper, wrote in an opinion column after Mr. Zahab’s arrest. “The other point put forward is that hatred is not the way to handle this situation and one man’s actions should not condemn the entire town’s Muslim population.” The case is playing out as Australia contends with the same nationalist, anti-immigrant forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the American presidency and that prompted voters in Britain to approve a withdrawal from the European Union. Visiting Australia last year, Mutuma Ruteere, the United Nations special rapporteur on racism, condemned Australian politicians as engaging in “xenophobic hate speech,” and likened the country’s mood to nationalist ideologies brewing in Europe and the United States. Mr. Zahab was arrested, with his family present, in a raid at his property in Young on Feb. 28. He was accused of researching and designing a long-range guided missile and laser warning device for use by Islamic State militants. "
675,Will a Leak Reveal Trump’s Tax Returns? Don’t Hold Your Breath,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/politics/taxes-trump-irs.html?searchResultPosition=31,2017/03/09,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The early days of the Trump administration have turned Washington into a land of leaks, with a national security adviser’s telephone calls, raw intelligence dossiers and confidential C.I.A. surveillance schemes spilling into the public. But the holy grail of leaks remains elusive: President Trump’s tax returns. As taxpayers scramble to file their own returns and Republicans push to overhaul the tax code, attention has shifted back to Mr. Trump’s taxes and how he could benefit from the sweeping legislation he hopes to sign. Looking for the ultimate leak, opponents of Mr. Trump have wondered aloud how it could be that top intelligence agencies are suddenly fonts of classified information while the staid tax collector remains hermetically sealed. “The American people deserve to know what conflicts of interest are hiding in Trump’s taxes,” said Delvone Michael, a member of the Tax March executive committee, which is organizing a mass demonstration to call for the release of the tax returns next month. “Every president in a generation has released his taxes. Trump must too.” Mr. Trump broke with 40 years of tradition as a presidential candidate, declining to make his tax information public on the grounds that he was undergoing an I.R.S. audit. The government has made clear that is, in fact, no impediment to release, but since corporations like the Trump Organization are audited constantly, the excuse will not disappear, and he is not expected ever to release his returns willingly. So how might Mr. Trump’s returns come to light? If you’re thinking about a rogue I.R.S. agent or Russian cybertheft, don’t count on it. After one of Mr. Trump’s advisers said in January that he had no intention of ever releasing his returns, WikiLeaks accused him of breaching a campaign promise and called for leakers to send the filings its way for publication. Similar calls bubbled up last week when The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump hopes to sharply cut the funding of the I.R.S., and critics on social media urged people inside the agency to take revenge by distributing his records.

The endowment gave $14.5 million to 419 organizations in New York City in the fiscal year 2016, according to a study by the city comptroller’s office. That was more than 10 percent of all N.E.A. grants that year, making New York City groups the top recipients of such grants in the country. “The only real consistent funding that sustains our company is the government-funding sources,” said Emily Joy Weiner, artistic director of Houses on the Moon Theater Company, which is based in Manhattan. The group received a $10,000 grant from the N.E.A. for the play “The Assignment,” which focuses on gun violence and will debut next month. The grant was about 8 percent of the cost of putting on the production, she said. The group also received funding from the New York State Council on the Arts, which in turn gets a large annual grant from the federal endowment. “Without those sources our company would never have been able to continue to grow and sustain itself,” Ms. Weiner said. The New York Times reported last month that the federal government’s budget office had created a hit list of programs that could be eliminated to trim spending, including the arts endowment, which was established in 1965. Some of the first recipients of endowment grants were New York City-based dance groups, including the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Martha Graham Dance Company and the American Ballet Theater, according to Robert L. Lynch, the president of Americans for the Arts, an advocacy group that is pushing to preserve the endowment. "

I loved it.” She waited for the filmmaker’s people to follow up, American-style, and they, assuming her silence meant she wasn’t interested, offered the part to someone else. But “the stars just realigned in this very, very lucky way,” she said: The other actress had to drop out. Now, in the ghostly “Personal Shopper,” in theaters Friday, March 10, Ms. Stewart is playing a role that Mr. Assayas wrote specifically for her. As the sullen, motorcycle-riding Maureen Cartwright, she selects haute couture for her celebrity client, who gives her blank checks but demands that she not try on the clothes. But that’s just Maureen’s day job. A twin whose brother has recently died, she is also a medium in search of a sign — anything will do — that he is still by her side. At Cannes in May, “Personal Shopper” was booed at the press screening but went on to be nominated for the Palme d’Or, with Mr. Assayas sharing a best director win. In a phone interview from Los Angeles, Ms. Stewart, almost 27 and warmly loquacious, discussed her intimidating facade and calling out President Trump on “Saturday Night Live.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

678,Review: ‘American Crime’ Fixes on Migrant Dreamers in the Fields,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/arts/television/review-american-crime-season-3-abc.html?searchResultPosition=11,2017/03/09,TELEVISION,"The third season of “American Crime,” the gritty ABC drama with an investigative heart, will unspool just as President Trump’s proposed border wall will be generating a lot of discussion. The series wants a piece of that debate, but not the obvious one about cost and necessity. It wants you to ponder just why anyone would want to work the fields of the giant farms that are so important to the United States economy. This season of the anthology show, which has its premiere on Sunday night, has an unexpected setting, given the big-agriculture theme: It takes place not out West, but in North Carolina, where tens of thousands of Spanish-speaking migrant workers help bring in crops of fruits and vegetables. Structurally, the series uses one crime to illuminate an array of story lines and issues, and this season eventually follows that template, but it also suggests that the bigger crime is the exploitation and poor treatment of workers on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. In the show’s first two seasons, Regina King won Emmys for her work, and she is strong again in Season 3 as a social worker who wants very much to conceive a child. But she may have competition in the accolade department this time from Benito Martinez, playing Luis, a father who makes his way — illegally — to North Carolina from Mexico to search for his son. Luis knows that the young man worked in the fields before the family stopped hearing from him, so though Luis is not a farmhand, he masquerades as one, discovering a world where workers are trapped by debts to those who smuggled them and provide their wretched housing. John Ridley, the series’s creator, has never tiptoed around the issues he attacks, and he’s particularly blunt here, showing brutality by the overseers who manage the workers, sexual assaults on female migrants and more. In among the foreign migrant workers is the American-born Connor (Coy Henson). View him as Mr. Ridley’s response to the argument that illegal immigrants are taking jobs from American workers. Connor, a drug addict trying to get clean, can’t handle the hard labor, and he’s pretty much the only Caucasian in the fields. Americans are not exactly lined up to fill the backbreaking, low-paying jobs. The contractors who provide workers to the big farms have to lie and obfuscate to get anyone, legal or illegal, to jump in their trucks. "
679,Trump’s New Travel Ban May Be Hard to Beat. But States Are Trying.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/donald-trump-new-travel-ban.html?searchResultPosition=12,2017/03/09,U.S.,"President Trump’s executive order banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries faced a new front of opposition from the states on Thursday, as the attorney general of Washington announced that he would seek to block the order from taking effect next week. Backed by several fellow Democratic attorneys general, Bob Ferguson of Washington said he would ask a federal district judge, James Robart, to extend an order freezing the first version of Mr. Trump’s travel ban and apply it to the updated restrictions the White House unveiled on Monday. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Ferguson acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s updated order was less sweeping than its predecessor. But he argued that the travel restrictions remained “effectively a Muslim ban,” with many of the same legal weaknesses as the first version. “It’s fair to say that the revised executive order does narrow the scope of who’s impacted by it in an adverse way,” Mr. Ferguson said. “But that does not mean it has cured its constitutional problems.” His announcement in Seattle opened a new phase in the legal battle over Mr. Trump’s attempt to sharply limit travel to the United States from a group of majority-Muslim countries — including Syria, Libya and Iran — as a collection of Democratic-leaning states that attacked the first ban increasingly mass their efforts behind Mr. Ferguson’s litigation. Among the attorneys general backing Mr. Ferguson on Thursday were Eric T. Schneiderman of New York and Maura Healey of Massachusetts, both of whom dropped separate litigation against Mr. Trump to join Mr. Ferguson’s suit, and Ellen F. Rosenblum of Oregon. Mr. Ferguson and his colleagues, along with Attorney General Lori Swanson of Minnesota, are expected to file updated complaints aimed at taking down the new travel order in the coming days. "

More worrisome, perhaps, is the question of who else knows about these security weaknesses. Hackings are rarely discovered in a secure facility accessed only by spooks. They are more often than not found in the online bazaar of hackers and cyberweapons dealers trading security information for fun and profit. And the C.I.A. is hardly the only intelligence agency looking to acquire that information. It is safe to say that intelligence and law enforcement authorities from most countries — not to mention a wide array of hackers — are on the lookout for ways to break into smartphones and other security devices. So what should you do about it? The Times’s Brian X. Chen offers a few tips: First, update your software if you are using an iPhone or an Android phone. Most of the breaches described in the documents appeared to target older software. On your personal computers, also make sure you have the latest operating system and antivirus software. You should also update the firmware in your router. The bad news? If hackers can really turn Samsung TVs into monitoring devices, there is no easy solution. Samsung says it is looking into the issue. More tech news: Uber says it will stop employees from using a program called Greyball to thwart regulators. In the wake of a New York Times article about the tool, which appeared to allow drivers to avoid officers in Oregon, the company said it was conducting a review of how it is used.

Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, who comes from a right-wing religious party and has long championed changes to the court, considered the appointments a victory: One of the new judges is a settler; another is an Orthodox Jewish woman; a third is also considered a conservative. (The fourth judge is an Arab Israeli.) The new judicial appointments, Ms. Shaked argued, “reflect the human and legal diversity” that she said had “until now has been so lacking on our highest court.” After decades dominating politics, the Israeli right had finally broken through into this bastion of unapologetic liberalism. Now the right has the opportunity to prove that it can run the country effectively without being fettered by a liberal court. Engineering this political earthquake required some serious politicking. A nine-member committee selects the judges for the High Court of Justice. Four members are politicians, two of them ministers and two members of the Knesset. Three are sitting judges on the court. Two are representatives of the Bar Association. To get the conservative judges added, Ms. Shaked cunningly forged a coalition between the politicians and the lawyers. When the judges on the committee tried to block most of the new appointees, she made them back down by threatening to pass legislation that would in effect cancel their power to veto candidates they highly dislike. The High Court had been a target of right-wing complaints for more than two decades. In the 1990s, a liberal-minded court began interpreting Basic Laws — Israel’s partial substitute for a constitution — more expansively. The court also became more aggressive in inhibiting government actions. The new approach, labeled a “constitutional revolution” by Aharon Barak, then the chief justice, aimed to fill a void left by Israel’s lack of a constitution. The timing couldn’t have been more out of step with the direction of the country. As the court was becoming more liberal and interventionist, Israel’s voters and politicians were moving rightward. As liberals lost elections, they increasingly turned to the courts. Meanwhile, judges became a constant irritant to the conservatives who won elections only to see their agendas constrained by the judiciary. Critics said the court was forcing its liberal values onto Israel’s elected officials. For example, in 2013 the court rejected a government policy enabling the state to detain without trial illegal immigrants for three years. For years, settlers and their supporters have accused the High Court of going easy on Arabs who build without proper licenses, while being tough on settlers who do the same thing. Ms. Shaked and many of her peers in the government harshly criticized the court in these cases. "

Charts Economic Course, Politics Complicate the Picture",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/business/european-central-bank-mario-draghi-rates.html?searchResultPosition=50,2017/03/09,BUSINESS,"FRANKFURT — Central bankers like to portray themselves as being aloof from the hurly-burly of politics, coolly assessing the economic data as they ponder whether to add a jolt of stimulus or take some away. But with populism on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, opinion polls have arguably become one of the European Central Bank’s most important sources of data points. Faced with a series of national elections in which anti-euro candidates play prominent roles, Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, mounted a spirited counteroffensive on Thursday. He portrayed the currency as the key to European prosperity and even took an implicit jab at the protectionist rhetoric of President Trump. “Open trade has been the pillar of world prosperity for many, many years,” Mr. Draghi said. Although it made no major changes to monetary policy on Thursday, the bank is under increasing pressure to begin withdrawing the stimulus program that has prevailed for a decade. That task, delicate in the best of times, is even more difficult in the charged political atmosphere that permeates not only Europe but also the United States and the rest of the world. Some political candidates are questioning the whole idea of a united Europe and the European Central Bank’s fundamental reason for being. The situation raises the stakes whenever the bank makes a decision. Britain, which was never in the eurozone, has voted to leave the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate for the French presidency, has worried investors with talk of bringing back the franc. Similar nationalist language has been heard from candidates in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy who have been emboldened by Mr. Trump’s election. "

And as the House debates how to best dismantle the Affordable Care Act, a familiar array of interest groups with deep pockets, incensed talk radio hosts and online agitators is again assuming its posture of aggression toward the House Republican leadership. “Swampcare,” the writer and radio personality Erick Erickson scoffed at the new American Health Care Act, the culmination of seven years of promises to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. “Obamacare 2.0,” declared Breitbart.com. “RINOCARE,” Mark Levin wrote on Twitter, using the acronym for Republican in Name Only. Political groups backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and other powerful players on the right, such as Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, have come out quickly and strongly against the bill. Some have threatened to punish lawmakers by docking their conservative ratings on the influential “scorecards” they distribute to voters. Activists are already swarming Capitol Hill and demanding that Congress take a harder line and pass a repeal measure that would leave no trace of the Affordable Care Act. “I feel lied to,” said Anna Beavon Gravely, the deputy state director of the North Carolina chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed group that is funding a grass-roots push against Republicans in Congress who want to stop short of an outright repeal. “We trusted you because you said you were going to do something about this. And this is not it. Not even close,” she added as she prepared to set out for the offices of North Carolina lawmakers with other activists from her state. "

Trump’s victory became clear. “Outside of the Civil War, World War II and including 9/11, this might be the most cataclysmic event the country’s ever seen,” Mr. Halperin said. Given that assessment, it might seem surprising that Mr. Halperin has opted to re-examine Mr. Trump’s tumultuous campaign in all its detail. But he and Mr. Heilemann, the authors of the best-selling campaign books “Game Change” and “Double Down,” are betting that there is still a strong appetite for an insider, blow-by-blow account of the 2016 campaign. On Thursday, Penguin Press announced that it had acquired their latest book, which will explore Mr. Trump’s striking and unexpected rise to the presidency. The book has also been purchased for a mini-series on HBO, which turned “Game Change” into an original movie, with Julianne Moore as Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and Ed Harris as Senator John McCain. Like “Game Change,” the new mini-series by HBO Films will be directed and executive produced by Jay Roach, and executive produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman of Playtone Productions. Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann, who are also producers and hosts of “The Circus,” a weekly documentary series on Showtime, will be entering crowded terrain in revisiting last year’s campaign. In the months since the election, several prominent political reporters have sold memoirs and books promising an inside view of the race, including Katy Tur of NBC News, who is writing a book about covering the Trump campaign, and Amy Chozick of The New York Times, who is working on a memoir of her years covering Hillary Clinton.

Huntsman Jr. has accepted President Trump’s offer to be ambassador to Russia, people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday, taking on a diplomatic assignment that would be challenging in the best of times but is more so now, given the questions swirling around the Trump campaign and its links to Russia. Mr. Huntsman, a former Republican governor of Utah, served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011. Experts said he will need his political dexterity to navigate Moscow at a time when Mr. Trump has called for better ties even as Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election remains under intense scrutiny. “Not only is there this mess with the investigation that will complicate his assignment, there’s a lot of incoherence within the Trump administration regarding its policy toward Russia,” said Michael A. McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. The F.B.I. is known to have examined possible contacts between Russia and Trump advisers. Congress also has opened an inquiry. While Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign to defrost the relationship with Moscow after the chill of the Obama years, senior officials in his cabinet have so far signaled less change than continuity. The administration, for example, has said it will not lift sanctions until Russia withdraws from Crimea and stops destabilizing Ukraine. The prospect of further investigations into Russia and the Trump campaign may make it politically impossible for Mr. Trump to pursue a new start. And any new disclosures could make Mr. Huntsman’s life on the diplomatic circuit in Moscow awkward. "

The agency, created in 1974, released its analysis of the completed version of the health care law in March 2010. It estimated 21 million people would be enrolled in public marketplaces by 2016. The year ended with 11.5 million enrollees. But according to a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, a health care research group, the C.B.O.’s projections for the Affordable Care Act were more in line with what actually happened than four other prominent analyses from 2010.

692,Obama Education Rules Are Swept Aside by Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/every-student-succeeds-act-essa-congress.html?searchResultPosition=22,2017/03/09,U.S.,"With all the attention paid to President Trump’s lightning-rod secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, and her advocacy for private school vouchers, little public notice has been paid to the action on education in Congress — where lawmakers have broader power than Ms. DeVos to make changes to the nation’s school system. Now, Congress has done exactly that, voting to repeal crucial regulations associated with the Every Student Succeeds Act, one of President Barack Obama’s final legislative achievements. When Mr. Obama signed the act in December 2015, many Democrats and Republicans alike celebrated the supposed end of what they saw as an era of federal overreach into local schools. The measure, known as ESSA, took a more collaborative approach than its predecessor, No Child Left Behind. Many critics viewed No Child, passed under President George W. Bush, as well as Mr. Obama’s first-term education policies, as punitive. The policies pushed for test scores to be used to remove underperforming teachers and to shut down struggling schools. They were also unpopular because they led to an explosion in the number of tests students took each year. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, children still have to take standardized tests in math, reading and science, and schools still need to report on the progress of at-risk groups, like disabled students, nonwhite students and those learning English. But fewer consequences are now tied to low test scores and more emphasis is placed on holding schools accountable for providing access to advanced classes and for reducing student suspension rates. In addition, states are now able to come up with their own plans for how to intervene in failing schools. Mr. Obama called the bill a bipartisan “Christmas miracle.” The National Council of La Raza, a Latino-rights organization, gave ESSA’s two Senate co-sponsors, Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, an award for their work on behalf of students learning English. The two appeared together to accept the honor, each praising the other’s collaboration. "

According to a recent Tax Policy Center report, under the Trump plan, “about 70 percent of benefits go to families with at least $100,000 and 25 percent of benefits go to families with at least $200,000.” Low-income families would have to wait until the end of the year for a refundable tax credit — which, according to your article, could be as little as $10 — something that households with limited cash flow can ill afford. The Trump plan offers little or no improvement over the existing Child and Dependent Care Credit. If we really want to increase the supply of high-quality, affordable child care, we should focus on urging Congress to allocate funds to improve staff salaries and benefits and adult-to-child ratios, increase oversight, and provide substantial direct subsidies to low-income families to cover their child care expenses. SONYA MICHEL, SILVER SPRING, MD. The writer is the author of “Children’s Interests/Mothers’ Rights: The Shaping of America’s Child Care Policy.” To the Editor: President Trump’s proposal to make child care affordable for families could also benefit nannies and fill the tax coffers. Currently, a million nannies are hidden from the Internal Revenue Service — to their detriment as well as the government’s. "

President François Hollande of France warned on Sunday that Mr. Trump’s ignorance of Europe “means we must prove to him the E.U.’s political cohesion, its economic weight and its strategic autonomy.” Mr. Hollande invited Britain, despite its departure from the bloc, to join Europe’s defense. On Monday, European Union ministers agreed that military training operations underway in Africa should have a headquarters in Brussels, a cost-saving move that is also a step toward the permanent European command structure called for in the union’s 2009 Lisbon Treaty. More troubling, though, is talk of nuclear expansion. After Mr. Trump’s election in November, Roderich Kiesewetter, a foreign policy spokesman in Germany’s ruling party, warned that, in the absence of nuclear protection by the United States, “Europe still needs nuclear protection for deterrent purposes,” and that he would look to nuclear powers France and Britain to provide it. And Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party, said in interview published last month that strategic autonomy means Europe “would have to be able to keep up with Russia” on the nuclear front, raising the prospect of a nuclear arms race between Europe and Russia. As long as NATO’s tactical nuclear weapons remain in Europe, there is little possibility of Europe creating another nuclear deterrent. Yet, despite recent assurances from Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the Trump administration remains committed to a strong NATO, Mr. Trump’s alarming statements questioning America’s commitment to the alliance and his ignorance of the treaties that underpin nuclear security have unnerved Europe’s leaders. “Europe cannot be naïve and has to take care of its own security,” states a paper released by the European Commission this month, in laying out scenarios for Europe’s future. “Being a ‘soft power’ is no longer powerful enough when force can prevail over rules.” Europe seems to see Mr. Trump as a threat to stability forged through rules. For the sake of Europe, the United States, and our collective security, Mr. Trump must show that he understands the limits of unilateral action. "

But there are increasing uncertainties around Britain’s decision to leave the European Union and an inevitable gathering of opposition to her decision to go for a hard break with the bloc, particularly in Scotland and Northern Ireland but also, increasingly, in England. A bill to allow the government to start its formal notice of resignation from the European Union, known as Brexit, is wending its way through Parliament. With noisy bouts of disagreement from the House of Lords, pressure is growing on Mrs. May, of the Conservative Party, to call an early general election to solidify her narrow majority in the House of Commons while the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats remain in disarray. Mrs. May has vowed that she will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March, beginning the two-year process of withdrawing from the European Union. She may do it even sooner, before the other 27 nations of the European Union gather in Rome on March 25 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome that led to the founding of the bloc. Some are urging her to call for an election at the same time. However, Mrs. May has vowed not to hold an election before the next scheduled vote, in May 2020. And she is usually described as someone with contempt for those who treat promises as ephemeral. But the temptation is strong, articulated this week by William Hague, the former Conservative Party leader, speaking for other Tory legislators, who urged her to capitalize on Labour’s woes. "

After Donald J. Trump, the answer may well be a run for the White House. Mr. Trump had no political or military experience, the traditional routes to high political office. Virtually his only qualification was his business career, and a checkered one at that, considering his own brush with personal bankruptcy. “There is this sense that if Trump got it, why shouldn’t they?” said David Gergen, co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and an adviser to four presidents. “They’ve been more successful, they have more experience, and they’ve run a public company, which is more equivalent to what a president does than a private company” like the Trump Organization. Stu Loeser, once the press secretary for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who considered a presidential run last year, concurred. “If you run a company that has employed tens of thousands of people, and generated lots of profit and been undeniably successful, and you look at a sitting president who, to be honest, a lot of business people don’t have much respect for, you think, why not me?” he said. Mr. Loeser now runs his own strategic consulting firm, and told me he has clients who are business executives considering a run for high public office. “I can’t tell you their names, obviously,” he said. Boldface corporate names widely discussed as contenders for the next Democratic presidential nomination include chief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com, along with Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, and Oprah Winfrey, chairwoman and chief executive of Harpo Inc., which owns half of the Oprah Winfrey Network.

In the latest iteration, the Justice Department declined to comment on whether Mr. Trump is — or is not — the subject of an investigation. “No comment,” a department official said. In normal circumstances, a “no comment” from the Justice Department on the status of any investigation would be standard practice. And certainly there has never been any indication that Mr. Trump himself was the target of inquiries by the department and congressional intelligence committees into possible contacts between his associates and members of the Russian government. But by venting his ire against Mr. Obama in a series of Twitter messages at dawn on Saturday, Mr. Trump awkwardly raised that possibility himself, since any wiretapping could have been the direct result of an investigation targeting him. One presidential tweet in particular — “how low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process” — clearly portrayed Mr. Trump as the victim of surveillance. Thursday’s verbal gymnastics actually started on Wednesday when Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, insisted to reporters that the president is not the target of a counterintelligence investigation involving contacts with Russia. He said, flatly, that “there is no reason to believe there is any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice.” That prompted Thursday’s comments from a Justice Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. The official said that Mr. Spicer had not relied on any information from the department in denying the existence of an investigation targeting the president. "

On the day the threat arrived, the congregation of Masjid Bilal Ibn Rabah had planned a potluck dinner. Earlier that afternoon — March 4 — the president of the mosque in Lexington, Ky., found an envelope in the mail from Sheffield, England. Inside was a green index card that read, “An explosive device will be placed at your mosque very soon.” Waheedah Muhammad, who worships at the mosque, was shocked when she heard about the threat. The congregation is not used to threats and has a strong relationship with the surrounding community. Prior to the threat, neighbors and others had sent the mosque notes of support and donations — a Sunday school class even sent the mosque love notes. “It was just so bizarre that this would happen here where we have a sense — maybe a false sense — of security,” said Ms. Muhammad, who is also the Kentucky chairwoman of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Masjid Bilal Ibn Rabah is one of more than a dozen mosques to receive threats since January, according to reports collected by the council. Threats, vandalism and other forms of discrimination targeting mosques in the United States have risen in recent years, from 39 in 2014 to 139 in 2016. The council has also found a more than 50 percent increase in incidents of bias against American Muslims between 2015 and 2016. The Greenview Madani Center, in Lawrenceville, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, received a handwritten letter reading, “death is waiting for you and your kind” in the mail late last month. Three other mosques in the Atlanta area, and two in Alabama, received emailed threats in February, warning of attacks on Muslims on March 15. "

But in his first spending blueprint since taking office, Mr. Trump also made choices demonstrating that parts of America will be more first than others — and some of the budget losers, it turns out, may be some of the very constituencies that have been most supportive of the new president during his improbable rise to power. While border guards will have more prisons to lock up unauthorized immigrants, rural communities will lose grants and loans to build water facilities and financing to keep their airports open. As charter schools are bolstered, after-school and summer programs will lose money. As law enforcement agents get more help to fight the opioid epidemic, lower-income Americans will have less access to home energy aid, job training programs and legal services. The budget proposal that will be unveiled by Mr. Trump’s White House on Thursday represents the most dramatic shift in how national resources are divvied up of any presidential spending plan since Ronald Reagan. In his rhetoric both before the election and since his inauguration, Mr. Trump outlined a vision of a country getting back to basics, tapping into a visceral sense among many Americans that Washington has been too generous with taxpayer money spent wastefully both at home and abroad while doing nothing to alleviate what he called the “American carnage.” The budget is his first attempt to translate that into concrete reality. Mr. Trump wants to slash deeply into domestic and international programs to pay for a large military buildup and protect Social Security and Medicare without increasing the deficit or raising major taxes. As a practical matter, the budget may stand little chance of passing intact. But as a political statement, it represents a new way of doing business. "

President Trump also proposed scrapping the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a key revenue source for PBS and National Public Radio stations, as well as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. It was the first time a president has called for ending the endowments. They were created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation declaring that any “advanced civilization” must fully value the arts, the humanities, and cultural activity. While the combined annual budgets of both endowments — about $300 million — are a tiny fraction of the $1.1 trillion of total annual discretionary spending, grants from these agencies have been deeply valued financial lifelines and highly coveted honors for artists, musicians, writers and scholars for decades. Nothing will change for the endowments or other agencies immediately. Congress writes the federal budget, not the president, and White House budget plans are largely political documents that telegraph a president’s priorities. "

But does the Republican alternative solve these problems, or does it exacerbate them? A report this week from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office provides some answers. What follows is a report card analyzing the Republicans’ plan by the standards they have used in judging, and condemning, President Barack Obama’s health care law. THE CRITICISM While some people have gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act, “the deductibles are so high, you don’t even get to use it,” Mr. Trump said Monday at a meeting with people he described as victims of the law. “The deductibles are so high that you really don’t have insurance.” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said this week that “deductibles are unaffordable.” Many consumers, required to pay deductibles of more than $10,000 a year for family coverage, agree. THE REPUBLICAN ANSWER Legislation drafted by House Republican leaders and approved by two House committees could make the situation worse. Consumers’ out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles, “would tend to be higher than those anticipated under current law,” the budget office said, and it gave two reasons. "

The selection of Ms. Powell is the most prominent appointment on the National Security Council staff since Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster was picked last month to serve as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. K. T. McFarland will continue to serve as the principal deputy national security adviser, making her the second-ranking official after General McMaster. Ms. Powell was asked to take the job by General McMaster, who wants to put a greater emphasis at the council on developing and implementing strategy. Although she does not have extensive experience on national security issues, Ms. Powell has spent 15 years in government, has worked in the private sector and has a broad network of contacts. Ms. Powell also works closely with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and will be his closest liaison with the council. Ms. Powell was recently the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. During her years at Goldman Sachs, she worked with Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump’s senior economic policy adviser, and she is expected to continue her role working on the administration’s economic initiatives. She was born in Egypt, is fluent in Arabic and participated in Mr. Trump’s meeting this week with Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi Arabian deputy crown prince and defense minister. Ms. Powell was an assistant secretary of state for education and cultural affairs during President George W. Bush’s administration. Before working at the State Department, she was an assistant to the president for personnel. In the early phase of her career, she worked on Capitol Hill, and she has close relationships with Democrats as well as Republicans. Her familiarity with working across government agencies may be useful for an administration that has gotten off to a rocky start. “General McMaster understands that one of the things that is going to be especially important is interagency coordination, and to get that right requires additional senior level talent and somebody with real clout,” said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the council. “Ms. Powell’s private and public sector expertise will be essential.” General McMaster has also asked Nadia Schadlow to join his staff as a deputy assistant to the president for national security strategy. Ms. Schadlow served as a senior officer at the Smith Richardson Foundation and is the author of a recent book that examined 15 cases in which the United States Army intervened abroad, and the service’s role in political and economic reconstruction. She will be tasked with drafting the United States national security strategy, a comprehensive statement of the administration’s foreign policy and defense goals, which is issued by the White House.

The surprise pairing at the new musical “Come From Away” was rich with symbolism, as Mr. Trudeau tries to maintain his country’s close relationship with the United States despite substantial differences in public policy. Ms. Trump, the president’s daughter and a close adviser, sat in Row F between Mr. Trudeau and Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and directly behind a former Canadian prime minister, Jean Chrétien. In brief remarks from the stage before the performance, Mr. Trudeau did not discuss government policy explicitly. Instead he focused on praising the show’s story, about a small town in Newfoundland that fed and housed thousands of air travelers from around the world, diverted when North American airspace was closed during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “The world gets to see what it is to lean on each other and be there for each other through the darkest times,” he said.

Bush a significant defeat by tightening legal restrictions against torture in a law called the Detainee Treatment Act. Soon afterward, Neil M. Gorsuch — then a top Justice Department official — sent an email to a White House colleague in case he needed “cheering up” about the administration’s setback. The email from Judge Gorsuch, nominated by President Trump to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, linked to articles about a less-noticed provision in the act that undercut the rights of Guantánamo Bay detainees by barring courts from hearing their habeas corpus lawsuits. “The administration’s victory is not well known but its significance shouldn’t be understated,” wrote Judge Gorsuch, who had helped coordinate the Justice Department’s work with Congress on the bill. The email about the court-stripping provision — which the Supreme Court later rejected — is among more than 150,000 pages of Bush-era Justice Department and White House documents involving Judge Gorsuch disclosed by the Trump administration ahead of his Senate confirmation hearings next week. Judge Gorsuch’s time in the executive branch was brief. He joined the Justice Department in June 2005 as the principal deputy associate attorney general, meaning he was the top aide to the No. 3 official in the department. He left in August 2006, when Mr. Bush appointed him as a federal appeals court judge in Denver. But those 14 months were tumultuous ones for the Bush administration amid controversies over detainee abuses, military commissions, warrantless surveillance and its broad claims of executive power. Judge Gorsuch’s job put him at the center of both litigation and negotiations with Congress over legislation about such topics. "

Health Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-rally-health-care-policy.html?searchResultPosition=88,2017/03/15,POLITICS,"NASHVILLE — President Trump made a plea on Wednesday for his supporters to unite behind the Republican plan to overhaul Americans’ health care as the only way to squelch Democratic attempts to scuttle the plan. At the same time, facing resistance to the bill from within his own party, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said it would be refined and improved. “We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government,” Mr. Trump told about 10,000 supporters at the Municipal Auditorium in downtown Nashville. He spoke against the backdrop of a giant American flag to a crowd dotted with red trucker caps bearing his signature slogan, “Make America Great Again.” “We’re going to all get together, we’re going to get something done,” Mr. Trump said. “Remember this: If we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we’d need 60 votes, so we’d have to get the Democrats involved. So we’re doing it a different way, a complex way.” “It’s going to be fine,” Mr. Trump added. The remarks were a nod to the complicated and politically risky approach Republicans have taken in pushing through legislation to repeal the health care law. The House plan championed by Mr. Ryan is coming under strain amid resistance, both from conservative Republicans concerned it is too close to Obamacare and from moderates who fear it will provide insufficient coverage for Americans who lack health insurance. Mr. Ryan, fighting to keep the measure on track, said Wednesday that he was making “some necessary improvements and refinements” to the package to answer the concerns, which intensified this week after the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that the legislation would increase the number of people without health insurance by 24 million by 2026. “Now that we have a score, we can incorporate feedback to improve this bill, to refine this bill, and those kinds of conversations are occurring between the White House, the House and the Senate, and our members,” Mr. Ryan said.

The results were immediately cheered by pro-European politicians who hoped that they could help stall some of the momentum of the populist, anti-European Union and anti-Muslim forces Mr. Wilders has come to symbolize, and which have threatened to fracture the bloc. Voters, who turned out in record numbers, nonetheless rewarded right and center-right parties that had co-opted parts of his hard-line message, including that of the incumbent prime minister, Mark Rutte. Some parties that challenged the establishment from the left made significant gains. The Dutch vote was closely watched as a harbinger of potential trends in a year of important European elections, including in France in just weeks, and later in Germany and possibly Italy. Many of the Dutch parties that prevailed favor the European Union — a rare glimmer of hope at a time when populist forces have created an existential crisis for the bloc and Britain prepares for its withdrawal, or “Brexit.” “The Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said ‘Whoa’ to the wrong kind of populism,” Mr. Rutte told a wildly enthusiastic crowd, excited that his party, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, had come in first among the parties and lost fewer seats than it had feared. “Today was a celebration of democracy, we saw rows of people queuing to cast their vote, all over the Netherlands — how long has it been since we’ve seen that?” Mr. Rutte said.

What started as officials “reviewing” what the president had said soon morphed into “I have no reason to believe” that an investigation exists, and finally became using wiretap “in quotes.” Here’s a timeline of the administration’s responses: The Twitter post that started it all came early on a Saturday morning, and was followed by several others, including one in which Mr. Trump accused former President Barack Obama of engaging in behavior similar to that of Richard M. Nixon during Watergate. “Bad (or sick) guy!” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama. That same afternoon, the president’s spokesman took a wait-and-see approach, suggesting only that the administration’s chief lawyer would review options. Other officials, speaking on background, suggested that the chief counsel was looking for evidence to back up the president’s claim. The second-day response was twofold: criticize the news media coverage and try to shift the responsibility for providing information to Capitol Hill by demanding a congressional investigation. By the Tuesday after the tweet, administration officials were trying to move past the issue. Several sought to stick to Mr. Spicer’s previous admonition that the White House would not comment any further until congressional investigations took place. "

Every winter the two factions in the Capitol, the Republicans who rule the Senate and the Democrats who dominate the Assembly, each put forth a gorgeous what-if of a resolution, outlining a vision for the state’s spending — with one gigantic, unspoken caveat: that these proposals have no chance of becoming reality. The Senate Republicans won’t adopt all of the Democrats’ ideas, of course, nor will the Assembly go for all of the Republicans’ plans. The final budget will inevitably be a compromise between the two, with the added — and enormous — input of the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat whose politics generally fall between right and left. On Wednesday, both houses passed their resolutions with an added wrinkle: The Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of eight Democrats who partner with Senate Republicans, decided that it too would release a one-house resolution. Not to be outdone, the Senate Democratic Conference — whose 23 members are the minority in the 63-seat chamber — also released their budget resolution. That’s four budget resolutions, each with a snowball-in-a-sauna’s chance of being adopted wholesale. Yet the various plans — and the Venn diagram of their overlaps and outliers — offer hints as to what the actual budget will look like when it’s adopted at the end of March. (If it’s adopted then: Mr. Cuomo has a six-year record of on-time or close-to-on-time budgets on the line.) Democrats trumpeted social programs, ethics reform and housing, while Republicans pressed on jobs, deregulation and economic development. "

American workers will see gradual pay raises that keep compensation rising faster than inflation. Interest rates will rise gradually, while staying low by historical standards. And that’s all before accounting for any major stimulative policies that may emerge from the Trump administration and Congress. That was the view of the economy sketched by the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, at her first news conference of 2017 on Wednesday. In short, the Fed believes that after nearly eight years of trying to nurse the economy back to health, its work is nearly done. The general sense of rosiness isn’t really anything new — for years, Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, have forecast that the economy will steadily converge toward a Goldilocks-like state of being neither too hot nor too cold. Two things have changed. First, that day now feels imminent, with the unemployment rate at 4.7 percent and inflation closing on the 2 percent the Fed thinks best. That is a key reason the Fed raised its interest rate target Wednesday. Second, markets now believe the Fed’s message that higher rates are on the way; bond markets suggest that the Fed will actually follow through with its intentions on gradual interest rate rises. You couldn’t say that a year ago. “The simple message is: The economy is doing well,” Ms. Yellen told reporters. The overwhelming message was of gradualism — both on the rate of economic improvement and the Fed’s own efforts to wind down its era of low interest rates. She suggested no urgency toward a tightening of the money supply that might suggest a hair-trigger readiness to accelerate interest rate increases. Ms. Yellen evinced little fear that the Fed is behind the curve, suggesting that two more interest rate increases are on the way over the remainder of 2017. "

Abolish It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/opinion/erick-erickson-dont-try-to-fix-obamacare-abolish-it.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/03/15,OPINION,"ATLANTA — As Republicans in Washington grapple with altering the Affordable Care Act, they have proceeded in a direction that will do little to curb the cost of health care in America. Instead, they are pushing a bill that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, might save the government money, but will end coverage for 24 million people (though several million of those would be willingly giving up coverage the law now requires them to have). If it passes, Republicans will not only own the nation’s health care problems for years, but they will also have violated more than six years of promises. Since 2010, Republicans have pledged to repeal — not fix, not tinker with, but abolish — Obamacare. In 2016, that was a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s campaign. Republicans ran advertisements noting they had voted 70 or more times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they would do it as soon as they had control of Congress and the White House. Voters gave them just that. And now Republicans, who had used the word “repeal” like a meditation chant, act like the proverbial dog that caught the car. The plan they all liked in 2015 — one that would have ended the law’s mandates, subsidies and Medicaid expansion — would not pass today. Yes, Republicans, you really did once author a plan to credibly repeal Obamacare, unlike what you are considering now. Of course, Republicans are acting this way in large part because of President Trump’s voters. Despite all the hard talk about repealing Obamacare, Mr. Trump’s voters supported a man who promised a government-run health care plan that would provide universal coverage. In other words, he promised more than Obamacare. For that matter, Mr. Trump promised more government involvement in health care than Hillary Clinton did. It is not hard to see why Republicans think they can get away with breaking their promises. Their own party’s presidential nominee promised more than what President Obama offered and claimed he could pay for it all without raising taxes. "

The secretary general of the United Nations quickly disassociated himself from the report, which seemed bound to aggravate the already tense relationship between the world body and the Trump administration. It also could provide momentum to advocates of an international movement to boycott Israel. Just over a week ago, Israel’s Parliament passed a law barring entry to foreigners who have publicly supported that movement, known as B.D.S. — boycott, divestment and sanctions. The report was published by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, composed entirely of Arab member states; most do not recognize Israel. One of the authors of the report was Richard Falk, an American law professor and former United Nations human rights investigator whom critics regard as an anti-Israel extremist. He has been refused entry to Israel for what Israeli leaders have described as his hostile point of view. The report comes amid a hardening polarization on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with vastly diminished hopes for a two-state solution, a pillar of diplomatic efforts for the past two decades.

A few things: Without the supporting schedules for that return, nothing can be gleaned about the president’s conflicts of interest and/or possible compromising ties to foreign entities. And even if there were some suspicious information revealed in that return, that it is more than a decade in the past would certainly ameliorate the consequences. Lastly, just because some numbers are presented on a 1040 tax form does not mean that it is the tax return that was filed with the Internal Revenue Service. As lending officers have found, the only true way to confirm the veracity of a tax return is to have a borrower sign a form allowing them to get the information directly from the government. NEIL STEIN, BROOKLYN To the Editor: The tax returns arrived “over the transom.” David Cay Johnston, the journalist who received the documents, speculated that President Trump might have sent them himself. Of course the pages came from the Trump team, in my opinion. Why would a third party send these two pages to an adversarial reporter? These two pages show that Mr. Trump paid $38 million in taxes. It is almost impossible to believe that a third party would somehow have gotten only two pages of the tax return. And all of the unfavorable information (write-offs and charitable deductions or lack thereof) is contained in the other pages. Someone sympathetic to Mr. Trump would have sent the return to a pro-Trump reporter. An anti-Trump person would have sent the whole return to Mr. Johnston. So the only logical explanation is that Mr. Trump sent the two favorable pages to an adversary. Once again, he has played the media like a fiddle. JEFFREY L. FELDMAN
AVENTURA, FLA. To the Editor: Tax information for President Trump has been leaked and we now know that he did, in fact, pay federal taxes — 11 years ago. Still, his recent returns are more germane regarding interests that may affect his judgment as president. What President Trump is trying to hide is information that reveals a better understanding of his business acumen and his current net worth. The details must be embarrassing; otherwise, a bombastic braggart like Mr. Trump would have long ago produced proof that he is worth $10 billion. BUCK RUTLEDGE, KNOXVILLE, TENN. "

Trump an additional $31 million in federal income taxes in 2005 that a banquet of deductions would have otherwise enabled him to avoid paying. At its most basic, the A.M.T.’s goal is simple: In a tax system with enough loopholes to fill a macramé tapestry, the idea was to ensure that the richest taxpayers were not able to skip out on paying altogether. A version was introduced in 1969 after Congress discovered that — are you ready? — 155 taxpayers with taxable incomes over $200,000 paid no tax. But critics across the political spectrum have long complained that it has failed to live up to the promise. Both Mr. Trump and the House Republicans’ proposed overhaul of the code would eliminate the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. During his Democratic presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont suggested replacing the A.M.T. with a flat 28 percent rate on deductions for high-income households. Even the National Taxpayer Advocate within the Internal Revenue Service once called it the most serious problem facing taxpayers. The minimum tax has gone through several iterations, but the essential intent has not changed: to limit the amount of deductions available to the richest Americans. Over the years, though, inflation has eaten away at its effectiveness — as has the exclusion of interest and dividend income, which insulates the richest Americans. About 30 percent of households earning $200,000 to $500,000 in 2016 are being hit by the minimum tax, as are 63 percent of those earning $500,000 to $1 million, according to calculations from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. But only a fifth of the total earn more than $1 million and face the minimum tax. "

Mr. Trump’s advisers have likened him to Jackson, the first populist to win the White House. The president has hung Old Hickory’s portrait in the Oval Office and called him “an amazing figure in American history.” So how alike are the nation’s seventh and 45th presidents? Mr. Trump, who relishes junk food like Doritos and disdains physical exercise, stands at 6-foot-3 and weighs 236 pounds, according to a letter from his doctor last year, qualifying him as overweight with a body mass index of 29.5. Some think he is overstating his height (his driver’s license lists him at 6-foot-2) and understating his weight (one writer estimated by 30 pounds). Jackson, who survived diseases like smallpox, malaria, dysentery, rheumatism and dropsy and endured physical disability most of his adult life after being shot in the chest during a duel, was just shy of Mr. Trump in stature, standing 6-foot-1. But Jackson was far thinner, with estimates between 145 pounds and 154 pounds, putting his body mass index at 20 or lower. At age 13, an unruly Mr. Trump was packed off by his frustrated parents to New York Military Academy, but he never served in the armed forces, receiving five deferments from the draft during the Vietnam War, four for education and one for bone spurs in his heels.

The decision to block all but humanitarian trade dealt another blow to the much-beleaguered Minsk peace process and raised tensions not just with the separatists but with their patrons in Moscow, who could be called upon to provide aid and markets to the breakaway regions. President Petro O. Poroshenko has been reluctant to isolate the breakaway areas, in a region known as the Donbas, fearing that would implicitly recognize their independence and be a first step toward the country’s partition. But the idea of halting trade has long animated Ukrainian nationalists as a way to shift the cost of sustaining the approximately three million people in the eastern region onto Russia’s already weakened economy. In recent weeks armed bands of men in tattered camouflage had begun doing exactly that, blockading rail shipments from the east, mostly coal trains. They enjoyed strong public support, and their actions helped force the issue to the top of the nation’s agenda. When, in retaliation, separatist leaders started nationalizing Ukrainian mines and factories, the president said he felt forced to act. In televised comments at a meeting of the Ukrainian Security Council, Mr. Poroshenko minimized the damage that halting trade would do to the separatist regions, saying that far greater economic harm would befall Ukraine, which was losing an important source of cheap fuel.

The budget outline, to be unveiled on Thursday, is more of a broad political statement than a detailed plan for spending and taxation. But it represents Mr. Trump’s first real effort to translate his bold but vague campaign themes into the minutiae of governance. The president would funnel $54 billion in additional funding into defense programs, beef up immigration enforcement and significantly reduce the nondefense federal work force to further the “deconstruction of the administrative state,” in the words of Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Yet for all its headline-grabbing bold strokes — and the White House claims that it will reset the process of Washington policy making — major elements of the plan have already been declared dead on arrival by the Republican leadership in Congress, and much of the fiscal fine print will be filled in by Capitol Hill lawmakers and their aides over the next month. House appropriations subcommittees began reviewing the plan late Wednesday. Among the cuts: drastic reductions in the 60-year-old State Department Food for Peace Program, which sends food to poor countries hit by war or natural disasters, and the elimination of the Department of Transportation’s Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes flights to rural airports. The plan to be released at 7 a.m. tomorrow is a “skinny budget,” a pared-down first draft of the line-by-line appropriations request submitted by first-term administrations during their first few months. A broader budget will be released later in the spring that will include Mr. Trump’s proposals for taxation as well as the bulk of government spending — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs. Mr. Trump’s version is likely to be even skinnier than usual, a result of the chaos, inexperience and staffing problems encountered by the Trump White House over the first two months. "

But it clarified an important policy question: Should the alternative minimum tax be repealed? Answer: No. In a world of honest policymaking, that clarification alone would be enough to change the trajectory of the tax debate now unfolding. Instead, it highlights how dishonest the debate has become. If not for the alternative minimum tax, a part of the code that applies to wealthy taxpayers, Donald Trump would have paid just 4 percent of his reported $150 million income in federal taxes in 2005. But thanks to the AMT — which disallows excessive deductions so that the very rich pay something closer to a fair share — Mr. Trump paid tax equal to 25 percent of his income. That’s still too low; the merely affluent, who earn six and seven-figure incomes, are subject to similar rates and rules. But it’s better than it would be if there were no AMT. So, of course, a linchpin of the tax reform plans by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans is to get rid of the AMT. "

In a recent interview in New York, she leaned in to mimic her mother’s voice. “‘What are you doing with your menstrual pads?’” she whispers. “My mother taught me to go burn them in the backyard when nobody’s looking.” Ms. Adichie never fully understood the shame that was supposed to usher in womanhood, which made her hide her pads and made her friends apologize to boyfriends for having periods at all. “I’m not going to have my daughter have that kind of shame,” she said. Ms. Adichie’s latest book, “Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions,” is a 63-page blueprint for achieving that reality. Written as a letter to a friend, the book offers a set of guidelines for how to raise a feminist daughter. “Teach her to love books”; “never speak of marriage as an achievement”; “‘because you are a girl’ is never a reason for anything.” The premise of feminism, Ms. Adichie writes, is simply: “I matter. I matter equally.” The Washington Post wrote that much of the book would be familiar to readers of Ms. Adichie’s previous work but that it was “more personal, more urgent.” In person, Ms. Adichie, 39, is warm and thoughtful, and also distinctly glamorous. She has spoken often about the pleasure she takes in fashion, and she is the face of Boots No7, a makeup brand. Ms. Adichie has cultivated these two strands of her identity: the serious literary author and the fashion icon. In turn, she has been celebrated both by mainstream pop culture and the literati. She won a MacArthur fellowship in 2008, and her novel “Americanah” won the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction and was chosen as New York City’s “One Book” for 2017. Her 2012 TEDx talk, “We Should All Be Feminists,” was sampled by Beyoncé in her music, and excerpts appeared on T-shirts at Dior’s Paris Fashion Week show last year. The pop and the literary threads are not opposites to her, and their merger is central to the way she presents her public self and her work. "

Two Russian intelligence agents directed a criminal conspiracy that broke into 500 million Yahoo accounts in 2014, the Justice Department said, in one of the largest known data breaches. The agents were supposed to be helping Americans hunt for hackers — but instead they were working against them. Prosecutors said the Russian government used the information to target foreign officials, business executives and journalists. _____ 2.

Granting the automakers their top wish, Mr. Trump halted an initiative by the Obama administration to impose stringent fuel-economy standards by 2025 — rules meant to cut carbon emissions and meet international commitments to address climate change. Instead, Mr. Trump vowed to keep cutting regulations as a means to accelerate economic growth and add new jobs. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he declared. The move to reopen the government’s review of the standards will allow automakers to argue for less stringent — and less costly — mileage standards than the target of 54.5 miles per gallon set in 2012 by President Barack Obama. But the Trump administration is expecting things from the automakers in return for its pro-industry stance: new American jobs, and less investment in foreign operations. And while Mr. Trump vowed to improve business conditions at home, he pledged again to stop the flow of automotive investment and jobs to Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he termed “a total disaster.” "

Andania, plain and sturdy, pulled into New York Harbor on April 11, 1923, after a slow journey from Liverpool, England. In a third-class cabin was a gray-eyed Irishman named Richard Michael Cawley, fleeing poverty and war. The son of a tailor from a rural village, Mr. Cawley, then 20, had come of age during a guerrilla conflict. Now, with Irish fighting Irish, he had made his way to America to join his older brother and uncle. He would settle in Chicago, a city bursting with Irish Roman Catholic life; marry a teacher; find work as a streetcar driver; and sing ballads by the piano on Saturday nights. He would become an American citizen, march in St. Patrick’s Day parades and visit Ireland, looking, one cousin marveled, like “a real Yank.” It is a familiar American tale, except for this: Mr. Cawley’s grandson and namesake, Michael Richard Pence, is the vice president of the United States, which is in the thick of a roiling immigration debate. On Thursday, Mr. Pence, wearing a spray of shamrocks in his lapel, welcomed Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, for breakfast at the vice president’s residence as part of the White House’s St. Patrick’s Day festivities. For Mr. Pence — who calls his grandfather “the proudest man I ever knew, and the best man I ever knew” — and his family, it is a deeply personal celebration. "

He pledged to build a wall, hire 15,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents and speedily deport millions of undocumented immigrants. He justified these actions by claiming that immigrants regularly flout the “rule of law and pose a threat.” In his first speech to Congress, he directed the Department of Homeland Security to create a new office — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice — dedicated to helping victims of crimes perpetrated by “removable aliens.” I am an immigrant and an American citizen, and, as a philanthropist, have supported migrants all over the world for more than 30 years. Based on my experience and the facts, the president’s approach to immigrants is just wrong — and a new round of court injunctions against Mr. Trump’s latest proposed travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries suggests many in the federal judiciary agree. It does nothing to make America safer, while whipping up emotions against immigrants that have translated into an alarming surge in hate incidents all across our nation. My heart goes out to the victims of violence, whatever the source. But in the name of protecting the population from a relatively minor source of concern, he is branding all immigrants as criminals. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s claims, immigrants commit significantly less crime than native-born citizens. This has been borne out in study after study, using a wide range of methodologies, dating back decades. According to the nonpartisan American Immigration Council, the percentage of the population that is foreign-born grew to 13.1 percent from 7.9 percent between 1990 and 2013. F.B.I. data shows that the violent crime rate dropped 48 percent during that time and today remains near historic lows. A recent study by the Journal on Ethnicity in Criminal Justice shows that immigrants actually drive down crime rates in the neighborhoods where they live. But targeting immigrants and minorities with false and prejudicial rhetoric, as Mr. Trump has done during the campaign and in the early weeks of his presidency, has spurred a surge in hate acts against them. The Southern Poverty Law Center found that hate incidents reported in the first few weeks following Mr. Trump’s victory were at levels normally seen over a six-month period. No community appears safe from this rash of hate — with reports like school bullying against Muslim children, stories of Latinos being harassed on the street and told to “go back to your country,” attacks on blacks and gays, and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. This is a country that prides itself on neighbors looking out for one another. In Donald Trump’s America, we are increasingly at one another’s throats. "

Yet he continues to be lured to the stage and, after a string of concerts celebrating his 70th birthday in 2015, he will embark on a run of four shows each in New York and Los Angeles. Expect a set list that draws on his solo career as well as his remarkable work with Cream and the Yardbirds; additionally, plan to hear covers honoring blues masters like Robert Johnson and Willie Dixon.

The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter and cabaret star Lady Rizo has been something of a mainstay at Joe’s Pub in recent years: Indeed, she was once an artist in residence at the venue. So it makes sense that she would unveil a new show, titled “Red, White and Indigo,” at one of her preferred performance spaces. Expect this piece to be her most sociopolitical one yet: The performance will explore what she calls her “love-hate relationship with America,” which she will expand upon with hilarious and sardonic storytelling — and using her undeniable set of pipes.

Since the late ’90s, the group’s founding members, Stephen O’Malley and Greg Anderson, have spurred a rise in experimental metal in America thanks to their own record label, Southern Lord, which has also released excellent albums by experimental-noise bands like Pelican and Boris. For this concert, brace yourself for overwhelming guitar drones, which Sunn O))) conjures with instruments tuned so low, they just might reach the Earth’s core.

Two decades into its career, the Grammy-winning alt-rock band Wilco has settled into a comfortable groove; it has been releasing albums, such as “Schmilco” in 2016, with a tossed-off breeziness that suggests the frontman Jeff Tweedy and his group will never tire of the rigors of rock ’n’ roll. The same vibe defines Wilco’s live shows, too: Each night features a changing set list of around three dozen songs, which are drawn from the band’s solid catalog of 10 studio albums, including the 2002 breakthrough “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.”

The potential elimination of about $445 million in annual funding, which helps local TV and radio stations subscribe to NPR and Public Broadcasting Service programming, could be devastating for affiliates in smaller markets that already operate on a shoestring budget. Patricia Harrison, the corporation’s president, warned in a statement on Thursday that the Trump budget proposal, if enacted, could cause “the collapse of the public media system itself.” But the power players in public broadcasting — big-city staples like WNYC in New York City — would be well-equipped to weather any cuts. Major stations typically receive only a sliver of their annual budget from the federal government, thanks to listener contributions and corporate underwriters. Podcasts and other digital offshoots have also become significant sources of revenue. Rural affiliates, however, rely more heavily on congressional largess, which can make up as much as 35 percent of their budgets. Mark Vogelzang, president of Maine Public, called the Trump proposal “the most serious threat to our federal funding” since he started in public broadcasting 37 years ago. “We’re always living on the edge in this ecosystem of public broadcasting,” Mr. Vogelzang said in an interview.

728,Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/books/review/letters-to-the-editor.html?searchResultPosition=33,2017/03/16,BOOK REVIEW,"‘Reality Is Not What It Seems’ To the Editor: Lisa Randall’s review of “Reality Is Not What It Seems” (March 5) claims the science in my book “isn’t always correct, and interpretations are misleadingly presented as facts.” However, with the exception of one typo I thank Randall for detecting (“length” instead of “area,” in the ratio between cosmic and Planck scales), it is Randall who is misleading in her interpretations. Contrary to Randall’s assertions, the book clearly states it follows one interpretation of quantum mechanics (the “relational” interpretation) among the many defended today and presents the Big Bounce as a possibility that seems to emerge from loop quantum gravity. Randall’s declarations of fact (the realism of the wave function, for example) are subject to the same caveats. A core argument of my book is that on current issues in fundamental physics there is no consensus. Nobody has the Truth in her pocket. Disagreement nourishes science, but assaults on different schools of thought weaken it. Randall also mischaracterizes my discussion of how modern science builds upon earlier concepts. Of course ancient ideas are not the same as contemporary ones: The entire book is about this difference. There is more history, depth and complexity in contemporary science than what some scientists make of it.

I have had access to private rooms, overheard exquisite conversations and been able to observe subtle changes in another person’s inner life. Books have shown me horror and beauty. All this is true. But the most magical moments in reading occur not when I encounter something unknown but when I happen upon myself, when I read a sentence that perfectly describes something I have known or felt all along. I am reminded then that I am really no different from anyone else. Perhaps that is the secret motive behind every library: to stumble upon ourselves in the lives and lands and tongues of others. And the more foreign the setting, the more poignant the event seems. For a strange thing occurs then: A distance widens and then it is crossed. How many times, and in ways that did not seem to require my consent, have I suddenly and in my own bed found myself to be Russian or French or Japanese? How many times have I been a peasant or an aristocrat? How many times have I been a woman? I have been free and without liberty, gay, disabled, old, loved and loathed. All great art allows us this: a glimpse across the limits of our self. These occurrences aren’t merely amusing or disorientating or interesting experiments in “virtual reality.” They are moments of genuine expansion. They are at the heart of our humanity. Our future depends on them. We couldn’t have gotten here without them. "
730,Trump Takes a Gamble in Cutting Programs His Base Relies On,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/trump-budget.html?searchResultPosition=37,2017/03/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s proposal on Thursday for deep cuts to the budgets of a broad part of the federal bureaucracy was billed as a tough-minded and necessary corrective to the growth of the government’s power. But even members of his own party questioned some of the cuts — and what was not being cut. The harshest criticism of Mr. Trump’s budget came from Democrats and liberal organizations. But in a city where many federal programs enjoy longstanding bipartisan support, some Republicans also assailed the president’s judgment. “While we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the president’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,” said Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. “We will certainly review this budget proposal, but Congress ultimately has the power of the purse.” The spending plan’s bottom line is roughly the same as in President Barack Obama’s last budget request, but it marks Mr. Trump’s first major attempt to dismantle what his aides dismissively call the “administrative state.” The $1.1 trillion spending plan envisions deep cuts to many government programs while leaving entitlement programs like Social Security untouched. It increases spending on the military and border security. Mr. Trump was elected on a promise to wage war against what he has frequently mocked as a bloated and ineffective federal work force, and he is betting that his first budget will help consolidate support by calling for a significant shift of resources away from established programs that aid the poor, the environment, foreigners and the arts.

Congress",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/budget-republicans-democrats.html?searchResultPosition=39,2017/03/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — After eight years of chafing under President Barack Obama’s fiscal priorities, congressional Republicans were longing for a budget proposal that did the two things that have become the party’s mantra: Make broad cuts to federal spending and reduce the federal deficit. Instead, President Trump sent them a budget even many Republicans found difficult to love. To fulfill a campaign promise to leave Social Security and Medicare — which represent more than 40 percent of annual federal spending — untouched while constructing an expensive border wall, Mr. Trump went after a relatively small pot of money, discretionary spending, goring Republicans’ pet programs in the process. He does propose increasing military spending by 10 percent, something many conservatives would also like to see, but he probably cannot unilaterally break through legal budget caps, imposed after a battle in 2011 over raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling. Mr. Trump ran as a populist and stacked his cabinet like a conservative, yet he delivered a budget that in many respects is neither. The result is deeply unsatisfying for many in his party, which has been yearning for a unified government to finally make major changes to entitlement programs to bring the deficit in line. “This is a good budget if you want to spend your time fighting small fires,” said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who as the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee spent years trying to rally lawmakers to do the hard work to balance the budget. “It’s a statement of policy, which is legitimate, that the government is too big,” Mr. Gregg said. “As a practical matter, it does not affect the big issues that drive that.” "

Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, was paid over $65,000 by companies linked to Russia in 2015, according to a letter released on Thursday by congressional investigators. Among the companies was a cargo airline implicated in a bribery scheme involving Russian officials at the United Nations, an American branch of a cybersecurity firm believed to have ties to Russia’s intelligence services, and RT, the Russian government’s English language TV channel, according to the letter, which was sent to Mr. Trump on Thursday by Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat. Mr. Cummings is the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The document provides new details about Mr. Flynn’s ties to Russian entities just over a month after being forced to resign following revelations that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials about his conversations last year with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The letter, addressed to Mr. Trump; James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, requested additional documents related to Mr. Flynn’s security clearances. The fees were apparently for speaking engagements by Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. The engagements occurred before he became an official adviser to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. "
734,Green Beer and Rank Hypocrisy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/green-beer-and-rank-hypocrisy.html?searchResultPosition=41,2017/03/16,OPINION,"Does green beer taste better laced with hypocrisy? Does shamrock smell sweeter perfumed with historical amnesia? We may be about to find out, for this year’s St. Patrick’s Day jamboree at the White House will be a breathtaking celebration of double standards and the willful forgetting of America’s recent past. Even by the crooked yardstick of the Trump administration, the disconnect is surreal: The president will salute the legacy of one wave of immigrants even as he deploys against other immigrants the same calumnies once heaped upon the Irish. In the blizzard of executive orders, it was easy to miss a proclamation President Trump issued on March 1. The president declared this Irish-American Heritage Month and called on “all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish-Americans to our nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities and programs.” The proclamation could hardly be more upbeat in its praise of the Irish for “overcoming poverty and discrimination and inspiring Americans from all walks of life with their indomitable and entrepreneurial spirit.” Mr. Trump embraced these poor and despised foreigners as the forebears of “the more than 35 million Americans of Irish descent who contribute every day to all facets of life in the United States.” The Irish are at least as fond as anyone else of being told how great they are, but as an Irish person, I find this more than a little disconcerting. It is like having your chastity praised by a brothel keeper, or your temperance and thrift eulogized by a drunken sailor. The whole thing would be funny if it did not raise the most uncomfortable question: Is it right to applaud the legacy of mass immigration from Ireland because the Irish are white and Christian? The question is especially pertinent because so many of the people who have devised, defended and attempted to carry out Mr. Trump’s policy of identifying immigrant communities with criminality and terrorism are themselves Irish-Americans. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, announcing in January that his boss would continue the tradition of accepting a bowl of shamrock from the Irish prime minister on March 17, told reporters that the St. Patrick’s Day reception is “an issue that’s near and dear to me” because of his pride in his own Irish roots. Mr. Trump’s senior strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, boasts of his “blue-collar, Irish Catholic” family background. Kellyanne Conway (née Fitzpatrick) is half-Irish. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, who has the job of enforcing Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant policies, “is remembered fondly” in Massachusetts, according to The Boston Globe, “as an adventurous Irish Catholic son who reached the highest echelons of military service.” These are intelligent people, and it seems unlikely that they are so romantic as to imagine they’re descended from Irish kings and Celtic goddesses. Most probably, some of their ancestors were wretched people. The Irish Catholic immigrants who washed up in the United States after the potato famine of the 1840s were, on the whole, the most destitute national group ever to arrive on American shores. "

But a politician’s attitude toward food is often reflected in policies that affect us all. Michelle Obama often explicitly tied the Obama administration’s anti-childhood-obesity efforts to her own family’s eating habits: After a wake-up call from their daughters’ pediatrician, the Obamas shifted away from packaged convenience foods to healthier fare. After developing diabetes, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, gave up his beloved fried foods for a lean, less processed diet, lost 105 pounds and became a staunch proponent of anti-obesity measures in his state. While President Trump should be allowed to eat his ketchup-doused steak in peace, it would be negligent to completely overlook his eating habits, which include a heavy reliance on fast food. Given his ability to steer our food policies — including those relating to school food and other child nutrition programs — we have every right to peer a little more deeply into that bucket of KFC.

Lawyers and judges in other parts of the country, including Texas and Colorado, have also complained of immigration agents in courts. Officials have repeatedly expressed fear that seeing immigration agents in court will erode public trust in the judicial system and make undocumented immigrants less likely to comply with investigations or serve as witnesses. In Colorado, one prosecutor said she had already dropped several domestic violence charges after the victims said they would no longer go to court. Federal immigration agents generally comply with what is known as the sensitive location policy, avoiding schools, hospitals and places of worship. But courts are not considered sensitive locations, and federal officials have said they are increasingly moving to make arrests there because fewer local law enforcement agencies are working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain suspects so they can be picked up and processed for deportation. Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said, “While ICE does arrest targets at courthouses, generally it’s only after investigating officers have exhausted other options.” "
737,The False Feminism of ‘Fearless Girl’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/nyregion/fearless-girl-statue-manhattan.html?searchResultPosition=29,2017/03/16,NEW YORK,"From the moment that “Fearless Girl,” a bronze statue of a small child, landed in Lower Manhattan to face off against the 7,000-pound sculpture of a charging bull, installed in 1989 as a symbol of Wall Street resilience, there were reasons, it seemed, to feel queasy. Where, for instance, was her nanny? While others saw a narrative of female defiance — the girl’s torso thrusts forward as if she has a chance — I imagined a poorly paid caregiver fired for leaving her charge unattended, and ultimately trampled to death. The statue, created by an artist named Kristen Visbal previously known for a series of larger-than-life sculptures of college football coaches, is an exercise in corporate imaging. It was put in place on the eve of International Women’s Day, March 8, by the investment firm State Street Global Advisors to celebrate “the power of women in leadership,” a message the company delivered, we might note with some irony, absent the depiction of an actual woman. Corporate feminism operates with the singular goal of aiding and abetting a universe of mothers who tuck their daughters in at night whispering, “Someday, honey, you can lead the emerging markets and sovereign debt team at Citigroup, and then become a director at Yahoo.” The point of “Fearless Girl” was to advertise a State Street initiative pushing companies to include more women on their boards. Although the firm has said it is working to improve the number of female executives in its own ranks, it hasn’t been close to exemplary in this regard: Of its 28-person leadership team, only five are women, according to the company website. Is the root of this effort an organic wish to buoy the ambitions of confident little girls in high-tops? Not particularly. As the firm’s marketing materials clearly state, “research shows that companies with greater levels of gender diversity have had stronger financial performance” and “fewer governance-related issues such as bribery, corruption, shareholder battles and fraud.” With this assertion, we are returned to the era of temperance movements, when 19th-century women were enlisted as moral safeguards essentially for the purpose of propelling capitalism’s journey forward on the backs of a sober labor force, ensuring that rich industrialists got richer. Just as the theory has been floated that President Trump might have leaked his 2005 tax returns to deflect the country’s attention from the potential evisceration of the Affordable Care Act, it is worth considering the timing of State Street’s clarion call. In January, following an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Boston field office, the Justice Department announced that State Street Corporation, the parent company of State Street Global Advisors, had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government, consenting to pay more than $64 million to resolve fraud charges.

But Mr. Clement faced an uphill fight. “Your clients are not blameless in this affair,” Chief Justice Roberts said. “They don’t come here with clean hands.

Paul D. Ryan, the House Speaker, is fond of mentioning them. So is Tom Price, the secretary of Health and Human Services. They say the bill needs to be understood as part of a larger strategy of reforming the health care system, not a piece of legislation that, alone, can achieve their goals. Details about the second and third prongs of the strategy are still sketchy, but some ideas have begun to emerge. This week, Mr. Price and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sent a letter to governors welcoming them to submit applications to waive normal Medicaid rules, and add policies like work incentives and premiums. Such changes to regulations and standards are said to be Prong No. 2. As for Prong No. 3? Members of the House have said they will soon take up bills that deal with medical malpractice and antitrust protections. Here’s why the prongs are crucial to the effort to roll back Obamacare: Republicans have chosen to pass their health reform bill using a special budget procedure that limits the policy changes they can make. That means that many of their key policy promises made over the past few years — and even days — can’t be achieved in the bill. "
740,"Why the Whitney’s Humanist, Pro-Diversity Biennial Is a Revelation",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/arts/design/why-the-whitneys-humanist-pro-diversity-biennial-is-a-revelation.html?searchResultPosition=28,2017/03/16,ART & DESIGN,"Since moving downtown, the Whitney Museum of American Art has grown up, thanks to a larger, dashing new building, more ambitious exhibitions and new responsibilities brought by rising attendance and membership. No surprise, its biennial has grown up, too. Perhaps less expected: So has the art in it. This show’s strength and focus make it doubly important at a time when art, the humanities and the act of thinking itself seem under attack in Washington. The 2017 Biennial, the first held in the expansive Renzo Piano-designed structure on Gansevoort Street, is an adult affair: spatially gracious to art and visitors alike, and exceptionally good looking, with an overall mood of easy accessibility. My first thought: It needs a little more edge. Yet this show navigates the museum’s obligations to a broader public and its longtime art-world audience with remarkable success. Organized by Christopher Y. Lew, the Whitney’s associate curator, and Mia Locks, an independent curator, it has some immature inclusions and other letdowns. But once you really start looking, there’s edge all over the place. The show spotlights 63 artists and collectives working at the intersection of the formal and the social, and in this it announces a new chapter of so-called political art — though one already brewing in small museums, galleries and studios. Many of these artists confront such American realities as income inequality, homelessness, misogyny, immigration, violence, hatred and biases of race, religion and class. But they are equally committed to the artistic exploration of media and materials, and to the creation of bold and strange things to see and think about. Important messages are conveyed through perception. Take Henry Taylor’s gripping history painting of Philando Castile dying in the passenger seat of his car in a St. Paul suburb, having just been shot by a policeman whose gun, arm and uniform are visible through the car window. We are inside the car, in the driver’s seat, bearing witness with Diamond Reynolds, Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, as she live-streams his mortal injury on a cellphone. Mr. Castile, a school cafeteria manager, has the noble head of a Greek bronze, complete with a jawline beard and an eye whose flat whites the Greeks would have made from silver or alabaster inlay. His shirt is spattered with paint, not blood. Mr. Taylor’s style is harsh but it doesn’t overplay. Samara Golden’s “The Meat Grinder’s Iron Clothes” is a dystopian combination of mirrors and eight half-size miniature interiors — including some upside down — that create endless kaleidoscopic reflections of class conflict. Overlooking the Hudson River, it includes a drab office full of computer stations, an all-white aspirational Upper East Side living room and some merging of high-end hospital and prison featuring pink wheelchairs and filthy toilets. The melding of pleasure and horror it can elicit would have delighted Georges Bataille, the radical philosopher for whom “truth has only one face: that of a violent contradiction.” This Biennial follows the lead of Kerry James Marshall’s painting retrospective at the Met Breuer last fall, which set a high standard for social engagement sustained by formal ambition. This presentation is also an important bookend to the 1993 Biennial, a raucous, untidy show unforgettable for the real-life issues it threw in viewers’ faces — and for often overly didactic, hectoring and visually dry art. The current Biennial reflects the emergence of artists committed to political subject matter but unwilling to limit themselves artistically or to lecture viewers. Mr. Marshall, who presides here in absentia, has lots of company. "
741,Trump Is Not Above the Courts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/trump-is-not-above-the-courts.html?searchResultPosition=35,2017/03/16,OPINION,"CHICAGO — So much has happened during these early weeks of President Trump’s administration that it is easy to lose sight of the single event that may well have the most powerful and troubling impact on American democratic society. I speak of the administration’s startling assertion following its first travel ban, which was blocked by the courts, not merely that the president’s executive order limiting immigration from seven nations was constitutional, but that the president is actually immune from judicial review of the constitutionality of his action. The president’s lawyers explicitly made this argument before the Ninth Circuit, and the presidential counselor Stephen Miller has asserted that presidential power over immigration cannot be questioned. The constitutionality of the president’s bans on travel from parts of the Muslim world — the most recent one was blocked this week, by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland — gives rise to complex issues on which reasonable people can differ. But what is not in dispute is the ability of the judiciary to determine their constitutionality, free from control by the executive branch of government. Indeed, not only is such thinking largely inconsistent with over 200 years of established American constitutional practice, but it also ignores and undermines the genius of the Constitution’s framers, who saw the judiciary as perhaps the most important deterrent to tyrannical power. By “tyranny” the framers did not mean simply the abuse of power. Rather, it is the very accumulation of such power that they saw as the essence of tyranny, because once the power is accumulated, the harm has already taken place. The framers considered the Constitution to be the primary protector against authoritarianism. The document is framed in mandatory language and can be amended only by a complex process. Congress cannot simply enact a law repealing a provision of the Constitution. Rather, those who wish to amend it must go through an intentionally difficult process requiring substantial supermajoritarian majorities. The framers knew that throughout history republican governments ultimately degenerated into authoritarian regimes. To preserve democratic government in which those in power remain representative of and accountable to the populace, that government must be subject to the control of a countermajoritarian document — the Constitution. This describes the democratic paradox that underlies American constitutionalism: to preserve democracy, we must limit democracy. Once we understand the special role played by the Constitution in preserving democratic government, the role of the judiciary in enforcement of that document flows inescapably. Of the three branches of the federal government, only one is explicitly insulated from the dictates of democratic representation and political accountability: the judicial branch. Article III of the Constitution guarantees to federal judges life tenure (subject only to removal through the impeachment process) and protects their salaries from reduction. A nation that only a few years earlier had fought a revolution over the slogan “no taxation without representation” protected one of the three branches of its federal government against the check of political accountability. Why would the framers have done this? "
742,"Trump Digs In on Wiretap, No Matter Who Says Differently",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/richard-burr-mark-warner-trump-wiretap.html?searchResultPosition=26,2017/03/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The former president denied it. So did the former national intelligence director. The F.B.I. director has said privately that it is false. The speaker of the House and the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees — all three Republican — see no indications that it happened. But President Trump insists he is right. No matter how many officials, even in his own party, dismiss his unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama secretly tapped his phones last year, the White House made clear on Thursday that it would stand by the assertion. Ultimately, it insisted, the president will be proved correct. Nearly two weeks after Mr. Trump first accused his predecessor in a series of Saturday morning Twitter posts, the standoff between the president and the available record has come to shadow the White House even as it tries to overhaul the nation’s health care system and drastically rewrite the federal budget. Much like his longstanding assertion that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, Mr. Trump dismisses contrary information with undiminished surety. Indeed, the White House even added a new assertion on Thursday during a fiercely combative and sometimes surreal briefing by the press secretary, Sean Spicer, who berated reporters and read from news accounts that either did not back up the president’s claims or had been refuted by intelligence officials. One report that Mr. Spicer read contended that Mr. Obama used Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, the signals agency known as GCHQ, to spy on Mr. Trump. In effect, the White House was embracing a claim that the United States’ closest ally collaborated with a president against a presidential candidate. “There’s widespread reporting that throughout the 2016 election, there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people,” Mr. Spicer said. Asked if the president stood by his original allegation, Mr. Spicer said, “He stands by it.” "
743,Trump and G.O.P. Work to Win Repeal of Obama’s Health Act,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/health-care-repeal-affordable-care-act.html?searchResultPosition=46,2017/03/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and House Republican leaders worked Thursday to win conservative support for legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, offering concessions to speed cutbacks in Medicaid and dismantle more of President Barack Obama’s signature health law. But in a bid to ensure passage of the Republican health care bill in the House, White House and Republican leaders risked losing support in more moderate quarters of their party — not only in the narrowly divided Senate, but in an increasingly nervous House. A faster path to Medicaid cuts, new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and potentially smaller tax credits for the working poor could mollify conservatives who are pressing for a smaller government footprint on the health care system, but they would cut deeper into the benefits that many Trump voters have enjoyed under the Affordable Care Act. White House officials have made clear that they are open to supporting amendments that would require a quicker end to the expansion of Medicaid under the 2010 health care law, according to an administration official involved in negotiations with Congress. Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, and other conservatives want to freeze the expansion of Medicaid next year, two years earlier than under the legislation drafted by House Republican leaders. Referring to this change, Mr. Barton said, “The Trump administration is open to it.” But in an interview, Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said: “I am opposed to that. New Jersey expanded Medicaid. I don’t want that to be eliminated.” The federal government pays at least 90 percent of Medicaid costs for newly eligible beneficiaries, and Mr. Lance said, “I would like that to continue for at least several years.” "
744,Mr. Trump’s Tear-Down Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/mr-trumps-tear-down-budget.html?searchResultPosition=11,2017/03/16,OPINION,"The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, defended the president’s budget proposal for 2018 by saying it puts numbers on Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. That it does, but in so doing, it shows that many of those promises simply cannot be kept. As he pledged, Mr. Trump would spend heavily on the military and border security — but only, as it turns out, by spending far less in areas like education and infrastructure that he had once deemed important. This is, of course, very much a political document, full of bluster and preposterous cuts that Mr. Trump must know that Congress, including many Republicans, will not accept. But the spirit behind the “budget blueprint” is clear enough: With a few big exceptions, Mr. Trump is in full tear-down mode. He would cut the State Department by 29 percent, enfeebling diplomacy and international aid, while relying more on military might to protect national interests. He would cut the Department of Health and Human Services by 16 percent, undermining vital research by the National Institutes of Health. Smaller agencies that promote justice, arts and letters would be eliminated entirely, including the Legal Services Corporation, which finances legal aid groups; the National Endowment for the Arts; the National Endowment for the Humanities; and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The budget would raise spending in only three of 17 major categories — Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs — while slashing it in most of the rest. Hardest hit would be the Environmental Protection Agency, with a cut of 31 percent. These cuts would end climate change research — a global setback. They would eliminate money to carry out President Obama’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants — the centerpiece of his strategy to combat global warming. They also would disadvantage states that went for Mr. Trump. For Wisconsin and Michigan, for example, the budget would zero out initiatives to restore the Great Lakes. For Virginia, it would end restoration of Chesapeake Bay, whose watershed affects Pennsylvania also. Farm states, which largely supported Mr. Trump, would face a 21 percent reduction in the Department of Agriculture. Rural Americans would also be hurt by the elimination of federal aid to rural airports and reductions in subsidies for long-distance Amtrak services, while low-income Americans in general would see the end of $3 billion in block grants to states and localities for Meals on Wheels, housing aid and other community assistance.

745,"From a Placid Judge, a Cutting Rejection of Trump’s Travel Ban",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/hawaiian-judge-derrick-watson-trump-travel-ban.html?searchResultPosition=12,2017/03/16,U.S.,"Judge Derrick K. Watson’s language was stern, even biting: In an order on Wednesday that blocked President Trump’s travel ban from taking effect, he rebuked the government for its “illogic” and for presenting arguments he bluntly called “not true.” The sometimes cutting opinion drew applause on social media, as critics of Mr. Trump’s policy cheered on Judge Watson like a gladiator in the ring. To friends of the judge, that role would seem an unlikely one: He is known to them not as a feisty scrapper, but as a placid and patient colleague, an even-tempered former Army reservist and automobile aficionado who rarely gets riled up, except where baseball is concerned. “The only time he probably gets extremely emotional is with respect to the Dodgers,” said James A. Bruen, a San Francisco-based litigator who worked closely with Judge Watson at two law firms. Far from an attention seeker, Judge Watson eschewed the typical ceremony for his installation on the bench in 2013, telling The Honolulu Star-Advertiser, “It’s just not me.” Yet if Judge Watson, 50, is an uneasy temperamental match for his sudden role in history, there are elements in his career that appear to have put him, and his native Hawaii, on a kind of legal and political collision course with Mr. Trump.

Cuts, States Would Lose Help in Emergencies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/trump-environmental-protection-agency-budget-cuts.html?searchResultPosition=13,2017/03/16,CLIMATE,"WASHINGTON — Late one Friday night in 2014, Ohio’s environmental agency received word of a frightening test result from Toledo’s water supply: A toxic greenish substance had rendered the drinking water of half a million Toledo residents unsafe to drink. “Immediately we reached out to the Environmental Protection Agency,” said Craig Butler, the director of Ohio’s environmental agency. “Because of the scale of the problem, and the technical knowledge required, we needed their expertise.” State officials flew water samples from Toledo to an E.P.A. laboratory in Cincinnati, where staff scientists identified the substance as microcystin, a rare but toxic substance that is produced by algae blooms in water and causes liver damage in humans. The resources to respond to those emergencies, along with much of the other state-level work performed by the agency, would be eliminated or sharply reduced by President Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal 2018, which cuts the E.P.A. by 31 percent, more than any other agency. While the agency may be known for sweeping regulations to curb climate change, increase auto fuel efficiency or mandate smokestack controls, the agency’s bread and butter is more prosaic. The staff and scientists at its regional offices and laboratories across the country regularly respond to emergency calls from city and state officials: a December 2016 chemical leak from an asphalt plant into the water supply of Corpus Christi, Tex.; airborne drifts last summer in southern Missouri of dicamba, an herbicide that damages non-genetically modified crops; a 2014 fire at a perfume factory in Bridgeport, Conn., that spewed dangerous chemicals into the surrounding neighborhood. Funds to respond to many of those calls would no longer be available under Mr. Trump’s budget. He proposed lowering the agency’s $8.1 billion budget to $5.7 billion, and cutting 3,200 jobs from the its staff of 15,000. "

She’s a diplomatic neophyte representing an “America First” administration that seeks travel bans for refugees and mocked the United Nations. It is an awkward relationship. But as the White House stands poised to slash funding for the United Nations — how severely is still to be determined — it is a critical relationship for both the secretary general, António Guterres, and the United States ambassador, Nikki R. Haley. For Ms. Haley, an ambitious politician, the ambassadorship is an opportunity to burnish her foreign policy credentials. Mr. Guterres, a former politician himself, needs to fend off the decimation of his organization. For the last six weeks, the two diplomats have been dancing around each other delicately, she in her trademark pointy-heeled boots, he in avuncular brogues, both trying to leverage the other to get what they need. Ms. Haley, 45, a former governor of South Carolina, has a lot to gain. She is expected to have a long political career ahead of her, and being the envoy to the United Nations allows her to build on her limited foreign affairs experience. As the United States ambassador, she has enormous leverage over the United Nations, but she also appears to have some freedom to speak her mind. She has criticized Russia’s role in the Syrian conflict, using language that differed markedly from that of President Trump, who has adopted a more conciliatory stance toward Moscow. "

Ms. Erdrich, who has published 15 novels, won in an especially competitive year for high-profile literary fiction, with Michael Chabon, Ann Patchett, Zadie Smith and Adam Haslett among the finalists. “I’m among such dramatically wonderful novels that it didn’t seem that this was possible,” Ms. Erdrich said in her acceptance speech, before making a passionate plea about the importance of free expression and the need for writers and journalists to challenge falsehoods. “The truth is being assaulted not only in our country but all over the world,” she said. “More than ever, we have to look into the truth.” Like virtually every other cultural event these days, the NBCC awards ceremony at the New School on Thursday night frequently veered into pointed political commentary. The ceremony took place not long after President Trump revealed his first federal budget plan, which proposes eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, prompting outcries from PEN America and other writers’ groups. The novelist Yaa Gyasi, whose debut novel, “Homegoing,” won the John Leonard Prize for the best first book in any genre, thanked her parents for the sacrifices they made to bring her family to the United States from Ghana. “In a time where it feels like every day immigrants and refugees are being met with new affronts to their humanity, I am even more grateful,” she said.

Cohn is selling a significant holding in the world’s largest bank — which happens to be in China — as he clears potential conflicts of interest to serve in his new role. The stock that Mr. Cohn is selling is in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which with nearly $3.5 trillion in assets is the biggest on the planet, and it would be valued at about $16 million based on Thursday’s trading, according to details of his holdings in a set of documents issued by the Office of Government Ethics. The Chinese bank position appears to be the largest stock, private equity or hedge fund holding — apart from his shares in Goldman Sachs, where he was president — that Mr. Cohn will have to sell because of his new job. The timing of his initial purchase of the Industrial and Commercial Bank shares and of his planned sale are not clear. Neither Mr. Cohn, who is now the director of the National Economic Council advising President Trump, nor a White House spokeswoman responded to requests for comment. A Goldman spokesman referred questions to the White House. Mr. Cohn’s holding in the Chinese bank are notable because the Trump administration has portrayed China as a threat to American economic growth. Relations between the new administration and China are off to a bumpy start. Mr. Trump is set to meet with China's president, Xi Jinping, next month at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where issues like trade policy and disputed territorial rights in the South China Sea will most likely be on the table.

Spruill’s “Divided We Stand” (the story of the National Women’s Conference of 1977 and its aftermath), and Tressie McMillan Cottom’s “Lower Ed” (a deep dive into students who attend for-profit colleges). Iconic buildings don’t just spring up either, as Wendy Lesser’s engaging biography of the architect Louis Kahn makes clear. Philosophy takes time too: in the 35 years’ worth of essays and fragments that make up “Other People: Takes and Mistakes,” David Shields establishes himself as a funny, vulnerable and humane 21st-century Socrates. Had it with gravity? Head for outer space: via Jaroslav Kalfar’s debut novel, “Spaceman of Bohemia” (for adventurous adults) and Jon Agee’s picture book “Life on Mars” (for adventurous kids). Radhika Jones
Editorial Director, Books SOUTH AND WEST: From a Notebook, by Joan Didion. Foreword by Nathaniel Rich. (Alfred A. Knopf. $21.) Didion’s latest is two excerpts from her notebooks, written in the 1970s: a short meditation on California and a more substantial piece about traveling through the Deep South for a month with her husband, John Gregory Dunne. Our critic Michiko Kakutani said: “At a remove of more than four decades, she maps the divisions splintering America today, and uncannily anticipates some of the dynamics that led to the election of Donald J. Trump.” YOU SAY TO BRICK: The Life of Louis Kahn, by Wendy Lesser. (Farrar, Straus and Giroux. $30.) This biography covers the best-known works of the architect Louis Kahn — including the National Assembly Building of Bangladesh and the Phillips Exeter Library, in New Hampshire — and his complicated personal life as well (he essentially presided over three families at once). It is not the first biography of Kahn, but our critic Dwight Garner said it is “notable for its warm, engaged, literate tone and its psychological acuity.” SPACEMAN OF BOHEMIA, by Jaroslav Kalfar. (Little, Brown and Company. $26.) In this debut novel, a Czech astronaut is sent to investigate a mysterious cloud of dust that has swept in from a neighboring galaxy. While in orbit he meets a giant spider that has ready access to his unconscious. Our critic Jennifer Senior said it’s “not a perfect first effort,” but “a frenetically imaginative one, booming with vitality and originality.” DIVIDED WE STAND: The Battle Over Women’s Rights and Family Values That Polarized American Politics, by Marjorie J. Spruill. (Bloomsbury, $33.) The National Women’s Conference in 1977 was a high-water mark of political feminism and a turning point — but not for the reasons the organizers had hoped. A small but savvy coalition of foot soldiers led by Phyllis Schlafly mobilized against the Houston conference’s aims, and their successors reshaped gender politics and party lines in America. Spruill, a historian at the University of South Carolina, tells the timely story of four days that inspired a socially conservative backlash. HARMLESS LIKE YOU, by Rowan Hisayo Buchanan. (Norton, $24.95.) In Buchanan’s lyrical first novel, Yuki, a sensitive and lonely teenager, has persuaded her parents to let her remain in New York to pursue a career as an artist when they return to Japan. The first of the novel’s two alternating strands follows Yuki’s artistic education through the bohemian romance of New York City in the 1960s and ’70s. The second, set in the present, is narrated by her adult son, Jay, who was 2 years old when Yuki left him and his father and moved to Berlin to devote herself to her work. "

Some wear red, stay warm in gloves adorned with the maple leaf, or carry a provincial flag. Canada is having a rare moment on Broadway — “Come From Away,” a musical written by a married Canadian couple, set in Newfoundland and celebrating Canadian decency, has just opened at the Schoenfeld Theater. The show was already drawing an unusually high number of Canadian ticket-buyers, and an extraordinary amount of Canadian media attention, even before this week, when it hit the apotheosis of Canadianness: The country’s charismatic and popular prime minister, Justin Trudeau, attended with a group of 600 allies and diplomats. And now the show has turned unexpectedly into a form of Canadian soft power: an expression of Canadian ideals, seemingly at odds with those of the new American administration, on stage nightly in the heart of New York City. On Wednesday night, Mr. Trudeau sat side-by-side with Ivanka Trump, the American president’s daughter and close adviser, as the 100-minute musical celebrated the welcome extended by residents of Gander, a small town in Newfoundland, to thousands of air travelers diverted during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The show is packed with distinctive local details; one scene, inevitably, is set in the ubiquitous doughnut chain Tim Hortons. The timing was rich: As Ms. Trump, joined by Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and Mr. Trudeau, accompanied by his wife, Sophie, watched an artistic tribute to the virtues of embracing foreigners, President Trump was proposing to eliminate federal funding of the arts and to ban travel from parts of the Muslim world.

But it certainly earned her a lot of viewers. More than 4 million people tuned in on Tuesday to watch Ms. Maddow’s report on MSNBC, the biggest audience in her show’s nine years on the air. It was the third-ranked show across all of television at 9 p.m., beating the broadcast networks ABC and Fox. Ms. Maddow drew 1.1 million more viewers than her Fox News rival, Tucker Carlson, who typically dominates the 9 p.m. time slot. And excluding major events like elections, conventions and debates, her program on Tuesday was the second-highest rated show ever to air on MSNBC, the network said, narrowly missing a Keith Olbermann episode in October 2008. The ratings may have been stellar, but the response was anything but. Since the report aired, Ms. Maddow’s approach — dragging out the revelation for more than 20 minutes, past the first commercial break — has been mocked by the late-night host Stephen Colbert and criticized as overly dramatic by political reporters. In the end, what Ms. Maddow revealed was less than scandalous: two pages of a single federal tax return from 2005, in which Mr. Trump paid a 25 percent effective tax rate totaling $38 million. But the vast audience she attracted, after teasing viewers with a vague post on Twitter about 90 minutes before airtime, points to a large interest in Mr. Trump’s tax records, which the president has declined to make public. And Ms. Maddow seemed to strike a nerve at the White House. The president’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, denounced the report as “despicable and reprehensible.” Mr. Trump, in an interview with Fox’s Mr. Carlson on Wednesday, dismissed the journalist who obtained the tax forms, David Cay Johnston, as “not much.” MSNBC’s audience on Tuesday peaked between 9:15 and 9:30 p.m., around the time Ms. Maddow was informing viewers of Mr. Trump’s tax payment. Viewership dipped slightly after that, but enough viewers stuck around to boost MSNBC’s 10 p.m. host, Lawrence O’Donnell, to a rare victory over Sean Hannity on Fox News, according to Nielsen figures. As for Mr. Carlson’s interview with Mr. Trump on Wednesday, cable-news ratings for that evening were not yet available on Thursday. Viewership figures in the television industry have been delayed this week because of an electrical problem at a Nielsen company facility near Tampa, Fla. "

A group of 27 former associates from the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell sent a letter on Thursday to Walter J. Clayton, who is known as Jay, a Sullivan & Cromwell partner and President Trump’s nominee to become chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the letter, the group urge Mr. Clayton, whose Senate confirmation hearings are set for next week, to publicly denounce Mr. Trump’s proposed travel ban. The former Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers ask that Mr. Clayton speak out during his confirmation hearings and stand up for the legal profession by “unequivocally opposing” the president’s executive orders and “the unlawful, cruel and shameful actions of this administration.” Mr. Trump has issued two such orders, the first of which suspended entry to the United States by individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, and the second removing Iraqi nationals from the list. Mr. Clayton is a longtime partner Sullivan & Cromwell, which is known for its representation of Goldman Sachs and major financial firms.

754,‘I’d Be Hurt and Upset’: Cities Fear Trump’s Cuts to Urban Programs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/budget-cuts-inner-city-programs-trump.html?searchResultPosition=21,2017/03/16,POLITICS,"BALTIMORE — In a dimly lit church basement, James Gaymon III spent much of Thursday staring at practice questions as he prepared for his high school general equivalency diploma exam. He recently moved into an apartment two blocks from the underpass where he spent 20 years sleeping, and often smoking crack. Now Mr. Gaymon is sober and taking classes at an adult learning center run by Strong City Baltimore, a nonprofit that operates with federal funds from the Community Development Block Grant program — which President Trump’s budget for fiscal 2018 would eliminate. “I’d be hurt and upset if this place was gone, and this program wasn’t here anymore,” said Mr. Gaymon, 49. “I need it. I need my education. I want my G.E.D. But I’ll leave it in the hands of God.” Mr. Gaymon’s worries echoed across the country’s urban centers on Thursday as city leaders, nonprofits and poverty experts lamented Mr. Trump’s proposed budget, which would make drastic cuts to programs aimed at helping the country’s inner cities and some of its most vulnerable populations. Mr. Trump spent months on the campaign trail promising to fix “broken” inner cities, appealing to African-Americans with the question, “What do you have to lose?” In terms of money, the answer turns out to be: plenty. Mr. Trump would cut the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development by 13 percent and eliminate programs like the Community Development Block Grant, which cities have used to fund programs like Meals on Wheels as well as homeless shelters and neighborhood revitalization initiatives.

755,A Dent in Europe’s Populism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/a-dent-in-europes-populism.html?searchResultPosition=22,2017/03/16,OPINION,"Bucking fears that the Netherlands would be the next populist domino after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump’s election in the United States, the Dutch turned out in record numbers on Wednesday to reject the anti-Muslim platform of the far-right candidate Geert Wilders. The Dutch election was seen as a potential bellwether for elections in France and Germany, where far-right populist parties have gained ground. But it is premature to assume the Dutch result signals the defeat of far-right populism in Europe. The Dutch parliamentary election was a highly fractured affair, with 28 parties competing for 150 seats. It takes 76 seats to form a government. Though the final result will not be announced until Tuesday, with most of the votes already counted, Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy won with 33 seats. Mr. Rutte will have to seek — as is the usual case in the Netherlands — partners to form a coalition government, which could take weeks or even months. Mr. Rutte is likely to turn to the conservative Christian Democratic Appeal party and the center-left, pro-European Democrats 66 party, each of which won 19 seats. Even if those parties joined his coalition, he would still need at least one more party to reach 76 seats. That party could be the left-leaning, pro-European Greens, which increased their seats to 14 from just four. But, however the horse trading goes, the Netherlands looks set to form a staunchly pro-European government. That idea has cheered European leaders. On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, which will hold its election in September, said she “was very happy that a high turnout led to a very pro-European result, a clear signal.” President François Hollande of France hailed a “clear victory against extremism.” Still, it would be a mistake to assume the Dutch vote will translate into a defeat for Marine Le Pen and her far-right National Front party in France. While polls indicate the En Marche! candidate Emmanuel Macron will beat Ms. Le Pen in a second round of voting on May 7, polls have had a sorry track record in populist-fueled elections. They predicted a far stronger showing by Mr. Wilders, and missed the Brexit and Trump victories. Despite his defeat, Mr. Wilders’s Party for Freedom did come in second with 20 seats, and he remains a powerful far-right provocateur. “Rutte has not seen the last of me yet!” Mr. Wilders wrote on Twitter. Nor would a defeat for Ms. Le Pen in May put an end to her movement. The Dutch vote is encouraging, but the threat of far-right populism in Europe continues. "
756,Scientists Bristle at Trump Budget’s Cuts to Research,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/climate/trump-budget-science-research.html?searchResultPosition=23,2017/03/16,CLIMATE,"Before he became president, Donald J. Trump called climate change a hoax, questioned the safety of vaccines and mocked renewable energy as a plaything of “tree-huggers.” So perhaps it is no surprise that Mr. Trump’s first budget took direct aim at basic scientific and medical research. Still, the extent of the cuts in the proposed budget unveiled early Thursday shocked scientists, researchers and program administrators. The reductions include $5.8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health, which fund thousands of researchers working on cancer and other diseases, and $900 million, or a little less than 20 percent, from the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, which funds the national laboratories, considered among the crown jewels of basic research in the world. The White House is also proposing to eliminate climate science programs throughout the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency. “As to climate change, I think the president was fairly straightforward: We’re not spending money on that anymore,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said at a White House briefing on Thursday. “We consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that.” While the budget is only a blueprint and is sure to face strong opposition from members of both parties in Congress — many lawmakers have already said that certain cuts, like those to the N.I.H., are nonstarters — policy makers expressed concern about what the proposal says about the administration’s commitment to science.

As with so many of these scattershot acts of resistance, the call to reserve tickets and leave the seats unoccupied seemed pointless for a first-come-first-served event issuing unlimited tickets. I made my reservations anyway on the off chance I was wrong. Then I thought, “I should just go.” Not as a protester — megaphone-to-megaphone combat is a fine American tradition, but it’s not a great fit for someone who likes pretty much everybody. Most Tennesseans might consider me a Yellow Dog Democrat, but President Trump’s people are my people — the people I come from, the people I live among. I believe my people elected the greatest threat to American democracy since the Third Reich, but I haven’t been able to work up a real us-versus-them way of thinking about my own friends and family. The president was scheduled to speak at 6:30 p.m., but when I got down to the Municipal Auditorium at noon, the line of people waiting to get in stretched all the way around the building — twice — before crossing the street and continuing farther than I could see. “Wow, what time did you get here?” I said to a guy near the front of the line. He’d been standing there since before dawn, on a day when it was 23 degrees outside. A few steps down the line, a Trump supporter named Megan Taylor was dressed in jeans and a “Make America Great Again” hoodie with sleeves made of American flags — and dozens of Trump buttons: “Hot Chicks for Trump,” “Girls Just Wanna Have Guns,” “Basket of Deplorables Member.” “I feel like I’m at the fair!” Ms. Taylor said, turning to show me a button the size of a salad plate: “Trump 2016 — Finally Someone With Balls.” "

Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump has produced an “America First” fiscal plan that is not even earning much praise from his own allies in Congress. His $1.1 trillion spending plan does not reduce the deficit. It sharply increases military spending while cutting the budgets of federal agencies and programs, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. It is a gamble for a politician whose supporters include low-income workers who rely on many of the programs he proposes to reduce, including grants that feed hungry children and help local law enforcement. “This will be a heavy lift for the House, and for the Senate, a lot of this will be nonstarters,” said former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who chaired the Budget Committee. Here are the winners and losers in the budget, broken down by agency. "
759,Edge or Liability? White House Ties May Cut Two Ways for Goldman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-white-house-relationship.html?searchResultPosition=18,2017/03/16,DEALBOOK,"During a recent meeting with stock analysts to discuss a huge loss, the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland sought to inject some levity. “I have a question online from the White House — sorry, sorry, Goldman Sachs,” said Howard Davies, to the sound of guffaws from the audience. The chairman, who was fielding a variety of questions that day from analysts from Goldman and other financial firms, then read out the Goldman inquiry about returns on capital. Jokes like that are commonplace in these first 100 days of the Trump administration. Stacked with former Goldman employees and embracing business-friendly policies, President Trump’s White House would appear to give Goldman a unique and influential edge. Already, Mr. Trump’s proposals to cut corporate taxes and reduce regulation — which would benefit Wall Street broadly — have lifted the stock prices of Goldman and other banks. Shares of Goldman are up more than 36 percent since the election. Yet the Trump connection may actually be more of a liability, people close to the firm contend. That’s because of differences over both style and substance, as well as the constant scrutiny a company naturally falls under when five of its former executives are named to prominent government positions. Other big financial institutions, including the money manager Fidelity and the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, can claim only one former executive apiece among those put forward for major staff or secretary roles in the Trump administration.

This history, it seems, does not afford lifetime privileges. After addressing the room briefly, amid the group’s push to oppose the Republican health care bill endorsed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Mulvaney was interrupted, respectfully, by the caucus’s chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina. “Mark said, ‘Look, Mick, we’re going to ask you to step out because we know your loyalties are different now than they were,’” recalled Mr. Mulvaney, a South Carolina congressman from 2011 until his confirmation last month. “And I said, ‘Mark, you’re absolutely right.’” He left without complaint. As Mr. Trump unveils his budget plans this week — against the backdrop of a health care bill that Mr. Mulvaney’s former colleagues detest — the man charged with executing the White House’s fiscal vision is a figure who, not very long ago, might well have been leading the opposition to much of it. While Mr. Mulvaney’s first budget does call for some of the deepest cuts to domestic programs in decades, in many ways his fiscal philosophy appears at odds with that of the president. Mr. Mulvaney has long railed against runaway military spending; Mr. Trump wants a huge increase. He has favored drastic changes to Medicare and lifting the eligibility age for Social Security, placing him at odds with Mr. Trump, who has pledged to protect those entitlement programs. "

Like many universities across the country, the Oregon university is getting fewer international applications. Nearly 40 percent of colleges are reporting overall declines in applications from international students, according to a survey of 250 college and universities, released this week by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.

But it has been percolating for years. It started before this married couple even started dating, when, as writers on “A Different World,” they bumped into each other as each sought solace, after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, at the First A.M.E. Church of Los Angeles. More than two decades later, when their son was distraught over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, Mr. Bythewood showed him a documentary about an even older injustice, the lynching of Emmett Till. “We started feeling like, as artists, we don’t want to always be on the sidelines,” Mr. Bythewood said. “We felt the need to do something like this.” Originally conceived as a feature film, “Shots Fired” became a 10-episode TV series when Fox asked Ms. Prince-Bythewood (“Beyond the Lights”) to create a show about such themes in the wake of the 2014 killing of Michael Brown and resultant demonstrations in Ferguson, Mo. “Because of the reach of network television, we could put this out into the world in a big way,” she said. Sanaa Lathan and Stephan James star as Department of Justice officials unraveling twin mysteries in a North Carolina town. One surrounds a high-profile police shooting, which inverts the typical dynamic by having a black officer, played by Tristan Wilds, shoot an unarmed white man. The other involves a separate, but possibly related, murder of an African-American boy. (Other stars include Helen Hunt, Richard Dreyfuss and Aisha Hinds.) "
763,The Dutch Election Shows How Not to Defeat Populism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/geert-wilders-dutch-election-shows-how-not-to-defeat-populism.html?searchResultPosition=70,2017/03/16,OPINION,"The parliamentary election in the Netherlands on Wednesday was predicted to be the next populist show of strength after the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump’s election. The Dutch would be the first of a number of European countries to succumb to the right-wing populists’ siren songs in 2017, with the French not far behind. It didn’t work out that way. Geert Wilders, who is all too often described as a bleach blond or referred to as “the Dutch Trump,” did not defeat the conservative prime minister, Mark Rutte. In fact, he didn’t come close. With more than 95 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Rutte’s People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, or V.V.D., came first with 21.2 percent of the vote, compared to Mr. Wilders’s Party for Freedom, which took only 13.1 percent. Mr. Wilders barely improved on his margin in the 2012 election (where he took 10.1 percent) and failed to do as well as he did in 2010 (where he got 15.5 percent of the vote). The real story in Dutch politics isn’t Mr. Wilders’s rise, it is the unprecedented fragmentation of the political system. Together, Mr. Rutte’s and Mr. Wilders’s parties look set to make up only 33 percent of the Parliament, with 11 more political parties constituting the rest. This splintering of Dutch politics is making effective governance of the country increasingly impossible. While previous Parliaments have counted 14 or more factions, what has changed is the relative size of the parties. In 1986, the top three parties together won 85 percent of the vote. In 2003, it was down to 74 percent. Today it is just around 45 percent. Because of its proportional representation system of voting, the Netherlands is an extreme case. But the trends are similar across Western Europe: The main center-right and center-left parties are shrinking, smaller parties are growing and unstable coalition politics are becoming the norm. There are many reasons for this — from secularization to deindustrialization to the emergence of new political issues, like the environment or immigration. "

Stephen FitzGerald, Australia’s first ambassador to China, delivered a speech on Thursday that will only amplify that debate, arguing that the world had reached the end of an era defined by European and American leadership. He called on Australia to make China its primary focus of diplomacy and economic policy and to “implant in our education the study of China and Chinese.” “We are living in a Chinese world,” he said. “But we don’t have a relationship to match it.” Dr. FitzGerald’s comments — delivered as part of a popular lecture series known as the Gough Whitlam Oration, named after the prime minister who sent Dr. FitzGerald to China in 1973 — reflect a view that has been gaining momentum in Australia for years, but especially so since Mr. Trump’s victory. After decades of Australia sidling up to the United States, sharing intelligence and fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, many Australians in the foreign policy and economic establishment are now questioning what some have come to describe as a complacent favoritism for American priorities in the region. Dr. FitzGerald, an esteemed figure in Australia whose comments on China are always closely parsed, seemed especially eager to seize on Mr. Trump’s rise to argue for a shift in focus. In his remarks, at Western Sydney University, he said that Mr. Trump both threatened the old order and provided “a moment of opportunity” in which Australia could become more independent of Washington and develop the kinds of ties to Beijing that would allow Australia to moderate China’s behavior in the region. He did not hold back on what he hoped Australia could affect: Dr. FitzGerald explicitly criticized China’s anti-democratic tendencies, calling out the way it seeks to influence Australian politics through investments and campaign contributions. He also condemned China’s efforts to control information and opinions within Australia’s Chinese community. "

Here’s what Mr. Colbert and his counterparts had to say about the tax-return reveal: Ms. Maddow herself appeared on “The Tonight Show,” where the ever-amiable Jimmy Fallon didn’t press her much on the bathos of her broadcast. She did disclose that the Trump administration refused to verify the tax return until hours before airtime Tuesday and that her team had taped an entirely different show, in case the White House proved the document to be a forgery at the last moment.

Legal experts fear the move will set back human rights in Mexico by decades. The tool is an innocuous-sounding bill, submitted last month by a close ally of President Enrique Peña Nieto — only a day after his government publicly chided the Trump administration to respect the rights of all Mexicans. The governing party says the bill, labeled a reform to the criminal code, will make “adjustments” to Mexico’s new legal system, a linchpin of cooperation with the United States that was completed last year with more than $300 million in American aid. It is widely considered Mexico’s most important legal advancement in the past century. But while the American-backed legal system is supposed to enshrine human rights in a nation desperately lacking them, this new bill heads squarely in the other direction. Legal scholars say it will broaden the power of the Mexican government to detain suspects for years before trial, enable the police to rely on hearsay in court and potentially allow prosecutors to use evidence obtained by torture. Beyond that, the bill, which has not yet been approved by Congress, flips the very premise of modern justice on its head: Rather than innocent before proved guilty, it would require concrete evidence of reasonable doubt, essentially shifting the burden of proof to the accused. “It is not only a counter reform, but it has reforms that contravene the right to a proper defense,” said Alejandra Ramos, a judge in the state of Chihuahua. “They want to pass this because it is easier to do than to train police officers and prosecutors, clean up the entire system and break the use of torture as the main tool of investigation.” "

The proposal, which includes a $2 billion down payment on Mr. Trump’s signature border wall, is one of the single largest investments in the president’s budget plan. Yet experts say it appears only to scratch the surface of what Mr. Trump has pledged, and highlights the difficulty of translating campaign promises into a workable, governing reality. “It’s easy to promise things until you have to pay for them,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security. “It is certainly an attempt to begin to carry out what he promised.” Mr. Trump is proposing to pay for his border security plan by marshaling savings from across the federal government. To what extent it is ultimately funded will depend in large part on Congress, which makes spending decisions based on the president’s proposals. Democrats have pledged to fight tooth and nail against the wall and stepped-up immigration enforcement. That means that funding is likely to come down to how much political capital the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill is willing to spend on a project they have tried to downplay, despite Mr. Trump’s urgings. The changes will not come cheaply. If funded, Mr. Trump’s plan would spend billions of dollars on the design and construction of the wall. It would also prompt a hiring spree in the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to step up enforcement and the deportation of people who are in the United States illegally. Programs and agencies of all sizes from across the federal government would face cuts to pay for the plan. "

Gorsuch prepares for his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, liberal groups are promising a furious fight that they say will rival the most memorable clashes over candidates to the nation’s highest court. Here is a look at some other major confirmations fights — and how they turned out. President George Bush’s nomination in 1991 of Judge Thomas at first seemed to go smoothly. Some doubted Mr. Bush’s claim that race had not figured in his decision to name a second black justice to take the place of the first one, Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights hero. There were also questions about Mr. Bush’s claim that Judge Thomas, 43, was the best qualified candidate. But the nomination did not run into serious trouble until journalists disclosed that Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, had submitted a confidential sworn statement accusing Judge Thomas of sexual harassment. Judge Thomas issued vehement denials. “This is a circus,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “It’s a national disgrace. And from my standpoint, as a black American, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.” The confirmation hearings riveted the nation but did not resolve the protagonists’ conflicting accounts. The Senate voted to confirm Justice Thomas by a vote of 52 to 48, the narrowest margin in more than a century. "

Candidate Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-campaign.html?searchResultPosition=76,2017/03/16,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Rarely do a presidential candidate’s own words so definitively haunt his presidency. For the second time in two months, two federal judges on Wednesday refused to allow President Trump to impose a travel ban, citing his campaign rhetoric as evidence of an improper desire to prevent Muslims from entering the United States. The judges’ stunning rebukes were a vivid example of how Mr. Trump’s angry, often xenophobic rallying cries during the campaign — which were so effective in helping to get him elected — have become legal and political liabilities now that he is in the Oval Office. It is a lesson that presidents usually learn quickly: Difficult and controversial issues can easily be painted as black-and-white during a long campaign, but they are often more complicated for those who are in a position to govern. That is especially true for Mr. Trump’s bellicose remarks about immigrants, which animated his upstart presidential campaign but now threaten to get in the way of his broader agenda for a health care overhaul, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It all seemed so simple before. Five days after terrorists in California killed 14 people in December 2015, Mr. Trump whipped up his supporters at a rally by vowing to impose a complete ban on entry by Muslims “until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.” "

As an Iraqi living in Jordan he had trouble finding steady work. In 2010, he traveled to Iraq for the first and only time to renew his passport, and wound up in jail. When he returned, he applied for U.N. refugee status and came to the United States in 2012. Now a United States green card holder, he married his Jordanian girlfriend, Kholoud Sammour, on a trip back to Amman in 2014. Soon afterward, he petitioned the United States government to allow her to live with him in Louisville, Ky. While the visa application was pending, Mohammed visited Kholoud; the couple soon had a baby, Lilav, who is now 5 months old. Like her father, Lilav holds Iraqi citizenship, although she’s never been to that country in her short life. "

In 2016, 95.8 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs were male and so were 348 of the Forbes 400. Of the 260 people on the Forbes list described as “self-made,” 250 were men. Wealth — and the ability to generate more wealth — must still be considered a reliable proxy for power. But at the other end of the scale, men of all races and ethnicities are dropping out of the work force, abusing opioids and falling behind women in both college attendance and graduation rates. Since 2000, wage inequality has grown more among men than among women, as the accompanying chart from the Economic Policy Institute shows. A study by the Dallas Federal Reserve published in 2014, “Middle-Skill Jobs Lost in U.S. Labor Market Polarization,” found that: From 1979 to 2007, seven percent of men and 16 percent of women with middle-skill jobs lost their positions, according to the Dallas Fed study. Four percent of these men moved to low-skill work, and 3 percent moved to high-skill jobs. Almost all the women, 15 percent, moved into high-skill jobs, with only 1 percent moving to low-skill work. Men whose childhood years were marked by family disruption seem to fare the worst.

Gorsuch. I offered my own advice in the days immediately following Judge Gorsuch’s nomination: Senators should ask how he would have decided Supreme Court cases from the past. Don’t accept the standard nominee response that “I can’t answer because that question might come before the court.” It has already come before the court. (This suggestion is based on a 2006 article by two Yale law professors, Robert Post and Reva Siegel.) As it happened, the Supreme Court promptly obliged a few weeks later by serving up a perfect specimen for an experiment on whether the modern confirmation process has any utility left: whether it can actually succeed in eliciting a nominee’s views. Buck v. Davis, issued on Feb. 22, was a death penalty case, although the question before the court was nowhere near as straightforward as whether a Texas death-row inmate named Duane Buck should live or die. Rather, the case lay deep in the weeds of state and federal habeas corpus — a “labyrinth,” as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. put it in his majority opinion, which ordered a federal appeals court to consider the inmate’s appeal, “where it has wandered for the better part of two decades.” The contorted procedural status of the case may account for the fact that even as a rare Supreme Court victory for a death-row inmate, the decision received relatively little attention. Further, the facts were as unusual as they were disturbing, with the majority insisting that it was making no new law and the dissenters taking pains to point out that the decision was unlikely to affect anyone but Mr. Buck. In other words, the perfect case for a question to Judge Gorsuch, who now sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver. Texas law at the time of Mr. Buck’s sentencing in 1995 made a prediction of “future dangerousness” a necessary predicate for a death sentence. Evidently incited by a romantic breakup, he had gone on a murderous rampage, shooting his former girlfriend to death in front of her children, killing a male friend of hers and wounding his stepsister. Part of the defense argument against a death sentence was that a romantic entanglement of the sort that precipitated Mr. Buck’s crime wouldn’t happen again because he would be serving a life sentence in prison. But then the defense lawyer called as a witness a psychologist, Walter Quijano, whom the judge had appointed to evaluate Mr. Buck and numerous other defendants facing a potential death sentence. Dr. Quijano had reported that while on the facts of the case Mr. Buck was not likely to be violent in the future, his race, black, meant an “increased probability” because “there is an overrepresentation of blacks among the violent offenders.” Mr. Buck’s lawyer had read the report but called Dr. Quijano to testify anyway. While Mr. Buck was unlikely to be violent, the psychologist told the sentencing jury, race was nonetheless a factor “known to predict future dangerousness.” The prosecution reiterated this testimony at the close of its argument. The jury obliged by returning a death sentence. "

He is not honest. He is not a brilliant deal maker. He is not even competent. His entire life, Trump has sold shimmer and called it silver. It was and is all an illusion, a brand built on selling banality with braggadocio. He shaped vapors into dreams and delivered them to those hungry for a taste of the showy, hollow form of the high life he came to represent. He was successful at exploiting those with an ostentatious appetite for the air of success. Trump’s life story is a pyramid scheme of ambitions. He took that history to a people struggling through a drought of opportunity and he exploited their weaknesses: a shrinking sense of economic security and growing nativist tendencies. But Trump doesn’t speak so much from facts as from feelings. For him, the truth is malleable and a lie is valuable. He creates his own reality rather than living in the reality of others. Deception is just a tool; betrayal is just an inconvenience. Now even some of the people who once supported him with vigor are being forced to remove the scales from their eyes. They are now the betrayed disciples of a false prophet. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence of connections and contacts between the Trump team and Russia, a country that proof-positive interfered in our election in an effort to help Trump and hurt his opponent.

774,Preventing a Free-for-All With Drone Strikes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/preventing-a-free-for-all-with-drone-strikes.html?searchResultPosition=81,2017/03/16,OPINION,"For nearly a decade, drone strikes have been central to America’s counterterrorism policy. Operated from remote locations, the small aircraft can hover over targets for long periods of time and kill extremists with precision without risking American casualties. President Barack Obama found drones so effective and useful that over two terms, he approved 542 strikes that killed 3,797 people in non-battlefield areas where American forces were not directly engaged, including Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. But this seductive tool of modern warfare has a dark side. Seemingly bloodless and distant, drone strikes can tempt presidents and military commanders to inflict grave damage without sufficient forethought, violating sovereign rights and killing innocent civilians. Civilian deaths during Mr. Obama’s tenure undermined American counterterrorism operations and became a recruiting tool for more extremists. Mr. Obama was persuaded to impose sensible constraints on the use of drone strikes between 2013 and 2016. The White House would decide which individuals outside of the traditional war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan could be targeted, and there had to be “near certainty” that no civilians would be killed. In traditional war zones, military commanders make these decisions without interagency review, and the threshold for acceptable civilian casualties is less strict. Now comes disturbing news: President Trump and his administration are moving to dilute or circumvent the Obama rules. This could have disastrous outcomes, not least because Mr. Trump seems even more enticed by drone warfare than Mr. Obama was. In the days since his inauguration, the tempo of airstrikes has increased significantly. Mr. Trump has already granted a Pentagon request to declare parts of three provinces in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is fighting Iranian-backed Houthis rebels, to be an “area of active hostilities.” This, The Times has reported, would enable more permissive battlefield rules to apply. The president is also expected to soon approve a Pentagon proposal to do the same for parts of Somalia, where militants of the Shabab who are linked to Al Qaeda threaten regional stability. Both designations are supposed to be temporary, giving the administration time to decide whether to rescind or relax the Obama rules more broadly. "

There are no similar anecdotes for Donald Trump, although we are looking into a rumor he once sat with an aide in business class. Quick question: What kind of tree nickname should Donald Trump have? A) Old Slippery Elm B) Old Gopherwood C) Old Hackberry D) Old Ornamental Dogwood The visit was part of Trump’s ongoing effort to present himself as Hickory’s outsider soul brother. Two instinctive friends of the common man, only one of whom has been repeatedly charged with stiffing his contractors. “It was during the Revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite. Does that sound familiar?” the president asked a crowd of visitors as he stood in front of Jackson’s house, the Hermitage. During the Revolution, while Jackson was a teenager, he served as a messenger for the rebels, was captured by the British, spent time in a prison camp, lost two brothers and his mother. The kinship here would be … that military-themed boarding school? "

Tillerson, the American secretary of state, began his first major foreign trip in Japan and said on Thursday that the United States needed a “different approach” to North Korea’s escalating nuclear threat, though he declined to give specifics. Speaking to reporters in Tokyo after talks with Japan’s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, Mr. Tillerson said, “The diplomatic and other efforts of the past 20 years to bring North Korea to a point of denuclearization have failed,” noting that during those 20 years, the United States had provided $1.35 billion in assistance to North Korea to encourage it to abandon its nuclear program. “Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,” Mr. Tillerson added, saying he would highlight the issue in Seoul, the South Korean capital, and Beijing, the next stops on his trip. On the eve of President Trump’s sending a federal budget to Congress that proposes a 29 percent cut in the State Department’s budget, Mr. Tillerson, who took questions only from reporters who had been preselected by one of his press advisers, said he would take on the challenge of the cutbacks “willingly.” “The level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking, particularly in the past year, is simply not sustainable,” Mr. Tillerson said, explaining that current spending reflected the “level of conflicts that the U.S. has been engaged in around the world as well as disaster assistance.” He said the department would undergo a review of programs and would “be much more effective, much more efficient, and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars.” "

The budget would fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to shock Washington by slashing the government work force — but it is virtually ensured to be discarded by Hill Republicans who see many of Mr. Trump’s cuts as too rushed, indiscriminate and reckless. “You can’t drain the swamp and leave all of the people in it,” Mick Mulvaney, the White House’s budget director, said during a briefing on Wednesday. The budget would cut the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent, the State Department by 28 percent and Health and Human Services by 17.9 percent. Funding to several smaller government agencies that have long been targets of conservatives — like the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts — would be axed entirely. The chances of Mr. Trump’s first budget passing Congress in its current form are slim. Many of the proposals would be nonstarters for Democrats, and some would be problematic for Republicans. The proposed $54 billion increase in military spending — a 10 percent increase — would also require a repeal of spending caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act; Democrats oppose such a move without equal spending increases for domestic programs.

Russian hackers were identified by American intelligence officials as having tried to aid Donald J. Trump during the presidential election last year, at the expense of Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said Russians were also behind another prominent hacking: a giant breach at the internet company Yahoo in 2014, when 500 million user accounts were compromised. Federal officials said two Russian intelligence officers were responsible for the breach, along with a Russian hacker and a Kazakh national living in Canada, write Vindu Goel and Eric Lichtblau, reporters for The New York Times. The Russian government then used the information obtained through the Yahoo breach to target American executives and other officials, according to the indictment from the Justice Department. The development is likely to deepen questions over how much the United States and Russia can trust and work with each other. The relationship is also in the spotlight because of comments President Trump has made about his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, which have raised some eyebrows. At least one person was thankful that the Justice Department had brought its indictment out over the Yahoo breach. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, who is also grappling with another hacking of some 1 billion user accounts at the company, wrote in a message on Twitter that she was “very grateful” to the American authorities for getting to the bottom of things.

Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, wants to make one thing clear — the Fed does not share the optimism of stock market investors and business executives. To be sure, the Fed is confident about the economy. But growth is still slow, and the central bank wants to have time to adjust its plans should President Trump and Congress cut taxes or spend massively on infrastructure. If these policies materialize, the Fed could accelerate the pace of rate increases. If Congress gets bogged down, it can hold off. Yahoo has given scant details about the data stolen from 500 million of its accounts in 2014. The Justice Department, though, has taken action, charging two Russian intelligence officers and two other men with directing the scheme.

First, François Fillon, the embattled conservative candidate for president of France, currently lagging in third place and charged on Tuesday with embezzlement, was accused by Le Journal du Dimanche of having received “presents” from an unidentified friend in the form of 13,000 euros (about $13,880) in custom suiting from Arnys, the tailor that LVMH acquired in 2012 to merge with Berluti, its men’s wear label. Cue multiple headlines along the lines of this one from ledauphine.com: “The very expensive clothes of François Fillon.” Then it transpired that Ivanka Trump’s fine jewelry line was no more, having been, depending on how you look at it, either shut down or transformed into Ivanka Trump Fashion Jewelry (i.e., no longer involving precious gems and metals, created with a different licenser, and instead of costing $428 to $47,000, costing $28 to $198). Both of these developments underscore an unavoidable reality about life in the public eye: With populism on the rise, what politicians and their families wear (or put their name on) increasingly has a dollar, or euro, sign attached. And therein problems may lie. Price sensitivity isn’t limited simply to objects on shelves in stores; it now goes with wardrobes, too. Better take it … well, into account. Ms. Trump apparently did. After all, though the general attitude toward any Trump-related product these days is to treat sales as a referendum on the president and whether people are buying the lines he (and his family) are selling, note that, according to a statement from the brand’s president, Abigail Klem, the decision to discontinue the fine jewelry had nothing to do with revenue generation, but rather was made “as part of our company’s commitment to offering solution-oriented products at accessible price points.” In other words, to make the jewelry consistent with the rest of the brand’s positioning. The question being: Which brand? Because, according to a company spokeswoman, this decision was actually made back in December. That is, after Ms. Trump had separated her personal social media accounts from her brand’s social accounts, but before she had taken a formal leave of absence from the company. Which is interesting. Because segueing away from high-end jewelry doesn’t just bring the collection in line with the rest of the Ivanka Trump product portfolio — the clothes and bags and shoes — it brings it in line with what is increasingly emerging as the Ivanka Trump personal portfolio: the issues of child care, working parents and sacrifices made.

Good morning on this bitter Thursday. Don’t let the snowstorm and the few blooms fool you: Allergens are here. For many New Yorkers, the start of spring is synonymous with postnasal drip. Dr. William Reisacher, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, helped us set the record straight on some seasonal truths and falsehoods: True or false? Allergies are worse in the spring than they are in the winter. False. “Some people are very sensitive in the nose to changes in humidity, temperature and even barometric pressure,” Dr. Reisacher said. “When those factors are fluctuating, as we saw all winter, allergy-like symptoms can be worse.” Fact or myth? Allergies are worse in the suburbs because there are more trees. Myth. “Cities in general can have more problems with allergies,” Dr. Reisacher said. “Most of the pollen in New York City actually comes to us along the prevailing winds, which move west to east. The tall buildings can make allergy symptoms worse by creating a ‘wind tunnel’ effect.” Definitely or debatable? Springtime sniffles are mostly the result of pollen in the air. Debatable. “Older buildings in the city tend to have higher amounts of indoor allergens, such as dust mites, mold and pet dander,” Dr. Reisacher said. “Nasal symptoms can also come from nonallergic sources, such as airborne chemical, pollution, and particulate matter in the air from industry and construction.” Right or wrong? The trees are probably making me sneeze these days. Right. “The most common airborne allergens this time of the year are trees, such as Maple, and mold.” So really, it’s both. “When snow begins to melt,” he added, “mold spores, which have been lying dormant underneath the snow cover all winter, become airborne.” "

Through it all, Mr. Trump repeated a series of misleading assertions and falsehoods, such as when he seemed simultaneously to walk back and yet double down on his accusation that President Barack Obama had wiretapped him. “That really covers surveillance and many other things. Nobody ever talks about the fact that it was in quotes,” he said on Fox News before adding, “I think you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront in the next two weeks.” Here’s an assessment of some of his recent claims. This is misleading. The Times article Mr. Trump referred to did use the word “wiretap” but it did not assert that Mr. Obama had ordered surveillance of Mr. Trump, nor did it even mention Mr. Obama. Rather, the story referred to intercepted information collected overseas. The headline in print read, “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides.” And the word appeared twice in the text of the article: “intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House” and “If Mr. Sessions is confirmed, he will for a time be the only person in the government authorized to seek foreign intelligence wiretaps on American soil.” False. Mr. Trump has proposed to add $54 billion to the Pentagon’s budget, which amounts to a 10 percent increase. There have been at least 10 larger increases to the base defense budget since the 1977 fiscal year and four since 2002. "

The message was quickly removed. A spokeswoman for McDonald’s, Becca Hary, said Twitter notified the company that its account had been compromised. “We deleted the tweet, secured our account and are now investigating this,” Ms. Hary said in an email, echoing a message the company posted on Twitter later in the morning. Ms. Hary did not respond to a question about whether the company had any idea about who may have been responsible. Will Stickney, a Twitter spokesman, said, “We do not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.” The tweet criticizing Mr. Trump was shared many hundreds of times and set off a furious round of comment. The company’s corporate Twitter account has about 150,000 followers, far fewer than the 3.4 million on its main account. The comment about Mr. Trump’s hands in the initial message was an apparent reference to last year’s insults directed at Mr. Trump from Senator Marco Rubio, his former rival for the White House. Mr. Rubio said Mr. Trump had “small hands” and “spray tan” during a campaign stop. “You know what they say about men with small hands,” Mr. Rubio said at Roanoke College in Salem, Va. “You can’t trust them.” The remarks came after Mr. Trump had repeatedly dismissed the Republican senator as “Little Marco” at his own campaign rallies.

That sentiment translates into politics. For the Dutch, both the British vote to leave the European Union and Donald J.

Two days later, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Ms. Conway had been speaking in jest. “The microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone,” Mr. Spicer said, “and I think that has been cleaned up.” Of course. But readers of The New York Times in 1956 might have suspected something sinister. A big defense contractor, the Raytheon Manufacturing Company of Waltham, Mass., put a help-wanted notice in the Sunday Business-Financial section, saying it was looking for electrical engineers to develop 2450-megacycle microwave ovens. “Most helpful previous experience: magnetron tube development, large-cavity resonators or magnetron feeds,” the ad said. Clearly, this was to be something more than a Mixmaster. “Cooking the new electronic way,” was how Raytheon described it. There was nothing new about it.

The disclosures were unusual; prosecutors rarely announce the conclusion of such inquiries when no charges are filed. The federal inquiry found a pattern in which Mr. de Blasio or his associates solicited contributions from donors seeking favors from the city and then contacted city agencies on their behalf, according to a statement from the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. But the decision not to bring charges, the statement said, came after weighing among other things, “the high burden of proof, the clarity of existing law” and challenge of proving corruption without “evidence of personal profit.” State prosecutors, who examined Mr. de Blasio’s unsuccessful 2014 effort to help Democrats regain control of the State Senate, concluded that the aspects of the undertaking amounted to an “end run” around limits on contributions to candidates, according to a 10-page letter outlining their findings. Mr. de Blasio was quick to try to put the issue behind him. “I’ll just say simply it’s been basically a year, I’ve said consistently that we acted appropriately,” he told Brian Lehrer on WNYC in a previously scheduled interview Thursday morning, shortly after the prosecutors released their findings. “This confirms what I’ve been saying and what all my colleagues have been saying.” He added, “We gotta get back to work. My focus now is getting back to business.” "

But the Trump administration does not have a lot to say about it. On his first day as secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson vowed to “deploy the talent and resources of the State Department in the most efficient ways possible.” For “efficient,” read minimalist. During his first two overseas trips, to Germany and Mexico, his public statements amounted to 625 words total. His predecessor, John Kerry, might have taken that many to answer a single question at one of his frequent press encounters. This week, Mr. Tillerson visited Japan, China and South Korea against the backdrop of increased regional tensions thanks to North Korea’s recent missile tests. Normally, the secretary of state would be accompanied by a dozen or so reporters, but Mr. Tillerson left the State Department press corps behind — offering a single seat on his plane to an obscure conservative outlet that devotes more attention to America’s culture wars than its foreign policy. This is part of a pattern. Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Greece all visited the State Department in recent days for bilateral meetings. There were photos of handshakes, but the secretary had nothing to say about how the United States views the challenges these important allies face, or how it might help. Last week, the State Department released its annual human rights report. Mr. Tillerson wrote an introduction but made no presentation of the report’s findings, another departure from past practice. The low-key rollout — interpreted as a downgrade of human rights as a policy priority — drew a sharp rebuke from Senator Marco Rubio. What corporate executive would stop all advertising and marketing as he learned a new job? That’s effectively what Mr. Tillerson has done. There were no daily press briefings for six weeks. In the modern era, this is unheard-of. “He’s not a media guy,” one official acknowledged recently. "

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Adeel Hassan, a reporter based in New York, provides today’s introduction. The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s executive order on immigration can be felt across California, especially in the cluster of kebab houses and Iranian-American businesses known as Little Tehran or Persian Square in Los Angeles, home to the world’s largest Iranian diaspora. The latest order, which was blocked on Wednesday, would have imposed a 90-day ban on citizens from Iran and five other predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the U.S. The original ban, issued in January, was ultimately blocked by a federal appeals court. The chaos over the ban’s rollout has put into flux travel plans ahead of the most important Iranian cultural holiday, Nowruz. The 13-day secular celebration of the Persian New Year begins on the first day of spring, which is Monday. Nowruz (pronounced NO-rooz) dates back thousands of years to the old Iranian solar calendar. It’s a part of the cycle of planting and harvesting and renewal. “There is lots of anxiety in the community,” said Peyman Malaz, program manager in the Los Angeles office of Pars Equality Center, an Iranian-American advocacy group. “Everyone is terrified actually. Everything is uncertain.” "
794,The Rise of the Paranoid Citizen,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/the-rise-of-the-paranoid-citizen.html?searchResultPosition=61,2017/03/16,OPINION,"SOFIA, Bulgaria — As I follow the news and listen to politicians these days, I am struck by the extent to which America and Europe are awash in conspiracy thinking. Conspiracy theories have replaced ideologies at the heart of politics. They mobilize people to take to the streets; they connect political leaders to their followers. They decide the outcome of the elections. But as the saying goes, “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.” Russian hacking of the servers of the Democratic National Committee was not a conspiracy theory but a fact. Neither was it a conspiracy theory that the United States was snooping on the chancellor of Germany and the president of Brazil. Most of the corruption scandals in the Western world right now are not conspiracy theories, either. They are actual conspiracies. Yet is the existence of bona fide conspiracies a good enough reason to view everything happening in the world in that light? Is the epidemic of mistrust that is tearing apart democratic societies making us more or less free? And does the rise of a new kind of citizen — let’s call him or her the “paranoid citizen” — imperil our democracies? In Poland it was the shared belief that the death of President Lech Kaczynski along with 95 other members of the Polish elite in a plane crash near the Russian town of Smolensk in 2010 was an assassination rather than an accident (a claim that was officially rejected) that correlated with voting for the now governing right-wing Law and Justice party in the last parliamentary elections — probably more than education, income level, church attendance or any other factor. In the United States, very few Democrats cast doubt on the argument that President Trump is in the pocket of the Kremlin. Across the aisle, few of the Republican faithful are willing to publicly disavow Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that he and his campaign were wiretapped on the order of President Barack Obama; fewer still will contest the lie that protesters against the new president are paid by leftist billionaires.

795,A Sea Change for Climate Coverage,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/insider/a-sea-change-for-climate-coverage.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/03/16,TIMES INSIDER,"When considered individually, the main journalistic components of today’s article on the troubling state of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef are nothing new — a focus on the climate, an international dateline (“SYDNEY, Australia”), arresting visuals. Each is a mainstay of New York Times reporting. In this case, though, their combination in a single article quietly hints at a series of changes. The article resulted from a collaboration involving two recent projects at The Times: a newly established bureau in Sydney, and a newly formed team of journalists devoted entirely to climate issues — both of which played crucial roles in the article’s conception and execution. “The climate team was formed to handle breaking news stories exactly like this one, along with bigger enterprise pieces like last month’s story on the water crisis in Mexico City,” said Hannah Fairfield, who leads the new group from Washington. The team, which has been around for a little longer than a month, exists as its own desk in the newsroom (just like, say, the national desk or the sports desk) and consists of editors and reporters in New York and Washington. The goal, Ms. Fairfield says, is to produce visual, explanatory and investigative journalism at a time when, as today’s article indicates, the calamities caused by climate change seem to be intensifying. The team is also coming together at a time of uncertainty regarding the Trump administration’s environmental policies. Just yesterday, President Trump announced a rollback on fuel-economy standards set by President Barack Obama. Climate change has long been a critical area of coverage in The Times’s news report. And the establishment of a dedicated team for climate coverage is just the latest iteration in an evolving approach to reporting on the environment. (A similar team, called the environment desk, existed from 2009 to 2013, for example, but was disbanded to allow for a more interdisciplinary approach.) "

The annual event is part of a packed day that includes breakfast with the Irish-American vice president, lunch with the Irish-American speaker of the House and — perhaps — a few drinks. On Friday, there will be an anti-Trump immigrant solidarity event in New York organized by Aodhan O’Riordain, an Irish senator who made headlines last year when he called the newly elected Donald J. Trump a “fascist” during a speech in Parliament. The event, called an “Irish Stand,” will denounce the new administration, its immigration policies and its many Irish-American members, including Vice President Mike Pence and Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. The dueling events highlight a political divide in Irish America, which includes more than 33 million people, and between Irish America and Ireland itself, an increasingly liberal country of about five million people. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular there, but Irish-American leaders said he might have drawn just under half of the Irish-American vote, part of a decades-long drift to the right by a once solidly Democratic bloc.

With no fewer than 137 institutions of higher learning, from community colleges to world-class private universities to specialized colleges like the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Juilliard School for music, there is a school for virtually every academic pursuit. Even, it may come as a surprise, for future merchant mariners. Tucked away under the Throgs Neck Bridge in the Bronx is the often overlooked State University of New York Maritime College, which has become known for its strong engineering and marine transportation programs. According to a new study, recent graduates of SUNY Maritime earn more than graduates of any other university in the United States. When Payscale.com surveyed the annual incomes of 1.4 million midcareer graduates with bachelor’s degrees, Maritime College ranked first, with an average income of $144,000, surpassing M.I.T., Harvey Mudd College and Princeton University. The college is an unusual blend of engineering school and military academy; a majority of the students train to be merchant mariners, wearing uniforms and following a strict regimen that prohibits freshmen, for one thing, from leaving campus during the school week. A typical cadet is Cullen Palicka, a 20-year-old junior who was raised in Manhattan and attended the Harbor School, a maritime-themed high school on Governors Island, which provided his first taste of life at sea. For Mr. Palicka, sailing on the Training Ship Empire State VI is what sets Maritime College apart from the typical college. "

And “James Baldwin is a no-brainer. (I’d let him smoke inside.)” What books are currently on your night stand? There are two: The first is “Black Over White: Negro Political Leadership in South Carolina During Reconstruction,” by Thomas Holt. It was published in 1979, but it’s still one of the most comprehensive looks at the black elected representatives who held power in South Carolina from 1867 to 1876. To me, this is perhaps the most fascinating and tragic period in American history. The other is a galley for the novel “Touch,” by Courtney Maum; it comes out in May, and I’m about halfway through it. So far it’s a really smart and funny look at the insane psychological and social costs of our era of constant connectedness. I know Courtney from college, and my wife really liked her first novel, “I Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You,” which got raves. What’s the last great book you read? I’ll name two because I basically read them at the same time, as I was working on my own book. “Ghettoside,” by Jill Leovy, which is at one level just the story of one homicide detective in L.A., but is more profoundly about violence and policing and the ways in which our criminal justice system exhibits its contempt and devaluation of black lives through policing as well as overpolicing. The other is “Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life,” by Karen and Barbara Fields. I’m slightly embarrassed to say that I’d not heard of it until my research assistant for the book, George Aumoithe, who’s a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia, recommended it to me. It’s a book of essays that grapple with a pretty simple question: What is race? It’s permanently altered the way I think about the concept and the language I use to describe it. Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets — working today do you admire most? There are way, way too many for me to list here, particularly journalists, because there is just an incomprehensible amount of amazing work being produced right now. But here are a few: Ta-Nehisi Coates; David Grann; Masha Gessen; Junot Díaz; Stephen Karam; Lin-Manuel Miranda; Sarah Ruhl; Tony Kushner; Lynn Nottage; Rebecca Solnit; George Saunders; Michelle Alexander; China Miéville; and my brilliant, talented friend Alix Sobler, who is a playwright you will be hearing a lot from. What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? The vast majority of book reading I do right now has to do with writing projects I’m working on, so for about a year and a half it was mostly criminal justice, policing, race and early colonial U.S. history. Now I’m reading a ton of history books about Reconstruction; in fact, it’s basically all of what I’m reading. "

A typical opioid overdose involves pills that a doctor prescribed legally but that someone other than the intended patient ingested. This pattern is a sign that doctors often prescribe too many pills at once. After surgery, for example, many patients use only a small portion of the painkillers prescribed — and the remainder become available for a relative or friend who’s addicted to painkillers to abuse. Here’s how bad the opioid crisis has become: More Americans now die of overdoses than died of AIDS at the peak of that epidemic, as Atul Gawande writes in a special report published by the Annals of Surgery, a medical journal. The journal’s report points to several common-sense solutions, such as smaller prescription amounts and easier refills for patients who really need painkillers. If you don’t generally enjoy reading medical journals, I sympathize, and suggest you read the short, easily understandable introduction to the opioid report from Gawande, the surgeon and New Yorker writer. I also recommend an Op-Ed in The Times today by J.D. Vance, the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” one of the most talked-about books of the past year. Vance describes his decision to move back home to Ohio, where he is starting an organization to fight the opioid crisis. (Given Vance’s prominence and interest in policy, I wouldn’t be surprised if he eventually ran for office.) Because it’s hard to talk about almost any medical issue without talking about Trumpcare, I also recommend Doyle McManus’s explanation, in The Los Angeles Times, of how the Republican health bill would hamper treatment of opioid addiction. More broadly on Trumpcare: Margot Sanger-Katz debunks the idea that it reduces the cost of medical care, while Sarah Kliff and Ezra Klein lay out the past, present and future of the American health care system in a brisk 6,000 words.

But when Neurala needed money, it got little response from the American military. So Neurala turned to China, landing an undisclosed sum from an investment firm backed by a state-run Chinese company. Chinese firms have become significant investors in American start-ups working on cutting-edge technologies with potential military applications. The start-ups include companies that make rocket engines for spacecraft, sensors for autonomous navy ships, and printers that make flexible screens that could be used in fighter-plane cockpits. Many of the Chinese firms are owned by state-owned companies or have connections to Chinese leaders. The deals are ringing alarm bells in Washington. According to a new white paper commissioned by the Department of Defense, Beijing is encouraging Chinese companies with close government ties to invest in American start-ups specializing in critical technologies like artificial intelligence and robots to advance China’s military capacity as well as its economy. The white paper, which was distributed to the senior levels of the Trump administration this week, concludes that United States government controls that are supposed to protect potentially critical technologies are falling short, according to three people knowledgeable about its contents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “What drives a lot of the concern is that China is a military competitor,” said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who is familiar with the report. “How do you deal with a military competitor playing in your most innovative market?” "

The coalition said it had no indications that an airstrike hit civilians, but in its daily report on coalition strikes, the United States military acknowledged that strikes were carried out in the area. It said that coalition warplanes carried out 19 airstrikes on Tuesday — an unusually high number for a single day — on a range of Islamic State facilities near the city of Raqqa. The attack, which hit a school in the town of Mansoura, where civilians had taken shelter on Tuesday night, was the second time in a week that Syrians had accused the United States of involvement in a strike that killed dozens of noncombatants. Forty-nine people died last week when American warplanes fired on a target in Al Jinah, a village in western Aleppo Province. United States officials said the attack had hit a building where Qaeda operatives were meeting, but residents said the warplanes had struck a mosque where hundreds of people had gathered for a weekly religious meeting. The United States military said it was investigating whether civilians had been killed in that airstrike. "

The Washington Tidal Basin, the reservoir that sits between the Jefferson Memorial and Washington Monument, is usually jammed with visitors on a weekend morning in late March. They come to see the cherry blossoms that surround the basin in a flush of pink. On Sunday, however, the area was “basically deserted,” as the website Cherry Blossom Watch noted. Why? There wasn’t yet much to see. Washington has just had its warmest winter on record (with a February that was warmer than an average March). The warmth brought many cherry blossoms to the cusp of a very early bloom, at which point they’re delicate. And when a cold spell came last week, it killed many, leaving them wilted and brown. “This is something that has never happened in the 105-year history of cherry blossoms in D.C.,” Mike Litterst of the National Park Service told The Washington Post. The real-world consequences of climate change are accelerating. The Great Plains is suffering its worst drought in a century, hurting many farmers. Pollen counts are rising, aggravating allergies. Warming oceans have killed huge sections of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, turning their glorious colors to a bleached white that’s as dispiriting as a wilted brown cherry blossom. Just a couple of miles away from the Tidal Basin, on the other end of the Washington Mall, Neil Gorsuch had his second day of confirmation hearings yesterday. For a summary, I recommend coverage from The Times, Slate and Scotusblog. You can also listen to NPR’s Nina Totenberg. Climate change hasn’t been a major focus of the hearings. Yet I expect that the climate will end up being a large part of Gorsuch’s legacy if he joins the Supreme Court. He could be the deciding vote on pollution cases that will come before the court in the near future. Longer term, when the country next has a president who takes climate change seriously, many efforts to fight it are likely to end up before the court. Gorsuch is extremely conservative, and the best working assumption is that he will be hostile to environmental regulation. But that’s not the only possibility. “Gorsuch’s record on environmental cases is sparse,” Patrick Parenteau of Grist has written. “His decisions generally reflect the views of a conservative jurist, but not a particular animosity toward environmental regulations. Plus he’s an avid fly-fisher, which surely counts for something.” Ultimately, some influential conservatives will surely decide they care about the health of the planet. Right? "

Jerry Brown arrived in Washington for his first trip to the capital during the Trump administration with an agenda full to the point of groaning. But in addition to infrastructure, immigration, health care and myriad other issues important to the nation’s largest state, he had another topic on his mind. “The end of the world,” said Mr. Brown. In a visit to The New York Times Washington bureau Tuesday, the always-spirited governor was at his most animated when discussing his work on the board of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and a threat he said should be taken more seriously. “One bomb of 15 kilotons dropped in Washington from a terrorist from some material they put together — unlikely but highly possible — could kill 80,000 people instantly, 100,000 serious casualties, wipe out the president, most of the Congress, whoever is at the meeting and change America forever,” said Mr. Brown, tapping a conference table for emphasis. “End America as we know it. That is not inconceivable.” The governor put in a plug for legislation sponsored by Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts that would require the president to receive congressional approval to use nuclear weapons.

Spurred by the 2012 shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., she had pressured local and federal lawmakers on gun control legislation, first on the backs of postcards and then in live confrontations in town halls and congressional offices. Her advocacy led to calls for her to run for office, but Ms. Rzeszowsk had repeatedly declined. Now, seeking solace and inspiration following the 2016 presidential election and the Women’s March on Washington, Ms. Rzeszowski, 42, is squaring off in a tough race against a local Republican for a seat in the New Jersey Assembly. Political activism of all persuasions, ignited largely in response to President Trump, has swelled in the wake of the 2016 election. A monsoon of marchers swept through Washington following the inauguration, letters and phone calls flooded the White House and Congress, and protests erupted at congressional town hall meetings across the nation. But in the social media age, where protest movements often remain relegated to cable news screens and hashtags, some have wondered whether the fervor and energy would be reflected in local, state and federal ballots. The answer seems to be a resounding yes. A surge in demand for programs around the country like the one at Rutgers, along with a significant spike in off-year small dollar fund-raising for local races, suggests that the protest movement is producing a flood of first-timers, led predominantly by new female candidates, on local ballots, from school boards to town councils to state legislatures.

At least four people, including the assailant, were killed and at least 40 others injured in the confusing swirl of violence, which the police said they assumed had been “inspired by international terrorism.” It appeared to be the most serious such assault in London since the deadly subway bombings more than a decade ago. Throughout a turbulent afternoon, ambulances, emergency vehicles and heavily armed security officers thronged the area outside Parliament, as one of the busiest sections of London was cordoned off and evacuated. Prime Minister Theresa May was rushed into a vehicle and spirited back to her office. She held a meeting of the government’s emergency committee and issued a statement on Wednesday night from her 10 Downing Street residence denouncing “the sick and depraved terrorist attack on the streets of our Capital this afternoon.” Mrs. May also said that “the full details of exactly what happened are still emerging,” but she confirmed that the attack had been carried out by a lone male assailant. As of late Wednesday, his identity had not been released, but Scotland Yard officials said they believed they knew who he was. "

The hotel was the home to countless galas and parties, including the Alfred E. Smith dinner, traditionally the last event where the presidential candidates share a stage before the election, and the Viennese Opera Ball, which bills itself as the oldest white-tie event in New York City. Its closing left a void in the city’s social circuit that event planners and philanthropic gatekeepers have rushed to fill. “It was almost like a starter’s pistol,” said Richard Martin, the director of development at the Ronald McDonald House of New York, of the June 2016 announcement of the hotel’s temporary shutdown. The charity has held its spring fund-raiser at the Waldorf for nearly a quarter-century. Starting from late June, Mr. Martin scoured the city for comparable spaces that could handle more than 1,000 guests. He eventually settled on the Empire Ballroom at the Grand Hyatt New York. “We could fit into the space, and we liked the look of the location,” he said. “And they had a good price for us.” Not everyone felt so lucky. Melissa Meredith, the director of strategic events at the International Rescue Committee, had more difficulty finding a suitable alternative to the Waldorf for the organization’s annual event. “Our dinner is the first Wednesday in November,” she said. “It’s been that way for a long time, and it’s what our audience expects.” But that date falls in the middle of the busy fall social calendar, so the closest she found was Nov. 2, a Thursday, at the New York Hilton Midtown. There were other concerns, too. "

But Obama-era positions suggest otherwise. They include what constitutes a war zone (in effect, the entire planet); who the enemy is (any group “associated” with Al Qaeda whether or not Congress has authorized hostilities); who is targetable within such a group (never made clear); and what constitutes an “imminent” threat (a threat that may materialize in the future). So it is no surprise that the Trump administration would cast the removal of President Barack Obama’s constraints as lawful. Bottom line: Look for ever more death and destruction against civilians and the inevitable blowback that sends us into a downward spiral of violence, all accompanied by an increasingly robust offer of “alternative facts” on civilian casualties.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks. The first two blasts ripped through the Brussels airport on the morning of March 22, 2016, turning a busy travel hub in the heart of Europe into a scene of carnage. Then, while bloody-faced passengers were being evacuated from the airport, a bomb went off miles away in the Maelbeek subway station at the peak of rush hour, disfiguring some commuters so badly that coroners struggled to identify them. Befitting a cosmopolitan capital where the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are based, the victims in the attacks came not just from Belgium but from a number of other countries as well, including China, India, Morocco and the United States. Among them were a Belgian filmmaker, a Swedish illustrator, a Congolese business school graduate and father of two young girls, a Chinese entrepreneur, a Belgian Muslim teacher and mother of three, and a couple from the United States who had come to Europe in search of adventure. A large crowd gathered at the airport on Wednesday to observe a minute of silence at 7:58 a.m., the time when the first explosion convulsed the departure terminal. Among them were King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, Prime Minister Charles Michel and relatives of victims. Baggage carousels froze, takeoffs and landings were held off and all other activity at the airport ceased for the tribute. The names of the dead were read to the plaintive accompaniment of a single cello. The anniversary dominated Belgian newspapers on Wednesday. Le Soir, a leading daily, referred to “that day in March where we lost our innocence.” "

But his references to North Korea as an “imminent threat” that requires “immediate attention” did not provide a clear picture of how he intends to proceed and in what way the Trump administration’s approach would differ from President Barack Obama’s policy of strategic patience — waiting out the North Koreans while ratcheting up sanctions and covert action. That policy failed to constrain a program that has produced enough fissile material for about 21 nuclear bombs and enabled Pyongyang to accelerate the development of missiles that could carry warheads to hit Japan, South Korea and, one day, the United States — and that has people like China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, warning of a “head-on collision” between North Korea and the United States. Mr. Tillerson seemed to rule out negotiations with the North and suggested that the United States might be forced to take pre-emptive military action if the North Koreans “elevate the threat of their weapons program” to an unacceptable level. This sort of talk is jarring and risky, and even though negotiations are a long shot, there is little hope of moderating the North’s position without them. En route from Seoul to Beijing, he told a reporter from the conservative-leaning website Independent Journal Review that while “all options are on the table,” there are “a lot of steps and a lot of distance between now and a time that we would have to make a decision like that.” He talked of a multistep process in which countries, especially China, would be encouraged to carry out United Nations Security Council sanctions intended to press the North to give up its nuclear program, and he said that even tougher sanctions — ideas under discussion include barring North Korea from the global financial system and penalizing Chinese banks that do business with North Korea — could be considered.

810,Search for Secret Service Leader Intensifies as White House Security Is Tested,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/politics/secret-service-white-house.html?searchResultPosition=79,2017/03/22,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — In the century or so since Congress first assigned the Secret Service the task of protecting the president of the United States, its top job has always gone to an agency veteran. Like so many things in the Trump era, that may soon change. Aides to President Trump are narrowing a list of candidates to lead the Secret Service, the beleaguered agency that protects the country’s top government officials and investigates certain crimes. Unlike in transitions past, no clear front-runner has emerged. But top aides have been looking at candidates inside and outside the agency who can improve its morale and regain the credibility lost after a string of embarrassing lapses. They hope to name a new director in the coming weeks. The search has taken on new urgency in recent days, as a series of attempted intrusions on the White House grounds — including a successful one in which a man was able to wander close enough to peer through the windows — have reignited concerns about management, training and security vulnerabilities thought to be on the mend. Critics of the agency have seized on the most recent cases to amplify calls for the White House to recruit a leader from outside the Secret Service, which would be unprecedented in the famously hidebound agency’s modern history. They insisted that only someone untethered from the agency’s ways of thinking could institute the kind of reforms necessary to guide the organization. “I still believe they have a deep-seated cultural problem,” Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, and the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in an interview. “We need a transformative figure to truly change the culture at the Secret Service.” "
811,"Trump’s ISIS Plan, as Described by Tillerson, Sounds Like Obama’s",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/world/middleeast/rex-tillerson-isis.html?searchResultPosition=78,2017/03/22,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump falsely accused President Barack Obama of founding the Islamic State. He said Mr. Obama “did not get it,” in terms of fighting the extremist group that is based in Iraq and Syria, and vowed to obliterate them on the battlefield. But in the Trump administration’s first major announcement of its still-nascent plans to defeat the militants, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Wednesday closely parroted Mr. Obama’s strategy. His comments came as talk of fighting the Islamic State was overshadowed by an attack in London that killed four and injured 40. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, or if the Islamic State was linked to it. “The great commonality among we who have gathered today is a commitment to bringing down a global force of evil,” Mr. Tillerson said at the start of a conclave of the 68-nation coalition to defeat the Islamic State that was held at State Department headquarters. In his 20-minute speech, Mr. Tillerson noted that over the past year, the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria had dropped more than 90 percent, and that 75 percent of the Islamic State’s online propaganda had been eliminated. Both gains occurred largely on Mr. Obama’s watch. “Reflecting on the past year or so, we should be encouraged by the significant progress we as a coalition are making,” Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Trump has long insisted that citing “radical Islamic terrorism” is key to defeating the Islamic State. “You can’t solve a problem if you refuse to talk about what the problem is,” he said in November 2015. Yet Mr. Tillerson used those three words together only once — when he requested that Saudi Arabia and Egypt do more to combat extremism. "
812,"House Republicans, Deeply Divided, Face Painful Choice on Health Vote",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/health-care-bill-republicans.html?searchResultPosition=77,2017/03/22,U.S.,"WASHINGTON — For the House Republicans who have never served under a Republican president — roughly two-thirds of them — the vote scheduled for Thursday on a measure to replace President Barack Obama’s health care law is a legislative fantasia, the culmination of seven years of campaign promises impeded by Mr. Obama’s veto pen. But weeks of back-room machinations to bring a disparate group of lawmakers on board have left many Republicans with an excruciating choice: Pass a bill with an extremely limited constituency that could well wreak havoc with their own voters, and with Republicans’ re-election prospects, or vote it down, undermining President Trump’s agenda. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday that he was confident the House would pass the bill. But as of late Wednesday, roughly 30 Republicans had said they either would vote against the measure or had not made up their minds. That left the bill’s sponsors short of the 216 votes needed, and on Wednesday night Mr. Ryan scheduled a meeting in the Capitol to try to win over skeptics. If House Republicans reject the measure, the working relationship between the White House and Republican leaders in Congress, still in its infancy, will suffer a powerful blow. In Washington, failure often begets more failure, as opposition forces strengthen, alliances fragment and the thin foam of bipartisanship evaporates. “How do we have any momentum to do anything else?” asked Representative Richard Hudson, Republican of North Carolina. “Without this bill, I don’t know how you do tax reform,” he said. If the bill fails, “it’s going to have negative repercussions for all of us.” "

Gorsuch veered, somehow, to the matter of mutton busting. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wanted to hear about the Denver rodeo. And Judge Gorsuch, elusive all week as Democrats have strained to pinpoint his judicial leanings, turned instantly expansive. “Mutton busting, as you know, comes sort of like bronco busting for adults,” he began on Tuesday. “You take a poor little kid, you find a sheep and you attach the one to the other and see how long they can hold on.” He went on. “…You know, it usually works fine when the sheep has got a lot of wool and you tell them to hold on — I tell my kids hold on monkey-style, you know? Really get in there, right? Get around it…” The Democrats stared blankly. “…Because if you sit upright, you go flying right off, right? So, you want to get in. But the problem when you get in is that you’re so locked in that you don’t want to let go, right? And so, then the poor clown has to come and knock you off the sheep.” Judge Gorsuch smiled. “We can talk mutton busting all day,” he said. They may as well have. As Judge Gorsuch glided through the third day of his hearings on Wednesday, suffering few slips and answering no question he did not wish to, Senate Republicans were eager to assist. "

But do they know that scientific data shows that the Earth’s climate is already changing? And do they know that people and communities are already being affected by these changes? In this lesson, students use the Times’s series Carbon’s Casualties to learn about how climate change is displacing people around the world. They then practice the important skill of explaining the science to a skeptical public that sometimes doubts what it doesn’t see with its own eyes. _________ Warm-Up and Background To get the most out of the main activities in this lesson, students should have a familiarity with the science of climate change. Teachers may want to do part of this Warm-Up as a brief refresher, or they might choose to do the entire Warm-Up as an extended background lesson before tackling the more in-depth articles. Warm-Up: Ask students to engage in a free write for five minutes in response to the term “climate change.” This practice of informal writing can encourage them to activate prior knowledge and to explore questions that they have in a nonthreatening, non-evaluative way. They can write what they know, what they think they know, what they’ve heard, what they’re confused or unsure about, or what they want to know. After students are done writing, ask them to turn and read their writing to a partner. After they have heard each other’s writings, ask them to work together to write a collaborative summary in which they combine their ideas. As a class, discuss what students noticed as they went through this process. What did they know? What did they learn from their peers? What was it like to engage in this process? What questions do they have? Were there disagreements? "

The editorial was an extraordinarily harsh rebuke of President Trump, calling him “his own worst political enemy” and asserting that he was damaging his presidency “with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods.” In particular, the editorial board pointed to Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that former President Barack Obama had tapped his phones. “The President clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle,” the editorial said, even though senior intelligence officials, as well as Republicans and Democrats, have said they have seen no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s accusations. The paper’s editorial and opinion writers have been critical of Mr. Trump in the past, although the language of this editorial, which ran in Wednesday’s paper, seemed intended to remind the president to focus on his stated goals rather than distractions. And the timing of the editorial — during a week in which Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, is testifying at confirmation hearings and the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the Republican health care bill — is almost certainly not a coincidence. In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Journal said, “The editorial speaks for itself,” and declined to make Paul Gigot, the editorial page editor, available for an interview. The editorial, headlined “A President’s Credibility,” criticized President Trump for “rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims” — namely, repeating an unsupported allegation by a Fox News commentator that British intelligence had wiretapped Mr. Trump on behalf of the Obama administration. Like The Journal, Fox News is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, who has ties to the president. "

But its plan to present the North American premiere of a work by the Syrian playwright Mohammad al-Attar risks being stopped at the United States border if President Trump’s travel ban is upheld. To present the play, “While I Was Waiting,” Lincoln Center is seeking visas for several artists with passports from Syria — one of several predominantly Muslim nations from which the Trump administration has sought to temporarily ban travelers. The recent pair of executive orders seeking the ban were both blocked by court orders. The festival is hoping the visas will be granted. “Our choice of artists predated the travel ban,” Nigel Redden, the director of the Lincoln Center Festival, said in an email. “But the very idea of the ban shows how important it is for us to have greater understanding of the world beyond our own borders.” “While I Was Waiting,” about the travails of a middle-class family in Damascus, is one of several international plays planned for this summer’s festival, which will run from July 10 to 30. The festival will begin with “Opening Skinner’s Box,” from Britain’s Improbable Theater, and will feature two productions from Israel: David Grossman’s “To the End of the Land” and Amos Gitai’s “Yitzhak Rabin: Chronicle of an Assassination.” Dance Companies From Around the World A previously announced highlight of the festival will be an unusual international performance of George Balanchine’s “Jewels,” with the Paris Opera Ballet, New York City Ballet and the Bolshoi Ballet trading acts of a work that evokes different national dance styles.

817,New York Today: Russian Spies in Our Midst,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/nyregion/new-york-today-russian-spies-in-our-midst.html?searchResultPosition=90,2017/03/22,NEW YORK,"Updated, 7:28 a.m. Good morning on this chilly-cheery Wednesday. With accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election and the F.B.I. investigating whether members of President Trump’s campaign were involved, Washington seems to be getting all the espionage attention. Yet we’d like to point out that New York’s streets, parks and libraries have long been grounds for covert operations. “New York is one of the great espionage capitals of the world,” said Edward Lucas, the author of “Deception: The Untold Story of East-West Espionage Today.” “But the spying that happens in New York doesn’t always involve United States.” A big draw for foreign agents is the United Nations, Mr. Lucas said. For spies, “it’s like a pond: Any fish you want swims through there.” New York has long been a hub of Russian spies because the Russian Mission to the U.N. was a way of getting agents into the United States, where they could work covertly and recruit Americans to their cause, Mr. Lucas added. A few of our city’s most famous Soviet spies include: • Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a Manhattan couple accused of perpetuating the “crime of the century” from their Lower East Side apartment. They were convicted of an espionage conspiracy for stealing atom bomb secrets for the Soviets, and were executed by electric chair in 1953. (Mrs. Rosenberg’s defenders, among them her two sons, say she was innocent and should be exonerated.) "
818,Trump Says Regulations Impede. Perhaps Not in the Electric Car Business.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/technology/electric-car-regulations-trump.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/03/22,TECHNOLOGY,"President Trump is not fond of regulations. Within weeks of taking office, he and his appointees began to roll back rules that govern the financial industry, guns, the energy business and broadband internet providers. Last week was the auto industry’s turn. In a speech in Ypsilanti, Mich., Mr. Trump said he would alter rules imposed by the Obama administration to raise vehicles’ fuel standards, which are aimed at curbing greenhouse gases. The rules, Mr. Trump said, are killing jobs. Getting rid of them would prompt a resurgence in the auto industry that would make America “the car capital of the world again,” he said. That’s one possibility. We also have to consider another scenario: Loosening the fuel-economy rules could remove a primary incentive for big carmakers to catch up with innovative upstarts like Tesla and leave the American car industry out of step with a future ruled by electric motors rather than the internal combustion engine. This might happen because the effects of regulation are not as simple as Mr. Trump argues. The president’s view that rules almost always hurt businesses is not supported by history. Researchers who study regulation and its effects on business said there have been numerous instances in which regulation speeds along, rather than impedes, technological progress. It has happened in the energy business, the electronics industry and health care. And it’s happening now in cars. Vehicles powered by electricity keep getting better. Electric cars are getting less expensive, their range is increasing, and the infrastructure to sell, charge and maintain them is improving. As a result, electric cars keep getting more popular, even in a time of low gas prices. There are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California. “Having long-term targets is driving investments in innovative technologies,” said Don Anair, who studies the auto industry for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group. “Maintaining those standards is critical for maintaining that progress.” "
819,Morning Agenda: The ‘Trump Trade’ Faces a Test,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/business/dealbook/markets-trump-trade-uber.html?searchResultPosition=92,2017/03/22,DEALBOOK,"The Trump trade is facing its first test. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed down 1.24 percent on Tuesday, its sharpest daily decline since October. Financial stocks, like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, led the sell-off, and the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index also declined. Could investors’ optimism and composure, so steady even through political volatility, be waning? Are they now questioning President Trump’s ability to pass market-friendly laws? There are some troubling signs. The Russell 2000 small-cap index tumbled on Tuesday — an indication of concerns over tax overhaul (small businesses would benefit from a corporate tax cut). The value of the dollar slid, and the yield on 10-year Treasury notes slipped, indicating that investors were piling into safer government bonds. The sinking feeling continued into the Asian trading day, with stocks dropping across the region. The Nikkei 225 closed down 2.13 percent. European markets weakened too on Wednesday morning. • Shares in Akzo Nobel fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday after it said it had rejected another takeover bid from PPG. It had rejected an earlier bid, saying it undervalued the company. This time it pointed to a “significant culture gap” between the two companies. “Put very simply, change starts at the top.” Those were the words of Arianna Huffington, a member of the board at Uber, who wanted to make it clear that Uber has a plan: • There will not be a change in chief executive. The board of Uber is standing by Travis Kalanick, the chief executive, and prioritizing the search for a chief operating officer to help him. • The board also wanted to show, during a hastily announced conference call with reporters, that executives had a plan to get the company back on track after a series of revelations that have left the company in turmoil. The company intends to overhaul the human resources department, solicit feedback from concerned employees, issue a report on diversity and start an investigation into workplace culture. Sometimes, no amount of deal making can help bricks-and-mortar stores face the challenges of online commerce. Walmart Stores may have announced the creation of an investment arm that it hopes will help it compete in a world of retail that has been upended by e-commerce, but Sears Holdings is facing “substantial doubt” about whether it can survive at all. “Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” the company, which owns Sears and Kmart, said in a filing. The two icons of American retail were brought together by Edward S. Lampert, a hedge fund manager who has since shut down stores, reorganized the company and pushed for a greater online presence. Sears also sold its Craftsman tool brands in an effort to make the company leaner. "
820,Why Trump’s N.I.H. Cuts Should Worry Us,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/opinion/why-trumps-nih-cuts-should-worry-us.html?searchResultPosition=109,2017/03/22,OPINION,"Last week I was in London to participate in a scientific symposium. During coffee breaks, many British colleagues asked me and other American visitors to explain the bewildering news that President Trump had announced his intention to cut the budget for the National Institutes of Health by 18.3 percent, about $5.8 billion. My answer to “What is going on?” did include some consoling reminders. A presidential budget request is a proposal, not a done deal. The actual fiscal year 2018 appropriation for the N.I.H. will be determined by Congress, which has historically provided enthusiastic bipartisan support for biomedical research. Although the N.I.H. has lost a substantial amount of its spending power gradually over the past decade, it has only rarely experienced a sharp decline in actual dollars and never of this magnitude. Furthermore, strong nonpartisan opposition to Mr. Trump’s proposal will come from many quarters, including advocates of research on specific diseases. But it would be a mistake to be complacent about the president’s proposal, because it is likely to have real consequences. Yes, some have said that the proposed cut to the N.I.H. will be dead on arrival in Congress. But the president’s budget proposal is still important: The administration’s representatives will need to defend it at hearings, and it could be the starting point for negotiations among appropriators. It is not difficult to imagine a compromise in which the N.I.H. suffers a steep reduction. To understand just how devastating a cut of less than 20 percent of an agency’s budget would be requires some understanding of how the N.I.H. operates. Very little of its typical annual budget is spent on the agency’s administration: The industrious, underpaid government scientists who manage the funding of the N.I.H.’s research programs consume less than 5 percent of its budget. Only a bit more, about 10 percent, supports the work of government scientists. In sharp contrast, over 80 percent of its resources are devoted to competitively reviewed biomedical research projects, training programs and science centers, affecting nearly every district in the country. The N.I.H. awards multiyear grants and contracts, but receives annual appropriations that must be spent that year. This means that at the start of each year most of its dollars are already committed to recipients of awards from prior years. A budget cut of the size that is proposed would effectively prevent the awarding of new grants or the renewal of any that have reached the end of a multiyear commitment. Junior scientists, already struggling in a highly competitive atmosphere, may not get a chance to have an academic career. Senior investigators might need to lay off staff, disrupting research teams and leaving projects unfinished. "

Mr. Kony and his violent guerrilla group, the Lord’s Resistance Army, gained worldwide attention after the social media video “Kony 2012” was viewed more than 100 million times on YouTube. The L.R.A. is notorious for its use of child soldiers but has also carried out massacres, sexual violence, mutilations, pillage and abductions. The Pentagon’s Africa Command now wants to shift from a counterinsurgency operation against the guerrilla group to building African defense institutions and a more narrow pursuit of Mr. Kony, whose fighting force has dwindled to about 100 soldiers from a peak of 3,000. That change could free up perhaps dozens of the approximately 150 United States troops now assigned to the effort, allowing them to undertake other Special Operations missions. A decision on renewing the mission for six more months is scheduled for April, but the Trump administration, even before taking office, signaled its desire for change in a series of questions from its transition team to the State Department. “The L.R.A. has never attacked U.S. interests, why do we care?” the Trump transition team asked. “I hear that even the Ugandans are looking to stop searching for him, since they no longer view him as a threat, so why do we?” Mr. Kony and his militant force emerged in Uganda in 1987 to fight against President Yoweri Museveni. From 1987 to 2006, the armed group abducted more than 20,000 children to use as soldiers, servants or sex slaves, according to Unicef. The group’s violence has displaced more than 2.5 million people, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center reports. "

A single man of large fortune; with many admirers and speaking engagements!” Now the internet is a creature of mean understanding, too much information and uncertain temper. But the experience of 20 years online has enabled me to understand something of her character. And in this case she has fastened on something genuinely interesting, a truth increasingly fretted over: many aspects of culture, high and low, that once seemed securely in liberalism’s possession appear to be vulnerable to appropriation by the alt-right.

Director Mike Pompeo and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Dear Sirs, I am writing you today as the five adults with the most integrity in the Trump administration. Mattis, McMaster and Kelly, you all served our nation as generals in battle. Pompeo, you graduated first in your class at West Point and served as a cavalry officer. Tillerson, you ran one of America’s largest companies. I am writing you directly because I believe you are the last “few good men” who can stand up and reverse the moral rot that has infected the Trump administration from the top. The last time our country faced such a cancer on the presidency, the Republican Party’s leadership stood up and put country before party to get to the truth. But today’s G.O.P. is a pale imitation of that party. With a few exceptions, it has declared moral bankruptcy and abdicated its responsibility to draw any red lines for President Trump. To begin, I ask those of you who honored our country as military officers how you would have reacted if your commanding officer had charged his predecessor with a high crime that violated his constitutional oath — and then a few weeks later this charge was exposed as false by the top military judge advocate? And Secretary Tillerson, how would your former corporate board have reacted if a top executive at Exxon Mobil had accused a predecessor of a major act of malfeasance and the F.B.I. then told the board the claims were false?

As president, however, he is being urged by fringe-right groups and raging extremists to sign a “religious liberty” executive order that would allow discrimination against gays, women and religious minorities. As one Republican to another, I’d like to offer this bit of advice to President Trump: Don’t do it. I wish it were as simple as pointing out that supporting discrimination against anyone is just a bad idea and that doing so in the name of religion is hypocritical as well. But just for good measure, I’ll offer a few more reasons. The prospective executive order would authorize wide-ranging, taxpayer-funded discrimination against women, gays and members of minority faiths across federal programs and services. For example, a Social Security Administration employee could cite his religious beliefs to refuse benefits to the surviving spouse of a married same-sex couple. The idea itself is extraordinarily unpopular. According to an August poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, 63 percent of Americans oppose these religious exemptions, and only 30 percent back them. The survey affirms what polling has found over the last several years: Americans are becoming more tolerant and inclusive, with support for equal rights continuing to grow. Sixty-two percent of Americans in the survey say they favor same-sex marriage, compared with 47 percent just five years ago. But Mr. Trump, if you don’t trust the polls, then trust the people. When a White House draft of the executive order was leaked several weeks ago (yes, I know that’s painful), it unleashed a wave of negative news coverage and backlash from voters across the country. Most of them were plain dumbfounded, wondering why a president who just days before had crowned himself a steadfast supporter of the L.G.B.T. community would even consider signing an executive order that would license discrimination. Even faith leaders (400 of them) sent you a letter last month urging you not to further pursue this executive order, reasoning that, because religion is already fully protected under the law, this would then amount to something even worse: taxpayer-funded discrimination.

825,Tweeting Toward Oblivion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/opinion/tweeting-toward-oblivion.html?searchResultPosition=105,2017/03/22,OPINION,"Donald Trump faces a stark choice. He can tweet, or he can govern. He can indulge his persecution complex, firing off missives that compare Barack Obama to Joseph McCarthy and American intelligence officers to Nazis, or he can recognize it as a gateway to disgrace and irrelevance. He can make his presidency about his own viscera, or he can make it about the country’s welfare. He can do what feels cathartic in the moment, or he can do what’s constructive in the long run. He can dabble in bright colors and shiny objects, or he can deal in durable truths. I’m focusing on Twitter because it teases out his worst traits. It’s the theater for vainglorious, vindictive, impulsive Trump, and it was the realm in which he made the wild accusations that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. On Monday, James Comey debunked those charges, certifying them as the gaseous fulminations we more or less knew they were. And through much of Tuesday, Trump’s personal Twitter account essentially went dark. There was nothing from the hours around dawn, which is when he typically visits with his darkest vapors. There was only anodyne stuff later on: a shout-out to the scientists at NASA, a salute to American farmers. Either someone in his orbit convinced him, at least briefly, of the damage he was doing and the miserable situation he’s in, or Trump himself summoned some wisdom and restraint. He must be capable of that. Can he continue it? It could be argued that every presidency is a tug of war between private demons and the public interest, between the commander in chief’s indulgence of his own psychological needs and his attentiveness to the hard work of America. With Trump it’s a furiously pitched battle, and the demons are way out ahead. "
826,Why People Continue to Believe Objectively False Things,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/upshot/why-objectively-false-things-continue-to-be-believed.html?searchResultPosition=104,2017/03/22,THE UPSHOT,"“Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,” goes the saying — one that now seems like a relic of simpler times. Today, President Trump is sticking with his own facts — his claim that the Obama administration wiretapped him during the election — in the face of testimony to the contrary by the F.B.I. director, James Comey. When asked about the accusations Mr. Trump had made on Twitter, Mr. Comey told a Senate committee on Monday, “I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the F.B.I.” Other government authorities have come to similar conclusions. But Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said after the hearing that Mr. Trump stood by his wiretap allegations despite Mr. Comey’s testimony. Mr. Trump’s claims may appear to his opponents to have been embarrassingly debunked. But social science research suggests that Mr. Trump’s alternative version of reality may appeal to his supporters. Partisan polarization is now so extreme in the United States that it affects the way that people consume and understand information — the facts they believe, and what events they think are important. The wiretapping allegations could well become part of a partisan narrative that is too powerful to be dispelled. "

Do you think this is the best time for a show like this? It is the most perfect time possible. There is no medium on this earth that has more power to transform the way that people think about others than television. You received some backlash after the first episode, in which you featured a Hindu sect that engaged in cannibalism, and critics called it sensationalist. You have to admit you couldn’t have filmed that without thinking, This is going to make good television. Of course. It is actually a relatively brief part of the episode, and you come to a fairly profound conclusion about Hinduism, but people didn’t really talk about that. Do you think TV is an ideal place to educate people about different religions? Can it accommodate nuance? Look at what’s happening with Islamophobia or anti-Semitism: 1 percent of the population of America is Muslim. Two percent is Jewish. You could very likely be born, raised, grow old and die in America without ever once setting eyes upon a Muslim or a Jew. And so the only Muslims or Jews that you will ever be exposed to are the ones on television. If bigotry is a result of fear and not ignorance, then to me that becomes the medium through which to dispel fear of the other. You were raised Muslim, but you briefly departed from the faith in your youth and ended up having an “intellectual conversion” back to Islam as an adult. What did that look like? I grew up in Iran in a fairly secularized Muslim family. We came to the United States, and for the first time I realized that my religious faith was an issue. This was a time of tremendous anti-Muslim and anti-Iranian sentiment in the U.S. because of the Iran hostage crisis. I separated myself as much as possible from my culture and religion and converted to Christianity in high school. Once you’re a Christian, that’s your “you belong here” card. Apparently because you didn’t want people to know that you were from Iran, you used to tell people you were Mexican. Yeah, that tells you how little I knew about America. I didn’t realize you guys don’t like Mexicans either. "

efore I set sail with Tim and Karen Bartel on their 52-foot Bluewater yacht, Let It Ride, I didn’t tend to think of water as a place. I learned my geography by that wooden map of the United States — the jigsaw puzzle of the lower 48 with the inset Hawaii and Alaska to the side. The puzzle-piece states were the places to go, and everything else was just negative space. You could not visit the compass rose in the corner, nor the unvarnished pine off the coast of Oahu. The winding Mississippi and proboscoid Great Lakes gave shape to the puzzle but didn’t qualify as destinations themselves. In a nation transfixed by the dream of the road trip, a river is just a reason for a tunnel or a bridge. But if you let your eyes go blurry, you might imagine the inverse — the young woman hidden in the profile of the old hag. Inland water isn’t merely a breach in the freeway, but an intricate arterial network of its own, explorable by boat if you happen to have one. By this reverse image, the eastern half of the United States is an island, circumnavigable by water across the Great Lakes, down the Mississippi and into the Gulf of Mexico, then back up north along the shores of the Atlantic. In 2016, some 150 boaters circled the length of this so-called Great Loop — setting sail from any point along the way and crossing their own wakes about 6,000 miles later. These Loopers, as they call themselves, are mostly retirees traveling as couples, on boats named things like Living Life and Last Chance. The culture coalesces around the A.G.L.C.A. — America’s Great Loop Cruisers’ Association — a club and online forum for all things Great Loop. I emailed the A.G.L.C.A.’s director in search of a boat to take me aboard for a couple of days. The Bartels, sight unseen, said they would let me ride along as they knocked off the Central Florida leg of their Loop. I had never traveled the United States by water. Tim and Karen are in their mid-50s and wear Crocs and a lot of boat-themed shirts. They began in Ohio on Sept. 2 and set out from Fairport Harbor, bound for Fairport Harbor. Traveling Lake Erie up into Lake Huron, their boat continued north along Michigan’s shore, rounding the mitten at Mackinac Island before heading south around Charlevoix. Lake Michigan carried them into Chicago. From there, they passed through a chute of widening waters: the Calumet, the Illinois, the Mississippi. At Kimmswick, Mo., almost all Loopers stop at Hoppie’s, the last marina with gas until the Tennessee. Their progress from there was a series of detours — up the Cumberland, onto the Tennessee, to the Tenn-Tom — leading them eventually into the Gulf of Mexico near Mobile, Ala. Along the shores of the gulf, there is a fork in the Loop where a boat must either circle the Florida Peninsula or cut across the state by the Okeechobee Waterway. Each route is preceded by the same open-water crossing: 200 miles from a small town on the panhandle called Apalachicola, through the gulf into Clearwater harbor. Tim and Karen crossed the gulf with another boat called Shell Bell, piloted by two Loopers who had done this leg before. They ran Let It Ride for 25 hours straight, taking turns napping in the cabin below. This was the longest Karen ever manned the wheel — alone for three hours, trailing Shell Bell’s light. Tim woke as the lip of a thick fog unfurled, and together they followed the radar to port. From Clearwater, they floated down to the start of the Okeechobee canal in Fort Myers. When I arrived at the marina in Fort Myers on Feb. 15, they had been living on the water for more than five months. "

Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein of the Air Force made the remarks against the backdrop of a reassessment by the Trump administration of American nuclear policy, including whether nuclear disarmament, as advocated in 2010 under President Barack Obama, is a realistic goal. General Weinstein, the deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration, said in an interview on Tuesday with editors at The New York Times that he believed that history had shown that nuclear deterrence had basically kept the peace between the major powers since the end of World War II. The general expressed confidence that the United States’ nuclear arsenal remained effective, saying, “I sleep very well at night.” But like an aging vehicle, the general said, the arsenal is overdue for an overhaul. “When you look at our deterrent, it was really built in the 1960s,” he said, and was last updated in the 1980s. “It should have happened in 2000 and 2001,” the general said, but “obviously our country was a little bit busy in 2001 based on another horrific act.” Although the Obama administration spoke of its aspiration to eliminate nuclear weapons around the world, it did designate tens of billions of dollars to upgrade nuclear laboratories and prolong the lives of aging warheads.

He said was merely acting as a lawyer. ■ Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat, pushed Judge Gorsuch to say whether a president has constitutional powers to lawfully override torture and wiretap statutes. Judge Gorsuch said he would approach such a case using analysis set out when President Harry S. Truman tried to seize steel mills. ■ Mr. Leahy also pressed Judge Gorsuch to say whether he would recuse himself from Supreme Court cases involving the Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz, who was a former client and helped get him appointed to the appeals court. Judge Gorsuch did not answer directly. ■ The nominee would not discuss whether President Trump’s business dealings with foreign governments might run afoul of the Emoluments Clause, an obscure constitutional provision that the judge said “has sat in a rather dusty corner” until recently. ■ Judge Gorsuch defended his originalist judicial philosophy, assuring skeptics that “no one is looking to return us to the horse-and-buggy days.” ■ When asked about his views on cameras recording Supreme Court proceedings, Judge Gorsuch would say only that he would keep an open mind.

Trump pledged that his business empire would forgo new deals abroad while he was president. But as the Trump Organization unveils a new brand of hotels, that promise is not preventing the company from bringing foreign deals home. The company, now largely run by Mr. Trump’s eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., has been pursuing a downtown Dallas hotel project with a real estate firm that has deep Turkish roots. The hotel, if built, would fall under the Trump Organization’s Scion chain, a more affordable alternative to its five-star luxury line. An examination by The New York Times of records including corporation registrations, private emails and archived websites found that Alterra Worldwide, the real estate firm that would own the hotel and be partners with the Trumps, has business ties in Russia, Kazakhstan and at least two dozen other countries. Ordinarily, such international experience would be a selling point for the firm, but it is a complicating factor when dealing with Mr. Trump’s company, where concerns already have been raised internally about some of Alterra’s foreign connections. These revelations show that as the Trump Organization rolls out its new hotel line across the country — properties that the Trumps will manage and their partners will own — a partnership with Alterra may invite the foreign entanglements and potential conflicts of interest that the company said it sought to avoid in its international dealings. Alterra’s president, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, is a familiar face in Dallas, where he has recruited foreign investment to other developments that earned praise from city officials. Mr. Sarimsakci — who goes by Mike, or, alternatively, the “Turkish Trump” — is also listed on an expert consultant website charging $465 an hour for advice on doing business in such countries as Iran, Mexico and Nigeria. And he has counseled the governments of Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Sudan and Georgia, among others, on renewable energy, he acknowledged to The Times. His brother and longtime business partner, Yusuf Sarimsakci, has helped oversee numerous developments around the world, including the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow near the Kremlin, the hotel where Mr. Trump stayed in 2013 while his Miss Universe pageant came to town. On that project, Yusuf worked with a wealthy Kazakh businessman who has ties to the strong-arm leader of that country. "

Gorsuch continued to be questioned Wednesday at his confirmation hearing, but the real struggle over his nomination to the Supreme Court is already well on its way to the Senate floor. Republicans reveled in the nominee’s gaffe-free performance — one Democrats found a tad too scripted and stuffed with a lot of gollys and gees — and are ready to move ahead as quickly as they can. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, was emphatic Tuesday that Mr. Gorsuch would be seated on the Supreme Court before the Senate leaves for its April recess in two weeks. At the same time, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accused Judge Gorsuch of being evasive in his testimony, which stretched more than 10 hours. He insisted that the nomination would require 60 votes for approval when Republicans hold just a 52-seat majority and not a single Democratic senator has committed to supporting him. Those conflicting positions provide the inflammatory ingredients for a floor showdown. Mr. McConnell seemed to be laying the groundwork for a move to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on Supreme Court nominees if Democrats hold firm. “If Judge Gorsuch can’t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?” Mr. McConnell asked.

Matt Bevin of Kentucky was unrestrained in his praise for President Trump: Opening for him at a rally on Monday, Mr. Bevin, a conservative Republican, echoed Mr. Trump’s “America First” slogan and only gently noted the nagging divisions in their party. “We now have a president and a Congress that are united in party, and yet we still have disagreements among us,” Mr. Bevin said, insisting, “This is healthy and good.” In private, Mr. Bevin has been blunter about the party’s disagreements. Just days before appearing with Mr. Trump in Louisville, he joined a conference call with the president’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, to protest a White House proposal to defund the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development agency that spans 13 states and steers millions of dollars in federal money to Kentucky. Mr. Bevin was not alone in his dismay. As Mr. Trump and his advisers press for bone-deep cuts to the federal budget, Republican governors have rapidly emerged as an influential bloc of opposition. They have complained to the White House about reductions they see as harmful or arbitrary, and they plan to pressure members of Congress from their states to oppose them. Of acute concern to Republicans are a handful of low-profile programs aimed at job training and economic revitalization, including regional development agencies like the Appalachian commission and the Delta Regional Authority, which serves eight Southern and Midwestern states, seven of them with Republican governors. They are also protective of grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a $3.4 billion job training program funded through the Labor Department. Mr. Trump’s budget office has proposed to eliminate or deeply slash funding for all of those programs, along with dozens of others. "

What Took So Long?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/theater/lynn-nottage-paula-vogel-broadway.html?searchResultPosition=94,2017/03/22,THEATER,"They are two of the nation’s pre-eminent playwrights. Each has won nearly every award their field has to offer, including the Pulitzer Prize. Each has written works that are staged around the world and have become required reading in college classes. And each has earned an admired position in the academy, teaching aspiring dramatists at Ivy League institutions. One milestone, however, has long eluded Paula Vogel and Lynn Nottage: Broadway. This spring, their conspicuous absence comes to an end. “Sweat,” Ms. Nottage’s timely exploration of stressed relationships among a group of friends in a working-class city battered by industrial layoffs, opens Sunday, March 26, at Studio 54; “Indecent,” Ms. Vogel’s retrospective dramatization of the rise and fall of a play deemed scandalous during an ill-fated journey from the Yiddish theater to Broadway, opens April 18 at the Cort Theater. “It’s about damn time,” said Marsha Norman, also a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and co-director of the Juilliard playwrights program, who called Ms. Vogel and Ms. Nottage “the heroes of generations of women writers and readers, actors and audiences.” She added, “Thank you, universe.” The fact that these two writers are just now making their Broadway debuts raises uncomfortable questions for the theater industry, which season after season sees plays by men vastly outnumber plays by women in the all-important commercial spaces where money can be made, reputations burnished and Tony Awards won. “Indecent” and “Sweat” are the only new plays by women this Broadway season; by contrast, there are eight new plays by men (none of whom has credentials comparable to those of Ms. Vogel and Ms. Nottage). The disparity is sometimes worse; in 2013-14 there were no new plays by women. Such imbalance remains a striking incongruity for Broadway, where an estimated 67 percent of the audience is women. "

But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump got an assist from a powerful House Republican who said the president or his closest associates may have been “incidentally” swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, introduced the new claim into the deepening controversy over Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Yet Mr. Nunes also told reporters on Wednesday that he had no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claim that he was directly or personally wiretapped. Democrats quickly denounced the disclosure and said it bolstered the need for an independent investigation to replace the House inquiry being led by Mr. Nunes. Mr. Trump responded positively to Mr. Nunes’s remarks. “I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found,” the president told reporters at the White House, evidently referring to sources Mr. Nunes said he would not name. Mr. Trump said he felt vindicated, up to a point. “I somewhat do,” he said. Mr. Nunes acknowledged that the incidental intelligence gathering on Trump associates — during the presidential transition late last year, when Mr. Obama was in office — was not necessarily unlawful. American intelligence agencies typically monitor foreign officials of allied and hostile countries, and they routinely sweep up communications linked to Americans who may be taking part in the conversation or are being spoken about. The real issue, Mr. Nunes told reporters, was that he could figure out the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. He said some Trump associates were also identified by name in the reports. Normally, intelligence agencies mask the identities of American citizens who are incidentally present in intercepted communications. "

It was the first time that the United States had carried out an air assault with Syrian fighters in its campaign against the Islamic State, and the mission, which began Tuesday, reflected the leeway the Trump administration has given its commanders to carry out operations without prolonged review in Washington. In a significant commitment of American forces, American helicopters ferried fighters across enemy lines while Marine Corps howitzers, Army Apache attack helicopters and American warplanes provided firepower for the operation. Army surface-to-surface Himars rockets, which are based in northern Syria, are also part of the mission. American Special Operations forces were advising the Syrian fighters on the ground, although a military spokesman said they were not involved in direct, front-line combat. The mission represented a new stage in the broader offensive to cut off and seize Raqqa. Its objective was to take control of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River near Lake Assad, the nearby town of Tabqa and a local airfield. An immediate goal was to take the dam intact, but the structure was still under the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and officials said that the fighting was intense. “The fighting is raging on as I speak and is expected to last several weeks until the dam, airfield and city are free from ISIS control,” said Col. Joseph E. Scrocca, a spokesman for the American-led command in Baghdad. As the operation unfolded, Syrian state television and local residents asserted that at least 30 Syrian civilians were killed in an airstrike that hit a school where they had taken shelter in a rural area of Raqqa Province on Tuesday. American military officials acknowledged that the United States had been carrying out airstrikes in the area. These officials said they could not confirm the reports of civilian casualties, but would investigate. "

Gorsuch, has been criticized for using. The federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act requires “free appropriate public education” for all children. In multiple cases, the federal Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, has held that the law demands little “more than de minimis” — merely a program intended for a student to show some annual gains. “It cannot be the case that the Act typically aims for grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who can be educated in the regular classroom, but is satisfied with barely more than de minimis progress for those who cannot,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for a unanimous court. “When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing ‘merely more than de minimis’ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,” he wrote. “The IDEA demands more. It requires an educational program reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child’s circumstances.” In a 2008 ruling, Judge Gorsuch, who sits on the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, applied the “de minimis” standard in rejecting a parents’ claim that a school’s provisions for their autistic child were inadequate. Since Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court by President Trump, some Democrats have cited that and other opinions as evidence that the judge hews to an extreme conservative philosophy. At about the same time that Chief Justice Roberts was announcing the decision on Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch was questioned about the issue in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

843,North Korea Said to Be Target of Inquiry Over $81 Million Cyberheist,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/business/dealbook/north-korea-said-to-be-target-of-inquiry-over-81-million-cyberheist.html?searchResultPosition=55,2017/03/22,DEALBOOK,"Federal prosecutors are investigating North Korea’s possible role in the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh in what security officials fear could be a new front in cyberwarfare. The United States attorney’s office in Los Angeles has been examining the extent to which the North Korea government aided and abetted the bold heist in February 2016, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. In the theft, the attackers, using a global payment messaging system known as Swift, were able to persuade the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to move money from the Bangladesh bank to accounts in the Philippines. The Swift system is used by some 11,000 banks and companies to transfer money from one country to another. In the months that followed the Bangladesh heist, it was disclosed that cyberthieves had also attacked banks in Vietnam and Ecuador using Swift. North Korea’s involvement in the attack on the Bangladesh bank had not been publicly known until The New York Times reported last May that security researchers had found evidence that pointed to the country. The researchers discovered that a rare piece of code used in the theft had also been used in the hacking attack on Sony Pictures in December 2014. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles are also investigating the Sony breach, and what they uncovered in that inquiry led them to examine the bank theft. "

he scientist cried when he saw the evidence” — that was the detail from our article about the death and bleaching of Australia’s magnificent Great Barrier Reef that a former New York Times colleague grabbed onto and tweeted out. To some, the story was about climate change and the fragility of underwater ecosystems. To others, it was an emotional tale of life and avoidable death, of beauty lost to human failure. Our editors seemed to have both elements in mind; they pushed Justin Gillis and I to add more detail about why damage to the reef mattered, leading us to explain that the death of coral reefs worldwide could rob the world of not just colorful creatures, but also tourism income and human lives because of all the millions of people who get their protein primarily from reef fish. That editorial challenge — how to make people think deeply about subjects that may seem dense, or just distant — can be found embedded in much of the best work The Times produces. (Nick Casey’s profile of Diego, the Galápagos tortoise saving his species with his formidable sex drive, is another marvel of science made shareable.) And yet, there are often details that never get into even our most impactful efforts. In my experience, this is especially true for those that require a lot of explaining, as the reef story did. For example, I didn’t get a chance to tell you that when Terry Hughes — the reef scientist at the heart of our story — flies over the Great Barrier Reef to conduct surveys, there is a lifeboat between the seats of the small charter plane he uses because they are flying so low and slow that the chance of crashing is severe.

845,Why Medicaid Work Requirements Won’t Work,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/opinion/why-medicaid-work-requirements-wont-work.html?searchResultPosition=58,2017/03/22,OPINION,"WASHINGTON — Paul Ryan’s plan to replace Obamacare is headed to the House floor on Thursday for a vote that, even now, could go either way. That may sound surprising since Republicans have a sizable majority in the House. But if you’ve been following the debate over their replacement plan, the American Health Care Act, you know that, as harsh as it is, it’s not draconian enough for some members of Speaker Ryan’s party. In an attempt to win over those lawmakers, the Republican leadership has offered ideas to restrict coverage even further. One of the worst is a Medicaid work requirement. That may sound sensible to conservatives who, contrary to evidence, believe that Medicaid receipt discourages work. But it’s a mistake. Not only would this proposal make an already punishing bill even harsher, but it also constitutes an unnecessary add-on that has nothing to do with the purpose of Medicaid. Most poor people who can work do: A recent study of adults affected by Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, for example, found that 87 percent of able-bodied beneficiaries were working, looking for work or in school. Of the remaining 13 percent, it found, “three-quarters report they are not working in order to care for family members and the rest report other reasons, like being laid off.” Most other able-bodied people already receiving Medicaid before the expansion are also working, raising the question of what problem, exactly, the proposed requirement is meant to solve.

846,Leaders Struggle to Unite House Republicans Behind Health Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/politics/health-care-vote-republicans.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/03/22,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act faced an uncertain fate on Wednesday as conservative Republicans pushed to eliminate federal requirements that health insurance plans provide certain benefits to consumers. House Republican leaders met with members of their party late into the night on Wednesday as they struggled to muster support for the bill, scheduled for a vote on the House floor on Thursday. President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, worked through the day to placate conservative House Republicans who said that the bill did not do enough to lower health insurance costs by reducing federal regulations. The legislation would roll back major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a significantpillar of President Barack Obama’s legacy. But in trying to satisfy conservatives, the Trump administration and House Republican leaders risked jeopardizing support for the bill among more moderate Republicans. On the eve of the crucial vote, party leaders appeared to be short of a majority and were working into the night to whip their members into line. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, expressed optimism on Wednesday night that talks with Republican leaders would lead to revisions to the bill. “We’re encouraged tonight, just based on the real willingness of not only the White House, but our leadership, to make this bill better,” Mr. Meadows said, crediting the personal involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence.

Gorsuch continued to answer with practiced generalities on Wednesday, frustrating Democrats who seemed unable to rattle him or pin him down. “You have been very much able to avoid any specificity like no one I have seen before,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “And maybe that’s a virtue, I don’t know. But for us on this side, knowing where you stand on major questions of the day is really important to a vote.” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said he was searching to find “a beating heart and an independent streak” behind Judge Gorsuch’s testimony. After trying over a span of 20 hours over two days, Democrats were not able to move Judge Gorsuch off script. Instead, interest in the hearing seemed to wane, and many in the Capitol came to view a confirmation as inevitable. Judge Gorsuch managed to endure as much by what he did not say as by what he did. Most Supreme Court nominees are fairly reticent, but Democrats said Judge Gorsuch outdid the last two Republican appointees, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. They gave their views on seminal Supreme Court decisions, said Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. “We’ve had justices nominated by Republican presidents who have been willing to discuss past precedent,” Mr. Leahy said. “I was just kind of hoping you would be as transparent as these prior nominees were.” "
848,President Trump’s Reckless Shame Game,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/opinion/president-trumps-reckless-shame-game.html?searchResultPosition=57,2017/03/22,OPINION,"President Trump’s Homeland Security Department turned its immigration purge — and assault on the Constitution — up a notch this week. It posted the first of what it says will be weekly online reports identifying state and local law enforcement agencies that decline its requests to keep immigrants in jail to give federal agents time to pick them up. The idea is to name and shame these agencies, accusing them of recklessly loosing dangerous aliens onto the streets. The report, on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website, trumpets itself as a “Public Safety Advisory.” It includes a grim warning from the acting ICE director, Thomas Homan, about the agency’s requests, called detainers: “When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission.” The accusation is dishonest. The report is a sham. And the claim of protecting public safety is ridiculous — dangerously so. When local authorities decline to honor ICE detainers, they can have any number of good reasons for doing so. A likely one is the Fourth Amendment, which forbids imprisoning anyone without justification. If a police department is about to release someone who posts bail, it can’t prolong the detention — in essence, arrest that person again — just because ICE asks it to. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the local police cannot be forced to honor a detainer in violation of the Constitution. That is, without an arrest warrant from a judge. Which an ICE detainer is not. Beyond the constitutional problems lies an argument about public safety, which also finds the Trump administration on the wrong side of the facts, in service of a campaign of fear. Mr. Trump has been trying to make Americans fear unauthorized immigrants. He has succeeded in making these immigrants terrified of him, having declared open season on the undocumented, in effect making every one of 11 million people a priority for deportation. Nobody — not parents of citizen children, not students, not those with clean records and deep American roots — is above suspicion or safe from arrest. "

Now he is contending with a thicket of ethical and legal considerations as his former boss — Donald J. Trump — serves as president. But Mr. Danziger, previously a top executive at such huge brands as Wyndham and Starwood, is plowing ahead with plans for the company’s new Scion chain of hotels. These hotels will offer a four-star alternative to the company’s five-star luxury properties. Already, Mr. Danizger said, the company has signed some 30 letters of intent with potential developers in places such as Cincinnati, Nashville and Valley Forge, Pa. The partners would own the hotels while the Trump company brands and manages them. None of the deals have been completed, and all are subject to the approval of an outside ethics adviser. One of the potential deals — to build a Scion hotel in downtown Dallas — has already led to questions about the international connections of the local partner. Last week, Mr. Danziger spoke to The New York Times about Scion and the issues that the new hotels present for the company. Below are excerpts from the interview. How closely involved are Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump in Scion and in meeting with partners? Very much. And when Ivanka was involved, too. That’s why I joined this company. They really are incredible people. They are deeply involved in the hotel company’s growth and branding efforts. They will meet with anyone if I ask them to. "

The message continued, “Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan.” Mr. Trump, the oldest son of President Trump, was calling attention to an article from September in The Independent, a British newspaper, that described Mr. Khan’s reaction to a bombing then in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. Mr. Trump mischaracterized the London mayor’s remarks. Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as “part of living in a big city,” as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was “part and parcel of living in a great global city.” “That means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities; it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice,” Mr. Khan said in a video interview published by The Evening Standard, another British paper. (For the record, Mr. Khan did say the victims of the Chelsea bombing were in his “thoughts and prayers.”) "
852,"As Rivals Stand Silent, One Health Insurer Protests G.O.P. Plan",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/health/molina-insurance-executive-republican-health-care-plan.html?searchResultPosition=66,2017/03/22,HEALTH,"LONG BEACH, Calif. — In recent weeks, Dr. J. Mario Molina has anxiously approached lawmakers on Capitol Hill and governors across the country, warning them that the Republican efforts to overhaul the health care system could be devastating for insurers and patients alike. As head of the California company founded by his father, Dr. Molina has become one of the few insurance executives publicly criticizing the House bill, which he believes could strip away coverage for millions of their clients and cause considerable turmoil for the insurance industry. The major insurers have mostly stayed silent during the debate, supporting some of the Republicans’ provisions that promise near-term stability for the insurance exchanges and a repeal of a tax on health insurance. But while big insurers like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna have already largely abandoned the individual marketplaces, Molina Healthcare has been a mainstay of the current federal health care law, offering Medicaid plans in 12 states and Puerto Rico. It has signed up about one million customers in the state marketplaces, and more than doubled its revenue in the last three years to nearly $18 billion. But now Dr. Molina, a Democrat who took over Molina Healthcare in 1996 and runs it with his brother and sister, is warily watching the Republicans’ bill in the House as it comes to an expected vote on Thursday. Provisions that would cap federal funding for Medicaid to the states or cut subsidies for lower-income people threaten to upend some of the markets where Molina and other insurers have been trying to cement a baseline clientele. Insisting that he is not bluffing, Dr. Molina said that his company might also have to abandon the individual market after this year because so much is in flux. The Senate has yet to debate measures that could deeply affect insurers, and Molina Healthcare just reported to investors last month that it lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 2016 because of what Dr. Molina, its chief executive, called flawed federal funding formulas. While the exit of other insurers has been problematic, a withdrawal by Molina “would be hugely damaging,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University. "

Judge Gorsuch may be another Antonin Scalia, but we are already accustomed to having that kind of “originalist” on the court. While I struggle with the originalist philosophy in the face of an ever-changing world, I think of Judge Gorsuch as the lesser of many other potential evils. It is a hopeless endeavor to try to get him to tip his hand on his views of the controversial issues of the day. But he seems to be smart, and we know he is experienced. He is certainly not on the lunatic fringe. He is by far the best nominee for any post that Mr. Trump has so far put forth. Democrats would be smart to leave him alone and focus the heavy artillery on health care and tax reform. PETER ALKALAY, SCARSDALE, N.Y. To the Editor: After reading “Comey Confirms Inquiry on Russia and Trump Allies” (front page, March 21), I see a significant possibility that our current president and his administration are illegitimate. Why, then, should confirmation hearings proceed for a Supreme Court nominee chosen by a president who is under a cloud of suspicion? The only sensible step is to delay hearings until it can be determined that the choice of Judge Neil Gorsuch was made by a legitimate president. Senate Republicans have to date had no issue with having a lengthy vacancy on the court. Democrats have a sound basis other than tit-for-tat to delay the Gorsuch hearings. TERRY EDER-KAUFMAN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Another Supreme Court confirmation hearing and we are once again treated to nonanswers, undying adherence to precedent, and professions of judicial objectivity — characterized memorably by Chief Justice John Roberts, who during his hearing said judges were like umpires who just called balls and strikes. Everybody knows this is a hollow cliché that isn’t even true for umpires, but still the ritual continues. "

According to The Times’s count, there are 22 Republicans who say they won’t support the bill, and another 17 leaning toward no. That’s more than the 21 Republicans that they can afford to lose. Most of the opposition is coming from conservative members, including the Freedom Caucus, but they also have a challenge among moderate members. On Monday, House leaders introduced a series of changes to the bill intended to lure additional support. Were most of the changes geared toward wavering moderates, or members on the right? Margot It’s definitely a mix. You can see different changes designed to appeal to different groups. The changes would make tax cuts take effect sooner and would allow some changes to Medicaid favored by conservatives, so those are plays for the right. But the changes don’t feel major to me. I can’t tell if they’re big enough to bring along Freedom Caucus members who are committed to full repeal or moderates who are worried about increases in the uninsured rate. Who do you think are the most gettable of the “no” votes, and what do they need? "

Bush administration. R. Alexander Acosta, the nominee for labor secretary, also defended his decision as the United States attorney in Southern Florida to offer a lenient plea deal to a wealthy New Yorker accused of paying underage girls for sexual acts. For nearly three hours in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Acosta, 48, defended his record, explained how he might deal with budget cuts to the department and dismissed the concerns of several senators who asked how he would avoid any pressure from the president to pass policies based on politics and not on the best interest of workers. Mr. Acosta, who would be the only Hispanic in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, promised not to evaluate workers based on their political leanings. “If confirmed, I will work to enforce the laws under the department’s jurisdiction fully and fairly,” Mr. Acosta said in his opening pitch to senators. “As a former prosecutor, I will always be on the side of the law and not any particular constituency.” Mr. Acosta, the dean of Florida International University’s law school, was nominated after the president’s first choice for labor secretary, the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder, withdrew from consideration after coming under fire for past labor practices and domestic abuse allegations. Mr. Acosta, a former prosecutor from Miami who headed the Justice Department’s civil rights division, appeared to be a far less contentious choice. But Democratic senators did not go easy on him.

This was London’s counterattack: to show that it takes more than a murderous rampage through Westminster to shut down this mighty city. Somber but undaunted, members of Parliament of all parties expressed their admiration for the courage of the police, doctors and nurses who had responded with such speed and vigor, rushing to help those who had been mowed down by car on Westminster Bridge. Five people died in the attack: a London teacher, an American visitor and a 75-year-old man; a police officer, Keith Palmer; and the attacker, who has been identified as a 52-year-old Briton, Khalid Masood. As many as 40 people were injured, several of whom remain in critical condition. The deputy speaker of the House, Lindsay Hoyle, voiced the feelings of all his colleagues when he described Constable Palmer as “one of our village policemen.” Westminster is indeed a village, and, as a commentator on Britain’s political scene, I treat it as my professional workplace. For all its architectural grandeur, it is really a noisy souk, a forum for gossip, ideas and haggling. Shortly before the attack, I had been to see a cabinet minister who was worried about a “difficult year ahead” for the government. When I returned, Parliament Square had been closed off by the police and the traffic was gridlocked. The sirens of ambulances told their own distressing story. “You’d think they’d have sorted it out, for God’s sake,” a taxi driver complained out of his open window, to nobody in particular. As callous as that might sound, it was the authentic voice of London: unfazed, querulous, eccentric. The city’s cabbies are more fearful of traffic than they are of “nutters with knives” (another Londonism I overheard as I walked across Vauxhall Bridge, trying to find a way home). Here’s what really counts: By Thursday morning, London was, if not quite back to normal, then certainly back in business. As I traveled through the south of the city, up to Chelsea and later over to King’s Cross, Londoners really were going about their lives as on any other day. "

But they disagree on the details: who should pay, and whether it should be mandatory or optional. The idea of a federal paid leave policy brings up issues that Americans have complicated feelings about — like government mandates for businesses and gender roles at home — according to the surveys, released Thursday by the Pew Research Center. This ambivalence helps explain a paradox: why a policy with so much bipartisan support has nonetheless failed to be enacted. The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t mandate paid leave. “There’s massive distrust of federal government mandates in the United States,” said Joan Williams, director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings. “Support for paid leave is depressed by the overall hostility to government.” In a first, presidential candidates from both parties talked supportively about paid leave, but the Trump administration’s proposal, led by Ivanka Trump, faces hurdles because of deep divisions about what the policy should look like. Yet the surveys make clear that the need crosses income, gender and political lines, and affects people’s career decisions and wages. "

Huh? And now he runs to the White House and the press with “leaked” information before showing it to the Democrats on his committee? (He has since apologized for that.) This information serves as a distraction that makes our president under investigation feel “somewhat” vindicated, which is total nonsense when this information could have come from the White House itself. This would be like Senator Sam Ervin, investigating the Watergate break-in, going to the Nixon White House to brief the president on information he had received. Mr. Nunes has demonstrated that we need a special select committee in Congress to investigate collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. My only question for both Mr. Nunes and President Trump is: How stupid do you think the American people really are? "
861,U.N.’s Famine Appeal Is Billions Shy of Goal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/world/africa/un-famine-nigeria-somalia-south-sudan-yemen.html?searchResultPosition=16,2017/03/23,AFRICA,"UNITED NATIONS — A month ago, the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, warned that 20 million people would fall into famine if his aid agencies could not corral $4.4 billion by the end of March. It is almost the end of March, and so far, the United Nations has received less than a tenth of the money — $423 million, according to its Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The funding appeal, and the paltry response, comes as the Trump administration is poised to make sharp cuts to its foreign aid budget, including for the United Nations. Historically, the United States has been the agency’s largest single donor for humanitarian aid. For all four countries at risk — Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen — the United States has given $277 million so far this year, not all of it for famine relief. The conditions for famine are specific and not easy to meet, which is why the last time a famine was declared was in Somalia in July 2011, after 260,000 had died of hunger and related complications. The three criteria for declaring a famine are when one in five households in a certain area face extreme food shortages; more than 30 percent of the population is acutely malnourished; and at least two people for every 10,000 die each day. A famine has already been declared in a swath of South Sudan. A similar risk looms over Somalia, still reeling from years of conflict, and Yemen, where Houthi insurgents are battling a Saudi-led coalition supported by the United States and Britain. "

Sex, Gender, Feminism
By Camille Paglia
Illustrated. 315 pages. Pantheon. $26.95. “One test of un homme sérieux,” Christopher Hitchens wrote, “is that it is possible to learn from him even when one radically disagrees with him.” By this measure, Camille Paglia is une femme sérieuse indeed. Her best book remains her first, “Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence From Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson” (1990), a surprise academic-press best seller about decadence in Western art. It grew out of her doctoral dissertation at Yale, where her mentor was Harold Bloom. If you’ve forgotten “Sexual Personae,” or have never read it, Paglia helpfully reprints a few chunks of it in her new essay collection, “Free Women, Free Men: Sex, Gender, Feminism.” These chunks are fiercely erudite, freewheeling and sex-drenched. Nothing else in this collection can touch them. Paglia’s second-best book is “Break, Blow, Burn: Camille Paglia Reads Forty-Three of the World’s Best Poems” (2006). Her exegeses are prickly and acute, the Helen Vendler-meets-Patti Smith grad seminar you wanted but never quite got. One reason Paglia gets under people’s skin is that she has no sacred cows. Reviewing “Break, Blow, Burn” in The New York Times Book Review, Clive James got at why she made some readers uncomfortable. “The most threatening thing about her, from the American viewpoint, is that she refuses to treat the arts as an instrument of civil rights,” he wrote. “Without talent, no entitlement.” "

President Trump is an exception. In an interview with Time magazine, published on Thursday, Mr. Trump veers from topic to topic, praising himself and dismissing his critics in language that sometimes is hard to follow. For a detailed fact-check into Mr. Trump’s assertions in this interview, see this New York Times article by Linda Qiu. Here are several passages from the interview, and analysis on what they show about how Mr. Trump thinks. If there’s one thing that Mr. Trump hates, it is being laughed at. That is clear from this response in the Time magazine interview, when the president dismissed the critics who found humor in his pursuit of the White House. It is also worth remembering how flustered and angry Mr. Trump appeared to be when President Barack Obama made fun of him — and made a roomful of people laugh — during the 2011 White House correspondent’s dinner. Mr. Trump has said he will not attend this year’s dinner. "

Another is $50,000 in the red, more than 18 months after first declaring a quixotic run for mayor. Two more have names that are familiar in Democratic political circles but little in the way of broad support. And the most recent does not have a New York City address, and may end up in federal court trying to get one. The race to become the next mayor of New York City is, for the moment, increasingly a contest between Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat newly invigorated by the conclusion of state and federal investigations into his campaign fund-raising that found no criminal wrongdoing, and Paul J. Massey Jr., a well-funded Republican hopeful. But beyond the klieg lights and chyrons of their million-dollar campaigns are more than a dozen other New Yorkers — and one real estate developer from San Diego — who have set their sights on City Hall. Although the outlook for most of them is not good, and several have done little more than file the necessary paperwork with the city’s campaign finance board, others may have a shot at shaking up — if not actually defeating — the campaigns of the de facto front-runners. Chief among them is Bo Dietl, a frequently profane retired police detective, former television personality and lifelong Republican who tried to re-register as a Democrat to run in the 2017 primary but filed the paperwork incorrectly and ended up outside both parties. He has raised about $390,000 in contributions, coming in a distant third after Mr. de Blasio (whom he calls “Big Bird”) and Mr. Massey (whom he has described as “Melba toast”). Despite declaring an independent run, Mr. Dietl has recently been privately courted by some Republican party leaders not entirely satisfied with Mr. Massey, who has fund-raising prowess but also a record of spending just as quickly. Three of the city’s five counties would have to agree to let Mr. Dietl run as a Republican. "

The person responsible for many of the threats, law enforcement officials said, was half a world away, in Israel, a Jewish teenager. An intensive investigation spanning multiple countries culminated on Thursday in the arrest of the 18-year-old suspect, who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship, and his father. The teenager’s lawyer said he had a brain tumor that could affect his behavior. The surge in threats over the past few months — well over 100 sent to Jewish community centers, schools and museums since the start of the year — coincided with an increase in hate crimes against a number of groups, from scrawled swastikas to homicides, feeding worries about a new era of bigotry. American and Israeli officials refused to say how many of those threats the suspect was accused of making. And some recent anti-Semitic acts were apparently committed by others, like threats against Jewish centers for which a Missouri man was charged, and the vandalizing of Jewish cemeteries. But officials made it clear that they considered the teenager, who lived in the Ashkelon area of southern Israel, to be the primary source of the threats, though they did not offer a motive. “This is the guy we are talking about,” an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said. The suspect made threats to sites in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States, and to at least one commercial airline flight, prompting an emergency landing, Mr. Rosenfeld said. A judge ordered the suspect, who has not been charged, held until at least March 30 and ordered a medical examination. His father was ordered held for eight days, on suspicion that he might have been aware of the threats, or even been involved. "

Members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus emerged from a negotiating session with President Trump without an agreement on changes to Republican’s health care bill that would satisfy them. But they were closer. “We’re certainly trying to get to ‘yes,’” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. “We’ve made very reasonable requests and we’re hopeful that those reasonable requests will be listened to and ultimately agreed to.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the president had agreed to the conservatives’ demands that the bill strip out a set of “essential benefits” required of insurance policies by the Affordable Care Act. Those include emergency services, ambulance coverage, maternity care and preventive health care. "
867,Democrats Plan to Filibuster to Thwart Gorsuch Nomination,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/democrats-filibuster-neil-gorsuch-nomination.html?searchResultPosition=29,2017/03/23,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee’s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber. As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump’s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation. While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch. The Senate’s “cloture” rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster. “After careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court,” Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuch’s record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence, adding, “My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.” Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster — a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions. If Democrats band together, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has threatened to pursue the so-called nuclear option eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court selections. Mr. Trump has urged Mr. McConnell to take that step if necessary. "

Trump, you have to give him this: He’s done more to shine a spotlight on the loopholes and fundamental unfairness of the tax code than any other American president. In doing so, he’s made a powerful case for tax reform, though perhaps not quite along the lines he has in mind. This, of course, has happened despite Mr. Trump’s strenuous efforts to conceal his returns, reneging on a campaign promise to release them at some point, and defying a decades-long tradition in which presidential candidates have made public, at minimum, their recent tax returns. What we’re left with are scraps from Mr. Trump’s voluminous tax filings that have been leaked to the news media by anonymous sources: his federal Form 1040 from 2005, disclosed last week by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, and a few pages of his 1995 state tax returns, which include some data from that year’s 1040, revealed by The New York Times last fall. Flimsy and incomplete as they are, those returns nonetheless contain some startling revelations. Last week’s disclosure, on the face of it, was pretty tame: In 2005 Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, paid $38.4 million in federal tax, or about 25 percent of a reported income of nearly $153 million. So for at least one year, Mr. Trump did pay a substantial amount in federal tax, and he made a lot of money — two claims he has made before that were greeted with a fair amount of skepticism. But scratch the surface, and a far more complicated and troubling picture emerges. On the line for “other income,” the Trumps reported negative $103 million. Tax experts told me that is almost certainly what was left of the $916 million loss reported on the 1995 returns reported by The Times, an amount that could be carried over and used to offset income in future years.

Has Another",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/election-fraud-voter-ids.html?searchResultPosition=31,2017/03/23,U.S.,"Of the 860,000 Nebraskans who cast ballots in last fall’s election, only two are suspected of casting fraudulent votes. But while the actual number of illegal voters may be minuscule, State Senator John Murante says, there is an even better reason for Nebraska’s Legislature to crack down on fraud at the ballot box. “First and foremost, we know the confidence that Americans and Nebraskans have in the election system is at an all-time low,” said Mr. Murante, a Republican who is backing a constitutional amendment that would require all voters to display photo IDs. “The perception exists that voter fraud is a serious issue, and that perception itself has to be addressed.” Nationwide, Republican state legislators are again sponsoring a sheaf of bills tightening requirements to register and to vote. And while they have traditionally argued that such laws are needed to police rampant voter fraud — a claim most experts call unfounded — some are now saying the perception of fraud, real or otherwise, is an equally serious problem, if not worse. Given Republicans’ history of raising undocumented claims of fraud, Democrats and voting rights advocates say that citing perceptions of tainted ballots as a reason for voting restrictions is disingenuous at best. “It seems strange that someone who created the problem of perception then says we have to solve the problem, when there is no problem,” said Lloyd Leonard, the advocacy director for the League of Women Voters, which has sued to block a number of restrictive voting laws. In states across the country, Republicans are echoing the Nebraska argument for anti-fraud measures. "

Global temperature records have been broken three years running. Arctic Sea ice is declining rapidly. Sea levels are rising. For some societies, such as small island nations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, environmental havoc is not a distant threat. It has arrived. To reduce the risk of a global environmental catastrophe, and to avoid reversing the course of human progress, the world must urgently bend the curve of global emissions away from fossil fuels. Global warming must be kept below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit); beyond that we will face major social and economic consequences. The math to keep the increase below that critical level doesn’t get much simpler. Emissions must peak no later than 2020, and we must reach a fossil-fuel-free world economy by 2050. National pledges made for the Paris Climate Agreement fall short. Indeed, the political landscape is dominated by governments willing to make only incremental progress: two steps forward and one step back, or giant leaps back, in the case of the United States, where President Trump has threatened to retreat from international climate action and has proposed devastating cuts in funding for climate science and international collaboration. The vast divide between what is necessary and what politicians are willing to do leaves many scientists nervous that we could blow our last chance to reduce the grave risk to our environment and world stability. Still, there are good reasons for cautious optimism. Despite the halting progress made by politicians, history shows that the modern world has been shaped by major moments of disruption. Think about the recent United States election, Brexit, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the rapid advances made in the technology sector in recent decades. "

The Story of Beauty, Inequality, and the Struggle for Oral Health in America
By Mary Otto
291 pp. The New Press. $26.95. Politicians, journalists and researchers have a long-running problem when it comes to talking about class. The definitions we use are myriad and not always overlapping. Is the boundary of the middle class a college degree, a certain level of income? Perhaps a certain type of job: a teacher or a doctor versus a coal miner or factory worker? We might be missing a still more useful — and more personal — indicator, however. This is the premise, though not so bluntly stated, of Mary Otto’s new book, “Teeth: The Story of Beauty, Inequality, and the Struggle for Oral Health in America.” The dividing line between the classes might be starkest between those who spend thousands of dollars on a gleaming smile and those who suffer and even die from preventable tooth decay. If the idea of death from tooth decay is shocking, it might be because we so rarely talk about the condition of our teeth as a serious health issue. Instead, we think of our teeth as the ultimate personal responsibility. We fear the dentist because we fear judgment as well as pain; we are used to the implication that if we have a tooth problem, if our teeth are decaying or crooked or yellow, it is because we have failed, and failed at something so intimate that it means we ourselves are failures. Otto’s book begins and ends with the story of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died of an infection caused by one decaying tooth, and the system that failed him. In pointing out the flaws in that system, Otto takes us back through the history of dentistry and shows us how the dental profession evolved, separately from the rest of health care, into a mostly private industry that revolves almost entirely around one’s ability to pay. In other words, all of the problems with health care in America exist in the dental system, but exponentially more so. On the high end of the $110 billion-a-year dental industry, there are veneers for $1,000 each, “gum contouring” and more than $1 billion per year spent on tooth whitening products. A dentist tells Otto that members of his profession “once exclusively focused upon fillings and extractions, are nowadays considered providers of beauty.” And thanks to decades of deregulation, allowing medical advertising and then medical credit cards, they are doing well at it — according to a 2010 study, dentists make more per hour than doctors.

Vance, through his decision to move back to Ohio to help citizens in need (“Why I’m Moving Home,” Op-Ed, March 16), exemplifies a great bipartisan American tradition: acknowledging personal fortune and giving back to community. Yet Mr. Vance’s exercise of J.F.K.’s plea to “ask what you can do for your country” is increasingly rare among the conservative elite. The presidency is being used to increase Trump family fortunes; Republican leaders cheer destruction of public services, from Steve Bannon’s purported wish to destroy the “administrative state” to Grover Norquist’s goal of drowning the American government in a bathtub; and Republican members of Congress bitterly denounce those taxes that pay for public protections and social programs while simultaneously lying to their own voters about everything from climate change to Obamacare. For the sake of the Republic, let us pray that more citizens in the mold of Mr. Vance emerge — citizens with conservative values who understand that caring for fellow community members is a large part of what makes America great.

You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Today is a big day in the House of Representatives — and for millions of Americans at risk of losing their health insurance. House Republicans are planning to bring up their health care bill for a vote, and it’s not clear whether the bill will pass. A quick summary: The bill would take away health insurance from an estimated 24 million people and raise costs for many older Americans. It would channel the savings into large tax cuts for the affluent. House leaders considered late changes to the bill Wednesday night, which would worsen it even further by cutting benefits for mental health services and pregnancy, among other things. And the leaders won’t wait for a full analysis of the changes by the Congressional Budget Office before voting today. Democrats and a few moderate Republicans — as well as groups representing doctors, nurses, hospitals, retirees and patient groups — oppose the bill, because of its general terribleness. Some conservative Republicans also oppose the bill, because it retains a larger government role in health care than they believe wise. But most Republicans support the bill. To pass, it needs at least 215 of the 237 House Republicans to vote for it. (A bill usually needs 218 votes, but five House seats are vacant and a Democrat may miss the vote in the wake of his wife’s death.) "

Armed with intelligence that some Republicans said bolstered President Trump’s widely disputed claim of being wiretapped by the Obama administration, Mr. Nunes bypassed Democrats and went directly to the White House. The new information, Mr. Nunes said, showed that American intelligence agencies monitoring foreign officials may have “incidentally” picked up communications of Trump transition team members. The move angered Democrats who said that Mr. Nunes’s attempt to buttress Mr. Trump’s accusation raised questions about his ability to conduct an impartial bipartisan investigation. The House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, issued a challenge, saying that Mr. Nunes had to decide whether he was chairman of an independent investigation or “is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both.” Mr. Nunes apologized on Thursday to committee members for sharing new information with Mr. Trump and the news media before communicating with Mr. Schiff, according to two Democrats on the committee. Mr. Nunes described his decision as a judgment call. “At the end of the day, sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you make the wrong one,” Mr. Nunes told reporters on Thursday. “But you’ve got to stick by the decisions you make.” "

In this podcast, the opinion columnist Andrew Rosenthal talks about the news — the good, the bad and the most maddening. Lets get the bad news out of the way. The week’s worst news, says Times columnist Andrew Rosenthal, is that “the Trump administration is well on its way to rolling back all of the progress on climate change that we made under President Obama, which was not all that much, and thereby eliminating any real chance we have for dealing with this planet-killing issue.” The president wants to gut the Environmental Protection Agency — and that’s just the start. “The circus freak show about the Russian connection and the president’s lies about being wiretapped by the Obama administration have to be the most maddening developments in the most maddening two months in modern political history,” says Mr. Rosenthal. When the F.B.I. director and head of the National Security Agency denied there had been wiretaps at Trump Tower, President Trump, says Mr. Rosenthal “began spinning a new conspiracy theory about the F.B.I. director somehow colluding with President Obama about the Russia connection. It’s incomprehensible. It’s ridiculous. But it’s not funny. It’s damaging — to the White House, to the presidency, to the country.” Lastly, the good news. Mr. Rosenthal says it is that “the nation’s Republican governors, who are an indispensable source of support for the Republican Party in general and the president in particular, are starting to push back on the administration’s budget cuts.” He notes that governors have powerful platforms: “If they keep telling the truth about what’s going on in Washington, who knows? Maybe people will actually start paying attention.” Susan Lehman is host. "

The demand, issued by his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in an evening meeting with House Republicans, came after a marathon day of negotiating at the White House and in the Capitol in which Mr. Trump — who has boasted of his deal-making prowess — fell short of selling members of his own party on the health plan. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan emerged from the session and announced curtly that Mr. Trump would get his wish for a vote on Friday. Mr. Ryan refused to answer reporters’ questions about whether he expected the measure to pass. Although the House Republicans’ closed-door meeting became a cheerleading session for the bill, their leaders braced for a showdown on the floor, knowing they were likely to be at least a handful of votes short of a majority for the health insurance bill and would need to muscle their colleagues to the last to prevail. Some conservatives were still concerned that the bill was too costly and did not do enough to roll back federal health insurance mandates. Moderates and others, meanwhile, were grappling with worries of their states’ governors and fretted that the loss of benefits would be too much for their constituents to bear. "

In what seems like a parody of a Billy Mays OxiClean commercial, a smiling salesman wielding a white bucket peddles a product he promises will cause the cost of cars, food, clothing and medicine to soar: “The all new BAT tax is specially designed to make your disposable income disappear!” Airing in those locations and during those programs, the ad is clearly meant for the eyes of President Trump. But its creator, the National Retail Federation, wants it to influence Republicans in Congress and voters, too. That’s because the BAT the salesman promotes is the “border adjustment tax” — the keystone of the plan to overhaul the tax code being pitched by House Republicans and spearheaded by Speaker Paul D. Ryan. The commercial is the first strike in what is becoming an outright ad war, the harbinger of a bigger battle over tax policy that may make the current fight over health legislation look tame. The sums spent on television and digital media ads are expected to dwarf what has been spent on the health care fight so far because rewriting the tax code creates such a broad array of corporate winners and losers.

The F.B.I. director, other top intelligence officials and numerous Republicans have rejected this claim. Here’s an assessment of Mr. Trump’s references to The Times’s reporting. False. Mr. Trump was referring to an article published online on Jan. 19 and in print on Jan. 20 that disclosed that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of Mr. Trump. There were in fact two different headlines on the online and print versions of the article, which is typical. At no point was either headline altered. Times headlines often differ in print and online, in part because of variations in presentation and in part because of space. This disparity is always noted at the end of the web version and has been noted since the story was first published in print on Jan. 20. In this case, the article appeared in print with the headline, “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides,” followed by two subheadlines, “Examining Russian Ties” and “Business Dealings of Campaign Advisors Are Investigated.” Online, the headline read, “Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates.” "

And after Donald J. Trump, and not her mother, was sworn in as the country’s 45th president, another side of Chelsea Clinton seemed to emerge.

Ms. Clinton has accused a Trump adviser of spreading misinformation, admonished a Republican congressman for racist comments and pushed the president to speak out in the face of an increase in religiously motivated attacks. She has also seemed to step up the number of messages she is sending: According to TweetStats, a tool that tracks posting frequency, Ms. Clinton posted 142 tweets last November.

After Nixon won, the war dragged on and cost thousands of additional American and Vietnamese lives; it’s hard to see his behavior as anything but treason. Now the F.B.I. confirms that we have had an investigation underway for eight months into whether another presidential campaign colluded with a foreign power so as to win an election. To me, that, too, would amount to treason. I’ve been speaking to intelligence experts, Americans and foreigners alike, and they mostly (but not entirely) believe there was Trump-Russia cooperation of some kind. But this is uncertain; it’s prudent to note that James Clapper, the intelligence director under Barack Obama, said that as of January he had seen no evidence of collusion but that he favors an investigation to get to the bottom of it. I’m also told (not by a Democrat!) that there’s a persuasive piece of intelligence on ties between Russia and a member of the Trump team that isn’t yet public. "
882,Birth of the Biggest Lie,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/opinion/birth-of-the-biggest-lie.html?searchResultPosition=50,2017/03/23,OPINION,"A few things are clear after the congressional testimony of James Comey, the F.B.I. director, this week: First, Donald Trump owes Barack Obama and the American people an apology for his vituperative lie that Obama committed a felony by wiretapping Trump Tower. It was specious, libelous and reckless, regardless of the weak revelations of “incidental collection” that the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Trump transition team member Devin Nunes outrageously made public, briefing the president without first briefing his fellow committee members. Nunes’s announcement was a bombshell with no bomb, just enough mud in the water to obscure the blood in the water for those too willfully blind to discern the difference. Second, Donald Trump will never apologize. Trump’s strategy for dealing with being caught in a lie is often to tell a bigger lie. He seems constitutionally incapable of registering what others would: shame, embarrassment, contrition. Something is broken in the man — definitely morally and possibly psychologically. Third, and to me this is the biggest, Comey confirmed that the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to the Russians who tampered with our election is not “fake news” manufactured by Democrats stewing over a bitter loss but a legitimate investigation that has been underway for months and has no end in sight. Individuals who were associated with the president of the United States’ winning campaign are under criminal investigation. That is an extraordinary sentence and one that no American can allow to be swallowed up by other news or dismissed by ideologues. Depending on the outcome of this investigation, we could be facing a constitutional crisis. Oddly, it is likely that the reason Trump is even in the Oval Office is Comey’s original, extraordinarily inappropriate and unprecedented action. The Trump machinery then used that action to scare Americans about Clinton, in one of the most astonishing acts of deflection and hypocrisy in American history. The timeline of how the lie of Clinton’s constitutional crisis was born and grew is full of Machiavellian-level misdirections. "

Cognitive skills are important, but so are harder-to-measure strengths that fall under the heading of what is sometimes called character. Richard V. Reeves, of the Brookings Institution, has been doing research on the persistence of social and economic disadvantage for a long time. He often directs his attention to noncognitive skills. In a 2014 paper, “The Character Factor: Measures and Impact of Drive and Prudence,” Reeves and two co-authors, Kimberly Howard and Joanna Venator, focus on what they call “performance character strengths” and the crucial role played by noncognitive skills in educational attainment, employment and earned income. These character strengths — “perseverance, industriousness, grit, resilience, curiosity, application” and “self-control, future orientation, self-discipline, impulse control, delay of gratification” — make significant contributions to success in adulthood and upward mobility. As the accompanying chart demonstrates, upper-income kids perform well on tests of noncognitive skills, but there are substantial numbers of low-income children who do well also. “There is a long research literature on the importance of self-control, or the ability to defer gratification — a close corollary of our conceptualization of the character strength of prudence,” Reeves and his two colleagues write.

884,What a Le Pen Win Would Look Like,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/opinion/what-a-marine-le-pen-win-would-look-like.html?searchResultPosition=48,2017/03/23,OPINION,"LONDON — It is entirely plausible that the next president of France will be Marine Le Pen. After the Brexit vote in Britain and the election of Donald Trump in the United States, Ms. Le Pen, the leader of one of the oldest far-right parties in Europe, now smells victory in what her team is calling “the third battle.” Ms. Le Pen can already claim the backing of more than one in four French voters. These National Front supporters are a disgruntled lot who are more likely than others to say they’re certain to vote. Although recent opinion polls suggest that Ms. Le Pen would most likely lose in the presidential election’s second-round runoff, her strategists believe that she, too, will prove the pollsters wrong — by winning the first round in April, and then knocking out her leading rival, the upstart centrist Emmanuel Macron, in the second round the month after. They see the 39-year-old Mr. Macron as an ideal opponent, a former investment banker for Rothschild and a liberal elite technocrat who represents precisely the interests of “savage globalization” that Ms. Le Pen rails against. “Macron is a living and breathing embodiment of the globalist elite,” said one of Ms. Le Pen’s senior strategists at a recent presentation in London. (The briefing was conducted off the record, so I cannot attribute the remarks reported here to specific officials.) “How can a man from Rothschild understand French workers?” According to her team, Ms. Le Pen expects to win a plurality and eliminate lesser rivals in Round 1 by sweeping up protest votes. For the head-to-head contest in Round 2, however, she will focus relentlessly on Mr. Macron’s privileged background and his close ties to the departing president, François Hollande, who has historically low approval ratings. Ms. Le Pen’s team hopes that Mr. Macron’s economic liberalism will encourage traditional left-wingers either to abstain or back her own protectionist message, which is wrapped in the theme of national preference, the idea of putting native French workers first and introducing additional taxes on contracts for foreign employees. Ms. Le Pen’s populist rallying cry also includes promises to start a re-industrialization and to push back against global corporations like Ikea, forcing them to buy commodities locally and pay higher taxes if they hire non-French workers.

So How Did He Do?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-hearing.html?searchResultPosition=47,2017/03/23,POLITICS,"Judge Neil M. Gorsuch can relax now. After 20-odd hours of Senate questioning this week, the Supreme Court nominee has completed his testimony. The committee will hold a final session on Thursday featuring expert panelists discussing the judge. But his job is done. So what have we learned? Maybe he’ll clear the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster, attracting sufficient support from Democrats — particularly those from states that President Trump won. Or maybe skeptics will hold the line and force Republicans to change longstanding Senate rules to elevate Judge Gorsuch on a simple majority vote. But this much is clear: Nothing that’s happened this week has made much of a difference. Three days of hearings marked by attacks and deflections have left the Senate Judiciary Committee more or less where it started. If the Republicans’ goal was to persuade Democrats of a moral imperative to join them in support, they fell short. (In some cases, the nominee’s sparring with Democrats may have pushed some further away.) And if Democrats harbored any hope of raising doubts about Judge Gorsuch among Republicans, they came nowhere close. Empty seats. Distracted senators. Non sequitur questions about fly-fishing and duck-size horses. Despite the stakes inherent in any Supreme Court confirmation hearing, the Gorsuch proceedings often felt like an afterthought. Part of the burden falls on Democrats, who have failed to draw much blood in their questioning or generate meaningful momentum for opposition outside the hearing room, at least so far. "

he trees are so big that it would be cowardly not to deal with their bigness head on. They are very, very big. You already knew this — they’re called “giant sequoias” — and I knew it, too. But in person, their bigness still feels unexpected, revelatory. And the delirium of their size is enhanced by their age, by the knowledge that some of the oldest sequoias predate our best tools for processing and communicating phenomena like sequoias, that the trees are older than the English language and most of the world’s major religions — older by centuries, easily, even millenniums. The physical appearance of a tree cannot be deafening, and yet with these trees, it is. Facing down a sequoia, the most grammatically scrambled thoughts wind up feeling right. Really, there’s only so much a person can do or say. Often I found myself expelling a quivering, involuntary Whoa. The first time that happened, I was driving into Sequoia National Park from the foothills of central California’s Sierra Nevada, south of Yosemite. Suddenly, the Four Guardsmen came into view: a tight quartet of elephantine sequoia trunks through which the road passes. The trees have tops, too — those trunks lead to crowns — but that’s immaterial; the trunks are all you have a hope of registering from inside your car. They fill the windows and function as a gateway. They were like living infrastructure, rising out of the snow. The rental-car company had given me a squat Fiat micro-S.U.V., which, though it was equipped with all-wheel drive and seemed to be handling capably enough, was so strikingly unbrawny in appearance that crunching up the icy, winding mountain road, I wasn’t brave enough to push it any faster than a feeble crawl. Now, with the squeeze through the Guardsmen ahead of me tightening, I slowed even more. I heard myself letting out an anticipatory holler, like a Hollywood fighter pilot banking through a dogfight, and threaded the needle at nine miles an hour. There are more than 8,000 sequoias in the Giant Forest, the three-and-a-half-square-mile centerpiece of the park. The largest grow more than 300 feet tall and 30 feet across, barely tapering as they rise until, about two-thirds of the way up, the scrambling madness of their branches starts. The branches are crooked and gnarled, while the rest of the tree is stoic and straight. The branches are grayish and brownish — average American tree colors — while the trunk, particularly in sunlight reflected off snow, hums with a dreamy reddish-orange glow. The branches often seem to have nothing to do with the sequoia they’re attached to; they are trees themselves. In 1978, a branch broke off a sequoia called the General Sherman. It was 150 feet long and nearly seven feet thick. All by itself, that branch would have been one of the tallest trees east of the Mississippi. The General Sherman Tree is one of the park’s primary attractions. It’s 275 feet tall, 100 feet in circumference, and known to be the largest tree on Earth, by volume. (The National Park Service drives home its massiveness on a sign in front of its trunk this way: If the General Sherman were hollowed out and filled with water, it’d be enough water for you to take a bath every day for 27 years.) The General Sherman is not far off the Generals Highway, which runs through the park. It is a tree with its own parking lot. Though the pathways were ice-crusted or snowed under when I visited last month, I watched tourists of all shapes and sizes hobble and skitter over them toward the tree for photographs: the Italian dude with the soul patch posing with double thumbs up; the overweight couple huffing, “You make it to the tree?” to a few young women returning to their car; the young man looking up at the tree, eyes closed and still, face in the sun — a tranquil image of cosmic, momentary oneness were it not for his self-aggrandizing sweatshirt, which read, I AM NOT A GOD BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR. And then there was the woman with a moaning child in her arms. She was whispering, “Last one, I promise,” while her husband set up a tripod and timer, far, far away, struggling to frame his teensy family against the universe of the tree. Eventually the man found he had to reposition and walked right in front of me. When we made eye contact, he said, “It’s big!” "

It isn’t the legitimacy of his boss, President Trump, that Mr. Perry is calling into question. No, he has reservations about last month’s election for student body president at his alma mater, Texas A&M University. In a piece published by The Houston Chronicle on Wednesday, Mr. Perry took the remarkable step of weighing in on the most local of politics. In it, he argues in great detail that the election of the school’s first openly gay student body president was mishandled and that the true winner was denied victory, an outcome that never would have been allowed were he not a straight, white male. The process, overseen by the school’s Student Government Association, at best “made a mockery of due process and transparency,” Mr. Perry wrote. “At worst, the S.G.A. allowed an election to be stolen outright.” At issue was the election of Bobby Brooks, who is reportedly set to become the school’s first openly gay student body president when he takes office next month. Mr. Perry wrote that Mr. Brooks’s victory initially made him proud, but he soon found cause for concern. “The election appeared to demonstrate a commitment to treating every student equally, judging on character rather than on personal characteristics,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, a closer review appears to prove the opposite.” "

The measure passed in a 50-to-48 vote largely along party lines. The House is expected to mirror the Senate’s action next week, followed by a signature from President Trump. The move means Verizon, Comcast or AT&T can continue tracking and sharing people’s browsing and app activity without permission, and it alarmed consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers. They warned that broadband providers have the widest look into Americans’ online habits, and that without the rules, the companies would have more power to collect data on people and sell sensitive information. “These were the strongest online privacy rules to date, and this vote is a huge step backwards in consumer protection writ large,” said Dallas Harris, a policy fellow for the consumer group Public Knowledge. “The rules asked that when things were sensitive, an internet service provider asked permission first before collecting. That’s not a lot to ask.” The privacy rules were created in October by the Federal Communications Commission, and the brisk action of Congressional Republicans, just two months into Mr. Trump’s administration, foreshadowed a broader rollback of tech and telecom policies that have drawn the ire of conservative lawmakers and companies like AT&T, Verizon and Charter. Republican lawmakers and the new chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, have said the privacy rules were onerous and unfairly strapped regulations on telecom carriers, but not on web companies such as Facebook and Google that also provide access to online content.

Technology companies like Mint and Betterment have been eager to slurp up this data, mainly by building services that let people link all their various bank-account and credit-card information. The selling point is to make budgeting and bookkeeping easier. But the data is also being used to offer new kinds of loans and investment products. Now, banks have decided they aren’t letting the data go without a fight. In recent weeks, several large banks have been pushing to restrict the sharing of this kind of data with technology companies, according to the tech firms. In some cases, they are refusing to pass along information, like the fees and interest rates they charge. Both sides see big money to be made from the reams of highly personal information created by financial transactions.

The five-paragraph statement went through multiple drafts, according to two people involved in the process. Hard-liners in the White House first tried to kill the message, and when that failed, stripped it of references to engaging with the Iranian government or a future in which Iran and the United States might peacefully coexist. Instead, the statement, issued a day after the holiday began, reached out to the Iranian people while ignoring the government in Tehran. It paid tribute to Iranian immigrants in the United States, even as Mr. Trump’s travel ban prevented relatives of those immigrants from entering the United States. And it celebrated the ancient history of the Persian Empire while implicitly criticizing the persecution of religious minorities by the mullahs who rule the Islamic republic of today. “Nowruz means ‘new day’ in Persian,” the president said in the statement. “It is an occasion to celebrate new beginnings, a sentiment that is particularly meaningful for so many Iranians who have come to our country in recent decades to make a new start in a free land.” Among the sections deleted were one that said America looked forward to engaging someday with a “representative Iranian government” on the basis of mutual respect, and another that cited Henry A. Kissinger’s oft-repeated line that Iran needed to decide whether it is a “nation or a cause.” "

But that leaves us with the curious case of electric cars, as Farhad Manjoo writes. Electric cars are becoming less expensive and more reliable. The typical range they can drive on a single charge is extending, and charging stations are becoming more commonplace. What’s more, electric cars are spreading from innovative high-end companies like Tesla, an automaker based in Palo Alto, Calif., to mainstream manufacturers in the United States, China, Japan and areas of Europe. “There are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California,” Mr. Manjoo writes. Not surprisingly, many auto companies disagree with that sentiment, arguing that gradual acceptance of the technology and more affordable prices have contributed to the cars’ popularity. So what prompted the initial investments? There is a theory: Regulations prodded companies to invest in technologies they might otherwise have ignored. This led to the commercialization of the technology. Would shifts in technology occur if companies did not get a shove? Sure. But regulation can force change to happen more quickly than if it were left to the market. More tech news: AT&T and Johnson & Johnson are pulling ads from YouTube. The companies say Google is not doing enough to prevent their brands from appearing next to offensive material, like hate speech. Why big banks and tech firms are battling over your data.

The deaths underscored the strength of the Sinai insurgency, led by an Islamic State affiliate, despite almost four years of concerted Egyptian counterterrorism operations. In recent months Sinai militants have expanded their area of operations, targeted Christian civilians and fired rockets into Israel. In a statement posted on Facebook, Tamer el-Refai, an Egyptian military spokesman, said the Egyptian soldiers died in two roadside blasts on Wednesday during an operation that had targeted two Islamist storehouses in the deserts of central Sinai, outside their stronghold in the north of the peninsula. Among the soldiers killed were three officers and seven enlisted men, Mr. Refai said. Seven militants were arrested, he said, and explosives, medical supplies, cellphones and four-wheel-drive vehicles were seized. The death totals and other details from the operation could not be independently corroborated as most journalists, Egyptian or foreign, are prohibited from working in Sinai. The raid came a month after a series of attacks by militants targeting minority Christians in northern Sinai forced more than 250 people to flee the area, mostly to the nearby city of Ismailia. "

In a climate where the women’s top player, Ko, first reached No. 1 at age 17 and the average age of the players in the top 10 is 24, O’Sullivan’s refusal to put a full-time golf career ahead of a college experience sets her apart. It is as distinctive as her historic Symetra Tour victory a few months before her 17th birthday and her United States Women’s Amateur championship a few months later. “There’s so many people out on tour right now who are obviously doing super well at 17 or 18 years old,” said O’Sullivan, whose first name is pronounced HAH-nah. “But I realized for me a college experience is really important, and I didn’t really see the reason to push past that.” O’Sullivan was speaking during a break in an afternoon hitting session at Whirlwind Golf Club, near her home in the Phoenix suburbs. It was three days after she missed the cut in her first competition in several months, the L.P.G.A. Founders Cup in Phoenix, and the temperature had climbed into the mid-90s. At the start of her practice, O’Sullivan was the only person at the back of the spacious range. "
901,Chinese Firm Takes Stake in U.S. Investment Bank Cowen,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/dealbook/china-us-investment-bank-cowen.html?searchResultPosition=82,2017/03/29,DEALBOOK,"HONG KONG — As China looks to spread its economic influence around the world, it is taking a bigger interest in financial companies, a move that could raise scrutiny in the era of President Trump. In the latest deal, CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, agreed on Wednesday to buy a stake in a century-old New York boutique investment bank, the Cowen Group. For Cowen, the deal brings an injection of cash and debt financing and the promise of better access to the Chinese market. CEFC gets a ready-made springboard into high finance in the United States. It is the latest example of surging amounts of Chinese investment targeting overseas companies, especially American ones. Chinese firms made 173 deals targeting American businesses in 2016, according to data compiled by the research firm Dealogic, for a total value of $67.8 billion, more than the total for the six previous years. But the strategy is not a sure bet. Previous attempts by Chinese companies to penetrate American financial services have come under regulatory scrutiny or struggled to generate hoped-for financial returns, though Cowen’s chairman, Peter Cohen, said he viewed his deal as “pretty benign” from a regulatory standpoint. A decade ago, the China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, bought a stake in Morgan Stanley, a deal that signaled a shift in the investment strategy of organizations with links to the Chinese government away from domestic acquisitions to overseas purchases.

902,2 Christie Allies Are Sentenced in George Washington Bridge Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/nyregion/christie-bridgegate-baroni-bridget-anne-kelly.html?searchResultPosition=83,2017/03/29,NEW YORK,"NEWARK — Two former allies of Gov. Chris Christie were sentenced to prison on Wednesday for their role in closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political payback against a New Jersey mayor, a key chapter in the plot that derailed Mr. Christie’s presidential aspirations and then dimmed his chances to become President Trump’s pick for vice president. Bridget Anne Kelly, 44, who was a top aide to Mr. Christie, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, while Bill Baroni, 45, who served as deputy executive director at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was sentenced to two years in prison. The scandal, which became known as Bridgegate, was as brazen as it was bizarre. In an effort to punish Mayor Mark J. Sokolich of Fort Lee, a Democrat, for not supporting Mr. Christie’s re-election bid and his desire to cultivate bipartisan support ahead of a presidential run, members of the governor’s administration schemed with Port Authority officials to trigger a massive traffic jam in Fort Lee. Over five days in September 2013, the gridlock ensnared emergency vehicles, school buses and commuters, even as Mr. Baroni ignored Mr. Sokolich’s messages seeking an explanation. The plan was put into motion by Ms. Kelly’s now infamous email to David Wildstein, Mr. Baroni’s top deputy at the Port Authority, who pleaded guilty for his role in the scandal in 2015: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” The seven-week trial last fall of Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly revealed Mr. Christie’s aggressive political operation, which seemed as focused on carving a path to the White House as it was on the needs of New Jersey. While Mr. Christie was never charged in the scandal, Judge Susan D. Wigenton alluded to the political culture his administration created on Wednesday as she handed down her sentences against Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly at the federal courthouse in Newark, calling it a toxic “with us or against us” mentality detrimental to New Jersey residents.

903,Campuses Grapple With Balancing Free Speech and Security After Protests,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/texas-aandm-speaking-policy-richard-spencer.html?searchResultPosition=84,2017/03/29,U.S.,"Shortly after hundreds of students at Texas A&M University protested an appearance in December by Richard Spencer, a leading white supremacist, administrators there revisited its policy for hosting speakers on its campus. The task was not easy. The university expressed support for free speech, while emphasizing that Mr. Spencer’s remarks — at one point he said that America “belongs to white men” — did not reflect its values, said Amy B. Smith, a university spokeswoman. It also had to consider the extra burden of security costs. Eventually, Texas A&M settled on a new policy: All speakers must now be sponsored by a student, faculty member or organization affiliated with the university. The rule would have affected Mr. Spencer’s appearance, which was arranged by a private citizen who had paid about $3,000 to rent space at a student center. “We certainly don’t want to be affiliated with this guy,” Ms. Smith said in a telephone interview in which she declined to mention Mr. Spencer by name. “You are either for free speech or you are not, but with this person it was jarring because everything he stands for is against our core values, and we don’t want that reflected on our university in any way.” The new policy, posted on the university’s website in February and reported by CNN last week, is intended to give students or other groups affiliated with the university priority when assigning facilities. If the university is going to incur security and overtime costs associated with controversial speakers, Ms. Smith said, at least it will be for its own students. “We are not an American Legion hall,” she said. The university, a state institution with about 66,000 students located in College Station in east-central Texas, is not alone. In interviews, officials at a half dozen higher education institutions say they are taking steps to address the consequences of allowing provocative speakers amid heightened awareness of racial, ethnic, religious and diversity issues after the election of Donald J. Trump. "
904,No Deal Between Kushners and Chinese Company Over Fifth Avenue Skyscraper,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/nyregion/talks-end-between-kushners-and-chinese-company.html?searchResultPosition=85,2017/03/29,NEW YORK,"A Chinese company with ownership ties to some of the Communist Party’s leading families has ended talks to invest billions of dollars in a Manhattan office tower owned by the family of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a senior White House aide. The Chinese financial conglomerate, Anbang Insurance Group, and the Kushner Companies “mutually agreed to end talks regarding the property,” a Kushner Companies spokesman said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. The development came days after Democratic lawmakers wrote letters to the Office of White House Counsel and Treasury Secretary, expressing concern that the possible deal could breach federal ethics rules, and as Mr. Trump is preparing to meet Xi Jinping, China’s president, for their first summit at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The possible $4-billion deal between the two companies, first reported by The New York Times in January, would have paired a company led by a man who married the granddaughter of China’s late paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, with the family company of Mr. Kushner, a principal White House adviser on foreign affairs, including China policy. Any deal faced headwinds on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. In the United States, it was subject to increasing scrutiny by lawmakers, who also called on the government committee that reviews overseas investment to scrutinize the agreement for possible national security issues. In China, government regulators are trying to stanch the loss of foreign exchange reserves, and are wary of signing off on multibillion dollar deals in industries, such as commercial real estate, not deemed to have strategic value. Plans for the redevelopment, which envisioned gutting the aging office tower and erecting a soaring glass-sheathed tower with luxury residences, a hotel and retail spaces designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid, will now require a new investor. “Kushner Companies remains in active, advanced negotiations around 666 5th Avenue with a number of potential investors,” the company spokesman said in a statement. A spokesman for Anbang declined to comment. "

Defeated by Mao Zedong’s Communists, it fled to Taiwan, where it imposed martial law for decades before grudgingly yielding to popular demands for democracy. But now the days of power and wealth are gone for the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, as it struggles to stay relevant in Taiwan politics — a situation that has implications for Beijing and Washington. After a disastrous performance in last year’s general election, the Kuomintang, also known as the K.M.T., lost control of the presidency for the second time since Taiwan’s presidential elections began in 1996. For the first time, it is a minority party in the island’s legislature. “The K.M.T. is looking for its footing in a new environment,” said Nathan Batto, assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica and an expert on Taiwan’s elections. How it will adapt to challenges on several fronts is still an open question. The Kuomintang’s base is made up of those who think of themselves “as Chinese in some way,” Mr. Batto said. That base, however, is now only 20 to 40 percent of voters. Corporations seeking access to the Chinese market are an additional pillar of support — especially financial. The Kuomintang is under investigation regarding public and private assets it seized after arriving in Taiwan seven decades ago. In the 1990s, Kuomintang assets totaled $2.9 billion, according to party data. Its assets now frozen, it has recently cut staff from 800 to under 400 because of insufficient funds. "

Mr. Hannity is often very upset, at things like the past friendships of President Barack Obama; the suspected political leanings of his former colleague Megyn Kelly; the resignation of Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser; and the tweets of media reporters from rival news organizations. But the primary target of his anger in recent days has been Ted Koppel, a veteran news anchor and contributor to “CBS Sunday Morning,” which last weekend broadcast a clip from an interview with Mr. Hannity that the Fox star did not like at all. The interview was conducted by Mr. Koppel roughly three weeks ago, Mr. Hannity said on his show Monday night, and had been presented to him as an opportunity to discuss the political polarization in American life. But only a minute or so of the full interview was used. And it looks as though it may have been the part that Mr. Hannity found the most insulting. The night before the segment aired, CBS News posted online a part of the interview in which Mr. Hannity described his upbringing, which he said shaped his views. But in the televised footage, he was shown complaining about socialism, liberalism and “angry snowflakes,” right-wing slang for liberals that conservatives see as easily upset. Then he led with his chin: Mr. Hannity asked if Mr. Koppel, an elder statesman of broadcast news who hosted the ABC show “Nightline” for 25 years, thought he and his show were “bad for America.” Mr. Koppel responded, “Yeah.” “Really?” Mr. Hannity responded, his voice rising an octave or two. “That’s sad, Ted. That’s sad.” Why did Mr. Koppel think Mr. Hannity’s show was bad for America? "

Good beds,” the actress Patti LuPone said. She was referring not to furniture, but fingernails: the unvarnished ones on the hands of her current co-star, Christine Ebersole. They contrasted markedly with Ms. LuPone’s nails, which she herself had lacquered in shiny maroon, after years observing professional manicurists. “I watch how they depress the fluid,” Ms. LuPone said, pantomiming bottle and brush. “The problem is, when I put nail polish on it really weakens my nails,” Ms. Ebersole said in a sisterly way. “They just flake off.” The talons were out, in other words, but this was not a catfight. More a chat ’n’ chew between Tony Award-winning actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in “War Paint,” one of a half-dozen new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends. Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves, the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue, where the flagship of Elizabeth Arden’s signature spa, the Red Door, moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north. They had refused treatments and were instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups. In “War Paint,” which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6, Ms. Ebersole, 64, plays Miss Arden, née Florence Nightingale Graham: the entrepreneur who made cosmetics, long associated with prostitutes, acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s. Ms. LuPone, 67, plays Arden’s less-remembered but equally esteemed competitor, Helena Rubinstein, who imparted both artistic and clinical prestige to the pursuit of beauty, and who is credited with the phrase “there are no ugly women, only lazy ones.” "

Afterwards, her husband asked her to buy mace so she could protect herself. The second time Ms. Russ experienced racist harassment after the election of President Trump, it came in the form of a note left on her car while it was parked outside her home in Phoenix. The note included a swastika, a racial slur and the phrases “Trump won” and “go back to Mexco.” “The thing that stuck out was they couldn’t even spell ‘Mexico’ properly,” Ms. Russ said. The third time was at the grocery store, in January. Ms. Russ was talking on her phone in Spanish when a woman walked by and said, “I can’t wait for them to deport you.” This time, Ms. Russ said, “I was just fed up.” She confronted the woman, who claimed she had been talking to someone on the phone.

Nominee, Paid Millions by Industry, Says He’ll Recuse Himself if Needed",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/health/fda-nominee-scott-gottlieb-recuse-conflicts.html?searchResultPosition=90,2017/03/29,HEALTH,"President Trump has repeatedly slammed pharmaceutical companies for “getting away with murder” on soaring drug prices, but he and his nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration have pledged to ease industry regulations and speed approvals for medicines and other consumer products. The nominee, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, has spent the bulk of his career working in the drug and health care industry, which experts say raises the potential for myriad conflicts of interest. If confirmed to head the F.D.A., he would wield considerable power over companies and investment firms that have paid him millions of dollars over the years. From 2013 to 2015, for example, Dr. Gottlieb received more than $150,000 to advise Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a company whose two approved drugs are seen as breakthrough treatments for cystic fibrosis but carry list prices of more than $250,000 a year. He’s the acting chief executive of Cell Biotherapy, an early-stage cancer biotech firm that he helped found. He has served for years as a consultant to pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol-Myers Squibb and is paid by other companies for his expertise. Dr. Gottlieb plans to recuse himself for one year from any agency decisions involving about 20 health care companies he worked with, according to an ethics agreement made public Wednesday. But that is unlikely to mollify critics who argue that someone with such close industry relationships should not be in charge of an agency whose mission is to protect consumers and uphold safety standards for products from lipstick to lifesaving cancer therapies. “If you have a commissioner who is that conflicted, recusal is a tricky business,” said Susan F. Wood, who resigned as the director of the F.D.A.’s Office of Women’s Health in 2005 in protest over the agency’s decision to delay over-the-counter approval of the morning-after pill. Dr. Gottlieb’s nomination comes at a momentous time for the agency, which Mr. Trump has promised to significantly remake. The next commissioner will be charged with putting into practice a far-reaching law, passed in December, aimed at bringing drugs to market more quickly. Congress also must reauthorize a set of bills this year that determine how much the drug and medical device industry will pay in user fees, which fund more than half of the agency’s budget to review new drugs.

I am a Muslim immigrant. I am from the state of California. I am a triple threat to Donald Trump.” Dr. Mahmood will officially announce his first bid for public office Wednesday morning. The election is in November 2018. If elected, he would perhaps be the first Muslim to hold statewide office in California. That said, there are already a number of Muslims in public office across the country, including two Muslims in Congress, according to Mohammed Nadeem, the executive director of the Muslim Observer, which tracks these kinds of elections. (And in Michigan, a Muslim man is running for governor.) Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the incumbent, is barred by term limits from seeking a third term; he is running for governor.

Yet South Koreans would bear the brunt of the retaliation should Mr. Trump opt for a “pre-emptive” strike against the North Korean regime. Long-term peace on the Korean Peninsula is impossible without Seoul’s input. South Korea’s lack of influence with the Trump administration was evident during Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s recent visit to Asia. He held considerably shorter meetings with the South Koreans than with officials in Tokyo, and he did not even dine with his counterparts in Seoul. The South Korean side claimed Mr. Tillerson was tired (giving rise to “stamina” jokes on Twitter). The secretary fired back that his South Korean hosts had never sent a dinner invitation. South Koreans are partly to blame for being marginalized. The country has been preoccupied since last year by a political scandal that embroiled President Park Geun-hye and ultimately led to her removal from office on March 10. The place-holder government of Park appointees maintains her hard-line posture toward North Korea but without legitimacy in the eyes of the public. South Korea’s political vacuum will come to an end when the country votes on May 9 for a new leader, who will take office immediately. The election will have far-reaching implications for the Korean Peninsula — and for Mr. Trump’s North Korea policy. The liberal opposition is widely expected to win, with the Democratic Party standard-bearer, Moon Jae-in, maintaining a comfortable lead in the polls. The conservatives are in disarray, having split into pro-Park and anti-Park parties; they have yet to find a presidential candidate who polls over 10 percent. South Korean elections are notoriously unpredictable, but public disgust with the impeached president is casting a pall over the conservative camp. North Korea policy is one of the sharpest points of divergence between liberals and conservatives in the South. The hard-line conservative approach of all sticks and no carrots was unpopular by the time Ms. Park took office in 2013. Early on, she appeared to be looking for middle ground: She advocated building trust with Pyongyang and did not make denuclearization a precondition for inter-Korean dialogue. But as time passed, it became clear that Ms. Park’s interest in improving relations was all talk. After North Korea’s fourth nuclear test in January 2016, she abruptly shifted back to harsh rhetoric and hard-line policies, most notably by shutting down the joint North-South industrial park at Kaesong.

912,The Art of a Deal With the Taliban,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/the-art-of-a-deal-with-the-taliban.html?searchResultPosition=93,2017/03/29,OPINION,"WASHINGTON — This year, America’s war in Afghanistan will pass a grim milestone as it surpasses the Civil War in duration, as measured against the final withdrawal of Union forces from the South. Only the conflict in Vietnam lasted longer. United States troops have been in Afghanistan since October 2001 as part of a force that peaked at nearly 140,000 troops (of which about 100,000 were American) and is estimated to have cost the taxpayers at least $783 billion. Despite this heavy expenditure, the United States commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., recently called for a modest troop increase to prevent a deteriorating stalemate. The fall of Sangin in Helmand Province to the Taliban this month is a tactical loss that may be reversed, but it certainly suggests the situation is getting worse. With the Trump administration’s plan to increase the military budget while slashing the diplomatic one, there is a risk that American policy toward Afghanistan will be defined in purely military terms. Absent from the current debate is a clear statement of our objectives — and a way to end the Afghan war while preserving the investment and the gains we have made, at the cost of some 2,350 American lives. It has always been clear to senior military officers like Gen. David H. Petraeus, who was the American commander in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011, as well as to diplomats like me, that the war could end only through a political settlement, a process through which the Afghan government and the Taliban would reconcile their differences in an agreement also acceptable to the international community. The challenges of bringing about such a reconciliation are formidable, but the basic outline of a deal is tantalizingly obvious. Despite more than 15 years of warfare, the United States has never had a fundamental quarrel with the Taliban per se; it was the group’s hosting of Al Qaeda that drove our intervention after the Sept. 11 attacks. For its part, the Taliban has never expressed any desire to impose its medieval ideology outside of Afghanistan, and certainly not in the United States. The core Afghan government requirements for a settlement are that the Taliban ceases violence, breaks with international terrorism and accepts the Afghan Constitution. The Taliban, for its part, insists that all foreign forces withdraw. No doubt, both sides have additional desiderata, but the basic positions do not seem unbridgeable. This is particularly the case now that the Islamic State has emerged in Afghanistan, in conflict with both the government and the Taliban. "
913,Fix the College Dropout Boom,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/fix-the-college-dropout-boom.html?searchResultPosition=94,2017/03/29,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The college dropout phenomenon exacts a terrible price on American society. More than 25 percent of people in their 30s who have attended college at some point have no degree — neither a community-college degree nor a bachelor’s degree. They fare vastly worse in the job market than their counterparts who do graduate (despite all the overwrought commentary claiming that education is overrated). A typical college graduate working full-time earns 54 percent more than a full-time worker who attended some college but has no degree. And that statistic understates the gap, because college graduates are also much more likely to have full-time jobs. So how can the United States help more college students finish what they started? That question is the subject of a two-part Fixes column, by Tina Rosenberg, that she has just finished. Her first installment looked at the importance of small infusions of cash to lower-income students. Her latest piece examines the upside of inflexibility: “Colleges use different parts of the strategy and give it different names, although it often goes by ‘guided pathways,’” Rosenberg writes. “The underlying idea is to give students firm guidance in choosing the right courses, along with structured, clear course sequences that lead to graduation. Colleges also monitor students’ progress closely and intervene when they go off track.” One of her shining examples is at the City University of New York, which I’ve previously praised as an engine of economic mobility. Rosenberg’s two pieces address a topic of real importance. Elsewhere, Jonathan Chait of New York magazine explains that Trump’s climate policy will do a lot of damage to the planet but won’t stop the green-energy revolution. Sarah Jones of the New Republic makes a full-throated case for single-payer health care in the wake of Trumpcare’s implosion. As for the newfound claims by House Republicans that now they’re really going to repeal Obamacare: Color me skeptical. The same problems that kept them from passing a bill remain. Carl Hulse, The Times’s chief Washington correspondent, had a cleareyed column earlier this week on the larger issue. "

He talked about the so-called mansion tax in at least five separate events in one month in 2015, attempting to create momentum in Albany that never materialized. He has pushed it at a dozen events since rekindling the idea during a January budget address, and with increasing tenacity in recent weeks, including while chomping pickles at a diner with three older constituents on Facebook Live and during a mass conference call on Monday. “If we speak loudly, Albany will listen,” he said during his State of the City address. It has not worked out that way. The State Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Republican, has called the idea a “non-starter.” Likewise, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has seemed uninterested in helping out Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. “That proposal was made in January,” the governor said on Monday. “It never went anywhere in January and it hasn’t gone anywhere since.” Nevertheless, Mr. de Blasio has persevered, eagerly playing the snowball to Albany’s hell. He has dismissed those who say it cannot get through the state capital, and compared it to universal prekindergarten, one of his signature initiatives as mayor, which initially met resistance in Albany. But whereas that effort ultimately succeeded, the main sticking point was in fact a new tax on high-income earners that Mr. de Blasio wanted to levy, to pay for it. The tax component quickly fell by the wayside, but not before the mayor’s stubborn insistence, still near the outset of his term, set him permanently on the wrong foot with Mr. Cuomo and Republicans in the State Senate.

Travel bans. Policy reversals. Wire taps. In October, during the buildup to Election Day, we heard from therapists about how their patients were feeling fearful, angry and distrustful in reaction to the contentious presidential race. Now, these same therapists report that many of their patients are even more upset as they struggle to make sense of the direction in which the country is heading. And many can’t tear themselves away from the news. “So much is coming at us,” said Sue Elias, a psychotherapist in New York City. “There’s a chronic sense of anxiety among my patients that I have never seen before.” Indeed, Americans are reporting even higher levels of stress than they did before the election, according to a report from the American Psychological Association released in February. And like so many issues these days, the stress appears to be partisan. The report, called Stress in America: Coping with Change, was based on a Harris Poll of more than 3,500 American adults in August, with a follow-up of more than 1,000 men and women in January. While 26 percent of Republicans polled after the election said the political climate was a source of stress, 72 percent of Democrats said they felt that way. The report also found that 86 percent of adults constantly or often check their email, texts and social media accounts, and that those who are constant checkers are more likely to experience stress. The cycle of vigilance can be insidious. “The election results caused feelings of uncertainty,” which leads many people to check the news and search for information to help them cope, said Dr. Eric Hollander, a professor of psychiatry and the director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum program at Einstein — Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. If people see a tweet about wiretapping or deportations, for example, and try to look up news articles about it, what they find often “only heightens the worry and perpetuates the cycle,” he said. "

This was the same America whose president had declared a ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries that trapped people in airports and interrupted lives. And the same America where an Ali or a Hagig could do what, back home, would have been the unthinkable: call a lawyer; stop the president. “It was never my intention to go against the president of the United States,” said Mohamed Iye, a Somali-born American citizen whose Somali wife and two American daughters were stranded in Nairobi after President Trump’s first travel order prevented them from joining him in Minnesota. “I was just following the law and doing everything the way it’s in the books. And it came to this.” It came to this: more than 50 lawsuits across the country, with at least as many individual plaintiffs; a reprieve from a federal judge in Seattle; a new ban; and, on March 15, a new set of roadblocks from federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland. On Wednesday, the judge in Hawaii turned his temporary restraining order against the ban into an indefinite one, fixing it in place unless it is overturned. The government is appealing those decisions, which have drawn Mr. Trump’s fury. His administration has insisted it will prevail. "
917,New York Today: Much Ado About Tattoos,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/nyregion/new-york-today-much-ado-about-tattoos.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/03/29,NEW YORK,"Updated, 10:13 a.m. Good morning on this brisk-to-brilliant Wednesday. Fineline Tattoo is one of the oldest continuously running tattoo shops in the city, but it used to be an underground operation. As recently as 1997, tattooing was illegal in most of New York City. In 1961, the Health Department said the art form was responsible for a hepatitis outbreak and banned it for nearly 40 years. But in the 1970s, Fineline Tattoo began operating out of the Lower East Side home of Mike Bakaty, a sculptor-turned-professional tattoo artist. His secret business at 295 Bowery, the building known as McGurk’s Suicide Hall, was one of the few tattoo parlors in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens or the Bronx. In 1997, just before the ban was lifted, the Bakaty family moved Fineline Tattoo to a storefront at First Avenue and First Street in the East Village — where it remains today. The walls inside the shop are covered in designs ranging from Mickey Mouse and Betty Boop to dragons, swords and snakes. The counters are neatly organized with spray bottles and tubes of colored ink. On one desk is a photograph of Mr. Bakaty’s son, Mehai, now 44, with James Gandolfini. Mehai Bekaty said the actor came in for a tattoo just months before “The Sopranos” star died. Mehai Bakaty, whose childhood home doubled as the shop, says he remembers doing chores in the studio to earn part of his allowance, and falling asleep to the sound of his father’s tattooing machine.

That executive order directs the agency to begin the legal process of repealing and replacing the clean power plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s policies to fight global warming. On today’s episode: • President Obama’s policies on the environment spelled the end for the coal industry. Now President Trump is promising to restore thousands of coal jobs and do away with Obama’s legacy on climate change.

Even as it will lose its second-largest economy, the dysfunctional E.U. is far from dead, our writer says. Here’s a look at what happens next. • Trump unwinds Obama’s climate policies. President Trump signed a long-promised executive order on Tuesday to nullify former President Barack Obama’s climate change efforts, telling the coal industry workers who joined him, “You’re going back to work.” Miners are hopeful, but their expectations are muted. The president’s policy will help their industry, but market forces that favor rivals like natural gas and renewable energy may limit its effect. With Mr. Trump making clear that the U.S. has no intention of meeting his predecessor’s commitments to curb planet-warming pollution, we look at how some of Mr. Obama’s climate policies have fared.

Well, that was stupid. I apologize.” The original comment came during a segment on the network’s morning show, in which Mr. O’Reilly was shown observing a speech by Ms. Waters, a frequent critic of President Trump. When asked for his thoughts, Mr. O’Reilly said, “I didn’t hear a word she said. I was looking at the James Brown wig.” The comment was met with laughter off camera.

Tom Price left the House seat to become Mr. Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services, and we won’t know who will replace him until April 18 at the earliest. The district hasn’t voted for a Democrat in decades, but that could soon change. Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old Democrat and first-time candidate, has fared well in recent polls and has raised an astonishing $3 million in only a few months. Mr. Trump struggled to victory in this district, a well-educated suburban area north of Atlanta. He won by just 1.5 percentage points, down from Mitt Romney’s 23-point win in 2012. It would be a mistake to read too much into the result of this one election. Special elections tend to stand on their own, and there are reasons to think that Democrats have a better chance than the district’s voting in congressional races suggests. But at this point, it wouldn’t be shocking if Mr. Ossoff got the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff in June. The idea of a competitive race here would have come as a surprise to many just a few months ago. Mr. Price won re-election with a healthy 62 percent of the vote, which observers have held up as a stronger indicator of the district’s partisanship than Mr. Trump’s performance. Democrats also have a poor track record in special elections. "

The announcement on Wednesday amounts to the formal recognition of the value Mr. Trump places on the judgment and loyalty of both his daughter and his son-in-law. While relying on family members for advice is hardly unusual for a president, giving them a formal role has few precedents. Ms. Trump, 35, will be an assistant to the president; Mr. Kushner, 36, has the title of senior adviser. When questions were raised about whether Mr. Kushner’s appointment violated federal anti-nepotism laws, the Justice Department wrote a memo in January concluding that the rules did not apply to the White House. Ms. Trump said last week that she planned on serving as an informal adviser to her father, and she already has an office in the West Wing — upstairs from her husband’s. She was also in the process of receiving government-issued security clearance and communications devices. But that plan had prompted criticism from ethics experts, who had said it would allow her to avoid financial disclosure rules. “This arrangement appears designed to allow Ms. Trump to avoid the ethics, conflict-of-interest and other rules that apply to White House employees,” Norman L. Eisen and Richard W. Painter, White House ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, wrote in a letter to Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. "
924,Hawaii Judge Extends Order Blocking Trump’s Travel Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/travel-ban-trump-judge-hawaii.html?searchResultPosition=58,2017/03/29,POLITICS,"HONOLULU — A federal judge in Hawaii decided Wednesday to extend his order blocking President Trump’s travel ban. The judge, Derrick Watson of Federal District Court, issued the longer-lasting hold on the ban just hours after hearing arguments. Hawaii says the policy discriminates against Muslims and hurts the state’s tourist-dependent economy. The implied message in the revised ban is like a “neon sign flashing ‘Muslim ban, Muslim ban,’” that the government didn’t bother to turn off, the state’s attorney general, Douglas Chin, told the judge. Extending the temporary order until the state’s lawsuit is resolved will ensure the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens across the U.S. are vindicated after “repeated stops and starts of the last two months,” the state has said. The government says the ban falls within the president’s power to protect national security. Hawaii has made only generalized concerns about its effect on students and tourism, a Department of Justice lawyer, Chad Readler, told the judge via telephone. The Trump administration had asked Judge Watson to narrow his ruling to cover only the part of Mr. Trump’s executive order that suspends new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. Mr. Readler said a freeze on the United States refugee program had no effect on Hawaii. Judge Watson rejected that argument, preventing the administration from halting the flow of refugees. Judge Watson said in court that the government only argued for that narrower interpretation after a federal judge in Maryland blocked the six-nation travel ban but said it was not clear that the refugee suspension was similarly motivated by religious bias. The judge noted that the government said 20 refugees were resettled in Hawaii since 2010. “Is this a mathematical exercise that 20 isn’t enough? ... What do I make of that?” the judge asked Mr. Readler. The government lawyer replied that 20 is simply a small number of refugees. “In whose judgment?” Judge Watson asked. Hawaii was the first state to sue over Mr. Trump’s revised ban. The imam of a Honolulu mosque joined the challenge, arguing that the ban would prevent his Syrian mother-in-law from visiting family in Hawaii. In his arguments, Mr. Chin quoted Mr. Trump’s comments that the revised travel ban is a “watered down” version of the original. “We cannot fault the president for being politically incorrect, but we do fault him for being constitutionally incorrect,” Mr. Chin said. Earlier this month, Judge Watson prevented the federal government from suspending new visas for people from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and freezing the nation’s refugee program. His ruling came just hours before the federal government planned to start enforcing Mr. Trump’s executive order. Mr. Trump called Judge Watson’s previous ruling an example of “unprecedented judicial overreach.” Hawaii’s ruling would not be directly affected by a decision siding with the federal government in the Maryland case, legal experts said. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit set a hearing for May 8 to consider the administration’s appeal. "
925,"E.P.A. Chief, Rejecting Agency’s Science, Chooses Not to Ban Insecticide",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/epa-insecticide-chlorpyrifos.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/03/29,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, moved late on Wednesday to reject the scientific conclusion of the agency’s own chemical safety experts who under the Obama administration recommended that one of the nation’s most widely used insecticides be permanently banned at farms nationwide because of the harm it potentially causes children and farm workers. The ruling by Mr. Pruitt, in one of his first formal actions as the nation’s top environmental official, rejected a petition filed a decade ago by two environmental groups that had asked that the agency ban all uses of chlorpyrifos. The chemical was banned in 2000 for use in most household settings, but still today is used at about 40,000 farms on about 50 different types of crops, ranging from almonds to apples. Late last year, and based in part on research conducted at Columbia University, E.P.A. scientists concluded that exposure to the chemical that has been in use since 1965 was potentially causing significant health consequences. They included learning and memory declines, particularly among farm workers and young children who may be exposed through drinking water and other sources. But Dow Chemical, which sells the product under the trade name Lorsban, along with farm groups that use it, had argued that the science demonstrating that chlorpyrifos caused such harm is inconclusive — especially when properly used to kill crop-spoiling insects. An E.P.A. scientific review panel made up of academic experts last July also had raised questions about some of the conclusions the chemical safety staff had reached. That led the staff to revise the way it had justified its findings of harm, although the agency employees as of late last year still concluded that the chemical should be banned. Mr. Pruitt, in an announcement issued Wednesday night, said the agency needed to study the science more. "
926,Coal Mining Jobs Trump Would Bring Back No Longer Exist,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/coal-jobs-trump-appalachia.html?searchResultPosition=60,2017/03/29,BUSINESS,"In Decatur, Ill., far from the coal mines of Appalachia, Caterpillar engineers are working on the future of mining: mammoth haul trucks that drive themselves. The trucks have no drivers, not even remote operators. Instead, the 850,000-pound vehicles rely on self-driving technology, the latest in an increasingly autonomous line of trucks and drills that are removing some of the human element from digging for coal. When President Trump moved on Tuesday to dismantle the Obama administration’s climate change efforts, he promised it would bring coal-mining jobs back to America. But the jobs he alluded to — hardy miners in mazelike tunnels with picks and shovels — have steadily become vestiges of the past. Pressured by cheap and abundant natural gas, coal is in a precipitous decline, now making up just a third of electricity generation in the United States. Renewables are fast becoming competitive with coal on price. Electricity sales are trending downward, and coal exports are falling. All the while, the coal industry has been replacing workers with machines and explosives. Energy and labor specialists say that no one — including Mr. Trump — can bring them all back. “People think of coal mining as some 1890s, colorful, populous frontier activity, but it’s much better to think of it as a high-tech industry with far fewer miners and more engineers and coders,” said Mark Muro, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program.

In Syria, it has airlifted local forces to front-line positions and has been accused of killing civilians in airstrikes. In Iraq, American troops and aircraft are central in supporting an urban offensive in Mosul, where airstrikes killed scores of people on March 17. Two months after the inauguration of President Trump, indications are mounting that the United States military is deepening its involvement in a string of complex wars in the Middle East that lack clear endgames. Rather than representing any formal new Trump doctrine on military action, however, American officials say that what is happening is a shift in military decision-making that began under President Barack Obama. On display are some of the first indications of how complicated military operations are continuing under a president who has vowed to make the military “fight to win.” In an interview on Wednesday, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of United States Central Command, said the new procedures made it easier for commanders in the field to call in airstrikes without waiting for permission from more senior officers. “We recognized the nature of the fight was going to change and that we had to ensure that authorities were down to the right level and that we empowered the on-scene commander,” General Votel said. He was speaking specifically about discussions that he said began in November about how the fights in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State were reaching critical phases in Mosul and Raqqa. Concerns about the recent accusations of civilian casualties are bringing some of these details to light. But some of the shifts have also involved small increases in the deployment and use of American forces or, in Yemen, resuming aid to allies that had previously been suspended. "

Tillerson’s brief tenure as secretary of state will be as delicate as the one in Ankara on Thursday with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan is the leader of an important NATO ally and is crucial in the fight against the Islamic State, but he is also a prickly strongman whose campaign to change Turkey’s Constitution in a referendum has many worried that the country is on the precipice of authoritarianism. The referendum has resulted in the worst divide between Europe and Turkey in decades, with Mr. Erdogan accusing European leaders of Nazi-like tendencies after they refused to allow officials of his government to address pro-referendum rallies. Mr. Erdogan also has serious reservations about the American plan to attack the Syrian city of Raqqa, the declared capital of the Islamic State, and has demanded that the United States extradite a Pennsylvania cleric who the government says was the mastermind behind a failed coup attempt last July. Navigating these difficulties would test the most seasoned of diplomats. Mr. Tillerson, though, has had a rocky start. On a recent trip to Asia, he stumbled repeatedly — disputing a South Korean explanation for his dinner plans and allowing China to crow over his use of language that American diplomats had long eschewed. Mr. Tillerson’s aides insist that he is still finding his footing in a complicated job. But experts in the region say there is no room for mistakes in his discussions Thursday evening with Mr. Erdogan. “It’s hard to think of a more important or more challenging relationship,” said Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state who visited Turkey three times last year to keep the relationship from foundering. "

But on Wednesday, the first lady stepped out of the shadows, speaking out on behalf of women who battle gender discrimination and violence around the world. “Wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them,” Mrs. Trump said at a ceremony at the State Department that honored 13 women who have faced rapists, acid-wielding attackers and the prejudiced courts that often protect them. Speaking softly but firmly, from a teleprompter, Mrs. Trump challenged the members of her audience to put themselves in the shoes of these women — victims of domestic abuse, gender bias, or violence — who fought laws and social norms that sought to perpetuate the injustice. “Ask yourself if you would have the fortitude of spirit, the courage of your convictions, and the enormous inner strength required to stand up and fight against such overwhelming odds,” Mrs. Trump said, gesturing to the women, from Yemen to Sri Lanka, arrayed behind her. “Together,” she said, “we must declare that the era of allowing the brutality against women and children is over, while affirming that the time for empowering women around the world is now.” It was a pointed message for Mrs. Trump to deliver given the tumultuous last weeks of the 2016 campaign, when Donald J. Trump came under withering fire for his crude language about women after the release of a 10-year-old video from the television program “Access Hollywood.” "
931,Ignoring Diplomacy’s Past and Its Future Promise,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/ignoring-diplomacys-past-and-its-future-promise.html?searchResultPosition=66,2017/03/29,OPINION,"One of America’s greatest contributions to international peace resulted from a historic investment in foreign aid. After defeating Fascism in World War II, Washington channeled billions of dollars into the war-torn nations of Europe and Japan, helping transform them into economic success stories and vital democratic allies. That’s a lesson worth remembering as President Trump tries to slash the State Department and its foreign aid programs by about 30 percent in the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, while raising Pentagon spending by 10 percent. The cruelest cuts may be a reported $1 billion reduction for the United Nations’ peacekeeping operations and programs that care for needy children. Mr. Trump seems to assume that national greatness comes from the barrel of a gun — he wants to expand the fleet of Navy ships and the nuclear arsenal — rather than from a combination of military might and “soft power” tools. One such tool is the example America sets by adhering to constitutional principles, the rule of law and human rights. Others involve pursuing smart diplomatic engagement and initiatives, including nuclear agreements and disaster assistance for some of the poorest countries. The State Department and foreign aid have long been targets for budget cutters because many Americans don’t understand what these programs do. Polls show that Americans overestimate how much federal spending goes to these programs. The actual number for foreign aid is about 1 percent of the budget, or $36.6 billion in 2017. And some of that money is spent in the United States. Diplomacy doesn’t always prevent war, Syria being one example, but war becomes far more likely if there are not enough diplomats to work with other countries to resolve disagreements. Compelling examples of diplomacy working include the 2015 deal that is preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; the 1995 Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnia War; and the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Other examples include several treaties that committed America and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals significantly. American diplomats have strengthened alliances, built new partnerships with countries like Cuba and Myanmar, promoted democracy so that countries are less likely to go to war with one another and created jobs by helping to open overseas markets to American business.

The move, according to observers, was the latest development in a crackdown on free expression and liberal values under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has embraced President Trump and vociferously denounced Mr. Soros, a billionaire who is a frequent target of attacks by the right-wing news media in both the United States and Europe. The school, the Central European University, opened in Mr. Soros’s native Budapest in 1991, not long after the fall of communism and the start of Hungary’s uneven transition to democracy. The school is known as a center for research in the social sciences, with programs led by internationally prominent educators. The university has also given a platform to dissident voices, particularly in the period since Mr. Orban, who helped popularize the term “illiberal democracy,” came to power in 2010. Proponents of illiberal democracy place majority rule over civil liberties and minority rights, and they say that financiers like Mr. Soros are part of an elite capitalist class that puts cosmopolitan values over national interests. The university’s president and rector, Michael Ignatieff, is a human rights scholar and a former leader of the Liberal Party in Canada. In a phone interview from Budapest, he said he feared his institution was the main target of the legislation. “We view it as discriminatory and we view it as a piece of political vandalism,” Mr. Ignatieff said. “We feel that this isn’t just about us; this is about Hungarian academic freedom in general.” "

Speaking at the Brookings Institution, which released a ranking of choice options in the country’s 100 largest school districts, Ms. DeVos made her case for choice policies that she said focused on the “individual child.” And she called for the rejection of an “us versus them mentality” when it comes to investing in programs, like charter schools and school vouchers, to which President Trump has proposed giving part of a $1.4 billion funding increase in the fiscal year that begins in October. “Our nation’s commitment is to provide a quality education to every child to serve the greater public, common good,” Ms. DeVos said in her address. “Accordingly, we must shift the paradigm to think about education funding as investments made in individual children, not in institutions or buildings.” While Ms. DeVos offered no new details about the Education Department’s budget — which in the president’s budget blueprint takes a $9 billion, or 13.5 percent, cut — she rejected the notion that money was a panacea for the challenges facing public schools. She resurrected a report released by the Education Department in the final days of President Barack Obama’s administration, which showed that a program that funneled $7 billion into the nation’s worst-performing schools had little to no effect on academic results. The report, which was issued in January and examined the impact of School Improvement Grants, found “no significant impacts” on “math or reading test scores, high school graduation or college enrollment of students.” "

Tillerson has decided to lift all human rights conditions on a major sale of F-16 fighter jets and other arms to Bahrain in an effort to end a rift between the United States and a critical Middle East ally, according to administration and congressional officials involved in the debate. Mr. Tillerson’s decision comes as the Trump administration looks to bolster Sunni Arab states in the Middle East and find new ways to confront Iran in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain is a key player in that effort, and home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which patrols the strategic waterway. But the decision to drop the human rights assurances as a condition of the sale is bound to be read by Saudi Arabia and other states in the region as a sign that the new administration plans to ease its demands to protect and respect political dissidents and protesters. The conditions on the sale of 19 new American fighter jets, worth $2.8 billion, had been imposed by the Obama administration amid continuing concerns about the tiny Sunni monarchy’s crackdown against majority Shiites. The State Department declined to comment on queries about Mr. Tillerson’s decision, which has been discussed at length with some members of Congress but not yet publicly announced. The State Department on Wednesday notified Congress of its intent to proceed with the sale without the conditions, according to Micah Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Congress now has two review periods to examine the sale and raise any objections. Mr. Tillerson will attend his first meeting of NATO on Friday in Brussels, where he may run into resistance from European allies who are trying to build a new relationship with Tehran, and who have made human rights a more central feature of their foreign policy.

Ms. Haley said the United States would never close its doors to foreigners who flee persecution, even as she defended the Trump administration’s travel ban, which closed the door to refugees from six war-torn, mainly Muslim nations. She insisted that American taxpayers should get value for the money they contribute to the United Nations. She said nothing about whether the United States would help head off a potential humanitarian disaster from famine that the United Nations has warned is looming over 20 million people abroad. Ms. Haley’s remarks, made at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York early Wednesday morning, were her first as ambassador to an audience of foreign policy experts. She called it “an intimidating crowd.” She briefly channeled her boss, President Trump, by describing the United Nations as “basically a club” that needed to be disrupted. “The fact is, a wave is building throughout the world,” Ms. Haley said. “It’s a wave of populism that is challenging institutions like the United Nations, and shaking them to their foundations.” "

The Life
By John A. Farrell
Illustrated. 737 pages. Doubleday. $35. While writing “Richard Nixon: The Life,” John A. Farrell could not possibly have known who would be president on the day his fine book was published. That it happens to be Donald J. Trump is, for him, an extraordinary stroke of luck. To read this biography with an eye only toward the parallels between the two presidents would be lazy and unfair, a disservice to Farrell’s nuanced scholarship. But the context here is unignorable. The similarities between Nixon and Trump leap off the page like crickets. There is, first and most superficially, their nonpresidential looks — Trump with his roosterly combover, Nixon with jowls so low they formed an A-frame with his nose. More substantively, there’s the matter of their Old Testament fury at the news media. (“The press is the enemy,” Nixon told his aides. “Write that on the blackboard 100 times and never forget it.”) What else? Their thin skin. Their skyscraping paranoia. Their cavernous memory for slights. It’s hard to think of two modern presidents with a more dire case of political hemophilia. Once wounded, these men never stop bleeding. Like Trump, Nixon was a monomaniac on the stump, obsessed with the enemies lurking within. Nixon, too, had a penchant for sowing mayhem and a gourmand’s appetite for revenge, especially in the wee hours of the morning. (Trump tweets. Nixon made phone calls.) And members of Nixon’s own party feared for his stability. As vice president, he once flew into a rage after contending with a group of hostile student journalists at Cornell University. “What scares the hell out of me is that you would blow sky high over a thing as inconsequential as this,” an adviser told him. “What in goddamn would you do if you were president and get into a really bad situation?” "

Stocks are up 5 percent since the start of the year. And from the president on down, there’s talk of a Trump bump. The only problem: The boom is apparent everywhere except in the economic data. It’s not that the economy is stalling — far from it. But with the first quarter ending Friday, growth in the first three months of the Trump administration is looking much the way it did under President Barack Obama. In fact, experts see the gross domestic product in the quarter coming in at only about 1 percent, on an annualized basis — less than half the pace in the second half of 2016, and a far cry from President Trump’s own 4 percent target. “There is a temporal disconnect,” said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “There has been an incredible rise in sentiment, but the proof is in the pudding later.” Ms. Zentner expects growth of 1 percent this quarter, and considers recent data “solid,” but added that the big gap between expectations and reality “creates discomfort for economists and monetary policy makers.” “The divergence is stunning,” she added, drawing a distinction between “soft data” like consumer confidence and “hard data” like retail sales.

In a conspicuous show of bipartisanship during a fractious time at the Capitol, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee vowed to forge ahead by interviewing key players connected to Mr. Trump and pressing intelligence agencies to provide all relevant information. But their display of collegiality seemed intended primarily as a contrast to the explosive and often bewildering statements in recent days from the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, whose perceived closeness with the Trump White House has raised doubts about his ability to conduct an impartial investigation. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and a supporter of Mr. Trump during the campaign, suggested on Wednesday that he would not retreat from a process that could damage the reputation of a Republican president. “This investigation’s scope will go wherever the intelligence leads,” Mr. Burr said during a rare joint news conference. Asked later whether he had encountered any “direct links” between Mr. Trump and Russia’s interference, Mr. Burr was stern. "

Even if in the short term it provides jobs for coal miners, the ill effects put at risk their health, and the well-being of their families and future generations, as well as our shared planet. Rather than a red or a blue partisan issue, climate change is an evergreen one about life. TOBIAS WINRIGHT, ST. LOUIS The writer is an associate professor of health care and theological ethics at Saint Louis University. To the Editor: I am an environmental scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency, where I have enjoyed my work helping to improve our environment. But I am very saddened by what I see these days under an E.P.A. administrator whose role it is to dismantle the agency that he leads. I walk among my colleagues like a zombie in a bad dream; they also seem dazed. Our standard weekly newsletter now contains articles mainly about flower shows and photo contests rather than articles about environmental protection. Our president comes to the E.P.A. to sign an executive order withdrawing the Clean Power Plan and other environmental policies, and the audience applauds. I hope the nightmare ends soon. MICHAEL J. KRAVITZ, CINCINNATI To the Editor: I adored my grandfather. An immigrant from Portugal, he settled in Pennsylvania, working as a coal miner until he was forced out by black lung disease. He was an intelligent man who could speak and write fluently in several languages, but lacking a formal education in science, he was skeptical of the space race of the 1960s. My siblings and I would roll our eyes whenever he ranted about how the moon landing was faked. "

The legal question in the case was whether the convictions of seven defendants should be set aside because prosecutors had withheld evidence about another suspect. But the argument barely touched on legal principles. It was instead dominated by an intense effort to reconstruct what happened more than three decades ago. Prosecutors had presented no physical evidence, relying on eyewitness testimony. It was enough to convict eight defendants, including one who has since died, of brutally assaulting and killing Catherine Fuller. Twenty-five years after the trial, in 2010, lawyers for the defendants sought to reopen the case, saying their convictions had been tainted by violations of Brady v. Maryland, a 1963 Supreme Court decision that required prosecutors to turn over favorable evidence to the defense. They said prosecutors had withheld several kinds of evidence, most notably about another suspect, James McMillan. Mr. McMillan had been seen near the scene of the crime. After Ms. Fuller’s murder but before the trial, Mr. McMillan was arrested and later convicted on charges of robbing and assaulting two other middle-age women in the neighborhood. (Later, Mr. McMillan was convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering a woman in 1992, a few blocks from the alley where Ms. Fuller was killed.) Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, told the justices that “the evidence of the third-party perpetrator that petitioners have now put before this court is weak and speculative.” "

A room full of men is seen as commanding to some, so, as usual, Mr. Trump is telling those who love him what they want to hear, and in this case, showing them what they want to see. To his supporters, the homogeneous room is probably a comforting change from the more mixed Obama administration, and an affirmation that the powerful, take-charge persona they voted for is, in fact, in office right now. AIDAN LAMBIOTTE
TAKOMA PARK, MD. To the Editor: Jill Filipovic makes the point that the lack of diversity is a deliberate appeal to those who want to go back to a white male-dominated America. I submit that the strategy goes even deeper. I see this as an attempt to divide the Democratic Party by positioning the present political crisis as a war between women and men. My support for Bernie Sanders was criticized by female friends and allies, including my sisters, as anti-feminist. I have supported female candidates and women’s issues at every turn. Wars, a quasi-police state, global warming, and the attack on immigrant, minority and women’s rights affect men and women equally. Right-thinking women and men must remain united to stop this coup.

Furanyl fentanyl — or White China, as it is sometimes known — is a chemical analogue of fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that can be as much 50 times as powerful as heroin and has been blamed in some areas of the country for killing more people than heroin itself. Prosecutors said that the furanyl fentanyl seized in Wednesday’s case was produced in China, shipped to the United States by private mail and sold for as little as $7 to $10 per dose by a network of distributors in all five boroughs of New York. “These synthetics are lethal, they are cheap and they continue to flood into our streets,” Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, said at a news conference detailing the charges. Mr. Gonzalez added that the monthslong investigation of the drug ring, nicknamed Operation Hardball, turned up evidence that the traffickers were earning as much as $1 million a year. Though furanyl fentanyl was made illegal by the federal government in November, it is a new enough phenomenon that it has not yet been classified as a controlled substance under New York State law. As with K2, a synthetic form of marijuana that wreaked havoc across the city this summer, producers of fentanyl and its analogues can sometimes avoid prosecution by tweaking the chemical recipe of the drug to work around specific provisions of the law. In the 357-count indictment, the prosecutors in Brooklyn charged some of the defendants with the attempted sale of heroin, saying that many of the distributors and street-level dealers thought that they were selling heroin, not a knockoff. The indictment also accused members of the ring, including a supplier based in Phoenix, with selling heroin and cocaine as well. The charges came just two weeks after Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the city would spend as much as $38 million year on a comprehensive plan to stem the tide of opiate addiction, which police officials have said resulted last year in between 1,200 and 1,300 deaths — or nearly four times the number of murders in New York. Under the mayor’s plan, the city intends to pursue a broad array of initiatives, including expanding treatment for addicts, focusing on opioid addiction at city hospitals, aggressively prosecuting distributors of the drugs and handing out medication that can stop opiate overdoses to all 23,000 city patrol officers.

President Trump’s budget proposal is week-old news, but “The Daily Show” returned to it on Tuesday with a special report. Mr. Trump wants to cut funding for Meals on Wheels and other social services, while pouring billions of new dollars into the military. Trevor Noah’s team concluded that the way to save the meal-delivery program was to make Mr. Trump think it’s a military operation. Armed with sandwich launchers, and led by the “Daily Show” correspondent Roy Wood Jr., the squad calls itself Meal Team 6. Mr. Colbert complained on “The Late Show” that the Trump administration’s reported ties to Russia were a complicated, sometimes boring story to follow. So he found a way to simplify it. Jimmy Fallon skewered Mr. Trump for his sinking approval ratings. “This week it came out that his job approval rating is at just 36 percent,” Mr. Fallon said. “Trump was confused. He said, ‘How can you disapprove of a job I’m not even doing?’” Mr. Fallon came up with a list of things that are now, he said, officially more popular than the president: "

Two years of grinding divorce negotiations now begin, with the outcome unclear, except that the talks are certain to be contentious and spiteful — and that the only sure winners will be lawyers and trade negotiators. For the first time, the European bloc is losing a member, not to mention its second-largest economy. The multilateral architecture that has shaped the Western world since the aftermath of World War II has taken a severe blow, and as the letter was delivered on Wednesday, questions abounded about whether this pivot toward nationalism and self-interest represented the beginning of a more volatile global era. When Britons voted last June to leave the European Union, the champions of “Brexit” argued that the country, with its exit, was at the front edge of a larger populist wave. Months later, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States only deepened the feeling that an anti-establishment political contagion was sweeping across Western democracies, upending the established order. Britain, the argument went, would be a winner in this new era. Few people predicted the British exit, and fewer still predicted Mr. Trump’s victory. But few predicted where things stand now, either: The European Union, if still ailing and dysfunctional, is far from dead. Populist parties are sinking in the polls in Germany and underperformed in the Dutch elections this month. Opinion polls in many countries show continued public unhappiness with the bloc but little desire to see it fall apart. "

Trump’s presidential campaign staff and the Russian government, perhaps even influencing the 2016 election. When James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, went before Congress on March 20 and confirmed the existence of the Trump-Russia investigation, it echoed of the Cold War investigations in which the bureau and the C.I.A. searched for agents hidden in the government who had spied for Moscow. A look back at those Cold War cases may reveal lessons for today’s investigators. Above all, those past cases show it could take years before the new investigation uncovers any answers. Spy hunts usually begin with an unexplained incident. In the Trump-Russia case, there was the hacking of the D.N.C.’s computers. In 1985, there was an arrest on the streets of Moscow. In June 1985, Burton Gerber, the chief of the Soviet-East European division of the Central Intelligence Agency, was about to sit down to dinner at his home in Washington when he received devastating news. Paul Stombaugh, a C.I.A. case officer, had just been arrested by the K.G.B. in Moscow. Mr. Stombaugh had been caught while he was on a clandestine mission to meet the C.I.A.’s most important Russian spy, Adolf Tolkachev, a scientist at a secret military design facility who had been providing the Americans with top-secret information about Soviet weapons systems. Mr. Gerber knew that Mr. Stombaugh’s arrest meant that Mr. Tolkachev, an agent the C.I.A. had code-named GTVANQUISH, had certainly been arrested as well. "

The Senate already approved the bill, on a party-line vote, last week, which means that in the coming days President Trump will be able to sign legislation that will strike a significant blow against online privacy protection. The bill not only gives cable companies and wireless providers free rein to do what they like with your browsing history, shopping habits, your location and other information gleaned from your online activity, but it would also prevent the Federal Communications Commission from ever again establishing similar consumer privacy protections. The bill is an effort by the F.C.C.’s new Republican majority and congressional Republicans to overturn a simple but vitally important concept — namely that the information that goes over a network belongs to you as the consumer, not to the network hired to carry it. It’s an old idea: For decades, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, federal rules have protected the privacy of the information in a telephone call. In 2016, the F.C.C., which I led as chairman under President Barack Obama, extended those same protections to the internet. To my Democratic colleagues and me, the digital tracks that a consumer leaves when using a network are the property of that consumer. They contain private information about personal preferences, health problems and financial matters. Our Republican colleagues on the commission argued the data should be available for the network to sell. The commission vote was 3-2 in favor of consumers. "
948,Republicans Attack Internet Privacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/republicans-attack-internet-privacy.html?searchResultPosition=109,2017/03/29,OPINION,"Republicans just made clear how little they care about protecting the privacy of Americans by letting companies like Verizon and Comcast sell advertisers the internet browsing histories and other personal data of their customers without getting permission. The move could bolster the profits of the telecommunications industry by billions of dollars. Following a party-line vote in the Senate last week, the House approved a resolution on Tuesday that would overturn a broadband privacy regulation the Federal Communications Commission adopted in October. That rule requires cable and phone companies to obtain consent before using information like which websites people visited to show them customized ads and to build detailed profiles on them. The White House said on Tuesday that President Trump would sign the legislation, which would also prohibit the F.C.C. from adopting a similar policy in the future. Most Americans spend much of their lives online. They should be able to do so without fear that their internet service providers are logging their activities and selling the data. There is a long tradition of the government protecting such information. For example, the F.C.C. has long restricted what phone companies can do with call records. And in 1988 Congress prohibited video stores from disclosing the movies people rented. Republican lawmakers, like Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, say that the commission’s privacy rule is unfair because it applies only to broadband companies and not to internet businesses like Google and Facebook. This is highly disingenuous. Congress has only given the commission authority over telecommunications companies, so the F.C.C. couldn’t have come up with rules that applied to other businesses even if it wanted to. Telecom companies know a lot about what people do online because they are the gatekeepers through which people connect to the internet. And as people link household devices like thermostats, light bulbs and security cameras to the internet, these companies will have even more intimate knowledge about their customers. By comparison, people can more easily evade tracking by businesses like Google and Facebook by not using those services or by deleting the cookies those websites leave on their computers and phones. In the absence of strong privacy rules, people will have to rely on encryption to prevent service providers from tracking them. But broadband companies would still know what websites people visit. And the companies would be able to see all of the communications between users and websites that do not use encryption. Sophisticated users might increasingly rely on virtual private networks, which are used by corporations to let their employees log into secure systems remotely, and other tools to mask their activities, but most Americans are unlikely to be conversant with such tricks of the trade. Mr. Trump promised voters during the campaign that he would protect the working class. But now he and his party are moving quickly to do the bidding of a very different interest group: Big Telecom. "

Trump’s feelings about Chicago couldn’t have been clearer. He loved the place. It was 2004, and Mr. Trump, then a developer and reality show star, was waging a charm campaign here. He raved about Chicago’s “stunning” skyline and admired its architectural ingenuity as he proposed adding his own building to the mix. It was a “great city,” he said, right up there with his hometown, New York. Had Twitter existed at the time, Mr. Trump’s hashtag might have read #mykindoftown. Oh, how his views have changed. In recent months, Mr. Trump has repeatedly — obsessively, in the view of some — commented on Chicago’s street violence in interviews, debates and off-hour social media outbursts. “Chicago needs help!” he wrote on Twitter recently, after lamenting the city’s “carnage” in an earlier missive and vowing to “send in the feds” to save the day. On Tuesday, after meeting with police union leaders at the White House, Mr. Trump once again took note of this city’s violence, saying “I always ask, ‘What’s going on in Chicago?’” Politics could be partly to blame for Mr. Trump’s apparent change of heart. Chicago is Democratic to its core. It is where Barack Obama got his political start. And it is an easy foil when describing, as Mr. Trump does quite a bit, how dire urban America has become. But personal pique may also be an important factor when it comes to Mr. Trump’s relationship with the city. “It’s clear that he has a bone to pick with Chicago,” said Jesus G. Garcia, a Democratic Cook County commissioner. During Mr. Trump’s campaign, Chicago’s tight-knit, high-dollar Republican establishment showed tepid support, and he wound up canceling a rally here before he even arrived on stage, citing the raucous protesters who had gathered at the scene. But it may be the rejection he faced when he brought in his grand dream of putting up the world’s tallest skyscraper that stings most of all. "

Wrong. That’s all a smoke screen. Trump is actually a Chinese agent. He is clearly out to make China great again. Just look at the facts. Trump took office promising to fix our trade imbalance with China, and what’s the first thing he did? He threw away a U.S.-designed free-trade deal with 11 other Pacific nations — a pact whose members make up 40 percent of global G.D.P. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was based largely on U.S. economic interests, benefiting our fastest-growing technologies and agribusinesses, and had more labor, environmental and human rights standards than any trade agreement ever. And it excluded China. It was our baby, shaping the future of trade in Asia. Imagine if Trump were negotiating with China now as not only the U.S. president but also as head of a 12-nation trading bloc based on our values and interests. That’s called l-e-v-e-r-a-g-e, and Trump just threw it away … because he promised to in the campaign — without, I’d bet, ever reading TPP. What a chump! I can still hear the clinking of champagne glasses in Beijing. Now more Asian nations are falling in line with China’s regional trading association — the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership — which has no serious environmental, intellectual property, human trafficking or labor standards like TPP. A Peterson Institute study said TPP would “increase annual real incomes in the United States by $131 billion” by 2030, without changing total U.S. employment levels. Goodbye to that. "

President Obama and other American officials saw the pledges from both Beijing and Washington as crucial: China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by the United States. In the coming years, the opposite dynamic is poised to play out. President Trump’s signing of an executive order on Tuesday aimed at undoing many of the Obama administration’s climate change policies flips the roles of the two powers. Now, it is far likelier that the world will see China pushing the United States to meet its commitments and try to live up to the letter and spirit of the 2015 Paris Agreement, even if Mr. Trump has signaled he has no intention of doing so. “They’ve set the direction they intend to go in the next five years,” Barbara Finamore, a senior lawyer and Asia director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in New York, said of China. “It’s clear they intend to double down on bringing down their reliance on coal and increasing their use of renewable energy.” “China wants to take over the role of the U.S. as a climate leader, and they’ve baked it into their five-year plans,” she added, referring to the economic development blueprints drawn up by the Chinese government.

To sneak onto the White House grounds for that rendezvous with an unnamed source last week, he switched cars and ditched aides, vanishing into the night. But Senator Lindsey Graham looks at him and sees a different character. Graham said on the “Today” show on Tuesday that Nunes was bumbling his way through something of an “Inspector Clouseau investigation,” a reference to the fantastically inept protagonist of the “Pink Panther” comedies. I salute Graham’s movie vocabulary. I quibble with his metaphor. While Clouseau was a benign fool, there’s nothing benign about Nunes’s foolishness. As chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes, a California Republican, is a principal sleuth in the paramount inquiry into whether members of the Trump campaign were in cahoots with Russia, and from all appearances, he either doesn’t want to know the answer or has determined it already — in President Trump’s favor. Democrats are rightly calling on him to recuse himself. They’ve been joined in their alarm by Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican. As Graham summoned the specter of Clouseau, McCain said on “CBS This Morning” that “something’s got to change.” “Otherwise,” he continued, “the whole effort in the House of Representatives will lose credibility.” "

Rebellion has long been made into merchandise. “I saw the story Monday morning, and didn’t think much of it,” said Adam Petrick, Puma’s global director of brand and marketing. “But then everyone was talking about it, and it seemed like we could have fun with it, and it was easy to get behind. We’re a sports brand, and come down clearly on the side that leggings are pants, and women of any age should be able to wear leggings any time they desire.” Except, of course, none of this is really about leggings. Leggings are the excuse — or the symbol. But to focus on them, which so much of the discussion has done since the news of the United ban broke, is to miss the point. The question at the heart of the issue is not whether leggings are appropriate for planes. The question is, as in all discussions of dress code: Who gets to decide? The individual or the group? The individual or the business? Do we all have the inalienable right to express ourselves with apparel? Because what United was saying with its dress code was: When you fly on our dime you are representing our brand, and our brand takes flying with a certain amount of formality, the way it used to be taken. And what everyone else was saying is: When I fly (or do anything else for that matter, presumably) I am representing me, and I get to wear what I want, when I want. That tension has always existed, but in the past, the employer has generally won — at least when an individual was acting under the aegis of a brand, or on its behalf. Last year, however, when another dress code brouhaha broke out — this one about a temporary worker in Britain who was sent home for refusing to wear high heels — Susan Scafidi, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York and the founder of the Fashion Law Institute, told me that the pendulum had begun to swing the other way.

Giuliani had been retained to negotiate a resolution of the case with government officials at higher levels than the federal prosecutor overseeing the matter. The judge in the case on Tuesday asked Mr. Zarrab’s lawyers to clarify the roles of Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is close to President Trump, and Michael B. Mukasey, a former federal judge and attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, who have both been retained by Mr. Zarrab. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey traveled recently to meet with the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, about Mr. Zarrab’s case. Mr. Zarrab’s lead lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said in the letter to the judge on Thursday that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey were “merely serving an ancillary role which requires no direct interaction with the court.” They will not appear in court on behalf of Mr. Zarrab before or during his trial, Mr. Brafman wrote, and they “will not be engaging in plea negotiations with the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York.” But prosecutors in that office wrote to the judge on Monday, saying they had been “expressly advised” that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey had been retained by Mr. Zarrab and were involved in “efforts to explore a potential disposition of the criminal charges in this matter.” "

Sam Brownback of Kansas vetoed a bill on Thursday that would have expanded Medicaid in his state, setting up a potential showdown next week with a Legislature that, while heavily Republican, has come to favor extending the largely free health coverage to as many as 180,000 additional poor adults. Although the bill was easily approved in both chambers of the Legislature, supporters would need to muster three additional votes in the House and two in the Senate to override the veto by Mr. Brownback, a conservative Republican. After the House briefly debated an override on Thursday, the measure was put aside, probably until at least next week. Supporters were hoping to mobilize hundreds of residents who would benefit from Medicaid expansion, as well as hospital executives, clergy members and others who back the measure, to lobby specific lawmakers over the weekend. “Our plan is to make sure their phones are ringing off the hook,” said David Jordan, executive director of Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, an advocacy group. Republican lawmakers in Kansas were initially solidly opposed to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. But many softened their positions over the last year or so, particularly influenced by the financial struggles of the state’s small rural hospitals. Momentum grew after several Democrats and moderate Republicans picked up legislative seats in the elections last fall, although the leaders of both legislative chambers remain opposed to any expansion. In his veto message, Mr. Brownback said the cost of expanding Medicaid would be “irresponsible and unsustainable,” citing other states where Medicaid enrollment grew far more than expected after they expanded the program. The expansion effort comes in the midst of a budget crisis that has roiled Kansas for years. "

Mr. Luckey’s departure was announced two months after a trial in federal court over allegations that he and several colleagues had stolen trade secrets from a video-game publisher, ZeniMax Media, to create the Oculus technology. A jury found Facebook liable for $500 million in damages, in part for Mr. Luckey’s violation of a confidentiality agreement. “Palmer will be dearly missed,” Tera Randall, an Oculus spokeswoman, said in a statement. “His inventive spirit helped kick-start the modern VR revolution and helped build an industry.” Ms. Randall declined to disclose the terms of Mr. Luckey’s departure. The move adds another twist to Facebook’s bumpy foray into virtual-reality technology. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has bet big on virtual reality as part of the social network’s future, saying he envisioned social interactions between people will someday exist inside virtual worlds. Oculus, he has said, could be a catalyst for that. But from the start, Oculus has run into problems. Adoption of the Oculus technology and headsets has been slower than Facebook had anticipated. The selection of content made for VR headsets is still small, though growing. “These things end up being more complex than you think upfront,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in January while appearing in court for the ZeniMax trial. “If anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought upfront.” Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to spending more than $3 billion over the next decade to get virtual reality off the ground and into the mainstream. Mr. Luckey has had other stumbles. In 2016, it became public that he had donated $10,000 to Nimble America, a pro-Trump political organization that promoted far-right memes and slogans on social media sites like Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. He has since apologized for the impact his actions had on Oculus and its partners. Mr. Luckey did not immediately respond to a Facebook message requesting comment. In January, Facebook appointed a new leader, Hugo Barra, to head up the company’s virtual-reality efforts, including Oculus. "

In this article, Didi Kirsten Tatlow, a Beijing-based Times correspondent, compares notes and guilt trips with Times reporters around the world who have moved with their families to smog-laden news hubs. Air matters. So when the conversation over a recent lunch in The Times’s Beijing bureau turned to the air pollution that regularly suffuses this city with chemicals and despondency, Ian Johnson, a China correspondent, took out his phone to check Air Matters, an app that measures air quality based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality Index, which scores the air from 0 to 500. Over 300 and the air is “hazardous.” It was at 169, “unhealthy” by American standards and several times the World Health Organization’s recommended daily level. Air quality has long been a serious problem here in Beijing — for citizens and The Times’s foreign correspondents alike. Now efforts to dial back air pollution worldwide are likely to take a hit: On Tuesday, less than a week after rolling back fuel-economy standards for the auto industry, President Trump announced an executive order reversing the rest of the Obama administration’s climate plan. If carried through, the order — which lifts American limits on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, the largest contributor of particulate pollution — flies in the face of the United States’ pledge under the Paris climate accord to cut its emissions.

961,President Trump vs. Big Bird,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/president-trump-vs-big-bird.html?searchResultPosition=55,2017/03/30,OPINION,"So what if President Trump wants to deport Big Bird? We’re struggling with terrorism, refugees, addiction, and grizzlies besieging schools. Isn’t it snobbish to fuss over Trump’s plans to eliminate all funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting? Let me argue the reverse: Perhaps Trump’s election is actually a reminder that we need the humanities more than ever to counter nationalism and demagoguery. Civilization is built not just on microchips, but also on arts, ideas and the humanities. And the arts are a bargain: The N.E.A. budget is $148 million a year, or less than 0.004 percent of the federal budget. The per-capita cost for Americans is roughly the cost of a postage stamp. The humanities may seem squishy and irrelevant. We have a new president who doesn’t read books and who celebrates raw power. It would be easy to interpret Trump as proof of the irrelevance of the humanities. Yet the humanities are far more powerful than most people believe. The world has been transformed over the last 250 years by what might be called a revolution of empathy driven by the humanities. Previously, almost everyone (except Quakers) accepted slavery and even genocide. Thomas Jefferson justified the “extermination” of Native Americans; whippings continued in American prisons in the 20th century; and at least 15,000 people turned up to watch the last public hanging in the United States, in 1936. What tamed us was, in part, books. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” famously contributed to the abolitionist movement, and “Black Beauty” helped change the way we treat animals. Steven Pinker of Harvard argues that a surge of literacy and an explosion of reading — novels in particular — “contributed to the humanitarian revolution,” by helping people see other viewpoints. There is also modern experimental evidence that reading literary fiction promotes empathy. "
962,Why Democrats Should Work With Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/why-democrats-should-work-with-trump.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/03/30,OPINION,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has discovered that trying to work with Republicans, like trying to work on health care policy, is complicated. So with all his big campaign pledges in limbo following last week’s Obamacare fiasco, he reportedly is contemplating overtures to a party that actually wants to govern: the Democrats. This new tack comes, mind you, after Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for refusing to help him and House Speaker Paul Ryan eviscerate Obamacare. With zero support from Democrats, the pair had no margin for error as Republicans started to defect and were forced to pull their bill. Perhaps it’s beginning to dawn on the president that today’s Republican Party is designed for maximal obstruction and minimal constructive policy making. The rigidly doctrinaire Freedom Caucus essentially has veto power over White House initiatives, while moderates will jump ship if Mr. Trump concedes too much to right-wing purists. What’s more, Republicans are all over the map on the next big items on Mr. Trump’s agenda — tax reform and infrastructure. So even though Republicans control Congress and the White House, Washington’s new political math suggests that Mr. Trump may have no choice but to reach out to Democrats. If he could peel off several dozen moderate Democrats in the House and a handful in the Senate, he could neutralize the far right’s naysaying and give moderate Republicans a chance to vote for measures with broad, bipartisan support.

963,"New ISIS Tactic: Gather Mosul’s Civilians, Then Lure an Airstrike",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/middleeast/mosul-iraq-isis-military.html?searchResultPosition=16,2017/03/30,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — A United States military spokesman said Thursday that Islamic State fighters had been herding local Iraqi residents into buildings in western Mosul, calculating that rising civilian casualties would restrain the United States from using airstrikes to help retake that half of the city. “What you see now is not the use of civilians as human shields,” said Col. Joseph E. Scrocca, a spokesman for the American-led task force that is battling the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “ISIS is smuggling civilians into buildings so we won’t see them and trying to bait the coalition to attack.” An episode this week in which Islamic State fighters forced civilians inside a building, killing one who resisted, was observed by American surveillance aircraft. Islamic State fighters then positioned themselves inside the same structure to fire on Iraqi forces, according to an account provided in a briefing for Pentagon reporters by Colonel Scrocca. No video of the episode was released on Thursday, but he said the video would soon be made public. The furor over the March 17 American airstrike that led to the collapse of a building in western Mosul, killing scores if not hundreds of Iraqi civilians, as well as Defense Department allegations that Islamic State fighters deliberately placed the civilians in harm’s way, have caused a change in American tactics. “It has caused some adjustments to our procedures,” Colonel Scrocca said, though he declined to say what specific changes had been made. What has not changed is the generals’ decision to give greater authority to American officers on the battlefield to call in airstrikes. That decision was taken after Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of the task force that is battling the Islamic State, was told by subordinates that it was taking too long to conduct airstrikes when Syrian fighters were battling to take the town of Manbij in the northern part of the country and Iraqi fighters were first starting to take Mosul. The new procedures also will apply to the efforts to retake Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s capital. “This is a discussion that started in a November time-frame, and we started to pursue this. We recognized what we were stepping into,” Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of the United States Central Command, said in an interview Wednesday. “It was actually implemented for eastern Mosul, the whole urban environment, and frankly, as we kind of get ready for Raqqa. We are enabling our on-scene commanders across the area of operations.” "

After a little more than two months in office, President Trump has raised doubts about his ability to deal with what the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously described as the “known unknowns” and the “unknown unknowns.” “President Trump seems to have no awareness whatsoever of what he does and does not know,” Steven Nadler, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, wrote me. “He is ignorant of his own ignorance.” During his first 63 days in office, Trump made 317 “false or misleading claims,” according to The Washington Post. The FBI, the Treasury Department and two congressional committees are probing whether Trump’s campaign aides and advisers — including Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn — were complicit in alleged Russian interference. Without an obvious mandate (as the world knows, he lost the popular vote by 2.87 million), Trump has proposed a profound retrenchment of domestic policy. His 2018 budget, the potential impact of which he does not seem to grasp, calls for cutting $54 billion from programs that pay for education, housing and child care assistance for low- and moderate-income families, protection against infectious diseases, enforcement of environmental, worker and consumer protection regulation, national parks and a host of other social programs. See the accompanying chart, which illustrates the depth of these changes. It shows, to give a few examples, Trump’s proposal to cut the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 31 percent; the Labor Department by 21 percent; and the Health and Human Services budget by 16 percent.

Scores of departures by scientists and Silicon Valley technology experts who advised President Trump’s predecessor have all but wiped out the larger White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Mr. Trump has not yet named his top advisers on technology or science, and so far, has made just one hire: Michael Kratsios, the former chief of staff for Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley investor and one of the president’s wealthiest supporters, as the deputy chief technology officer. Neither Mr. Kratsios, who has a bachelor’s degree in political science from Princeton, nor anyone else still working in the science and technology office regularly participates in Mr. Trump’s daily briefings, as they did for President Barack Obama. “The impression this leaves is that Trump isn’t interested in science and that scientific matters are a low priority at the White House,” said Vinton G. Cerf, a computer scientist, vice president of Google and one of the chief architects of the internet. The dwindling of the White House science and technology staff for scientific research could have long-term consequences, Mr. Cerf said.

But the musical, by Luis Valdez, was a distinctly Los Angeles production: It was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving zoot-suit-wearing Mexican-American youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-Americans in summer 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group’s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the stage here for the first time since 1978. Tickets went on sale late last year and sold out quickly. The production has since been extended three times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and the enthusiasm demonstrate that the play touches a deep nerve in this city, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to find out what the play means to them. These interviews have been condensed and edited. Photographs by Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times When I first saw the movie in high school I felt really inspired. The pachucos loved the United States, but they did not want to give up their own culture. They created this subculture that was mixing all these backgrounds and creating this culture of resistance and their own identity. They were some of the first people who stood up for the Chicano community. When I wear a zoot suit I feel empowered, kind of like it’s a suit of armor. It’s not only honoring those in the past, but it makes you look sharp even though it doesn’t follow the norm of what a suit is supposed to look like. "

The meeting had been in the planning stages for several weeks as aides worked out the particulars. China had pushed for the more relaxed atmosphere of a meeting at Mr. Trump’s resort, rather than at the White House, American officials said. The leaders will have a full agenda as they hash out some of the more contentious issues in bilateral relations: Mr. Trump’s claims about China’s unfair trade practices; curbing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions; and American concerns about Chinese military ambitions in the South China Sea, among other matters. The meeting, on April 6 and 7, will follow a recent trip to China by the United States secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Tillerson struck a conciliatory tone as he met Mr. Xi in Beijing on March 19, a visit during which details of the Florida meeting were ironed out.

973,The Empty Supreme Court Confirmation Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/the-empty-supreme-court-confirmation-hearing.html?searchResultPosition=53,2017/03/30,OPINION,"The Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearing for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was just plain embarrassing, and not only for the nominee. But let’s begin with him, skipping over his Republican enablers, who had nothing to do but lob softball questions and praise his answers. If Judge Gorsuch wasn’t the least forthcoming Supreme Court nominee ever to appear at a confirmation hearing, it’s hard to imagine one who could be less forthcoming while still breathing. More interesting and less predictable answers could have come from Siri on an iPhone. The previous contender for the title of least forthcoming was Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016 and whom Judge Gorsuch would replace. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and confirmed unanimously, then-Judge Scalia wouldn’t even tell the Judiciary Committee whether he supported Marbury v. Madison, the landmark 1803 decision in which the court under Chief Justice John Marshall established the principle that federal courts can invalidate unconstitutional statutes. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then a Republican and later a Democrat, was so irritated by the nominee’s performance that four years later, when President George H. W. Bush nominated David H. Souter to the court, Senator Specter announced in advance that he expected an answer to the Marbury question. “That was one of 2,000 questions that Justice Scalia refused to answer,” the senator explained, his annoyance still simmering, as he ushered Judge Souter into his inner office for a private meeting. The Marbury v. Madison answer must have been satisfactory, because the two emerged shortly thereafter with Senator Specter praising the nominee’s “first-rate legal mind.” I’ve described this episode, which I witnessed, at some length because I’m tired of hearing that the refusal to answer the Judiciary Committee’s substantive questions began with Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s hearing in 1993. In fact, then-Judge Ginsburg was forthright in her support of the right to abortion, calling it “essential to woman’s equality,” and she praised the 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey as having strengthened the right in some respects. So it remains a mystery to me why Justice Ginsburg is singled out as the model of a say-nothing stance toward a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. (Just as it was a mystery to me why liberals during the past several years persisted in calling on her, and not the male justices who are her near age-mates, to retire and open a spot for President Barack Obama to fill. Nothing to do with her sex, I’m sure.) In any event, all Judge Gorsuch had to say about the right to abortion — as well as about the 51-year-old constitutional right to use birth control — was that it was supported by precedent. In answer to a question from Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committee’s chairman, about what he had to say about Roe v. Wade, the nominee answered: “I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, was a precedent of the United States Supreme Court.” Elaborating ever so slightly, he went on to observe that the decision had been reaffirmed and that people relied on it. “So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the United States Supreme Court, worthy of treatment as precedent like any other.” Precedents, of course, receive all kinds of “treatment” at the hands of future courts, from a warm embrace to being whittled away to outright overruling. What kind of “treatment” Judge Gorsuch thinks the court’s abortion precedents deserve was left neatly unspecified. "
974,Trump Remembers the Ladies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/trump-remembers-the-ladies.html?searchResultPosition=52,2017/03/30,OPINION,"Women’s History Month is coming to an end. Donald Trump must be absolutely exhausted. “… the White House has been hosting events all throughout March,” press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, launching into a list of activities that culminated Wednesday in a visit by the president to a special Women’s Empowerment Panel. The administration regarded this gathering as so important that it featured every single female cabinet member. Yes! All four! Actually, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao couldn’t come, so they substituted Seema Verma, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “My cabinet is full of really incredible women leaders,” the president said, looking at the quartet. There are 24 people in the cabinet. This is one of the reasons that pictures of White House decision-making resemble a meeting of the Freemasons. Besides Chao, the cabinet women include Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations, and Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration. While everybody wants to encourage small business and at least some of us want to encourage the U.N., neither of those would be regarded as exactly superpower positions. The final slot, secretary of education, belongs to Betsy DeVos, whose confirmation hearing was highlighted by the discovery that she didn’t know about the rights of disabled students. “I’m so proud,” the president beamed. He then set off on a quick march through women’s history, with shout-outs to Susan B. Anthony (“Have you heard of Susan B. Anthony?”), Harriet Tubman and “the legendary Abigail Adams.” "

I have been trying to convince the home to allow her to have one, and am making such excellent progress that I am sure I’ll be able to get her one for her 110th birthday. People are living longer these days, and one thing there is never a shortage of is cats. There is even a tribe of ferals around Ma’s nursing home parking lot. Once in a while, I’ve tried to grab a feral kitten to bring it in for a short visit. Why I keep trying, I don’t know; no matter how much whitefish you leave on a napkin, nobody is fast enough to catch a feral cat. So you’ll understand why, a year and a half ago, I decided it would be a great idea to get her a robo cat. My college roommate had sent me a link about it, the Hasbro Joy for All Companion Pet. This is some cat. It opens its eyes when you pet it, it purrs, and if you pet it long enough, it will roll over on its back for a belly rub. The commercials alone could make you weep: Elderly men and women, often in wheelchairs, are presented with a Joy for All Companion cat. At the sound of its meows or the sight of it washing its face with its paw, their faces light up as if someone has thrown a switch. They scratch its little ears, they lock eyes with it and snuggle it to their chests, they beam. Cat available in orange, gray and creamy white, $99.99. I order that fluffy little sucker so fast my credit card smokes. I get it in orange because we had an excellent orange-yellow tomcat when I was growing up in the Catskills, a lascivious boulevardier named Peaches whose sorbet-colored progeny dotted the town. A week later, I trot into my mother’s room with the cat, eager to see her go moist-eyed and tender. It didn’t happen a lot when my brothers and I were growing up — or ever, actually — but after someone’s brain has been fried in a major stroke and they’re in a wheelchair, things change. “What the hell is that?” Ma says. Wait — this wasn’t how it went in the movie. “It’s a robot cat,” I say. “I got it to hang out with you.” "
976,"No ‘Inner City’ in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Just Overlooked Strengths",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/nyregion/nadia-lopez-brownsville-brooklyn.html?searchResultPosition=17,2017/03/30,NEW YORK,"One recent morning, Nadia Lopez, a Brooklyn middle-school principal who became an internet celebrity two years ago — and as a result has been a guest of Ellen DeGeneres, Barack Obama and Drew Gilpin Faust, the president of Harvard, as well as an author — received a flood of text messages from family and friends who were outraged by an article in The Daily News titled “Brownsville Is Brooklyn’s Worst Neighborhood for Children.” For seven years, Ms. Lopez has run Mott Hall Bridges Academy in Brownsville to great acclaim, having gained national attention when the blog Humans of New York profiled a student who talked about what a profound influence she was. Part of the challenge of working in low-income urban communities is the fight against the perception that they are doomed and immiserating, an exercise that has required more energy in the age of President Trump, who has made use of the loaded term “inner city” to invoke the image of nightmare places where death always comes at gunpoint and schools are always synonymous with failure. The News’s article was pegged to a new report from the Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York, a nonprofit advocacy group whose purpose was to highlight both the deficits in Brownsville — its 40 percent poverty rate, nearly twice that of New York City on the whole, has remained unchanged during Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration — and its strengths, which are easy for outsiders to overlook. When I visited Ms. Lopez in her office to talk about what has changed in Brownsville and what hasn’t over the past several years, she spoke about how disheartening it was to see constant attacks in the news media, ones she believes were then internalized by children who would see themselves as hopeless and without value. Her mission involves a deft finesse between showing children the larger world of affluence — she takes students to stores and restaurants in Park Slope and Williamsburg so that they might know how the salumi half lives — and inculcating in them a sense of investment in their own neighborhood, so they might aspire to do well but ultimately return to the place they were brought up and improve it. “If kids have access and exposure they can change a trajectory,” she said, “but you can’t know what to ask for until you know what there is to want.” When Ms. Lopez takes the children through moneyed Brooklyn, they are consistently amazed that you can go to a store where the candy isn’t behind plexiglass and eat in restaurants where you sit down and the food is actually brought to you.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles, and the photographer Melissa Lyttle. When “Zoot Suit” made its debut in New York in 1979, it was the first time a Chicano show had made it to Broadway. But the musical by Luis Valdez was a distinctly Los Angeles production: it was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving Mexican-American zoot-suit-wearing youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-Americans in the summer of 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group’s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the downtown stage for the first time since 1978. When tickets went on sale late last year, the production sold out quickly and has since been extended three separate times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and enthusiasm demonstrates how the play touches a deep nerve in Los Angeles, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to hear what the play means to them.

978,The Blind Spots in Trump’s Foreign Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/the-blind-spots-in-trumps-foreign-policy.html?searchResultPosition=38,2017/03/30,OPINION,"AMHERST, Mass. — President Trump’s “skinny budget” might be a misnomer, because in foreign policy, at least, it is actually giving us fat nationalism. The biggest winners are the military, the Homeland Security Department and, of course, the wall. The biggest loser is the State Department and thus diplomacy. Mr. Trump is all about intimidating more and negotiating less. This is the hallmark of xenophobic nationalism. Mr. Trump is also blending xenophobic nationalism with protectionism. The jury is still out on how protectionist the Trump administration wants to be. But in relation to Latin America, even before revealing his budget, Mr. Trump already showed a clear preference for protectionism. He walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was as much about United States trade with Latin America’s rising Pacific economies as it was about trade with Asia. He has trashed Nafta, a trade agreement that is more important as a symbol of the reconciliation between the United States and Mexico than it is as a change in the economic fortune of the United States. His administration has expressed reservations about trade normalization with Cuba and the peace accord in Colombia, a nation with which the United States has a major trade agreement and a history of close cooperation. One problem with nationalist protectionism is that as an ideology, it is prone to double blindness: It is blind both to its exaggerations and to its consequences. Xenophobic nationalists exaggerate the extent to which the outside world takes advantage of the nation. The Chinese are manipulating their currency, Mexicans are taking jobs away, military allies are free-riding, and the rest of the world is misbehaving because it doesn’t fear you enough. And all of this happens “while we sit here like a bunch of dummies,” as Mr. Trump has tweeted. Nationalists thus exaggerate both the relative gains that others make at their expense, and the relative costs their own nations incur. They are blind to the concept of mutual gain; they see only abuse. "

What happens when you bring together 10 teenagers from poor communities and 10 police officers to try to get them to talk? Empathy ensues. “When the cops hear the kinds of things that these kids have gone through — a kid saying, ‘I hate cops because when I was 7 you barged into my house and you took my dad away and I never saw him again,’ cops have said to kids, ‘I don’t know how you live through this,’ ” said Lenora B. Fulani, a developmental psychologist who founded and runs Operation Conversation: Cops & Kids. Through theater and improvisation, the program aims to improve the often-contentious relationship between the police and youths from ages 15 to 21 in black and Latino communities. The empathy goes both ways, Dr. Fulani told us. “When I ask the cops what the hardest thing is about being a cop, the kids are really disturbed that the cops are not home for Christmas and that they’ve missed 10 holidays.” And just like that, Dr. Fulani said, snapping her fingers in the air, “the humanity surfaces on both sides. It’s very beautiful.” The program started after the deadly police shooting of Sean Bell in Queens in 2006. Today, 7,500 New York police officers have either participated in a private workshop or watched a public performance at venues including the Police Academy in Queens, the Apollo in Harlem and the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn.

The decision, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations, gives commanders at the United States Africa Command greater latitude to carry out offensive airstrikes and raids by ground troops against militants with the Qaeda-linked Islamist group Shabab. That sets the stage for an intensified pace of combat there, while increasing the risk that American forces could kill civilians. Mr. Trump signed a directive on Wednesday declaring parts of Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” where war-zone targeting rules will apply for at least 180 days, the officials said. The New York Times reported the Pentagon’s request for the expanded targeting authority on March 12, and Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the top officer at Africa Command, publicly acknowledged that he was seeking it at a news conference last Friday. “It’s very important and very helpful for us to have little more flexibility, a little bit more timeliness, in terms of decision-making process,” General Waldhauser said. “It allows us to prosecute targets in a more rapid fashion.” In a statement issued several hours after The New York Times first published news of the directive, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged that Mr. Trump had approved the Pentagon’s proposal to expand its targeting authority “to defeat Al Shabab in Somalia” in partnership with African Union and Somali forces.

In an early morning Twitter attack, Mr. Trump singled out members of the House Freedom Caucus, which scuttled his health care overhaul last week. “The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast,” he wrote. “We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!” He continued on Twitter throughout the day, naming individual members of the caucus, likening them to Democrats and urging other Republicans to “fight them” in the 2018 midterm elections if they do not back his agenda. But the Republican upstarts hardly cowered in the face of Mr. Trump’s criticism. They struck back, some of them ridiculing the president, using his own taunting and confrontational social media style. “Stockholm Syndrome?” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia asked on Twitter, suggesting that the president had become captive to the Republican establishment he attacked during the campaign. “It’s a swamp not a hot tub. We both came here to drain it. #SwampCare polls 17%. Sad!” wrote Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who often sides with the caucus on votes, mocking the president’s drain-the-swamp campaign pledge. "

The word is lagniappe, a bonus, like the 13th doughnut in the purchased dozen. As I went through yet another operation, my way was eased by the kindness of friends and relatives. The greatest extravagance came from my daughters who gave me their precious time. The younger flew in from New York City, the older from Boston. They were my lagniappes, in a sense: a bonus beyond the gift of having a potential health crisis averted. At my age, 72, and with my history, eight years of ongoing treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, I knew that their presence would bolster me. At the hospital, I went straight to radiology in order to undergo what is called the Savi Scout procedure. A mammogram machine was used to locate the calcifications that were causing the concern and then a tiny reflective device was shot into that spot. The radiologist used a black marker to ink an X above the spot on my skin. Later, during the operation, a wand placed on the X would activate radarlike waves: Beeping would send my surgeon to the reflector’s location. It would be removed, the technician explained, along with the abnormal cells. Then I was taken to a preoperative cubicle where I met with the surgeon and the anesthesiologist. I remember being wheeled toward the operating room, positioning myself on a narrow table, and being informed that I was being given something for sedation. I awoke with the comforting awareness of many gifts: my daughters’ company and also the extraordinary expertise of radiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses; the astonishing technologies upon which they relied; my excellent insurance that would compensate them; and my ability to afford the extra services I needed to make the outpatient procedure as easy as possible, including a hired car and driver to take us home. During that ride, still logy from drugs, I received an email from a reader concerned that the Trump administration’s proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act would seriously limit the cancer screenings that Planned Parenthood provides. Federal money is already prohibited from being used to pay for abortions, but the proposal would have cut off more than $400 million in federal funding to Planned Parenthood for other services including birth control, cancer screenings and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.

But Mr. Trump, eager to showcase his tough stance against unfair trade practices, plans to sign two executive orders on Friday that will lay the groundwork for new policies and stricter enforcement of trade laws. The president will order a 90-day study of abusive trade practices that contribute to the United States’ trade deficit. The Commerce Department and the United States trade representative will do a country-by-country, product-by-product accounting of the reasons for the imbalance. A second directive is aimed at increasing the collection of duties from countries whose companies American officials believe are selling products in the United States below their cost of production. Neither measure will have an immediate impact on trade policy or enforcement, but each could eventually lead to aggressive new measures. Both are aimed at showcasing Mr. Trump’s intent to fulfill his promises on trade. “These actions are designed to let the world know that this is another step in the president fulfilling his campaign promise,” said Wilbur L. Ross, the secretary of commerce. He said the findings would “form the basis for decision-making by the administration” on how to approach trade deficits in the future, including in a renegotiation of Nafta. “For the first time, we’re looking comprehensively at the source of what has been a large and persistent trade deficit that has contributed to job losses, the loss of our manufacturing base and other things,” said Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump’s National Trade Council.

In the end, in a strange and profoundly American collision of polarized politics, big-time sports, commerce and the culture wars, North Carolina’s notorious House Bill 2 was finally laid to rest on Thursday — though many were left wondering if some of its negative effects might linger. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed legislation repealing the law after it was approved by the Republican-controlled legislature. House Bill 2 had restricted the ability of municipalities to enact anti-discrimination policies and required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. In addition to repealing House Bill 2, the new law gives the General Assembly the sole power to regulate access to “multiple occupancy restrooms, showers or changing facilities.” It also creates a moratorium on local nondiscrimination ordinances through 2020. The compromise agreement came amid a looming threat that the N.C.A.A., which had already relocated a year’s worth of championship tournament games from the state, was planning to eliminate more, including future men’s Division I basketball tournaments. It was met with bitter criticism from gay rights groups, which said it was barely a repeal at all, and from conservatives, who said it backtracked on protecting public safety and traditional values. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Cooper said that the agreement would begin undoing the economic damage and that both sports events and economic development would begin coming back to the state. This week, The Associated Press calculated that North Carolina stood to lose more than $3.7 billion over the next dozen years if House Bill 2 were not repealed. “This is not a perfect deal and it is not my preferred solution; it stops short of many things we need to do as a state,” Mr. Cooper said. “In a perfect world, with a good General Assembly, we would have repealed HB2 fully today, and added full statewide protections for L.G.B.T. North Carolinians.” "

Putin responded publicly on Thursday to the nationwide anticorruption demonstrations with a familiar message: après moi, le déluge. Speaking in the northern port of Arkhangelsk at an international forum on Arctic issues, Mr. Putin defended his record on fighting corruption and warned that such outbursts, if uncontained, could lead to chaos akin to that spawned by the Arab Spring uprisings. Mr. Putin did not mention Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader who called for the demonstrations and who would like to oppose the president in the March 2018 election. But Mr. Putin left little doubt to what, or to whom, he was referring when he called the marches part of a presidential campaign. After accusing unidentified “political forces” of using public concern about corruption to promote their own “selfish interests,” Mr. Putin said this would only end in chaos if allowed to continue. “We well know, and I want to direct your attention to the fact, that this instrument was used in the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring. We know very well what this led to, to what bloody events it led to in this region,” he said. “We likewise know very well that this was one of the inciting motives and pretexts for the coup d’état in Ukraine. We also know well into what chaos these events sunk our neighbor, Ukraine.” Presiding over what some critics portray as a Mafia-like government that has conferred vast riches on a select few friends and associates of the president, Mr. Putin presented himself as a stalwart corruption fighter.

The revelation on Thursday that White House officials disclosed the reports, which Mr. Nunes then discussed with Mr. Trump, is likely to fuel criticism that the intelligence chairman has been too eager to do the bidding of the Trump administration while his committee is supposed to be conducting an independent investigation of Russia’s meddling in the presidential election. It is the latest twist of a bizarre Washington drama that began after dark on March 21, when Mr. Nunes got a call from a person he has described only as a source. The call came as he was riding across town in an Uber car, and he quickly diverted to the White House. The next day, Mr. Nunes gave a hastily arranged news conference before going to brief Mr. Trump on what he had learned the night before from — as it turns out — White House officials. The chain of events — and who helped provide the intelligence to Mr. Nunes — was detailed to The New York Times by four American officials. Since disclosing the existence of the intelligence reports, Mr. Nunes has refused to identify his sources, saying he needed to protect them so others would feel safe going to the committee with sensitive information. In his public comments, he has described his sources as whistle-blowers trying to expose wrongdoing at great risk to themselves. "
987,Israel Approves First New Settlement in Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/middleeast/israeli-settlements-netanyahu.html?searchResultPosition=30,2017/03/30,MIDDLE EAST,"JERUSALEM — Israel’s government on Thursday approved the establishment of a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time in more than two decades, and also laid the groundwork for further expansion despite a request from President Trump to hold off on settlement activity. It was not immediately clear whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had received a green light from the White House for Thursday’s announcement. Mr. Trump’s public request to hold off on settlements came during a meeting between the two leaders at the White House last month, after a series of moves by the Israeli leader to approve thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank. In a carefully calibrated statement issued two weeks before the meeting, the White House said, “While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.” Previous administrations viewed the settlements as an obstacle to peace, and the Palestinians and much of the world consider them a violation of international law. But it was not immediately clear whether the approval of the new settlement was meant to be a provocative move to scuttle the prospect of a revival of peace talks. Mr. Netanyahu said he was following through on a pledge he made a few weeks ago to 40 settler families who were evacuated from the illegal Amona outpost in the West Bank. That outpost was removed by court order because it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. “I promised at the outset that we would build a new community,” Mr. Netanyahu said earlier Thursday. “I believe that I first gave that promise back in December, and we will uphold it today.” "

The only real question is how the Senate Democrats will express their opposition to the violation of longstanding norms and traditions by Republicans that led to his nomination. The most common options being discussed are a simple “no” vote by the full Democratic bloc or an effort to delay the vote by filibuster, which is expected to lead to a further degradation of Senate rules by the Republican majority. Perhaps a third option should be considered: a boycott of the vote by Senate Democrats. They should refuse to legitimize the confirmation process by taking part. The end result might be the same — a confirmation of Judge Gorsuch by the Republican majority — but the symbolism would be clear. This nomination was achieved through a failure of democracy, and to participate in the confirmation vote would give it an appearance of legitimacy that it does not deserve. ALAN MELCHIOR
MIDDLEBORO, MASS. To the Editor: After Republicans left Judge Merrick Garland high and dry, Democrats became rebels with a cause. But Democrats may be cutting off their nose to spite their face by thwarting President Trump’s nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch. They could do worse. Judge Gorsuch’s admission to being offended by President Trump’s attack on the integrity of federal judges was a bold move. If he is confirmed, there is a possibility that he could move to the left. And for all we know, Mr. Trump may live to regret this nomination, if he hasn’t already. JOANN LEE FRANK
CLEARWATER, FLA. To the Editor: “Roadblock to the Court for Neil Gorsuch” (editorial, March 24) offers a hearty endorsement of the use of the filibuster against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch. At the time of the Democratic Senate majority’s 2013 elimination of the filibuster for lower federal court judges and executive branch appointments, The Times, in an editorial titled “Democracy Returns to the Senate,” called the filibuster the Senate’s “most infuriating rule,” and lauded Democrats for the change: “That means a return to the democratic process of giving nominees an up-or-down vote, allowing them to be either confirmed or rejected by a simple majority.” An “infuriating rule” should not be deemed less so, and an undemocratic procedure should not be deemed less so, simply because Republicans now hold a majority in the Senate. The Times ended its 2017 editorial endorsing the filibuster of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination with “What goes around comes around.” Perhaps the 2013 editorial should have ended that way as well.

The vote was one of a string of showdowns to reverse Obama-era regulations, but this one unfolded with all the drama of numerous past conflicts over abortion funding — with Mr. Pence casting the tiebreaking vote in his role as president of the Senate. “Today, Congress is sending a resolution to President Trump ensuring that states are not forced to fund America’s abortion giant, Planned Parenthood, with Title X tax dollars,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a prominent anti-abortion group. Taking money away from Planned Parenthood, the bill’s target, has been a longstanding goal of congressional Republicans, but earlier efforts were blocked by Democrats and President Barack Obama. Even with Republicans in full control of Washington, however, the process was not easy. The measure fell under a somewhat obscure and, until recently, rarely used Congressional Review Act that allows a new Congress to undo late actions of a previous presidential administration during the first few months of the year. It returns to the states the power to exclude health care centers that perform abortions from receiving Title X money set aside for family planning and related preventive health services for women. Title X grants cover contraception, as well as cancer and other disease screenings and treatments, but they cannot, under current federal law, be used to pay for abortion services. "

In an early morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump lamented what a “shame” it is that “someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost.” Mr. Trump and some of his aides immediately pushed back against the book, “Fear: Trump in the White House,” written by the famed Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, when excerpts were released on Tuesday, a week before it officially goes on sale. The president, who regularly rails against news reports that are not flattering to him and calls them “fake news,” has raised the issue of changing libel laws in the past. In March 2017, the president made a similar appeal when he was unhappy with reporting in The New York Times. “Change libel laws?” he asked. On the campaign trail, where he was not constrained by Twitter’s character limit, Mr. Trump was more expansive. “I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected.” "

Tillerson showered praise on Turkey’s government on Thursday, despite what some international critics see as a slide toward authoritarianism, and in response he got an earful of grievances from Turkish officials. Mr. Tillerson’s visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital, was intended to reassure a NATO ally in the fight against the Islamic State and a regional bulwark against a resurgent Iran. Turkish officials have repeatedly protested United States support for and reliance on Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria at the same time the Turks are waging a campaign against Kurdish militants inside Turkey. Mr. Tillerson was vague on Thursday when discussing American support for the Kurds, saying only that there were “difficult choices that have to be made.” Standing beside Mr. Tillerson on Thursday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that Turkey expected the United States to cut off aid to Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State, and that American law enforcement should arrest a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania whom the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a coup attempt last July. “We are expecting better cooperation,” Mr. Cavusoglu said.

It’s an unpaid role as an adviser to her father, the president, but it comes with an office, a title and, presumably, an even higher perch from which to fashion herself as a crusader for working women. “Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties — they should be the norm,” she said at the Republican National Convention last summer. She has written a book, to be published in May, called “Women Who Work.” In her very own West Wing office she will shepherd policy related to “women in the workplace,” according to her lawyer. In April she’s headed to a summit meeting in Berlin on women in the work force. While Ms. Trump may want to be the new face of working motherhood, the reality of the policies she has devised for her father diverge starkly from her rhetoric. They offer very little to most parents, especially the ones who really need the support. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump unveiled his daughter’s plan for six weeks of paid leave for women who give birth. When pressed, Ms. Trump made it clear that her policy was tailored specifically for coping with childbirth and was not meant for new fathers or parents who adopt. It’s a plan that is likely to hurt all working women more than help them. Employers are already more hesitant to hire mothers than other candidates, male or female. Part of what they fear, fair or not, is investing in an employee who will then leave to care for her children for some unknown period, taking all her training and knowledge with her and requiring the company to spend resources hiring a replacement. Their anxiety will be amplified if women are afforded time off from work for a new child and men aren’t. If only mothers get a paid leave benefit when their family welcomes a new child, the stigma falls squarely on one gender. "

The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet. Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation. In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had “reclassified them as common carriers.” Mr. Spicer said President Trump had “pledged to reverse this overreach.” The Obama-era rules, Mr. Spicer said, were an example of “bureaucrats in Washington” placing restrictions on one kind of company — internet service suppliers — and “picking winners and losers.” Telecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers. "

So less than a week later, after President Trump on Thursday warned the Freedom Caucus that he would “fight them” when they face re-election next year, Mr. Sanford was hardly cowering in fear. Instead, he and other members of the Freedom Caucus returned fire. “Intimidation may work with some in the short term, but it never really works in the long run,” Mr. Sanford said, adding that Mr. Trump should interpret the recalcitrance of conservative lawmakers as an indication of a flawed bill: “What you can’t do is shoot messengers.” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia, another Freedom Caucus member, was even more blunt. “Stockholm Syndrome?” he asked on Twitter above a copy of Mr. Trump’s taunting post, suggesting the president had become captive to the Republican establishment he gleefully flayed during the campaign. Mr. Trump’s attack on fellow Republicans was only the latest and most high profile in the increasingly open warfare within the party that controls Washington but has struggled to gets its legislative agenda off the ground. When Mr. Trump and some Senate Republican suggested that the law should be repaired with the help of Democrats, it was the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who spoke out and discouraged the idea. That, in turn, led Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, to blast Mr. Ryan. "

As the war there stretches into a seventh year, more than five million citizens, nearly a quarter of Syria’s prewar population, have fled their country, seeking shelter mainly in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday. Five million people is roughly equal to the population of Norway. If nearly a quarter of the United States’ population left the country, it would be as if the combined populations of California, New York and Florida had disappeared. In addition, 6.3 million Syrians have been internally displaced by the war. Altogether, about half of all Syrians have been forced from their homes because of violence. With no end to the war in sight, Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, predicted that 480,000 more Syrians would become refugees in need of resettlement this year. That is as if the entire population of Sacramento abandoned the city — and the country — over the course of the next nine months. Since the conflict began in 2011, an estimated 400,000 people have been killed. The five million Syrians who escaped war, starvation and deprivation now live mostly in one of five countries, often in squalid camps teeming with people. The majority of those refugees, nearly three million, have sought shelter in Turkey. Turkey, a country of 75 million, has absorbed a contingent of refugees equal to 4 percent of its population. The country’s location on the doorstep of Europe has increased its leverage in negotiations with the West about the fate of refugee resettlement, but the sheer number of people has taxed the country’s resources. Since February alone, 47,000 Syrians have sought refuge in Turkey. Two million other refugees are scattered through Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Last year, the United Nations sought pledges to resettle 500,000 Syrians around the world. Since then, only half that many have been given homes. “We still have a long road to travel in expanding resettlement and the number and range of complementary pathways available for refugees,” Mr. Grandi said. “To meet this challenge, we not only need additional places, but also need to accelerate the implementation of existing pledges.” The United States previously pledged to make 64,000 places available for Syrians. But President Trump has sought to decrease the number of refugees entering the United States. In January, he signed an executive order barring all Syrian refugees from entering the country, but he was forced to replace it when federal courts blocked it. His second order is also tied up, working its way through the courts. "

Mr. Cuomo said he and lawmakers had come to agreement on a wide array of subjects, including a plan for tuition-free college at state schools; expanded ride sharing to upstate; changes in workers’ compensation; opioid treatment; water infrastructure; and an extension of the so-called millionaire’s tax, something the governor has said is critical to funding his 2017 agenda. But if Mr. Cuomo’s remarks were meant to inspire confidence in a coming deal, the immediate reaction from legislators did anything but.

Mr. Trump, speaking in a wide-ranging interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, described the infrastructure package as a high-value legislative sweetener that he could attach to a revived Affordable Care Act repeal bill or tax code overhaul to attract bipartisan support that thus far he had neither sought nor received. “Infrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill,” said Mr. Trump, who is in need of a legislative win after the humbling defeat of his health care bill last month. “Infrastructure is so popular with the Democrats and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too.” The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on middle- and upper-income real estate development, has proposed eliminating an Obama-era infrastructure program that would have funded long-delayed proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem. State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattan’s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012. As Mr. Trump discussed his plan, hundreds of thousands of commuters endured a third day of upheaval prompted by a minor derailment at Pennsylvania Station, another reminder of the decrepit, tenuous state of much of the region’s infrastructure and transit systems.

They were married for six years. Trump and Maples have a daughter named Tiffany. She was named after a famous jewelry store. It is right next door to Trump Tower in New York City.” “A Kids’ Guide to America’s First Ladies” (HarperCollins) “First ladies like Pat Nixon and Betty Ford worked as models, but Melania is the only one to have had a successful career and also the only one who posed nude. At 5-feet-11, she is tied with Michelle Obama and Eleanor Roosevelt for tallest first lady.” “A True Book: President Donald Trump” (Scholastic Inc.)

As the executive editor for the children’s division of Time Inc. Books, she and her colleagues had worked through the fall to update their book “Presidents of the United States.” They added a spread about Barack Obama, another about the 2016 election and a third about Hillary Clinton, who polls had indicated would be elected the 45th president. In the days after the election, Ms. Sutinis scrambled to produce a profile of the person who was elected instead. “It was one of the harder things I have had to do in a long career of writing and editing nonfiction for kids,” she said. Presidential biographies are a staple of children’s book publishing, and of classrooms across the country. Nonfiction for children is a surging category, particularly in light of a Common Core mandate that schools put greater emphasis on it in their curriculum. Publishers like Penguin Young Readers, Scholastic and Time for Kids chronicle stories like the rise of Mr. Obama from Illinois state senator to president, or the political legacy of the Bush family, interspersing those accounts with facts about presidential history. The books hit bookshelves every four years, usually long before historians and writers of nonfiction for adults weigh in. But the story of Donald J. Trump posed a unique set of challenges. After an election cycle whose divisive effect on voters is still being felt, publishing books for classroom use has been unusually perilous. For Ms. Sutinis, the difficulty went beyond the time crunch to finding concise quotations from Mr. Trump’s campaign appearances that didn’t include contentious remarks. Ms. Sutinis’s updated edition outlines Mr. Trump’s business and television career and his campaign. “He made controversial remarks about several groups of people, including Latinos, Muslims, African-Americans and women,” the book reads. “This led many, including some Republican officials, to back away from him.” It goes on: “But Trump continued to receive wide support and thousands of people attended his rallies.” "

A year and a half ago, he huddled with two friends in a Quebec maple sugar shack, discussing how to stop the spread of what they call “invasive political Islam” in Canada. They formed a group called La Meute, or Wolfpack, created a Facebook page and invited like-minded people to join. Within a month, they had 15,000 followers. Today, the number has surpassed 50,000, and the group is still attracting people. Now, Mr. Beaudry and his colleagues say they are shaping those followers into dues-paying members who will give the group financial muscle and, they hope, political clout. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has publicly opened Canada’s doors to refugees and presented a face of tolerance and inclusion in a world increasingly hostile to migration. But as Canadian immigration policy has transformed the nation over decades, pockets of intolerance have grown across the country. Nowhere has it galvanized such large numbers as in Quebec, where many people still refer to themselves as pure laine, or pure wool, direct descendants of the 17th-century settlers of New France. The most emotional response has focused on conservative Muslim immigrants, who perhaps present the greatest contrast to traditional European-based culture and the secularism that Quebec struggled hard to win from the Roman Catholic Church. The concerns are outsize by any measure. Muslims represent just 3 percent of Canada’s population, and while Islam is one of the fastest-growing religions in the country, Muslims will still account for less than 6 percent of the population in 2050, according to the Pew Research Center.

Conservative groups moved quickly on Wednesday to shift the blame for the failure of a seven-year promise to repeal the law onto some not-as-conservative Republicans, after a small but powerful group of hard-line House conservatives failed again to come to a meeting of the minds with the Trump administration over how best to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature achievement. “The left wing among House Republicans doesn’t want to compromise or keep their pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare,” David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative free-market advocacy group, said in a statement. “They’ve rejected deals that would give Americans more choices for cheaper health insurance, and now they won’t even allow states the chance to scale back Obamacare’s costliest regulations.” The accusation — echoed by other conservatives — represents a remarkable turnaround in the blame game. The group and its supporters have opposed much of the major legislation considered by Congress in recent years. Last month, a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed to get enough support to bring it to a vote. About 30 of the most conservative members of the House rejected the bill as preserving too much of the existing law, but as they pressed to dismantle ever more provisions, they pushed away more moderate House Republicans who were leery of leaving 24 million more Americans without health insurance. The effort was left for dead, until Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump administration officials raced up to the Capitol this week to cobble together a new agreement with the most conservative Republicans, the House Freedom Caucus. The revived measure, stirring in its grave, was known informally on Capitol Hill as Zombie Trumpcare. "

McMaster Win?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/opinion/did-hr-mcmaster-win.html?searchResultPosition=71,2017/04/05,OPINION,"The Trump administration’s decision to remove its chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, from the National Security Council’s principals committee, along with the deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland’s likely exile to Singapore, as the United States ambassador, seems to indicate that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, is finally getting a little hard-earned bureaucratic traction. Not so fast: Other signals suggest that President Trump’s national security team remains as weak and dysfunctional as ever. And while some people are crediting General McMaster with a big win, the reality is much different. Reportedly from the moment he hired General McMaster, President Trump gave him broad staffing freedom. Yet Ms. McFarland, whom General McMaster wanted out, remained in place for well over a month. More egregiously, in mid-March, General McMaster tried to fire Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council. Mr. Cohen-Watnick, a holdover from Michael Flynn’s aborted stint as national security adviser, complained to Mr. Bannon and Jared Kushner, who prevailed on Mr. Trump to have him reinstated. The idea that the 30-year-old Mr. Cohen-Watnick should be senior director for intelligence programs — a position held by senior career C.I.A. officers in the Obama administration and others — is dubious. Furthermore, General McMaster’s decision to get rid of Mr. Cohen-Watnick was well within his pay grade. And Mr. Trump’s countermanding an understandable and routine staffing decision not only reneged on his deal with General McMaster, it also segued to an episode of clear White House obstructionism. A few days after his reinstatement, Mr. Cohen-Watnick was one of three White House staffers who facilitated a briefing to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on the “incidental surveillance” of Trump campaign staff members, which Mr. Nunes used to distract news media and public attention from the committee’s investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the outcome of the presidential election. A little unpacking revealed how artlessly pretextual this distraction was: Mr. Nunes professed the need to learn new information about surveillance to warn the president, yet that very information was in the possession of the White House and accessible to Mr. Trump without Mr. Nunes’s intervention.

1008,Baltimore Judge Rejects Request to Delay Police Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/baltimore-delay-police-hearing.html?searchResultPosition=80,2017/04/05,U.S.,"BALTIMORE — A federal judge refused on Wednesday to delay a hearing on a proposed agreement to overhaul the Baltimore Police Department, calling the Trump administration’s request a “burden and inconvenience.” The Justice Department had asked for a delay earlier this week, saying it needed time to review the plan and determine whether the proposal, called a consent decree, would hinder efforts to fight violent crime in the city. Federal District Judge James K. Bredar said the hearing would go on as scheduled on Thursday. With hundreds of people expected to testify, the judge said that pushing back the hearing would be a “burden and inconvenience to the court, other parties and, most importantly, the public.” Judge Bredar noted that it was “highly unusual” that both the city and the Justice Department had requested the hearing to allow Baltimore residents to comment on the proposed consent decree. “The primary purpose of this hearing is to hear from the public,” he wrote. “It would be especially inappropriate to grant this late request for a delay when it would be the public who were most adversely affected by a postponement.” A Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, declined to comment. The Obama Justice Department opened an investigation into accusations of misconduct in the Baltimore Police Department in 2015, after the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who sustained a neck injury while in police custody, plunged the city into unrest. The department published a scathing report outlining widespread abuses, including excessive force, unlawful stops and discriminatory practices. Last month, dozens of organizations and about 50 people submitted 195 pages of written comments on the proposed agreement, which the city reached with the Justice Department during the last days of the Obama administration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo this week announcing his intention to review all existing consent agreements. The Justice Department’s request to postpone the hearing was met with fierce opposition from city officials, including Mayor Catherine E. Pugh and the police commissioner, Kevin Davis, both of whom vowed to press on with an overhaul of the Police Department regardless of what happens with the consent decree. But Commissioner Davis and Ms. Pugh emphasized that a court-enforced agreement would enable the department to put those changes in place. "

Two days after a New Jersey Transit train derailed at Pennsylvania Station in New York on Monday, eight of the 21 tracks at the station, North America’s busiest, remained closed on Wednesday, prompting a third day of travel chaos across the region. Officials at Amtrak, which owns Penn Station, said they were working to repair damage caused by the derailment but warned that service might not be fully restored until Friday. Minor train derailments are not uncommon, but this one occurred at one of the worst possible spots: a switch point where multiple tracks connect and space for workers making repairs is tight. So far, the investigation into the derailment has focused on the condition of the tracks, rather than on human error or mechanical problems with the train, according to an official in New Jersey who was briefed on the inquiry but who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The infrastructure damage caused by the derailment was extensive, totaling more than $1 million, the official said. On Wednesday, Scot Naparstek, Amtrak’s chief operating officer, said in an interview that the investigation was continuing and that he did not want to draw conclusions about what had caused the derailment. He apologized again to the thousands of passengers inconvenienced by the accident. "
1010,Advocacy Groups Ask for Ban on Common Pesticide,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/well/advocacy-groups-ask-for-ban-on-common-pesticide.html?searchResultPosition=96,2017/04/05,WELL,"Advocacy organizations seeking to ban a pesticide linked to developmental disorders in children asked the courts Wednesday to intervene and order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban the pesticide from food within 30 days and from all uses within 60 days if it cannot prove it is safe. The head of the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, last week denied the petition to outlaw chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often used on apples, oranges and other crops, even though the agency’s own safety experts concluded that the chemical should be outlawed. Mr. Pruitt did not present any new evidence that it is safe, and said the agency could not be forced to complete a review of chlorpyrifos until 2022, when there is a deadline for re-evaluating it. The E.P.A. had been under a court order to respond by the end of March to a 10-year-old petition to ban the chemical, originally filed in 2007 by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pesticide Action Network. The most recent E.P.A. analysis concluded that children were being exposed to up to 140 times the safe levels of the pesticide through food alone. An earlier report said drinking water can also be contaminated. “The science is clear that this chemical is dangerous,” said Erik Olson, senior attorney and director of the health program at N.R.D.C. “We are asking the court to step in to keep our children safe.” An E.P.A. report issued last November concluded the risks justified a complete ban on chlorpyrifos, citing studies on pregnant women and children done at Columbia University that found evidence of neurodevelopmental effects in children whose mothers were exposed to chlorpyrifos in pregnancy. Dow Chemical, which makes the product, has argued that the science is inconclusive. A review panel of scientists also raised questions about the methodology the agency had used, leading to revisions but not altering the recommendation for a ban. "

Back on earth, at least one person was instantly captivated. “I was immediately like, download, print,” said Céline Semaan, a Lebanese designer and the founder of Slow Factory, a Brooklyn fashion company that began in 2012 with the goal of creating and selling products that raise awareness around issues such as the plight of refugees or the threat of global warming. Eventually, Ms. Semaan printed the image onto silk scarves for a collection called “Cities by Night.” The current political climate has provided ample fodder for her creative challenges. This spring, Ms. Semaan, who arrived in Canada with her parents in the late 1980s as a refugee herself, will add scarves with images of cities in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — the seven countries President Trump named in his original immigration ban in January — to the series. They follow a more earthly item: a simple, elegant brass necklace with a key charm dipped in white gold, made by Armenian artisans in Lebanon, symbolizing the homes that refugees leave behind. With the keys and the accompanying look book, featuring refugees, children of refugees and activists from various creative fields, Ms. Semaan is seeking to highlight both the struggles and the triumphs of the approximately 65 million people scattered around the world whose treatment has recently been a contested topic in the United States and abroad. “I’m a success story,” Ms. Semaan said. “I made it in America. There are a lot of people like us who are not represented in the media.” "
1012,Don’t Let Jeff Sessions Undermine Police Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/opinion/dont-let-jeff-sessions-undermine-police-reform.html?searchResultPosition=94,2017/04/05,OPINION,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently ordered a review of federal agreements with a number of local law enforcement agencies aimed at reforming troubled departments. As a first step, the Justice Department on Monday asked a judge to delay a consent decree that would overhaul Baltimore’s police force. On its face, Mr. Sessions’s  order simply asks whether the consent decrees promote public safety, support officers, respect local control and are warranted. But underlying the order is the Trump administration’s belief that efforts to align police practices with the Constitution have compromised public safety and thrown police officers under the bus. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. Countless police chiefs and mayors are vocal about wanting federal reform or have emerged from the consent decree process remarking that their departments were the better for it. Mr. Sessions claims to want to revert to local control, but he should listen to local officials like Baltimore’s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, who called the Justice Department’s request to delay the reform agreement “a punch in the gut” and noted that “a consent decree will make the Baltimore police department better both with the crime fight and our community relationships.” No matter what review Mr. Sessions conducts, he cannot unilaterally undo these reform agreements. That’s because the district courts that oversee them will ultimately decide their fate. In addition, the reforms are negotiated with local elected officials and law enforcement leaders, with extensive input from grass-roots organizations, police unions, officers and civilians. Mr. Sessions can try to undermine them, but many of the reforms are durable. That’s good, because communities around the country need this work to continue. In cities like Ferguson, Mo., Chicago and Baltimore, federal reform addresses unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests, and excessive and retaliatory force. These problems erode trust between police departments and the communities they serve, trust that is essential to effective policing as well as officer and public safety. Rebuilding these ties is also necessary for preventing and solving crime. Few in law enforcement would disagree with this. When we worked on police reform at the Justice Department, we heard over and over again from officers and community members during our investigations in Baltimore and Chicago that relationships had broken down so badly, witnesses sometimes refused to share vital information and victims declined police assistance.

In the United States, Ms. Trump has become a controversial figure, battling persistent questions about business conflicts and criticism for not doing more to moderate her father’s policies toward women. But in China, Ms. Trump is widely adored. Her lavish lifestyle and business acumen resonate with many young professionals who are hungry for fame and fortune in a society that often equates material wealth with success. Ms. Wang keeps photos of Ms. Trump on her iPad. She counsels burned-out friends to read Ms. Trump’s self-help tips (“Find strength in others” and “Be an optimist”). And she models her day on Ms. Trump’s, waking at 6 a.m. to increase productivity and setting aside at least a half-hour to read. “She’s pretty, she has her own career, she’s hardworking and she has a beautiful family,” said Ms. Wang, 26, a student at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing. “She inspires me.” "

Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said Wednesday that it was doubtful that a wall along the full border with Mexico would ever be built, despite an oft-repeated campaign promise by President Trump. “It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,” Mr. Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee. Instead, Mr. Kelly said, the department will look to build physical barriers — including fencing and concrete walls — in places that make sense. He said that the department was still studying the best places to construct such barriers, and that he could not give an estimate of the cost. The first bids for prototypes of the border wall were due Tuesday. According to people briefed on the agency’s plan, the first new section of the wall will be built on a short strip of federally owned land in San Diego, where there is already fencing. Congress has not yet acted on the funding request for the wall, and it faces considerable opposition from Democrats and even some Republicans. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Congress probably would not grant the Trump administration’s request for additional money for the border wall this year, adding that it would most likely be included in the next fiscal year’s appropriation.

Reforming the tax system. Spending big on infrastructure. One by one, President Trump’s campaign promises seem to be less likely — or at least won’t happen on the timetable he anticipated. So, why are so many chief executives and investors still seemingly bullish about a Trumpian economy? The answer they consistently provide: regulations. Or the promise to get rid of them. But it is actually something else, something that seems vastly underappreciated, that is staring us right in the face: The people whom Mr. Trump has appointed to positions of power can wield significant influence over how business is conducted in America. And in many cases, they can do so unilaterally, without the approval of Congress. The presidency of Donald J. Trump — the wealthiest businessman to occupy the White House in recent memory — has ushered in a new paradigm, one in which business and government are married in a way never seen before. And the people whom Mr. Trump has appointed come from the most senior ranks of business, bringing with them a frame of reference that is almost strictly about profit and economic growth. It isn’t often said aloud, but the aristocracy that Mr. Trump has put in place may be more important than any rule written on paper. And while there are significant questions about whether their experience in business will translate in Washington — and to the Regular Joe who supported Mr. Trump — their focus on issues that relate to the economy and their reverence for increasing G.D.P. have lifted the spirits in corner offices across America. Whether the topic is trade, infrastructure or taxes, to the C.E.O. set, Mr. Trump speaks their language. “We are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads,” Mr. Trump declared on Tuesday in Washington to a group of chief executives representing companies like Citigroup, MasterCard and JetBlue.

Tillerson issued a statement so cryptic that it left much of Washington confused. “North Korea launched yet another intermediate-range ballistic missile,” it began. “The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.” In fact, the Trump administration has said very little about North Korea, apart from some Twitter posts and Mr. Tillerson’s own statements in Seoul, South Korea, two weeks ago — when he said the United States would negotiate with North Korea only after it gave up its nuclear weapons and missiles. And that is unlikely to happen. A comprehensive policy review, ahead of the visit of China’s president, Xi Jinping, to the United States this week, came to an unsurprising conclusion: The administration would greatly intensify economic and military pressure on the North for the foreseeable future, and assure the Chinese that, once that pressure was in place, it would consider “engaging” the North Koreans. That is, the United States would negotiate with them, presumably before they have given up their nuclear weapons and missiles, despite Mr. Tillerson’s earlier statements. Mr. Tillerson has made clear he will be a secretary of few words, preferring to do his deals behind closed doors and open himself to as little probing of the strategy as possible. But in the absence of much public comment, American allies seem confused about the administration’s strategy of coercive diplomacy. It is unclear whether the goal is to force the North Koreans to surrender their arsenal, as Mr. Tillerson suggested, or just freeze missile and nuclear tests and open a negotiation. And many of those allies wonder how increasing pressure is likely to succeed when directed against a country that has survived financial cutoffs, trade sanctions and the presence of surrounding military forces for more than six decades.

1018,Learning to Love the Nuclear Option,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/opinion/filibusters-arent-the-problem.html?searchResultPosition=87,2017/04/05,OPINION,"This article has been updated to reflect news developments. The word “filibuster” sounds silly, like the name of a pompous but ultimately well-meaning character in a Dickens novel. The phrase “nuclear option,” on the other hand, sounds terrifying. So now that the Republicans have used the nuclear option to kill the poor filibuster to clear the way for the elevation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, we can lose perspective. In truth, eliminating the filibuster is a minor change compared with the problem that such a move takes a step toward solving: the recent rise of a system based on supermajority rule rather than majority rule. Of course, the modern filibuster, which remains in effect for legislation, doesn’t require senators to give speeches through the night. It’s all very abstract; in the case of nonspending bills, the minority party simply let it be known that it has enough votes to block the legislation. In effect, the minority party now gets to decide when a bill should require 60 votes instead of 51. The switch to supermajority rule happened without a constitutional amendment, without a national debate, without its even becoming a major issue in a presidential campaign. Because it happened gradually, we didn’t fully appreciate: The 788 filibusters since 2007 — those were the “nuclear” moments. It’s also confusing that the Republicans are saying: Don’t worry. Although we’re ending the filibuster against Supreme Court nominees, we’ll still allow the procedure to block legislation. If anything, there’s more of a case for eliminating the filibuster for congressional bills than for the court. If a horrible justice gets on the court, he or she is there for life; if a destructive piece of legislation gets through, it can be repealed. I remember vividly when I first became aware that the “Schoolhouse Rock” version of how a bill becomes a law had quietly disappeared. I was covering Congress for Newsweek during the Clinton administration. The Democrats were pushing legislation to create a national service program, which had broad support. "

So does Joshua Tillman, the songwriter who is releasing “Pure Comedy,” his third album as Father John Misty. The title of “Pure Comedy” is one of the album’s very few jokes, a bit of blunt irony for an all-too-persuasive set of songs envisioning global catastrophe as the inevitable result of human nature. Singing with earnest clarity, Father John Misty indicts selfishness, ignorance, distraction, vanity, politics, self-delusion, dogmatism, technocracy, God and, by no means least, himself. Midway through the album, like a roadblock, is “Leaving L.A.,” a plaintive 13-minute dirge with lyrics that accurately describe it as “some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe.” It’s morose, but also plush; Mr. Tillman croons those 10 verses atop soothing string-section arrangements. And the song grows into an acutely self-conscious, autobiographical portrait of where Mr. Tillman finds himself now, questioning his own role as a songwriter, careerist and maybe artist, or, as he sarcastically puts it, “Another white guy in 2017/Who takes himself so goddamn seriously.” The album is a self-questioning singer-songwriter’s reaction to the beginning of the Trump years, interrogating himself and his listeners about what culture can possibly accomplish. At a Father John Misty performance on July 23, the day after Mr. Trump’s dystopian convention speech accepting the Republican nomination, Mr. Tillman cut his set short and gave a harangue, complaining about entertainment “numbing” its consumers and ranting about how “stupidity just [expletive] runs the world.” On the album, he extrapolates further in “Total Entertainment Forever,” envisioning a world where the pleasures of virtual reality have entirely supplanted real life: Mr. Tillman has recorded extensively since 2003 as J. Tillman and has been in and out of bands, including a stint as the drummer in Fleet Foxes. He uses the Father John Misty name as both a mouthpiece and a persona, as a questionable character navigating an overripe, compromised world. The song that opened Father John Misty’s 2012 debut, “Fear Fun,” was “Funtimes in Babylon,” a sardonic embrace of Hollywood excess. Mr. Tillman had a strict religious upbringing that he broke away from, but he is still making moral arguments. Father John Misty is also a musical throwback. His bleak contemporary tidings arrive in rich, retro settings. The sound harks back to the late 1960s and early 1970s era of singer-songwriters, particularly those who were clustered around Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles and living a hippie dream of self-expression and self-indulgence, amid vintage guitars and well-equipped studio hideaways.

An insulting dismissal. A sexual ultimatum. A suggestion that a job is not fit for a woman. Droves of women have shared their own experiences with workplace sexual harassment on social media this week, spurred by claims against Bill O’Reilly, the Fox News host. The revelation that five women received settlements totaling $13 million after accusing him of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior has prompted more than 20 companies to pull advertising from his show, while others have called for his dismissal. The outpouring came six months after thousands of women posted accounts of being groped or assaulted in the wake of Donald J. Trump’s boasts on tape that he had forced himself on women. In each case, social media offered an outlet for women who said they had either been too afraid or too ashamed to describe their experiences publicly, or to report them in their workplaces for fear of retaliation. As reports circulated about the O’Reilly case, a hashtag, #droporeilly, was born, and it soon morphed into a meeting place for women to describe the professional mistreatment they said they had endured. One of those women, Kerri McKeand, 40, a paralegal from Chicago, offered her experience of working as an assistant to a project manager on the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago, about 10 years ago. When she was required to visit a construction site, she and a female colleague were asked to appear less feminine by taping down their breasts, not wearing makeup and hiding their hair with bandannas, she said in an interview on Wednesday. Ms. McKeand refused to comply with the restrictions, she said. During that visit, while on an elevator with men, she was sexually harassed, and a pornographic magazine was tossed at her feet, she said. She reported it to her boss who, according to Ms. McKeand, said, “I told you this would happen.” It was clear that “nothing would be done about it,” she added. “It was just kind of this accepted culture in this industry.” She said that those experiences had led her away from the construction field. Becoming a project manager seemed like the highest position a woman could attain, she said. Many other women shared similar experiences. Ms. McKeand said she was heartened by women’s willingness to share their stories on social media. “Silence is pervasive, and I think the more silent we are about it, the more it will continue,” she said. “It’s especially important for younger women to know that these things exist and to know what they can do when they are faced with these situations.” “I had no idea when I was younger of what sexual harassment was, what my rights were,” she added, citing an incident when she was 17, when her boss made her sit on his lap. “So hopefully this dialogue puts that in the forefront, so women can go into the work force having an idea of what’s acceptable and what’s not.” "

President Barack Obama learned that empty threats are ineffective, and that it is better to speak softly but carry a big stick, as reflected in the final years of his administration. President Trump should learn from Mr. Obama and act on the blatant violation of human rights and international law immediately. If not, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria will continue to see signs of weakness and respond only by continued, if not increased, use of chemical weapons. Furthermore, inaction would signal to President Vladimir Putin that the United States is unwilling to stand up for human rights or even the validity of international law, as he probably already suspects. This will inevitably lead to greater Russian influence and mischief in Syria and the Middle East. Appeasement is not the answer. The United States must maintain its global influence and cannot turn a blind eye to the immorality of chemical weapon use. Our response must demonstrate commitment to moral authority, universal human rights and a vigorous defense of liberal democratic values. PATRICK BRANDER NEWCOMBE
POTOMAC, MD. To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman’s April 5 column, “Trump’s Real-World Syria Lesson,” advocating the partition of Syria and, if necessary, the insertion of American troops as part of a protective force, doesn’t take into account the thousand-year track record of Western experience in the region. The United States, as in Vietnam, entered this game after European failure, generating its own disasters in Lebanon, Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq. It is long past time that we learned from these failures and the failures of others and left the region to manage itself without Western-generated instability. "

My colleague Chris Buckley, a New York Times reporter in Beijing, had been among the first to write about it, noting that Professor Feng, a Chinese-born expert on China at the University of Technology Sydney, had often criticized Beijing’s repression of dissent. Professor Feng is also well known for highlighting China’s growing influence in Australia, and as I listened to him talk about his experience and family, I found myself even more fascinated than before by the evolving relationship between China and Australia. It’s not a subject that any one story can fully explore, certainly not one as brief as what I wrote about Professor Feng’s return. And it’s not just politics. This week, I brought my family — including my 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter — on a food tour of Sydney’s Chinatown. Our guide told us that the Cantonese cuisine that long defined the area was now just one small part of a diversified mix. "

He called the chemical weapons attack on Tuesday “an affront to humanity” during a press conference with King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House. The death toll is believed to be over 100. At the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki Haley blamed Russia for blocking a Security Council response and warned that the U.S. might take unilateral action. The Daily podcast tracks the course of the Syrian conflict and the choices Mr. Trump faces. _____ 2. Mr. Trump removed Stephen Bannon, his chief strategist, from the National Security Council. The shift was orchestrated by the president’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. "

Democrats tried to focus Dr. Gottlieb’s confirmation hearing as much on the president who chose him as on the nominee himself. Mr. Trump has broken with Republican orthodoxy by embracing a Democratic push to allow the importation of prescription drugs from Canada and to allow the government to negotiate lower drug prices. Mr. Trump has also flouted established science with his efforts to link childhood vaccines to autism. As for Dr. Gottlieb, Democrats tried to raise doubts that the nominee could be objective after earning hundreds of thousands of dollars as an investor in and consultant to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and health care companies. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the committee, said Dr. Gottlieb had “unprecedented financial entanglements with the industries he would regulate.” But in two and a half hours of testimony, Dr. Gottlieb deflected most of the criticism, and he appeared to be headed for confirmation unless some damaging new information turns up.

1025,"When Xi Jinping Visits Trump at Mar-a-Lago, ‘Nothing Involving Golf Clubs’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/world/asia/xi-jinping-golf-trump-mar-a-lago.html?searchResultPosition=97,2017/04/05,ASIA PACIFIC,"HONG KONG — President Xi Jinping of China is not expected to be strolling the manicured fairways of the Trump International Golf Club on Thursday, sizing up his approach shot. Mr. Xi is known to be an avid soccer fan, bent on transforming China into a great power in that egalitarian team sport, but the Chinese Communist Party maintains an ideological contempt for golf as a rich person’s game. That view, among others, places him at odds with President Trump, who owns more than a dozen golf courses and whose so-called Winter White House, the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., charges more than $200,000 for membership. However he spends his time at Mar-a-Lago, “it’s safe to say there’s not going to be any golf,” the White House said in a statement. Mr. Trump, who played 18 holes with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan during his visit in February, will have to find another way to build a warm rapport with his Chinese counterpart. Although as many as a million people in China, not necessarily part of the wealthy elite, play golf, the game has become a symbol of capitalist excesses and corruption in the eyes of the Communist Party. That view goes back to 1949, when Mao Zedong declared golf the “sport for millionaires.” Mr. Xi has led a crackdown on corruption, and golf has been depicted as a temptation that has led party officials astray. Dozens of courses across China have been shut in recent years, ostensibly to preserve water and arable lands. What might Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi do instead of playing golf in between discussions about trade or what to do about North Korea’s nuclear provocations? “It’s possible that they’ll walk around a bit, as the mood strikes,” the White House statement said, “but nothing formal or nothing involving golf clubs.” "
1026,"Fed Is Expected to Pare Investment Holdings, Officials Signal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/economy/fed-minutes-interest-rates.html?searchResultPosition=98,2017/04/05,ECONOMY,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve expects to start reducing its huge investment holdings later this year, unwinding a giant program undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis to revive the economy. The holdings — which amount to more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage securities — are a legacy of the Fed’s campaign to help the economy recover from the depths of a recession. The Fed, increasingly confident that the American economy is “at or near maximum employment,” is beginning to loosen its grip on the economy, according to an official account that the Fed published Wednesday. Officials voted at the meeting in March to raise the Fed’s benchmark interest rate — the third time since the financial crisis — to a range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Since the meeting, Fed officials have said that it is on course to increase rates by at least an additional half a percentage point this year. Both the low rates and the investments were intended to support growth by encouraging risk-taking and borrowing by consumers and businesses. Now the Fed is gradually reducing that support. No decision was made about the timing or the details of any move to reduce the Fed’s holdings. The markets took the news with relative calm, suggesting that investors share the central bank’s assessment that the economy is getting closer to walking without crutches. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has traded in a narrow range since December, even as the Fed has raised rates twice. Indeed, some analysts said the Fed might need to take stronger steps to end its stimulus campaign. “Financial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways,” said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock’s U.S. multi-sector fixed income team.

Here’s what the available evidence, including a declassified four-page American intelligence report, tells us about the reliability of the Russian account. Russian officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, have publicly doubted whether a toxic attack even happened, and said that any chemical weapons in Syria belonged to insurgents fighting President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, not the government. The White House has asserted that the Assad government carried out the attack, and that the Russians tried to cover it up by spreading “false narratives.” There is no evidence that online video and photographs of the attack were fabricated, as Russia’s deputy envoy to the United Nations suggested last week. The images showed that scores of people, including children, died on April 4 in Khan Sheikhun, in northern Syria, suffering symptoms consistent with having breathed in some sort of nerve agent. On Tuesday, the Turkish health minister, Recep Akdag, confirmed a preliminary report that sarin had been used after an examination of the blood and urine of four victims who were evacuated from Syria to Turkey after the attack. Russian officials, citing their own monitoring systems, say a Syrian airstrike around noon on April 4 hit weapons-storage facilities on the eastern outskirts of Khan Sheikhun under the control of insurgents, including a “terrorist warehouse” where they were making “projectiles stuffed with chemical agents” to send to fighters in Iraq. Mr. Putin said Tuesday that insurgents were continuing to build chemical weapons in Syria and planned to blame any future toxic attack on the Syrian government. "

A Guide,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/mike-cernovich-bio-who.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/04/05,POLITICS,"President Trump has frequently derided the news media as “fake news,” and on Tuesday his son, Donald Trump Jr., told the world there was one person he wants to see win the Pulitzer Prize, the highest honor in American journalism: Mike Cernovich. Those who do not closely follow the world of conservative social media might be moved to ask, who? Fair question. Mr. Cernovich is a blogger, author of books, YouTube personality and filmmaker with a far-right social media following. Much of his online persona is driven by two mottos: “conflict is attention” and “attention is influence.” He told The New Yorker, “I use trolling tactics to build my brand.” Before this week, he was perhaps best known for promoting false claims that Hillary Clinton was part of a pedophile ring located in the basement of a pizzeria. He describes himself as an “American nationalist” and has been involved in shaping alt-right messages on social media, according to The New Yorker. But he has denied being part of the alt-right movement, calling it “too obsessed with gossip and drama for my tastes” in a blog post. "
1030,Ferguson Re-Elects White Mayor 2 Years After Mike Brown Incident,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/ferguson-mayor-race.html?searchResultPosition=74,2017/04/05,U.S.,"FERGUSON, Mo. — When a national movement for racial justice flared here two and a half years ago, activists nationwide hoped to upend the political order. Ferguson was one of many predominantly black communities across the country that were under white control, and they strategized about ways to change that. But those hopes for sweeping increases in black political leadership have not come to fruition, a point driven home in the mayoral election this week. Although much of the activism today stems from the killing of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, voters here — at least the few who turned out — re-elected James Knowles III, a white Republican who has been the object of much scorn among those who believe the city has discriminated against black people. About 67 percent of the city’s 21,000 residents are black, and 29 percent are white, according to the 2010 census. Some activists are now assessing what is happening politically for black people and whether there needs to be a complete rethinking of how they engage with mainstream politics. “With all that’s happened within the past two years nationally, I think I am concerned,” said Allen Frimpong, an activist based in New York. “I would expect that folks would, at the very least, move to the polls, and that’s not happening. There’s something that we need to look at, because something’s not working.” Especially with the concerns he has heard over President Trump’s policies, Mr. Frimpong said, he thought people would have been thinking, “Let me do something in my local community.” "
1031,President Trump’s Most Important Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/opinion/president-trumps-most-important-meeting.html?searchResultPosition=75,2017/04/05,OPINION,"Donald Trump’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart this week will be the most important diplomatic encounter of his presidency so far. His two days of talks at Mar-a-Lago with President Xi Jinping will test whether the two men — Mr. Trump an unpredictable novice, Mr. Xi a tightly scripted, experienced leader — can begin to effectively manage the world’s most significant bilateral relationship. By undoing American support for an international agreement on climate change, repudiating an Asia-oriented trade deal and calling for funding cuts for the United Nations, Mr. Trump has already ceded leadership in key areas to Mr. Xi, who is eager to expand Beijing’s role as an international power and has increasingly positioned his country as a competitor of the United States. It will be disastrous for America and the world if Mr. Trump continues on this disengagement path. Mr. Trump does seem to appreciate the threat from North Korea’s rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs, putting that matter at the top of his agenda. He could hardly avoid it, given the fact that the North conducted another missile test on Tuesday as Mr. Xi was en route to the United States. Mr. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he expects China, the North’s main supplier of food and fuel, to increase pressure beyond what it has been willing to do so far to force an end to the weapons programs. In an interview in The Financial Times on Monday, he was even more demanding, warning that the United States would take unilateral action to eliminate the nuclear threat if Beijing fails to act, presumably by curbing trade and assistance. Analysts say China may be willing to increase pressure somewhat on North Korea, but well short of causing the regime in Pyongyang to collapse. Most experts believe that the North will not abandon its nuclear program unless the leadership at the top changes. China opposes this because it fears a surge of refugees into its territory and wants to keep North Korea as a buffer against a potentially unified Korean Peninsula dominated by the American military.

Chris Christie of New Jersey remained largely silent while his constituents screamed. In fact, the governor was far from where the chaos was unfolding, choosing to go to Atlantic City to celebrate the opening of a casino while travelers vented their frustration on social media, on radio call-in shows and on packed platforms. The derailment on Monday of a New Jersey Transit train did not just cripple New Jersey Transit; it also disrupted service on Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road, the two other rail systems that share Penn Station. But it has been riders of New Jersey Transit, the nation’s third-busiest railroad, who have endured the worst travel experiences. Along with anger, many riders said someone had to be responsible for the missed hours of work, the lost wages, the extra costs from extended day care, the wasted — and increasingly expensive — gas. And many of them set their sights on Mr. Christie. “He’s nowhere to be found, while literally hundreds of thousands of his constituents are struggling and businesses are losing money,” said Dave Geller, 44, who had to work from his home in Maplewood on Wednesday. “At some point the buck has to stop where? You’re the man in charge.” One possible reason: Mr. Christie is seen as a main villain in New Jersey’s transit woes. Many of those enduring the upheavals on the rails and on the highways this week know that without a new tunnel under the Hudson River, days like Wednesday or Tuesday or Monday will become more frequent. They also know that in 2010, Mr. Christie scuttled plans for a new tunnel that had been scheduled to open next year. Mr. Christie’s commitment to public transit has been a recurring issue. Under his administration, the state subsidy to New Jersey Transit plummeted 90 percent. And for years, he had steadfastly refused to support an increase in the state’s gas tax to help finance the depleted transportation fund used to finance transit projects, relenting only late last year. However, he did sign a bill last month authorizing $400 million in spending on New Jersey transportation. "

Gorsuch had delivered the institution to this moment. It was the eve of two seminal votes for the Capitol’s upper chamber: an expected Democratic filibuster of Judge Gorsuch on Thursday and a likely rule change pushed by Republicans — the so-called nuclear option — to bypass the filibuster and confirm President Trump’s selection with a simple majority vote. On a few points, at least, bipartisan consensus seemed to have congealed: This is terrible for the Senate. This is terrible for the country. And this is happening. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, spoke of the “further and perhaps irreparable damage it will do to the United States Senate.” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, suggested it was a trying time to be a lawmaker who prides herself “as one who believes in the traditions of the Senate.” "

The visit to Excel Academy, an all-girls charter school, by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Queen Rania of Jordan and Melania Trump, the first lady, was meant to emphasize the Trump administration’s stance on school choice. But it was also part of a day of photo ops intended to cast a softer lens on a presidential administration grappling with several international crises, and provide another glimpse of a first lady whose sporadic appearances in Washington have revealed relatively little about her own leadership style. Earlier in the day, Mrs. Trump and Queen Rania stood behind President Trump and King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House. It was just one item on Wednesday’s agenda, which was also packed with a news conference to condemn a chemical attack in Syria and meetings to discuss brokering a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. At the news conference in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said his position on the civil war in Syria and his opinion of the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad, had changed. Mr. Trump did not offer details on any shift in policy. King Abdullah is viewed as a moderate voice among Arab leaders and has established himself as a willing partner to Mr. Trump.

Their message? Germany is not a threat to the United States. For decades, the United States has been a kind of second home to German carmakers, a place not only to sell vehicles but also to build them. German manufacturers employ thousands at plants across the United States, and produce finished products like cars, as well as parts and machinery, within the country for sale domestically or export abroad. But that the point — made during a session that included the chief executives of BMW, the carmaker; Siemens, the electronics and engineering company; and Schaeffler, a major supplier of parts for automotive engines, transmissions and chassis — needed to be made at all underlines growing concern in Berlin over hostility directed at German industry by the Trump administration. Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, has accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, even though German politicians and economists are among the staunchest critics of European Central Bank policies that have encouraged a weak euro. And the American president himself wondered aloud to a German newspaper in January why Americans buy lots of Mercedes cars while Germans hardly buy any Chevrolets. The anger from the Trump administration has been a rude shock, threatening the bedrock of Germany’s economy and leaving executives perplexed. Their quandary is one faced by business across Europe: Mr. Trump has questioned the assumptions that have underpinned trans-Atlantic commerce since the end of World War II, without making clear what could come instead. “I think there is a little bit lack of understanding,” Harald Krüger, the chief executive of BMW, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show in March, not long after Mr. Trump had attacked the company for building a plant in Mexico. “Maybe there hasn’t been enough data supplied before.” "

The next target is net neutrality, which is the guarantee that all internet content is equally accessible. That could be followed by cuts in broadband subsidies for low-income households and a relaxation in rules preventing media consolidation in local markets. Republican regulators and lawmakers have been waiting for this moment. Coordinating across the government, they are putting several telecommunications and technology policies created during the Obama administration on the chopping block. Already, Ajit Pai, the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who was appointed to the agency by President Barack Obama and named to lead it by President Trump, has begun chipping away at the low-income broadband subsidy and net neutrality rules created by his Democratic predecessor. “There was a good bit of overreach by the past F.C.C. that caused a lot of confusion,” said Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who was vice chairwoman for President Trump’s transition. “We are going to have technology and telecommunications policy that is light touch.” In a major philosophical shift from the Obama administration, Republican leaders have said they will look for proof of harm before creating new regulations for telecom firms. They believe antitrust and consumer protection laws suffice for government oversight of the sector. “The F.C.C. needs a more evidence-based approach,” said Roslyn Layton, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who was on Mr. Trump’s F.C.C. transition team. “No one is writing in and asking for Title 2 reclassification of broadband. Consumers are complaining about unwanted calls and billing problems.” "

Such comments tell women they won’t be believed.” Her statements came several days after an investigation by The New York Times showed that five women had received settlement payments from Mr. O’Reilly after making claims of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior. The payments totaled about $13 million, The Times reported. The Twitter posts on Wednesday were the first time Ms. Gomez Diamond had spoken publicly about the issue. In 2011, she received a payout from Mr. O’Reilly after she said that he had sexually harassed her. Ms. Gomez Diamond had recordings of Mr. O’Reilly, and as part of the deal, she agreed not to speak about her allegations, people familiar with the case said. “I have merit,” Ms. Gomez Diamond wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning. In an interview on Wednesday in the Oval Office with reporters for The Times, Mr. Trump defended Mr. O’Reilly, whose show he has appeared on for years. “I think he’s a person I know well — he is a good person,” Mr. Trump said, surrounded by his top aides.

The president declined to offer any details about potential action. But he said his horror at the images of “innocent children, innocent babies” choked by poison gas in a rebel-held area of Syria had caused him to reassess his approach. Only days after the White House declared it would be “silly” to persist in trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Trump said, “My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.” “It crossed a lot of lines for me,” the president declared at a news conference in the Rose Garden, referring to the “red line” that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had drawn before a 2013 poison-gas attack by Mr. Assad’s forces. Mr. Obama’s failure to strike Syria after that, Mr. Trump claimed, sowed the conditions for this new assault. The estimated death toll was reported to have exceeded 100. Syria was one of several places, along with North Korea and Iran, where Mr. Trump on Wednesday threatened a forceful American response. But in all these cases, he declined to disclose options, arguing that there was a need for surprise but stoking worries that his fledgling administration is not ready to deal with multiple threats across the Middle East and Asia. At the United Nations, Mr. Trump’s ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, warned that the United States might take unilateral action if the Security Council failed to respond to this latest atrocity in Syria. A shift in policy could include airstrikes, which were considered and ultimately rejected by Mr. Obama. The president, standing alongside King Abdullah II of Jordan at the news conference, told reporters, “I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other, but I’m certainly not going to be telling you.” "

Although the stock market is surging and profits on Wall Street last year hit their highest level since 2012, the good times are not translating into jobs the way they did a decade ago, before the financial crisis and the Great Recession hit. Employment in the securities industry in New York City has risen for three straight years. But, at 177,000, there are still 10,000 fewer jobs in the sector than in 2008. And even if the stock market keeps rising and shares of behemoths like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to hit postcrisis highs, don’t expect a surge in hiring on the Street. “The securities industry is still a pretty important source of very highly paid, very highly skilled jobs, but it’s not really contributing to growth in the number of jobs,” said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. To be sure, financial services and banking remain a key part of the overall economy in the tristate area. The financial services and securities industry is the largest private-sector contributor to tax revenue in New York State. What economists call the ‘‘multiplier effect’’ is especially high for finance jobs, since annual bonuses for bankers end up in the pockets of people like contractors, gardeners, jewelers, car dealers and real estate brokers. What is more, Wall Street remains crucial for the region’s tax base, especially for New York State. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of Albany’s tax revenues last year, and about 7 percent of the city’s tax haul. "

A leaked list of the Trump administration’s priority projects seemed to speak to the scope of the president’s ambitions: a high-speed rail line linking Houston and Dallas; a desalination plant in Orange County, Calif.; and improvements to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana, the longest continuous bridge over water in the world. Then came Mr. Trump’s budget proposal, which would slash the Department of Transportation’s spending by 13 percent, end subsidies for Amtrak’s long-distance trains and eliminate the Obama administration’s “Tiger” grant program, which has helped fund mass transit systems across the country. Among the potential victims of the president’s proposed cutbacks: Maryland’s long-awaited Purple Line, a planned 16-mile light rail system through the capital’s suburbs. Maryland had been just four days away from clinching some $900 million in federal aid in August when a federal judge ruled to temporarily invalidate environmental approvals for the project. But under President Trump’s plan, projects that don’t yet have complete federal funding agreements would be financed “by the localities that use and benefit from these localized projects.” Supporters of the project are devastated. “It was on the one-yard line,” said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association, a Washington-based advocacy group. The proposed budget cuts were inconsistent with the administration’s overall focus on infrastructure investment, he said. "

The former Massachusetts congressman says that President Trump is vowing to roll back financial regulations that even some of the biggest players in the banking industry have quietly come to tolerate. Many Americans — outside the financial industry — are not clamoring to scrap Dodd-Frank either, or even know what the law really does, said Mr. Frank, a Democrat who helped write it. So why is Mr. Trump adding Dodd-Frank to the long list of regulations he’s seeking to undo? “He has to denigrate everything the Democrats did,” says Mr. Frank, who retired from the House in 2013. “I think he has to say he inherited a mess. Well, he has to find a mess.” DealBook caught up with Mr. Frank last month as he was arriving in New York for a meeting at Signature Bank, a small lender, where he now serves on the board. Our conversation spanned a variety of issues that were addressed in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Regulation of derivatives was a major focus, owing to market-disrupting blowups like a trading scandal at JPMorgan Chase that came to be known as the “London Whale” episode, and the near-collapse of the insurance giant American International Group, or A.I.G., because of derivatives. We also talked about the political tug-of-war over a new consumer protection agency the law created called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as the C.F.P.B.  When President Trump signed an order in February to revisit financial regulation, including parts of Dodd-Frank, he said that the law had prevented a lot of his friends “that have nice businesses” from borrowing money. Is that true? "
1043,Do Tax Cuts Really Spur Growth? It Depends on the Details.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/dealbook/tax-cuts-job-growth-trump.html?searchResultPosition=102,2017/04/05,DEALBOOK,"If your tax rate were lowered tomorrow, how would it affect your work habits? Maybe you would work harder — put in longer hours, take on special projects, do everything you can to get that next promotion. After all, lower taxes would mean you get to keep more of each dollar you earn. Or maybe you would work less. After all, if you are happy with your current standard of living, lower taxes would mean that you could maintain it while putting in fewer hours at the office. Who needs that promotion when you’re able to keep more of the money you already make? Or possibly you would work exactly the same amount, because life is too short to sit around making every decision based on what is in the tax code. That little mental exercise — and the fact that reasonable people may choose any of the options — helps explain why the Trump administration’s plans to induce stronger economic growth by cutting taxes won’t necessarily work. At the core of decades of Republican economic policy is a simple idea: Cutting taxes will unleash investments and lead to higher incomes, more jobs and more rapid growth. And there are historical episodes that would seem to support that idea, most notably when Ronald Reagan cut taxes in the early 1980s, and the economy boomed in the years that followed. But there’s considerably less evidence that this cause-and-effect applies at all times and at all places. George W. Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were followed by years of disappointing growth. Bill Clinton’s tax increases in 1993 were followed by a boom that surpassed the Reagan-era expansion. "

As a left-leaning lobbyist for the nonprofit sector, his job is getting the voices of groups like the American Cancer Society, Save the Children Action Network and the ONE Campaign (which fights poverty and disease) heard in Washington. Over the years he has gotten support from both political parties for a variety of causes with the help of celebrities like the Irish rock star Bono and the actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Jennifer Garner. When administrations change, there is a normal ebb and flow of political appointees and an inevitable shift in focus for power brokers. Everyone adjusts to a new normal, identifies where opportunities are and finds point-people in the White House and on Capitol Hill who can advance their agendas. But everything changed in January, with the new administration determined to slash budgets and minimizing priorities for anything not related to the military and Homeland Security. Domestic and international development groups face proposed deep cuts in federal funds, and so do social programs that include meals for older adults, work-study programs for college students, programs to help homeless veterans and support for the arts and public broadcasting. Conservatives have come to power before, but Mr. Sheridan says the tone is different this time. Whereas in prior handovers nonprofits faced a fight for keeping or increasing their share of federal support, this time they face extinction. “This isn’t a political threat, it’s life and death,” Mr. Sheridan said by phone in March. “We’re not fighting ideology. It’s raw politics and a culture that is extremely new. Many are not equipped to handle it.” "

Speaking in the Oval Office, Donald J. Trump praised Mr. O’Reilly as “a good person” and declared, “I don’t think Bill did anything wrong,” days after The New York Times reported that five women had received settlements after making harassment claims against him. News of the payouts, totaling about $13 million, generated a storm of criticism toward Fox News, which recently renewed Mr. O’Reilly’s contract, and prompted more than two dozen advertisers to withdraw their support of Mr. O’Reilly’s prime time show, the highest-rated program in cable news. Few have spoken out publicly in support of the Fox star. The president had no qualms. “Personally, I think he shouldn’t have settled,” Mr. Trump told Times reporters in a wide-ranging interview. “Because you should have taken it all the way; I don’t think Bill did anything wrong.” “I think he’s a person I know well,” Mr. Trump said. “He is a good person.” The president is a well-documented fan of Fox News, sitting for interviews with its prime-time hosts and conferring privately by phone with Rupert Murdoch, the network’s executive chairman. Mr. Trump has bragged to associates that he now refers to Mr. Murdoch, one of the world’s most powerful media moguls, by his first name, according to a person who is friendly with both men. "

Mr. DeRossi, 42, is the owner or co-owner of several hip cocktail bars in New York City, including Amor y Amargo, Cienfuegos, Death & Co., Mayahuel and Mother of Pearl. His latest, Coup, is scheduled to open on April 14 near Astor Place. The name is not a twist on coupe, as one might guess, given Mr. DeRossi’s cocktail connections. It’s just Coup, as in “d’état.” Mr. DeRossi intends to use the bar to convert his political paralysis into liquid action. “One-hundred percent of the profits are going to organizations that are either being defunded by the current administration or need money to fight the current administration, like Planned Parenthood and the A.C.L.U.,” he said. The bar’s message will be unmistakable: Mr. DeRossi has commissioned artists to recreate some of the more clever signs that protesters have been brandishing at anti-Trump rallies and marches over the past few months. At Coup, they will become décor. Coup won’t be the first bar opened in protest of President Trump. During the week before the election and the week of the inauguration, Barrel, a saloon in Washington, converted its basement into a jokey, for-profit Trump-themed pop-up, with drinks like the Moscow Mole. Bar Ilegal, another Washington pop-up, sponsored by Ilegal Mezcal, ran for a week before the election, with all profits going to Niños de Guatemala, a school for underprivileged children in that country.

In his first interview since he was forced out, Mr. Bharara said this week that his firing was part and parcel of what he characterized as the chaos that has defined some of the administration’s decisions. He called it “a direct example of the kind of uncertain helter-skelter incompetence, when it comes to personnel decisions and executive actions, that was in people’s minds when this out-of-the-blue call for everyone’s resignation letter came.” Mr. Bharara also disclosed that Mr. Trump, after having asked him to remain in his post, telephoned him three times, raising concern among Mr. Bharara and his aides that such calls could run afoul of strict Justice Department protocols governing communications with the White House. Mr. Bharara, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was among 46 United States attorneys who were asked on March 10 to submit their resignations. The directive was not especially unusual; all presidents choose their own candidates for United States attorney positions, and invariably ask holdover prosecutors to leave. But Mr. Bharara’s inclusion in the request came as a surprise, since he had been asked on Nov. 30 by Mr. Trump, the president-elect at the time, to remain in his post. "

That’s because the late night talk show is an ephemeral form, its hosts forgotten faster than teen idols. Onetime superstars like Steve Allen and Jack Paar have faded into obscurity, primarily because it’s difficult to see their shows, and much of Johnny Carson’s oeuvre was erased. Mr. Letterman’s work is not so hard to find, thanks in large part to Don Giller, a superfan who stumbled into becoming a critical custodian of Mr. Letterman’s comedy. Of the 6,028 late night shows that Mr. Letterman hosted, on NBC and CBS, Mr. Giller, 66, has videos of all but two. His YouTube page has been viewed more than 4.5 million times, and he has become an invaluable resource for journalists on the late night beat. (I couldn’t have written my new biography, “Letterman: The Last Giant of Late Night,” without Mr. Giller’s help.) Even staff members from “The Late Show” have asked him for assistance. Mr. Giller, who works as a music typesetter for academic journals, has embraced his role as unofficial archivist, but only recently. For decades, he just really liked the show and found that it rewarded his natural obsessiveness. “You wouldn’t get it unless you watch a couple weeks and notice the story line — to me, there’s a story line,” he said in his Upper West Side apartment. “You start getting his little asides: ‘Oh, he did that a couple weeks ago.

In truth, it may not make that much of a difference at all. In an unexpected way, it may well herald the beginning of a better era for the Senate. The Senate Republicans’ successful effort on Thursday to end the 60-vote threshold to proceed with confirmation of Supreme Court nominees was really only the final step in a process set in motion by Democrats in 2013, when they removed that threshold for other nominees. That set off a far bigger firestorm, and Republicans have now simply extended that precedent. Republicans are quick to point out — and many Democrats privately agree — that had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the White House last year and Democrats taken the Senate, a similar confrontation would have been likely in the other direction, and that Democrats might have needed to take the same step Republicans took to confirm any Supreme Court nominee Mrs. Clinton had chosen. Congress has already been dwelling in the rubble for a while. A divisive showdown over a Supreme Court nominee was certainly not helpful in advancing comity, but it has not taken on the widespread acrimony that has consumed both houses of Congress in past fights, such as over government shutdown threats or the perpetual battles over the health care law.

1052,Why a Buyout of Staples Looks Flimsy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/business/dealbook/why-a-buyout-of-staples-looks-flimsy.html?searchResultPosition=29,2017/04/06,DEALBOOK,"It’s going to take a lot of tape and scissors to piece together a leveraged buyout of Staples Inc. that works. Staples, the office-supplies chain, is reportedly in talks with private equity shops about a possible deal. According to Reuters Breakingviews calculations, however, the investment proposition looks shaky. Since a plan to merge with Office Depot was shot down by United States regulators last year, Staples has replaced its chief executive and renewed efforts to slash costs. Sales at its 1,500-plus stores in the United States and Canada fell 7 percent last year and now account for less than 40 percent of some $18 billion in revenue. The rest comes from online and business customers. The company’s clean balance sheet and about $900 million a year of operating cash flow make it a buyout candidate, on paper. A 30 percent premium to its undisturbed market value, before news reports about a possible sale, would make the price tag about $7.4 billion. Buyouts often rely on increasing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, but in this case merely stopping the decline would be an achievement. Most leveraged buyouts these days involve an equity check for about 40 percent of the value. Though it would amplify the risk, at just 30 percent, Staples’s debt would come in under four times its $1.3 billion of expected Ebitda. That’s practicable. Then assume the buyer could sell Staples again in five years at the same multiple of Ebitda as it paid, just shy of six times. The company’s dividends run around $300 million a year. Suppose generously that the new owner could squeeze out the same amount even after paying interest on $5 billion of debt. Tally it all up, and the internal rate of return would reach 14 percent. It’s decent, but falls short of the usual buyout target and would require exemplary execution in a tough business at a company that’s currently shrinking. Combining with Office Depot would transform the calculus. Staples once envisioned $1 billion a year of annual synergies, which would improve returns sharply. There’s a notion among deal makers that the Trump administration will ease up on competition reviews. The new president also wants to preserve American jobs, though. That makes a merger far-fetched — and may leave any Staples buyout plan strictly on the back of an envelope. "

Bannon, his chief strategist; Reince Priebus, his chief of staff; his daughter Ivanka Trump; and others — said his decision had been prompted in part by what he called the failures by the world community to respond effectively to the Syrian civil war. “Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically,” the president said, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen, and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.” The Pentagon announced that 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired at Al Shayrat airfield in Syria. The missiles were aimed at Syrian fighter jets, hardened aircraft shelters, radar equipment, ammunition bunkers, sites for storing fuel and air defense systems. "

But during an untamed time, not long ago, New Yorkers routinely slid open the doors at the ends of train cars and stood in the open space as the train hurtled through the tunnel. New Yorkers like the future president of the United States. “I understand the subway very well,” President Trump told The New York Times on Wednesday when quizzed about his knowledge of the city’s infrastructure. “I used to ride between the cars.” That was in his days at Kew-Forest School in Queens, Mr. Trump said, which were in the late 1950s. As the city and the subway system deteriorated in subsequent decades, riding between cars became part of the chaotic subterranean landscape: Trains were covered with graffiti and broke down often, passengers smoked cigarettes or worse, and doors between cars banged open and shut of their own accord, practically inviting trespass. “The people who ride our system now consider the ability to cross between cars their personal right,” a subway official wrote in 1983 to a federal safety board that was pressing the Transit Authority to outlaw crossing between cars when the trains were stopped. A seldom-enforced law against traveling between the cars of a moving train was already on the books. On an N train on Thursday, Ronald Dupree, a bouncer and car salesman who grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, recalled his childhood pastime fondly. “It was something to do — you’d feel the breeze,” Mr. Dupree, 46, said.

Bannon, the architect of Donald Trump’s campaign and presidency, is a man with a lot of ideas. He believes that Western civilization is locked in an existential battle with the barbarians at the gates, that nationalists must wrest control from the aloof and corrupt globalist elite, and that America is a once great nation shackled by welfare for both the poor and the wealthy. It was a version of this narrative, market-tested on Breitbart News, that carried Mr. Trump to the presidency. One way to understand Trumpism is as applied Bannonism. The first few months of President Trump’s term have been an attempt to put all of that theory into practice, and by any reasonable standard, that attempt has failed. As it turns out, there’s a difference between spinning yarns and the careful needlework of piecing together policy and political coalitions. The travel ban was Mr. Bannon’s first high-profile defeat. The hastily written and sloppily executed executive order, intended to halt immigration and travel from seven Middle Eastern countries, was immediately met by widespread protests. Mr. Bannon attempted to spin this as a feature, not a bug, an attempt to provoke opposition from the right set of enemies, but even nominal allies recoiled from the ban’s capriciousness. Worse, the executive order was quickly halted by the courts, and even a revised version has not yet been able to pass muster with the judiciary. Mr. Bannon’s most recent defeat is his removal from the National Security Council. As with the travel ban, he and his allies attempted to cast this as part of the plan. In his telling, he had taken a place on the council only to undo the work of Susan Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser; his allies said he was there to monitor Michael Flynn, the first national security adviser under President Trump. With those tasks accomplished, his work on the council was done. These explanations were quickly countered by leaks that portrayed Mr. Bannon as the loser of an internal power struggle, a depiction implicitly confirmed by leaks from his own camp. The media has cultivated the reputation of Steve Bannon as chessmaster and puppeteer, both Rasputin and Svengali, a consigliere with a well-worn library card. “Saturday Night Live” even imagined him as the Grim Reaper. Mr. Bannon has cheerfully played along with this portrayal, likening himself to avatars of dark power like Darth Vader and Dick Cheney. But there was never much reason to believe Mr. Bannon has the political genius necessary to actually bring his ideas to life. It’s true that much of the ideological underpinning of Mr. Trump’s agenda comes from Mr. Bannon, and it’s also true that he has outsize influence with the president. But as accomplishments go, fomenting xenophobia and manipulating a famously mercurial political neophyte are thin evidence of genius. "

In a flight that took about five hours, Mr. Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. In that short time, he became a hero to his generation and those that followed. After the flight, Mr. Glenn was honored by the White House, on Broadway and around country. He became a symbol of can-do spirit, lifting morale and restoring self-confidence at a time when many felt that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union. Mr. Glenn died Dec. 8 at age 95, and he was laid to rest Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery. His flag-draped coffin covered in plastic to protect it from the pouring rain, was carried to the grave site on a horse-drawn caisson. Mr. Glenn’s family scheduled the service on the date that would have been his 74th wedding anniversary. His widow, Annie Glenn, 97, attended the ceremony wearing a red dress; she held a single red rose as she sat in tent next to the couple’s two children, John David and Carolyn. She spoke with visible warmth to the Marine who presented her with the flag, and their faces nearly touched before she gave him a kiss. Six Marine pallbearers in dress uniforms carried Mr. Glenn’s coffin. A military trumpeter played taps, Marines fired three ceremonial rounds from their rifles and mourners recited the 23rd Psalm. No family member made remarks during the portion of the service that was streamed live online. Mr. Glenn returned to space in 1998 aboard the space shuttle Discovery, a mission that made him, at age 77, the oldest man in space. He had many accomplishments outside his career as an astronaut. He flew 149 missions as a Marine fighter pilot in World War II and Korea, broke the transcontinental air speed record, served for 24 years in the United States Senate, and founded the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State University. In his honor, President Trump issued a proclamation and ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half-staff Thursday. Tributes came from fellow astronauts. Robert Lightfoot, the acting administrator of NASA, said in a statement: Lawmakers, including Senator Rob Portman, of Mr. Glenn’s home state, Ohio, offered testimonials. The historic send-off from Scott Carpenter, that Mr. Glenn received more than 50 years ago as he left the launchpad at Cape Canaveral seems fitting: “Godspeed, John Glenn.” "

What switch had been flipped in my head to alter the thinking of 48 years? Had I, after decades of fighting them, become a sucker for a trend? After all, as someone who spends a large part of her professional life immersed in the world of fashion fads, I generally try to avoid them for myself. Wearing blue when there is blue all over the runways, or florals, or what have you makes me feel like I’ve drunk too much of the Kool-Aid handed out during my twice-yearly perambulations to the shows. I tend to think it’s good to keep a respectable distance between what I wear and what I write. Yet clearly something was going on. And not just with me. Suddenly, everywhere I looked there were women wearing longer hemlines, longer sleeves and higher necklines: on the red carpet, in the White House, from the Upper East Side to Williamsburg to the SoHos in both London and New York. I went back through slide shows from the Oscars and street-style pictures. When two public figures as seemingly diametrically opposed as Rihanna and Melania Trump ended up on the same continuum (one that began with them in full pinup mode and ended with both in full cover), my critical hackles went up and the little hairs on the back of my neck started tingling. It was time to get out of my own head. "
1059,C.I.A. Had Evidence of Russian Effort to Help Trump Earlier Than Believed,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/trump-russia-cia-john-brennan.html?searchResultPosition=18,2017/04/06,U.S.,"WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president, a finding that did not emerge publicly until after Mr. Trump’s victory months later, former government officials say. The briefings indicate that intelligence officials had evidence of Russia’s intentions to help Mr. Trump much earlier in the presidential campaign than previously thought. The briefings also reveal a critical split last summer between the C.I.A. and counterparts at the F.B.I., where a number of senior officials continued to believe through last fall that Russia’s cyberattacks were aimed primarily at disrupting America’s political system, and not at getting Mr. Trump elected, according to interviews. The former officials said that in late August — 10 weeks before the election — John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director, was so concerned about increasing evidence of Russia’s election meddling that he began a series of urgent, individual briefings for eight top members of Congress, some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break. It is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings. But with concerns growing both internally and publicly at the time about a significant Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee, the C.I.A. began seeing signs of possible connections to the Trump campaign, the officials said. By the campaign’s final weeks, Congress and the intelligence agencies were racing to understand the scope of the Russia threat. In an Aug. 25 briefing for Harry Reid, then the top Democrat in the Senate, Mr. Brennan indicated that Russia’s hackings appeared aimed at helping Mr. Trump win the November election, according to two former officials with knowledge of the briefing. The officials said Mr. Brennan also indicated that unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. The F.B.I. and two congressional committees are now investigating that claim, focusing on possible communications and financial dealings between Russian affiliates and a handful of former advisers to Mr. Trump. So far, no proof of collusion has emerged publicly. "

Immigration agents were said to be planning a raid. They could come any minute. In this fraying, blue-collar city, where a quarter of the 95,000 residents are foreign born, word whipped across social media. Children were kept home from school. Families sorted through plans for what to do in case one among them was swept up. Waves of panic have become familiar since Donald J. Trump, who has promised wide-scale deportations of illegal immigrants, became president. Federal agents have made scores of publicized arrests around the nation. As communities wrestle with the administration’s new policy, they face another challenge, too: distinguishing between verifiable reports of arrests and empty rumors driven by fear. In New York, there was talk of raids on trains headed to the Bronx and in Queens, and of checkpoints on Long Island — all later deemed false. In Kansas City, unsubstantiated word of roundups outside churches kept some people from going to Mass. “Any smidgen of information just spreads like wildfire,” said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington.

The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past. Twitter disclosed in a federal court filing on Thursday that it had received a summons directing it to reveal the identity or identities of those behind @ALT_USCIS, one of several so-called alt-accounts run by people purporting to be current or former federal employees. The @ALT_USCIS account, which quickly gained tens of thousands of followers, has frequently criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies and enforcement actions. Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government’s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have “a grave chilling effect” on the speech of alt-accounts that voice resistance to government policies. “A time-honored tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,” Twitter said in its filing. “These First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life.” Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment.

There’s also an early contender for novel of the 22nd century, “American War,” which imagines a post-apocalyptic United States devastated by a second civil war. A new biography of thin-skinned Richard Nixon feels firmly rooted in the present. And two books illuminate bodies of water: “The Gulf,” a sweeping environmental history of the Gulf of Mexico, and “Earthly Remains,” a new Donna Leon mystery set on an island in the Venetian lagoon. Watch your back, and your boat. Radhika Jones
Editorial Director, Books AMERICAN WAR, by Omar El Akkad. (Knopf. $26.95.) This debut novel imagines the events that lead up to and follow the Second American Civil War at the turn of the 22nd century. Our critic Michiko Kakutani, with high praise rarely bestowed on a debut, calls it “a surprisingly powerful novel — one that creates as haunting a postapocalyptic universe as Cormac McCarthy did in ‘The Road’ (2006), and as devastating a look at the fallout that national events have on an American family as Philip Roth did in ‘The Plot Against America’ (2004).” SUNSHINE STATE: Essays, by Sarah Gerard. (Harper Perennial. $15.99.) Gerard grew up in Clearwater, Fla., a beach city near Tampa, and this blend of memoir and journalism takes a close look at her home state. Our critic Dwight Garner writes that even if some of the essays are more successful than others, the best put Gerard in the company of acclaimed writers like John Jeremiah Sullivan and Leslie Jamison. “When Gerard is on, she is really on,” Garner writes. “She’s best when her evocations of the frenzy that is Florida are personal.” THE GULF: The Making of an American Sea, by Jack E. Davis. (Liveright. $29.95.) Davis’s sweeping history of the Gulf of Mexico takes into account colorful nature, idiosyncratic human characters, economic development, and the ways in which artists and writers have seen the body of water. In his review, Dwight Garner calls it “a sensitive and sturdy work of environmental history.” RICHARD NIXON: The Life, by John A. Farrell. (Doubleday. $35.) This comprehensive biography of the 37th president arrives at a moment that its author couldn’t have predicted. (“The similarities between Nixon and Trump leap off the page like crickets,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes.) Like other charitable biographies of Nixon, this one paints Nixon as a tragic figure. Senior writes: “Farrell’s Nixon is smart and ambitious, a visionary in some ways (China), but also skinless, both driven and utterly undone by self-doubt.” THE EVANGELICALS: The Struggle to Shape America, by Frances FitzGerald. (Simon & Schuster, $35.) This fair-minded history — a vitally important overview that’s also, improbably, a page-turner — focuses on the doctrinal and political issues that have concerned white conservative Protestants since they abandoned their traditional separation from the world and, led by Billy Graham and others, merged with the Republican Party.

1064,"Trying to Revive Health Bill, G.O.P. Adds $15 Billion for Sickest Americans",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/health-care-affordable-care-act-house.html?searchResultPosition=12,2017/04/06,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Under intense pressure from President Trump, House Republicans took a small step Thursday to revive legislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, adding a $15 billion fund to help insurers pay claims for their sickest customers. Speaker Paul D. Ryan orchestrated a broad show of Republican support for the proposal, conceived as an amendment to the repeal bill that collapsed on the House floor two weeks ago. But Republicans said they still did not have enough votes to pass the bill, and with the House now on a two-week spring break, time is running out for their planned quick-strike repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Even so, Republicans said the amendment could help heal divisions in their conference and show progress to an impatient president, still smarting from a loss in his first showdown with Congress. By a party-line vote of 9 to 2, the House Rules Committee on Thursday gave its blessing to the proposal, devised by Representatives Gary Palmer of Alabama and David Schweikert of Arizona, both members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Mr. Palmer said the “risk-sharing program” would lower premiums by sparing insurers some costs. With lower prices, he said, more people would buy insurance. He estimated that it would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 1.2 million to 2.2 million. However, those gains would be dwarfed by other parts of the repeal bill, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says would result in 24 million more uninsured people compared with projections under current law.

1065,The Grim Logic Behind Syria’s Chemical Weapons Attack,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.html?searchResultPosition=11,2017/04/06,MIDDLE EAST,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The diplomatic situation had been looking bright for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. With the help of Russia, he had consolidated his power, the rebels were on their heels and the United States had just declared that ousting him was not a priority. So why would Mr. Assad risk it all, outraging the world by attacking civilians with what Turkey now says was the nerve agent sarin, killing scores of people, many of them children? Why would he inflict the deadliest chemical strike since the 2013 attacks outside Damascus? Those attacks came close to bringing American military retaliation then. And in a stunningly swift reversal, Tuesday’s attack drew a response from President Trump: dozens of cruise missiles launched at a Syrian air base. One of the main defenses offered by Mr. Assad’s allies and supporters, in disputing that his forces carried out the strike on Tuesday, is that such an attack would be “a crazy move,” as one Iranian analyst, Mosib Na’imi, told the Russian state-run news site Sputnik. Yet, rather than an inexplicable act, analysts say, it is part of a carefully calculated strategy of escalating attacks against civilians. For years, at least since it began shelling neighborhoods with artillery in 2012, then bombing them from helicopters and later from jets, the Syrian government has adopted a policy of seeking total victory by making life as miserable as possible for anyone living in areas outside its control. Government forces have been herding defeated opponents from across the country into Idlib Province, where the chemical attack occurred. Starved and bombed out of their enclaves, they are bused under lopsided surrender deals to the province, where Qaeda-linked groups maintain a presence the Syrian military uses as an excuse to bomb without regard for the safety of civilians. Dr. Monzer Khalil, Idlib Province’s health director, said such extreme tactics aimed to demonstrate the government’s impunity and to demoralize its foes. "

His announcement came just over a week after President Trump signed a directive that declared parts of Somalia an “area of active hostilities.” The order temporarily relaxes some rules for preventing civilian casualties when the American military carries out counterterrorism strikes in Somalia. Somalia has been marred by severe draughts, terrorism, corruption and a new spike in piracy. In the face of those challenges, the president’s cabinet on Thursday replaced the chief commanders of the army, the police and national intelligence, as well as the mayor of Mogadishu, the capital. The shake-up was greeted with skepticism among Mogadishu residents. The reshuffling of security officials looks like business as usual, said Hafzina Omar, a 22-year-old Mogadishu resident. “If Somali forces work honestly, Al Shabab attacks will be stopped,” she said. At least six people were killed on Wednesday after a suicide car bomber targeted a cafe frequented by government officials near the Internal Security Ministry and the Ministry of Youth. "

The world was waiting for leadership, and the United States has assumed that role, as it has historically. The next step is to declare President Bashar al-Assad of Syria a war criminal and to indict him in the International Criminal Court. As for the Russians, they are equally guilty in supporting the Syrian government, which has been killing its own people for years.

1068,A Pepsi Commercial’s Lesson for Advertisers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/a-pepsi-commercials-lesson-for-advertisers.html?searchResultPosition=33,2017/04/06,OPINION,"Pepsi on Wednesday pulled a disastrous advertisement after it was met with widespread ridicule. Titled “Jump In,” the two-and-a-half minute spot was full of clumsy, glib references to police brutality and Black Lives Matter protests. Nearly every tone-deaf frame has become a mocking meme. And the commercial (Pepsi calls it a “short film”) drew the most intense disgust from the very people whose experiences it tried to reflect. But “Jump In” — which bizarrely ends with the model Kendall Jenner handing a police officer a Pepsi, inspiring smiles all around in a happy end to a demonstration that looked more like a street party the whole time — is not just a one-off misfire or an offensive aberration. Rather, it highlights deep structural problems and contradictions in the advertising industry, problems that run much deeper than this particular failure. I’m a white man who has worked in advertising for seven years, and while I’d like to say I’ve never been complicit in similar mistakes, I know I probably have. But my experience gives me some insight. In advertising, any attempts to tackle “big issues” (racism, sexism, domestic violence, climate change) must remain linked to a corporation’s need to push product. Branded content like “Jump In” seeks to provoke while still speaking to the broadest possible audience. Its goal is the sort of edginess that doesn’t alienate anyone. With that in mind — and without any specific knowledge about how “Jump In” came to be — I can imagine that it was born from some combination of good intentions, corporate hedging and a huge failure to grasp the limitations of advertising on the part of the people working for Pepsi’s in-house content agency. But the failings that made “Jump In” a disaster on nearly every level are hardly one-dimensional or confined to this brand or this particular campaign. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, there has been a rash of advertisements seeking to remind consumers of what really makes America great, or to push saccharine messages about the idea that by working together, we can fight evil and make the world a better place. “Jump In” stands out even in this group with its attempt to channel, if not appropriate, the highly specific contemporary notion of “wokeness” — which, loosely defined, refers to understanding of and commitment to addressing injustice.

1069,Tesla Has Something Hotter Than Cars to Sell: Its Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/business/tesla-story-stocks.html?searchResultPosition=34,2017/04/06,BUSINESS,"As Tesla shares surged past $300 this week and the company’s market value surpassed Ford’s, even its founder, Elon Musk, acknowledged on Twitter that the company was “absurdly overvalued if based on the past.” By “the past,” he presumably means old-fashioned valuation measures like price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios, the traditional benchmarks for evaluating stock prices. By those measures, Tesla — a company that lost $773 million last year — is indeed off the charts. Tesla’s market value of nearly $49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford, which earned nearly $11 billion in profit last year, but is within easy striking distance of General Motors, which earned $9.4 billion. In contrast to Tesla, Ford and G.M. shares have dropped recently on fears that auto sales have hit a cyclical peak. Ford and G.M. executives wouldn’t comment on Tesla’s stock surge, but it’s easy to imagine they’d be tearing their hair out in frustration. “It’s nuts,” Bruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing, said of Tesla’s stock price. “Investors believe it’s going to dominate a market that no company has ever dominated before.” But Tesla is not a stock, or a company, that is measured by the past, as Mr. Musk is well aware. He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent “risk-adjusted future cash flows” — and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful, self-driving electric vehicles powered by solar-fed batteries that are easy on the environment.

Donald Trump has torn it open again. Among the many lies that he has constructed, none is more ridiculous than his attempt to contradict history by presenting the United States as a victim of Mexico, a country that supposedly steals jobs, imposes onerous treaties and sends its “bad hombres” across the border. To confront this fake history, some Mexicans are proposing to remind Mr. Trump exactly what country was the first victim of American imperialism. They are calling for a lawsuit that would aim to nullify the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (signed on Feb. 2, 1848), in which Mexico — invaded by American soldiers, its capital occupied, its ports and customs stations seized — was forced to accept the American annexation of Texas and concede more than half the rest of Mexican territory, now including most of the states of Arizona, New Mexico and California. This effort is being led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, the elder statesman of the Mexican left. Mr. Cárdenas is convinced that the Mexican government — especially given the need to confront Mr. Trump’s aggression — has a solid legal case. In his opinion, the 1848 treaty violates essential international legal norms and a case can be brought before the International Court of Justice, proposing reparations and indemnification. And even if one admits the legal validity of much of the treaty, there are a number of crucial articles — such as those dealing with citizenship, property and the security of 100,000 Mexicans who remained on what became American territory — that have been ignored from the beginning. Such an effort faces formidable obstacles, though. A former Mexican secretary of foreign relations, Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor, the leading Mexican expert in international law, believes — “much to his regret,” he said — that Mr. Cárdenas’s initiative is not feasible. “In previous times, wars of conquest did not find the same moral and legal condemnation that is nowadays part and parcel of our system of law,” he told me. The treaty would have to be challenged under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, “for which it must be shown that the state did not expressly agree that the treaty is a valid instrument or that, by reasons of its own conduct, that state must be considered as not having acquiesced to the validity of the treaty.” "

Officials also acknowledged that they had been aware of a defect on the tracks at the site of a derailment on Monday before it occurred, but did not recognize the urgency of the problem. The derailment of a New Jersey Transit train on Monday resulted in four days of extraordinary upheaval for hundreds of thousands of commuters across the region. Regular train service was scheduled to return to Penn Station on Friday morning, Amtrak officials said. The accident closed eight of Penn Station’s 21 tracks, causing a cascade of delays across the three railroads that share the station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road. The damage from the derailment required major repairs to the tracks, a complex labyrinth near the Hudson River tunnel. On Thursday, Amtrak took responsibility for the accident this week and for the derailment of one of its Acela trains on March 24. “Based on our recent investigations, we can confirm that problems with our tracks in Penn Station were a cause of both recent derailments,” said Charles W. Moorman, Amtrak’s chief executive. "

Well, we have finally reached that stage in the 2010s. The tectonic plates of fashion have shifted. Look around. What do you see?

One, the “Great German Art Exhibition,” featured art Adolf Hitler deemed acceptable and reflective of an ideal Aryan society: representational, featuring blond people in heroic poses and pastoral landscapes of the German countryside. The other featured what Hitler and his followers referred to as “degenerate art”: work that was modern or abstract, and art produced by people disavowed by Nazis — Jewish people, Communists, or those suspected of being one or the other. The “degenerate art” was presented in chaos and disarray, accompanied by derogatory labels, graffiti and catalog entries describing “the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or pencil.” Hitler and those close to him strictly controlled how artists lived and worked in Nazi Germany, because they understood that art could play a key role in the rise or fall of their dictatorship and the realization of their vision for Germany’s future. Last month, the Trump administration proposed a national budget that includes the elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts. The NEA operates with a budget of about $150 million a year. As critics have observed, this amount is about 0.004 percent of the federal budget, making the move a fairly inefficient approach to trimming government spending. Many Americans have been protesting the cuts by pointing out the many ways that art enriches our lives — as they should. The arts bring us joy and entertainment; they can offer a reprieve from the trials of life or a way to understand them. But as Hitler understood, artists play a distinctive role in challenging authoritarianism. Art creates pathways for subversion, for political understanding and solidarity among coalition builders. Art teaches us that lives other than our own have value. Like the proverbial court jester who can openly mock the king in his own court, artists who occupy marginalized social positions can use their art to challenge structures of power in ways that would otherwise be dangerous or impossible. Authoritarian leaders throughout history have intuited this fact and have acted accordingly. The Stalinist government of the 1930s required art to meet strict criteria of style and content to ensure that it exclusively served the purposes of state leadership. In his memoir, the composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich writes that the Stalinist government systematically executed all of the Soviet Union’s Ukrainian folk poets. When Augusto Pinochet took power in Chile in 1973, muralists were arrested, tortured and exiled. Soon after the coup, the singer and theater artist Víctor Jara was killed, his body riddled with bullets and displayed publicly as a warning to others. In her book “Brazilian Art Under Dictatorship,” Claudia Calirman writes that the museum director Niomar Moniz Sodré Bittencourt had to hide works of art and advise artists to leave Brazil after authorities entered her museum, blocked the exhibition and demanded the work be dismantled because it contained dangerous images like a photograph of a member of the military falling off a motorcycle, which was seen as embarrassing to the police. Such extreme intervention may seem far removed from the United States today, until we consider episodes like the president’s public castigation of the “Hamilton” cast after it issued a fairly tame commentary directed at Mike Pence.

1077,My Most Unpopular Idea: Be Nice to Trump Voters,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/my-most-unpopular-idea-be-nice-to-trump-voters.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/04/06,OPINION,"When I write about people struggling with addictions or homelessness, liberals exude sympathy while conservatives respond with snarling hostility to losers who make “bad choices.” When I write about voters who supported President Trump, it’s the reverse: Now it’s liberals who respond with venom, hoping that Trump voters suffer for their bad choice. “I absolutely despise these people,” one woman tweeted at me after I interviewed Trump voters. “Truly the worst of humanity. To hell with every one of them.” Maybe we all need a little more empathy? I wrote my last column from Oklahoma, highlighting voters who had supported Trump and now find that he wants to cut programs that had helped them. One woman had recovered from a rape with the help of a women’s center that stands to lose funding, another said that she would sit home and die without a job program facing cutbacks, and so on. Yet every one of them was still behind Trump — and that infuriated my readers. “I’m just going to say it,” tweeted Bridgette. “I hate these people. They are stupid and selfish. Screw them. Lose your jobs, sit home and die.” Another: “ALL Trump voters are racist and deplorable. They’ll never vote Democratic. We should never pander to the Trumpites. We’re not a party for racists.” "

What worries me most is that he seems to have no coherent plan, at least not one that he is willing or able to communicate. “I don’t show my hand” isn’t a strategy to conceal a plan as much as one to conceal the absence of a plan. His statements are all bluster and bungling and bosh. Our commander in chief is not in full command of his emotions or facts or geopolitics. We may sometimes think that the absurdity of Trump’s endless stream of contradictions and lies ends at the nation’s borders, but it doesn’t. The world is watching, and the world is full of dangerous men who see killing as a means of maintaining and exerting power. They see in Trump a novice and know-nothing, and they will surely test his resolve. Trump has exposed himself to the world as an imbecile and burned through American credibility with his incessant lying. Even many of our allies seem confused and worried about where we stand and how we plan to proceed. Trump is full of pride, obsessed with strongman personas, and absent of historical and geopolitical perspective. This is the worst possible situation. The man who could bring us into military engagement is woefully deficient in intellectual engagement. "
1079,Should America Have Entered World War I?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/should-america-have-entered-world-war-i.html?searchResultPosition=57,2017/04/06,OPINION,"One hundred years ago today, Congress voted to enter what was then the largest and bloodiest war in history. Four days earlier, President Woodrow Wilson had sought to unite a sharply divided populace with a stirring claim that the nation “is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.” The war lasted only another year and a half, but in that time, an astounding 117,000 American soldiers were killed and 202,000 wounded. Still, most Americans know little about why the United States fought in World War I, or why it mattered. The “Great War” that tore apart Europe and the Middle East and took the lives of over 17 million people worldwide lacks the high drama and moral gravity of the Civil War and World War II, in which the very survival of the nation seemed at stake. World War I is less easy to explain. America intervened nearly three years after it began, and the “doughboys,” as our troops were called, engaged in serious combat for only a few months. More Americans in uniform died away from the battlefield — thousands from the Spanish flu — than with weapons in hand. After victory was achieved, Wilson’s audacious hope of making a peace that would advance democracy and national self-determination blew up in his face when the Senate refused to ratify the treaty he had signed at the Palace of Versailles. But attention should be paid. America’s decision to join the Allies was a turning point in world history. It altered the fortunes of the war and the course of the 20th century — and not necessarily for the better. Its entry most likely foreclosed the possibility of a negotiated peace among belligerent powers that were exhausted from years mired in trench warfare. Although the American Expeditionary Force did not engage in combat for long, the looming threat of several million fresh troops led German generals to launch a last, desperate series of offensives. When that campaign collapsed, Germany’s defeat was inevitable. How would the war have ended if America had not intervened? The carnage might have continued for another year or two until citizens in the warring nations, who were already protesting the endless sacrifices required, forced their leaders to reach a settlement. If the Allies, led by France and Britain, had not won a total victory, there would have been no punitive peace treaty like that completed at Versailles, no stab-in-the-back allegations by resentful Germans, and thus no rise, much less triumph, of Hitler and the Nazis. The next world war, with its 50 million deaths, would probably not have occurred. "
1080,Rising Risks for Retirement Savers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/rising-risks-for-retirement-savers.html?searchResultPosition=56,2017/04/06,OPINION,"As America’s population ages, opportunities for a secure retirement should increase. But the opposite is happening. And things are likely to get worse in the Trump years. A measure passed recently by congressional Republicans and awaiting President Trump’s all-but-certain signature will reverse a rule, passed in the last year of the Obama administration, allowing cities and counties to organize savings plans for private-sector workers who have no employer-provided retirement coverage. Another measure, blocking states from sponsoring similar retirement savings plans, was passed by the House in February. The Senate and Mr. Trump would be wise to let that measure die. If it is enacted, 13 million people — a sizable portion of the 55 million Americans who don’t have company retirement plans — would be denied access to payroll-deduction individual retirement accounts. People who already have retirement plans also have cause for worry. On Wednesday, the Labor Department carried out Mr. Trump’s directive to delay the April 10 effective date of a federal rule that requires financial advisers to put a client’s interest before their own when giving advice or selling investments related to 401(k) rollovers and other retirement transactions. The rule, known as the “best interest” or ""fiduciary” standard, would protect 401(k) savers from being steered into overly expensive strategies and products when they retire. All of these rules were carefully researched and written. All are much needed. And all are being tampered with for one reason only: The financial industry does not want them because it makes tens of billions of dollars a year under a status quo in which its products and practices are the only game in town for retirement savers. This means that what congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are doing is looking for ways to line Wall Street’s pockets with the retirement savings of working people. The result will be continuing hardship for retirees. The roughly one-half of private-sector workers who do not have retirement plans at work will rely on Social Security for between half to all of their income in retirement. But even those with retirement savings will be hard pressed. A recent paper by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College showed that pension wealth — from traditional pensions and 401(k)’s — remained basically flat for workers ages 51 to 56 from 1992 to 2010. (The figures may show improvement in the 2016 data, due out next year, but they are unlikely to buck a nearly 20-year trend.) The study also found that even as overall pension wealth held steady, the shift from traditional pensions to 401(k)’s left people worse off in retirement. Traditional pensions guarantee constant monthly payments for life; 401(k)’s can and do run out. In addition, the income generated by 401(k)’s varies with interest rates, which have been very low for very long. "
1081,Trump Bets the House,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/trump-bets-the-house.html?searchResultPosition=55,2017/04/06,OPINION,"Each in its own way, the Trump administration, the Republican Senate and the Republican House face ideological conflicts between fiscal conservatism, white identity politics and right-wing populism. Their interests converge in a shared antipathy to immigration and to programs seen as disproportionately benefiting racial and ethnic minorities. It’s when their interests diverge that battles erupt. Two cases in point: the Trump budget and the failed attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. The administration’s proposed spending plan for the 2018 fiscal year, “America First — A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again,” appeases those who have long been determined to cut means-tested programs. But those same programs are crucial to keeping 6.2 million white working class voters out of poverty, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number of whites dependent on safety net programs is far larger than the number of African Americans, at 2.8 million, or Hispanics, at 2.4 million. "

The world’s biggest and second-biggest economies are like a married couple that complain about each other constantly yet can’t even contemplate a divorce. The marriage enters a new phase Thursday, as President Xi Jinping of China visits for two days of meetings at the Florida estate of a president who made China a punching bag on the campaign trail. The question is whether President Trump can turn his bellicose language into concrete gains for American companies and workers. A look at the economics of the relationship between the nations, and conversations with former officials with battle scars from past negotiations, show a path for getting a better deal. That path to success may not include the kind of flashy, headline-generating announcements that the Trump administration has tended to celebrate. In February, Mr. Trump called China the “grand champions at manipulation of currency.” During the campaign, too, he frequently assailed China for artificially reducing the value of the renminbi to favor its companies versus American and other competitors. It is a view that is outdated. For years, China did intervene in financial markets to depress the value of its currency. But now it is intervening to keep the yuan from falling — actually doing the opposite of what Mr. Trump alleged. Economists generally think that the Chinese currency is close to the levels that would be set by purely market forces. "

1084,Trump Administration to Take Harder Tack on Trade With China,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/trump-xi-jinping-china-summit-mar-a-lago.html?searchResultPosition=50,2017/04/06,POLITICS,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — The Trump administration is planning to roll out its first concrete measures against China on trade, administration officials said on Thursday, hardening its position toward America’s largest trading partner just as President Trump welcomed President Xi Jinping of China to his seaside club here for their first face-to-face meeting. Sometime after Mr. Xi leaves the United States, these officials said, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting countries that dump steel into the American market, an aggressive measure aimed mainly at China. It is unclear exactly what the order would do or how harsh it would be, but it would be designed to begin to make good on Mr. Trump’s promise during the campaign to redress China’s huge trade surplus with the United States. In addition, an official said, the White House is moving out a senior economy policy official, Andrew Quinn, who had helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, former President Barack Obama’s signature trade initiative. Mr. Quinn had become the subject of a battle between two camps in the White House: economic nationalists, who wanted him out, and more mainstream backers of free trade, who defended him. Taken together, these developments constituted a potentially significant victory for the hard-liners, coming off a string of setbacks in their efforts to persuade the president to deliver on the most combative anti-free-trade planks of his presidential campaign.

1085,Senate Republicans Deploy ‘Nuclear Option’ to Clear Path for Gorsuch,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html?searchResultPosition=51,2017/04/06,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Thursday engineered a dramatic change in how the chamber confirms Supreme Court nominations, bypassing a Democratic blockade of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch in a move that will most likely reshape both the Senate and the court. After Democrats held together Thursday morning and filibustered President Trump’s nominee, Republicans voted to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority. In deploying this so-called nuclear option, lawmakers are fundamentally altering the way the Senate handles one of its most significant duties, further limiting the minority’s power in a chamber that was designed to be a slower and more deliberative body than the House. The move, once unthinkable among senators, is a testament to the creeping partisan rancor in recent years, after decades of at least relative bipartisanship on Supreme Court matters. Both parties have warned of sweeping effects on the court itself, predicting the elevation of more ideologically extreme judges now that only a majority is required for confirmation. Senate Democrats in 2013 first changed the rules of the Senate to block Republican filibusters of presidential nominees to lower courts and to government positions. But they left the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees untouched, an acknowledgment of the court’s exalted status. On Thursday, that last pillar was swept away on a party-line vote, with all 52 Republicans choosing to overrule Senate precedent and all 48 Democrats and liberal-leaning independents pushing to keep it.

1086,Jefferson vs. the Filibuster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/jefferson-vs-the-filibuster.html?searchResultPosition=42,2017/04/06,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The founding fathers believed in majority rule, with only a few exceptions. In his 1801 guide to Senate practices, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “The voice of the majority decides.” The exceptions, as spelled out in the Constitution, included removing someone from office, overriding a veto, ratifying a treaty and amending the Constitution itself. Passing a regular law wasn’t one of the exceptions. Nor was confirming a Supreme Court justice. Over time, however, the Senate changed its rules to give the minority party the power to block action so long as it had 34 votes. (The Senate changed the threshold to the current 41 votes in 1974.) So when you hear people — on both the left and right — decry the likely weakening of the filibuster this week, keep in mind that it has not been a permanent part of American democracy. For much of our history, majority rule was the norm, and supermajority rule was a rare exception. “The switch to supermajority rule,” Steven Waldman writes in an Op-Ed today, “happened without a constitutional amendment, without a national debate, without its even becoming a major issue in a presidential campaign.” It happened through a series of changes in Senate rules and norms, as Waldman explains.

The statement from Turkey, where many of the stricken Syrians were taken after the assault on Tuesday, was the most specific about the cause. “According to the results of preliminary tests,” the statement said, “patients were exposed to chemical material (Sarin).” Western countries have accused the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad of carrying out the chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province, which left scores dead and hundreds sickened in one of the worst atrocities so far in the six-year-old Syria war. The Syrian government has denied responsibility. Russia, its main ally, has accused Mr. Assad’s enemies of rushing to judgment and has threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council measure condemning the assault. The Turkish statement said the sarin conclusion had been based on autopsies on three victims performed at Turkey’s Adana Forensic Medicine Institution with the participation of representatives from the World Health Organization and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, a group based in The Hague that monitors compliance with the global treaty that bans such munitions.

Some of our cultural institutions promoted the war effort. The songwriters and music publishers of Tin Pan Alley cranked out tunes to show support, including the military ballad “Over There” by George M. Cohan. And New York illustrators created some of the most iconic propaganda posters, such as James Montgomery Flagg’s “I Want You for U.S. Army” recruiting poster.

The central bank is expected to pare the more than $4 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage securities it bought after the 2008 financial crisis to keep interest rates low and to help revive the economy. It has already started to slowly raise its benchmark interest rate. Fed officials think the economy is strong enough for it to gradually ease back on its support. Markets appear to agree. News that the central bank would reduce its investments was met with relative calm. Some analysts think the Fed needs to step back even further. “Financial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways,” said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock’s U.S. multi-sector fixed income team. Corporate chiefs in the United States have bemoaned for years the taxes that they would face if they brought home more than $2 trillion in cash kept overseas. They may soon stop complaining. President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are widely believed to be open to lowering taxes on funds that companies bring back. For lawmakers, the idea of a tide of funds coming home creates visions of infrastructure investment and job creation. But on Wall Street, it has set off hopes for another spending priority: mergers and acquisitions. And deals often lead to job losses. "
1093,Damien Hirst Is Back With an Underwater Fantasy. Will Collectors Care?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/arts/design/damien-hirst-francois-pinault-palazzo-grassi.html?searchResultPosition=43,2017/04/06,ART & DESIGN,"VENICE — Damien Hirst is staring into the eyes of a jade Buddha, its face seemingly abraded by the vestiges of time. “I think he looks damn good, considering he’s 2,000 years old,” he said, straining to keep a straight face. Nearby, the sculpture of a pharaoh fashioned from blue granite and displaying a gold nipple ring bears an uncanny resemblance to Pharrell Williams. Is the face really that of the singer? “You could say that,” Mr. Hirst responded. “It’s all about what you want to believe.” After years of uncharacteristic silence, this artist known for his love-it-or-hate-it artworks is orchestrating his own comeback. On a recent morning, dressed all in black, Mr. Hirst could be found in the soaring entrance of the Palazzo Grassi watching his crew put the finishing touches on an extravaganza worthy of Cecil B. DeMille — his first major show of new work in 10 years. Opening to the public on Sunday, April 9, and called “Treasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable,” it is an underwater fantasy, with sculptures like the Buddha and hundreds of other objects fashioned to look as though they were antiquities dredged up from the bottom of the sea. The works will fill the Palazzo Grassi and the Punta della Dogana, two museums run by François Pinault, the Parisian collector who is also the owner of Christie’s auction house. The show is widely seen as Mr. Hirst’s attempt, at 51, to kick-start his career, which has suffered since 2008, when the financial and art markets crashed. Tapping into the age-old romance of shipwrecks, he and his patron are embarking on a giant artistic and financial gamble. “Treasures” cost Mr. Hirst millions of dollars to produce and Mr. Pinault millions to present (exact figures were not disclosed by either man). Collectors who have been offered the works report that prices start around $500,000 apiece rising to upward of $5 million. With Damien Hirst’s market untested on such a grand scale, the question the art world is asking is, will he sink or swim in Venice? Francesco Bonami, a curator who organized a major exhibition of Mr. Hirst’s work in Doha, Qatar, four years ago, said the latest Hirst production “goes beyond good or bad,” adding: “In his bombastic, exaggerated way, Damien has created a narrative the likes of which the public has never seen. Many will call it bad taste or kitsch, but it’s more than all of that. It’s Hollywood.” "
1094,First Family’s Needs Strain Secret Service,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/secret-service-trump-first-family-protection.html?searchResultPosition=49,2017/04/06,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Eleven weeks into the Trump presidency, the Secret Service is grappling with how to constrain the rising costs and unexpected strain that have come with protecting a new first family as large, mobile and high-profile as any in modern American history. To keep up, dozens of agents from New York and field offices across the country are being temporarily pulled off criminal investigations to serve two-week stints protecting members of the Trump family, including the first lady and the youngest son in Manhattan’s Trump Tower. Others, already assigned to the highly selective presidential protective division, had hoped for relief after a grueling election year. That hope has evaporated as they work more overtime hours and spend long stretches away from home because of the Trump family’s far-flung travel. And in Washington, agency leaders are already negotiating for tens of millions of dollars in supplemental funding to help offset the sky-high costs of securing Trump Tower and other high-profile family assets like Mar-a-Lago in Florida. It is a figure that will only continue to rise. “They are flat-out worn out,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The committee’s top-ranking Democratic member, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, gave an analogy: “It’s like being on a bike that you never get off of.” "

The outpouring of support came after the married couple, Jasper Vernes-Sewratan and Ronnie Sewratan-Vernes, said they were attacked by a gang of youths while holding hands on their way home from a party early Sunday. According to a statement the Arnhem police posted on Facebook, the two said they had been attacked by men wielding bolt cutters; one had some of his teeth smashed out. Prosecutors said five teenage suspects would be charged on Thursday with serious bodily harm. The authorities are still investigating the motivation for the attack, which the victims have characterized as a hate crime. The beating caused particular outrage in the Netherlands, which has long prided itself on its tolerance. Amsterdam, the capital, has been a haven for sexual minorities for centuries, and it has marketed itself as the “gay capital of Europe.” Homosexuality was removed from the Dutch criminal code in 1811, and the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage, with the first ceremonies in 2001.

1096,California Today: A Strike Looms in Hollywood,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/california-today-a-strike-looms-in-hollywood.html?searchResultPosition=40,2017/04/06,U.S.,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Let’s turn it over to Brooks Barnes, our Hollywood reporter based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. LOS ANGELES — For the first time in a decade, Hollywood is facing the threat of a major strike. Writers, who power almost everything the movie and television factories make, want better pay and the shoring up of a faltering health care plan. Studios, while open to some raises, have so far proposed health care changes that many writers consider rollbacks. Should a walkout happen — with its contract expiring on May 1, the Writers Guild of America last week asked members to give it the authority to call a strike — Howard A. Rodman will be among those leading the charge. While not prone to public grandstanding, Mr. Rodman, president of the Writers Guild, West, is a behind-the-scenes firebrand. He was elected in 2015 after vowing to get tough with studios. Labor conflict is in his blood; his father, also a writer, was a combative guild figure. Speaking by phone, Mr. Rodman insisted that writers, despite a Netflix-fueled boom in television, were being left behind by the industry. TV seasons are shorter. Networks are showing fewer reruns, limiting residuals. Studios are also making fewer movies and cutting back on paying to polish scripts. "
1097,Germany’s First Lady Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/germanys-first-lady-problem.html?searchResultPosition=39,2017/04/06,OPINION,"BERLIN — In a way, Elke Büdenbender is the exact opposite of Melania Trump. Being married to Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the new German head of state, she has given up her job as a judge at the Berlin Administrative Court to fully devote her time to the job of first lady. Mrs. Trump, on the contrary, refuses to be first lady, in order to, well, to continue to do pretty much nothing. Still, however different the two women may be, Germany is having the same discussion as the United States: Are we still in for a first lady in the 21st century? Is a first housewife still an appropriate representative of the nation we are? And does she represent the nation we’d like to be? As for the nation we’d like to be, the German answer is quite simple: No, she does not. Most Germans like to think of women’s equality as a mission accomplished and would probably agree that the role model that lives on at the Schloss Bellevue, the president’s residence, has outlived its time. Germany has never had a female president, which may be why it has never modernized the roles of its first couple. At the Schloss Bellevue, the 1950s have survived, turning it into a museum of social history, a “Mad Men” caricature of the domestic, patriarchal past, just plusher and less cool, exuding the stale smell of a Sunday roast gone cold waiting for Daddy to return to the familial home. The German first lady, not unlike her American counterpart, is the woman “at his side,” as many media outlets like to put it. She is active, but in a way that postwar Germany would have approved of, too. Traditionally, she’s the patron of the Müttergenesungswerk, a charitable organization founded by Elly Heuss-Knapp, Germany’s first first lady, which is dedicated to the health of mothers. Horst Köhler, the president from 2004 to 2010, and his wife, Eva Luise, for example, started a foundation for rare diseases. The first lady is in charge of organizing the president’s New Year’s reception and other tasks that comply with traditional female role requirements such as caretaking, tending and accommodating. All of this is based on mere convention. The first lady has no constitutional role. The fact that she is acting as a state official equipped with an office, assistant and staffer could actually raise some difficult legal questions, as Sophie Schönberger, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Konstanz, recently noted in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, picking up on the question raised in the United States over whether Mrs. Trump should be paid. Or, as Norbert Lammert, president of the German Parliament, put it during Mr. Steinmeier’s inauguration, addressing Ms. Büdenbender: “Yours is an office which, according to our Constitution, doesn’t exist.” It’s as though he was trying to squeeze women’s history into one sentence: Women have always managed without holding an office, acted without recognition, worked without pay, existed outside the written.

One of its members spent more than a decade as an environmental activist for a tree-hugging nonprofit. Another studied Arctic oceanography in Germany. Their commander is a former high school science teacher. But together they have forged one of Latin America’s most feared elite fighting units, on the front lines of Brazil’s struggle to curb the destruction of the Amazon. The team’s commander, Roberto Cabral, laughed when I asked him recently how his assemblage of Special Ops nerds came together. “In the universe of illegal activities in Amazonia, there’s deforestation, gold prospecting, bush meat hunting, clandestine logging and animal smuggling,” said Mr. Cabral, 48, who was shot in the shoulder in 2015 while pursuing gunmen who were razing tracts of forest. “We wanted to combat these dealings with brains as well as boots on the ground.” "
1099,Devin Nunes to Step Aside From House Investigation on Russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/devin-nunes-house-intelligence-committee-russia.html?searchResultPosition=37,2017/04/06,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The continuing fallout from President Trump’s unsubstantiated wiretapping allegation cost him another ally on Thursday, as the embattled Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced he would step aside from his panel’s investigation into Russia’s efforts to disrupt last year’s election. The announcement from the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, came shortly before the House Committee on Ethics said he was under investigation because of public reports that he “may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information.” Mr. Nunes’s recusal from the Russia inquiry was a blow to Mr. Trump, who in less than three months in office has seen the imbroglio over Russia’s disruption campaign exact political damage on some of his closest advisers and most vigorous supporters. The furor over the contacts that some of the president’s aides had with Russian officials has already led to the firing of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, and the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from overseeing the F.B.I.’s inquiry into the Russian efforts. Now it has led to the recusal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation, and Mr. Trump faces the potential revival of that inquiry. The investigation had descended into a partisan sideshow in the two weeks since Mr. Nunes told reporters that Trump associates had been swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies during the transition, citing intelligence reports that were classified. He then rushed to the White House to brief Mr. Trump, prompting Democrats to argue that Mr. Nunes had proved himself far too close to the president to run an independent investigation. The criticism intensified last week when The New York Times revealed that the classified information about incidental surveillance cited by Mr. Nunes came from White House officials. White House officials had been seeking evidence to bolster a claim that Mr. Trump made March 4 on Twitter that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. Numerous current and former American officials — including James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director — have debunked the claim. "
1100,Trump’s Shift on Russia Brings Geopolitical Whiplash,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/world/europe/russia-putin-trump.html?searchResultPosition=97,2017/04/11,EUROPE,"WASHINGTON — A week ago, President Trump was accused of being a tool for the Russians, an unwitting agent of influence, so full of admiration that he defended President Vladimir V. Putin against critics who called him a killer. Now, Mr. Trump is in a diplomatic clash with Mr. Putin’s Russia, his administration accusing Moscow of trying to cover up a Syrian chemical weapons attack on civilians and his secretary of state delivering us-or-them ultimatums. Even in a presidency marked by unpredictability, the head-spinning shift from coziness to confrontation has left Washington and other capitals with a case of geopolitical whiplash. The prospects of improving Russian-American relations were already slim given the atmosphere of suspicion stemming from Kremlin meddling in last year’s election, but the détente once envisioned by Mr. Trump has instead deteriorated into the latest cold war. For Mr. Trump’s camp, the abrupt turnaround simply proved how false the conspiracy narrative was from the start. “If there was anything that Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie,” said Eric Trump, the president’s son. For some critics, it seemed to be a cynical way of distracting attention from the multiple investigations into possible contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russia even as Moscow was trying to help Mr. Trump win the presidency. Either way, it suggested that the relationship between the two powers could be volatile in the months to come, subject to the impulsive reactions of a president with no prior experience in foreign policy, the often strident responses of a Russian leader given to his own moments of pique and the clashing national interests of both countries in key areas around the world.

1101,Executive Who Steered Uber Through Scandals Joins Exodus,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/technology/ubers-head-of-policy-and-communications-joins-executive-exodus.html?searchResultPosition=98,2017/04/11,TECHNOLOGY,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber has lost a string of top managers in recent months as the ride-hailing company has dealt with scandals over its workplace culture and its executives’ behavior. That exodus is continuing with the exit of Rachel Whetstone, the company’s head of policy and communications. In an internal email to employees on Tuesday, Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, said Ms. Whetstone was leaving amicably and of her own volition. “Since joining in 2015, Rachel has blown us all away with her ability to get stuff done,” Mr. Kalanick wrote. In a statement, Ms. Whetstone said, “I joined Uber because I love the product — and that love is as strong today as it was when I booked my very first ride six years ago.” But internally, Mr. Kalanick and Ms. Whetstone had a complicated relationship, according to three current and former employees who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel matters. Mr. Kalanick and Ms. Whetstone are intense personalities and occasionally clashed over how to handle external communications, especially in times of crisis, these people said. Over the past few months, Ms. Whetstone has steered Uber through several firestorms. A grass-roots campaign urged people to delete the Uber app after the company was erroneously perceived to have capitalized on President Trump’s executive order to bar immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries. In addition, a former employee, in a public blog post, detailed a history of harassment at the hands of an Uber manager, prompting an internal investigation and questions over the company’s culture. Apart from Ms. Whetstone, other Uber executives have recently quit. Last month, Jeff Jones, a former Target executive, left Uber because of what he characterized as disagreements with leadership. Brian McClendon, a top engineering executive working on Uber’s mapping initiatives, also departed the company to return to his home state, Kansas, where he plans to explore politics. Ed Baker, from Uber’s growth and product team, exited in February, and Amit Singhal, a top engineering executive said to have failed to disclose a sexual harassment complaint against him at his former workplace, was asked to resign late that month. Ms. Whetstone, who led communications at Google for a decade before joining Uber in 2015, has not detailed her next move. In an email to colleagues, she said she was looking forward to time off with her family. Recode, a technology news site, earlier reported Ms. Whetstone’s departure. Jill Hazelbaker, a former political operative for Senator John McCain and a longtime colleague of Ms. Whetstone’s at Google and Uber, will step into Ms. Whetstone’s global public policy and communications role. Ms. Hazelbaker joined Uber in 2015 from Snapchat. “I am incredibly proud of the team that we’ve built — and that just as when I left Google, a strong and brilliant woman will be taking my place,” Ms. Whetstone said in a statement.

He defeated James Thompson, the Democratic candidate, in the first national test of the Republican Party’s electoral strength, in a contest that saw a late infusion of national support from Republicans nervous about the tumultuous political environment during President Trump’s initial months in office. Mr. Estes, 60, the state treasurer, overcame the challenge by Mr. Thompson, a Wichita civil rights lawyer, and won by a count of 53 percent of the vote to 46 percent, according to unofficial results, to fill the seat in the district that was vacated by Mike Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director. In a race more than a year before the midterm elections, Mr. Estes was initially expected to cruise to victory in a district that his party has held for more than two decades and that Mr. Trump won by 27 points. But after internal Republican polling last week revealed Mr. Estes’s lead was in only the single digits, the national party scrambled to rescue his campaign — and effectively conceded that even seats in the reddest corners of the United States are not safe at a time when Democrats are so energized against Mr. Trump. In his victory speech late Tuesday, Mr. Estes took aim at those who thought he might lose. “The pundits were talking about — this wasn’t a seat we were going to win,” Mr. Estes said before several hundred people in a hotel ballroom, “that we were going to lose a Republican seat, that it was a special election, that it was a chance for the Democrats, they were motivated, there was a lot of angst against the president. But we really showed the pundits tonight, didn’t we?” “We’re going to continue that process that started in November and make the changes in Washington,” he added. Mr. Estes said he hoped his victory would set the tone for the other special elections to replace members of Congress who took jobs with the Trump administration. But many officials in his party, who were up anxiously watching the returns late into the night on Tuesday, hope to avoid any more surprisingly stress-inducing races. "
1103,Trump Faces the Limits of American Power,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/world/middleeast/trump-syria-nigeria.html?searchResultPosition=100,2017/04/11,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, inspired by TV images of faraway suffering to launch missile strikes against Syria, may be about to discover a lesson that has confounded presidents for 25 years: American power can only do so much. That truth is also embedded in another set of disturbing images that Mr. Trump has not cited publicly: those from Nigeria’s conflict-torn northeast, where a very different crisis is drawing different American action toward different ends. Those two conflicts, in both their contrasts and commonalities, reveal something of the role that Mr. Trump has taken on and its limitation. Both are humanitarian disasters whose ground-level stories horrify and enrage. And they are both crises of a sort that the United States, since emerging from the Cold War as the world’s policeman, has repeatedly tried but often failed to resolve. The range of American intervention efforts, as well as their often modest success, can be seen in those two crises that Mr. Trump inherited: Syria, whose civil war has become a global issue, and Nigeria, where fighting with Boko Haram rebels has killed tens of thousands and displaced an estimated three million people. The two wars could hardly be more different, as are the American responses. Yet they may still share the fundamental dynamics that make conflict-driven crises so resistant to outside resolution. "

The pending move is the third time in three years that the United States has moved toward selling the Super Tucano attack planes, a transaction that would require congressional approval. The Obama administration stopped one proposed sale on Jan. 17 just as it was about to be sent to Congress for approval, after a Nigerian fighter jet searching for Boko Haram members accidentally bombed a camp for displaced people, killing dozens of people and wounding more. But in a telephone conversation with President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria on Feb. 15, President Trump indicated that he would take another look at the proposed sale, administration officials said. “President Trump expressed support for the sale of aircraft from the United States to support Nigeria’s fight against Boko Haram,” the White House said in a statement after the call. Several officials from the State Department, the Pentagon and the White House said that the sale of the attack airplanes, valued at $600 million, would help the Nigerian Air Force battle the militant extremist group Boko Haram. The Super Tucano, a propeller-driven plane that is capable of reconnaissance and surveillance missions as well as attacks, is produced in part in Florida by Embraer of Brazil and the Sierra Nevada Corporation, a company in the United States. The potential for sales of American-made aircraft also played a part in Mr. Trump’s decision to move on the deal, one administration official said on Tuesday. "
1106,"Trump’s Directive Will Lift Hiring Freeze, as It Asks Agencies for Cuts",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/us/politics/trumps-directive-will-lift-hiring-freeze-as-it-asks-agencies-for-cuts.html?searchResultPosition=95,2017/04/11,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday will lift the hiring freeze that it had imposed on the federal work force, even as it directs agencies to submit plans for personnel cuts and other restructuring moves to fit the budget blueprint released by President Trump last month. The new guidance, to be issued by the Office of Management and Budget, is the next step in fulfilling Mr. Trump’s ambition to reshape the federal bureaucracy into a lean, businesslike operation. It comes as many federal workers across Washington have feared that their jobs will be eliminated by the spending cuts that Mr. Trump has demanded. “This is a big part of draining the swamp,” Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said at a briefing on Tuesday afternoon. “This is a centerpiece to his campaign.” In January, Mr. Trump ordered an across-the-board employment freeze for the federal government, halting hiring for all new and existing positions except those in national security, public safety and the military. The administration is now making clear that it is not giving a green light for agencies to start hiring; instead, the White House is seeking long-term plans from each agency to, in most cases, prepare for cuts. The 2018 budget outline that Mr. Trump released last month called for a 10 percent increase in military spending to be paid for with deep cuts to the budgets of the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, Health and Human Services and other domestic programs. The guidance that will be issued on Wednesday asks agencies to begin taking immediate steps to achieve the reductions to their work forces. Agencies will also be required to develop plans by June 30 to “maximize employee performance.” By mid-September, they must come back to the administration with longer-term plans. "

Trump’s application to register trademarks for his brand of home accessories languished in a government office in Lima, Peru. But since Mr. Trump was elected in November, the pace has picked up. A six-month-old request to register his brand of sheets, duvets, towels and other goods, now selling briskly at a home goods store in Lima, overcame a crucial hurdle in late December. So did a second application to protect Mr. Trump’s brand of flatware that was filed after the election. Peruvian officials say they are treating Mr. Trump’s trademark applications like anyone else’s and are acting on them now simply because his business representatives have answered outstanding questions. They insist that Peru’s president, who met Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in late February, has no influence over their decisions. But to a team of constitutional lawyers and ethics lawyers, the pending Peruvian petitions are emblematic of the legal and moral perils in Mr. Trump’s continued ownership of his business empire. In a federal lawsuit that has set up a high-stakes legal battle with the Trump administration, they argue that the Constitution prohibits the president from accepting any economic benefit, including trademark approvals, from foreign governments. A review of 10 trademark databases shows that Mr. Trump’s enterprise, now run by his two adult sons, has 157 trademark applications pending in 36 countries. Registered trademarks are valuable financial assets, especially for a business like Mr. Trump’s, which is increasingly focused on marketing his name, not building hotels. When the Chinese granted Mr. Trump preliminary approval of 38 trademarks of his name, not long after he was sworn into office, “it was a gift,” said Peter J. Riebling, a trademark lawyer in Washington. “Getting the exclusive right to use that brand in China against everyone else in the world? It’s like waving a magic wand.” "

The audience at the event, held at Aiken Technical College in Graniteville, S.C., near the state’s western border, was antagonistic from the start, booing audibly as he stepped to the lectern. But the conflict between Mr. Wilson and the crowd came to a head toward the end of the 40-minute question-and-answer period, when he responded to a question about Mr. Obama’s health care law. After he said the law was delaying and denying health services to its intended recipients, the rest of his comments were drowned out, as the crowd began to chant “you lie” in unison. The cheer continued for about 20 seconds. A video of the event was posted on Facebook Live. Leacy Burke, a spokeswoman for Mr. Wilson, 69, said in an email on Tuesday that the chant stood as “less than a minute of a positive event that lasted nearly two hours where the congressman engaged with his constituents both in a town hall format and one on one after the official program ended.” But the chant was just one of many difficult stretches in what overall looked to be a tough evening for Mr. Wilson, appearing in a county that President Trump won handily in November.

High school students with a solar-powered car. Two older women with concerns about parking. A man seeking city contracts for his business cleaning up abandoned homes. For Mr. de Blasio, the interactions were a chance to engage in the sort of one-on-one retail politics that he often shies away from, instead preferring to communicate with constituents at more of a distance, through large-scale town-hall meetings or weekly call-in radio appearances. He pulled in commissioners to join the conversations and stood flanked by half a dozen aides and security officers, sometimes more, nodding along with each anecdote. The gambit seemed to pay off for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who will be seeking re-election in November and is broadly disliked on Staten Island: There appeared to be no encounters with virulent opponents or testy exchanges with residents, even though the borough largely rejected his candidacy in 2013 and voted heavily for President Trump, a Republican. “I think it was really good; he’s a nice guy,” said Angelo Cardinale, a 17-year-old high school senior and driver of the solar-powered car that he and his club of tech-savvy teenagers parked in front of Borough Hall. The conversations — 26 in all, the mayor’s office said — came on Day 2 of what is to be a week of events on Staten Island. Mr. de Blasio and much of his staff moved their base of operations to the borough on Monday, and he plans to have similar weeklong stays in New York’s other boroughs before the end of the year. "

Officials released a declassified report that details the American intelligence on the attack, asserting that the Syrian government was responsible and accusing Russia of using disinformation to obscure the facts. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson struck a harsh tone at a Group of 7 meeting in Italy, saying that President Bashar al-Assad’s reign was “coming to an end.” Now he’s in Moscow, above, for what will be a closely watched meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov. The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, caused outrage when he contrasted Mr. Assad with Hitler and said incorrectly that Hitler didn’t use chemical weapons. Our podcast “The Daily” explores how Mr. Assad went from mild-mannered ophthalmology student to brutal ruler. "

Crime and Punishment in Black America
By James Forman Jr.
Illustrated. 306 pages. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. $27. James Forman Jr. divides his superb and shattering first book, “Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,” into two parts: “Origins” and “Consequences.” But the temptation is to scribble in, before “Consequences,” a modifier: “Unforeseen.” That is truly what this book is about, and what makes it tragic to the bone: How people, acting with the finest of intentions and the largest of hearts, could create a problem even more grievous than the one they were trying to solve. Forman opens with a story from 1995, when, as a public defender in Washington, he unsuccessfully tried to keep a 15-year-old out of a juvenile detention center with a grim reputation. Looking around the courtroom, he realized that everyone associated with the case was African-American: the judge, the prosecutor, the bailiff. The arresting officer was black, as was the city’s police chief, its mayor and the majority of the city council that had written the stringent gun and drug laws his client had violated. “What was going on?” Forman asks. “How did a majority-black jurisdiction end up incarcerating so many of its own?” This is the exceptionally delicate question that he tries to answer, with exemplary nuance, over the course of his book. His approach is compassionate. Seldom does he reprimand the actors in this story for the choices they made. "

Despite the surge in searches — nearly 15,000 from October to March, compared with 8,383 in the same period in 2015 and ’16 — agency officials said the latest numbers represent less than one percent of the 189.6 million travelers that arrived in the United States in that period. “These searches, which affect fewer than one-hundredth of one percent of international travelers, have contributed to national security investigations, arrests for child pornography and evidence of human trafficking,” said John P. Wagner, a deputy assistant commissioner at Customs and Border Protection. Privacy activists say the searches are invasive and violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. But courts have long held that those protections do not apply at the border and at airports because of the government’s compelling interest in combating crime and terrorism. A 2014 Supreme Court ruling did say, however, that law enforcement needed to have a warrant to search electronic devices when a person was being arrested. "

But over the years, it has become something to dread. You wait in endless lines for the chance to be poked, patted, X-rayed, interrogated, generally insulted and, in the final indignity, separated by class as you, at last, board. And it can get worse from there. On Sunday security officials at Chicago’s O’Hare airport literally yanked a passenger off a United flight because the airline needed seats for its staff. That fiasco was captured on videos that set the internet ablaze with outrage, and could end up costing the airline future business. Clueless United dug itself in deeper after the story blew up. Its chief executive, Oscar Munoz, apologized on Monday for having to “re-accommodate these customers” but not for the manhandling of the passenger, a doctor who was bleeding from the mouth in the videos. Mr. Munoz made matters even worse by calling the doctor “disruptive and belligerent” because he had the temerity to object to his removal. Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Munoz saw the light (and the drop in his company’s stock price) and said “no one should ever be mistreated this way.” United’s mistreatment of the doctor was extreme, but inconveniencing customers is now standard airline operating procedure. This is an oligopolistic industry that has become increasingly callous toward customers as it rakes in billions in profits thanks to strong demand and low oil prices. In recent years, big airlines have squeezed seats in coach closer together, forcing average-size Americans to become intimately familiar with their knees. In addition to checked-bag fees, which have been standard on many airlines for years, more passengers are being required to pay extra for early boarding, more legroom and, in a recent insult, the right to stash bags in overhead bins. There is no mystery why air travel has gotten so ugly. Four large airlines — American, Southwest, Delta and United — commanded nearly 69 percent of the domestic air-travel market in 2016, up from about 60 percent in 2012, according to government data. Those numbers actually overstate how much competition there is. Many people have only one or two options when they fly because the big airlines have established virtual fortresses at their hub airports. United, American Airlines and three regional airlines affiliated with them served nearly 80 percent of passengers at O’Hare last year. Disgruntled travelers may howl on Twitter or send furious emails, but airline executives know their bottom lines are for the moment secure. It was not surprising that none of the Big Four made a list of the 10 best airlines in the world that TripAdvisor published on Monday based on passenger reviews. Two smaller companies did — JetBlue (No. 4) and Alaska Airlines (No. 9). "

Mr. Estes fills the seat vacated by Mike Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director. ■ Elected state treasurer in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, Mr. Estes oversaw more than $24 billion in public funds, according to his campaign website, which also says that he came in under budget by over $600,000 during his tenure. ■ Mr. Estes, 60, has degrees in civil engineering and business administration and has worked with the aerospace, fossil fuel and information system industries. A fifth-generation Kansan, he spends his weekdays on a family farm in Osage County and his weekends at a house in Wichita. ■ The Wichita Eagle’s editorial board endorsed Mr. Estes, calling him “low key and affable” and noting that he supports a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution; a reduction in corporate and some personal income taxes; and a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, policies the board said aligned “with the values and priorities of many district residents.” ■ During the campaign, Mr. Thompson, a civil rights lawyer, repeatedly tried to tie Mr. Estes to the state’s unpopular Republican governor, Sam Brownback. “Ron Estes is nothing but a Brownback yes-man,” Mr. Thompson wrote on his campaign website. “Gov. Brownback cut our schools, raised taxes on the working class and tanked Kansas’ economy.” ■ Mr. Estes’s victory was aided by a last-minute influx of support from Republicans on the national level, something his Democratic challenger criticized after losing the election. “I’m probably not supposed to say this, but Mr. Estes did not beat us,” Mr. Thompson said. “It took a president of the United States, the vice president, the speaker of the House, a senator coming into our state and a bunch of lies to try to drum up a vote.” "
1117,Does Egypt’s President Really Want to Fight Terrorism?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/opinion/does-egypts-president-really-want-to-fight-terrorism.html?searchResultPosition=76,2017/04/12,OPINION,"The Islamic State’s affiliate in Egypt is on the march. On Palm Sunday, a pair of bombs killed 45 people at church. This was the third major attack on Coptic churches in less than four months — and the first such attack recently in major Egyptian cities, which many people believed were more secure. These attacks follow after months of terrorism, and they could have been predicted: Just two months ago, the Sinai-based Islamic State affiliate issued a video promising that the group would target Copts in Egypt’s mainland. These attacks demonstrate that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s counterterrorism strategy is failing. Mr. Sisi claims that he is committed to fighting terrorism, but in reality his energy is directed toward his other enemies: secular activists, journalists, independent members of Parliament, businessmen and academics who oppose him, human rights organizations and peaceful dissident Islamist groups. In response to Sunday’s bombings, Mr. Sisi declared a three-month-long state of emergency. North Sinai province has been under emergency law since October 2014. But the deterioration in the security situation there over the past year is a reminder of how such policies fail. The fact of the matter is that the national emergency law will do little beyond giving legal cover to the brutal practices that have already been enforced for the past few years in flagrant violation of Egypt’s Constitution. (After all, Mr. Sisi has previously stated that the Constitution was written with “naïve intentions.”) North Sinai looks increasingly like Mosul, which until recently was the Islamic State’s de facto capital in Iraq. Earlier this year, Egyptian news media was full of images of desperate Christians being forced from their homes in Sinai by Islamic State militants in a scene reminiscent of the jihadist group’s takeover of Mosul in 2014. In al-Arish, North Sinai’s capital, the Islamic State has reportedly set up checkpoints to force female public servants to adhere to a strict Islamic dress code. Young men have reportedly been flogged in public squares for the “crime” of selling cigarettes. The situation has deteriorated precipitously. Bombings and assassinations of security forces in Sinai are now a regular occurrence. The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy found that the number of attacks in North Sinai has jumped from 143 in 2014 to 681 in 2016. And just as Mosul was a center for orchestrating suicide bombings in Baghdad, Sinai is now a potential hub for such attacks in mainland Egypt. Shortly after Mr. Sisi took control of Egypt in a coup in July 2013, he called on Egyptians to take to the streets to give him a mandate to fight terrorism. People complied, even though terrorist attacks at the time were limited and mostly directed against military targets in Sinai near the border with Gaza. However, Mr. Sisi capitalized on this popular support to push for his real agenda and move against young secular activists, peaceful Islamist dissidents and human rights organizations. "
1118,Special Ed School Vouchers and the Burden of a ‘Simple Fix’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/insider/hidden-costs-of-school-voucher-specialed-mckay.html?searchResultPosition=75,2017/04/12,TIMES INSIDER,"Two weeks after President Trump’s inauguration, I joined The Times as a national education reporter. Mr. Trump’s administration did not waste any time before rolling out a proposal to expand access to private school vouchers, so I began researching them right away. The number of students using public dollars to attend private schools has more than doubled over the past decade, costing taxpayers some $2 billion annually. What I learned was that a lot of this growth is driven by new school choice programs that target disabled students. The largest is the John M. McKay voucher program in Florida, which serves more than 30,000 students and is the subject of my recent article. I also learned that private schools are not obligated under voucher laws in Florida and many other states to provide students with the full range of disability services that public schools are required to provide. I reached out to disability-rights organizations, which connected me with lawyers on the ground in Florida who specialize in representing children with special needs. I ended up speaking to more parents — always mothers, and usually mothers of sons on the autism spectrum — than I could include in the piece. Our conversations often lasted an hour or more; it felt as if these women were bursting to talk about the many challenges they’d had fighting on behalf of their children. But I had to tread carefully. In fact, the sensitivity of the reporting reminded me of work I had done in the past on adolescents caught up in the juvenile justice system: Parents asked for their children’s names not to appear, worrying that colleges or employers would judge them for common childhood behavioral issues. Still, the women wanted me to understand their children’s promise: Sure, he’d had behavioral meltdowns, but he was also reading ahead of grade level. And yes, he’d been suspended, but his teachers praised him, and he’d made lots of new friends. Although my piece was about private school vouchers, I found that many parents of students with disabilities choose vouchers only after having a deeply disappointing experience in the public education system. One mother told me about the day her autistic son came home with bruises after being physically restrained by staff. Several said their sons with behavioral challenges but typical intellectual abilities had been segregated, in classrooms away from the general-education population. "
1119,U.S. Takes Sharper Tone on Russia’s Role in Syria,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/world/europe/trump-nato-russia.html?searchResultPosition=74,2017/04/12,EUROPE,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson sought on Wednesday to isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for backing the Syrian government in the wake of its lethal chemical weapons attack on civilians, and worked to build international pressure on Moscow to change course. In Washington, Moscow and New York, the Trump administration publicly chastised Mr. Putin but privately worked to hash out increasingly bitter differences with him. At the same time, Mr. Trump embraced NATO — a military alliance he had previously derided as obsolete — as an effective and vital force for peace and security in a region where Russia has been an aggressive actor. During his presidential campaign, and in his early days in office, Mr. Trump’s approach to foreign policy included speaking warmly of Mr. Putin and the prospects of a United States alliance with Russia. He had also questioned the usefulness of NATO, and the concept of an alliance for common defense to counterbalance Moscow’s belligerence. In an interview that aired on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Putin was partly to blame for the conflict in Syria and denounced him for backing President Bashar al-Assad, whom he called an “animal.” Later at the White House, Mr. Trump said that Russia had likely known in advance of the Syrian government’s plan to unleash a nerve agent against its own people, and asserted that the United States’ relations with Moscow were at an “all-time low.” In Moscow, Mr. Tillerson came away from a two-hour meeting with Mr. Putin — the first such face-to-face session of the Trump administration — without reaching agreement on facts involving the chemical weapons assault in Syria or Russian interference in the American election. And sharply diverging from the meeting of the minds between the United States and Russia that Mr. Trump frequently aspired to when he was campaigning, there was no visible warming of the relationship. “There is a low level of trust between our countries,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov. “The world’s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship.” "

One day after he delivered a stunner of a gaffe from the White House lectern — favorably comparing Hitler to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, then clumsily referring to Nazi death camps as “Holocaust centers” — Mr. Spicer gave an abject apology on Wednesday, saying, “It really is painful to myself to know that I did something like that.” “I made a mistake; there’s no other way to say it,” Mr. Spicer said, his face taut, during a scheduled interview in Washington. “I got into a topic that I shouldn’t have, and I screwed up.” Facing a national outcry that included calls for his resignation, Mr. Spicer offered no excuses, describing his remarks as “inexcusable and reprehensible” and acknowledging that the timing — during Passover and the Christian Holy Week — “compounds that kind of mistake.” “On both a personal and professional level, yesterday was not a very good day in my history,” he told the MSNBC anchor Greta Van Susteren. His appearance, at a forum sponsored by the Newseum, was broadcast live by CNN and MSNBC, just one sign of the intense interest in the press secretary’s remarks. "

In his first weeks on the job, Mr. Pruitt drew glowing praise from foes of Mr. Obama’s agenda against global warming, as he moved to roll back its centerpiece, known as the Clean Power Plan, and expressed agreement with those who said the E.P.A. should be eliminated. His actions and statements have galvanized protests from environmentalists and others on the left. But now a growing chorus of critics on the other end of the political spectrum say Mr. Pruitt has not gone far enough. In particular, they are angry that he has refused to challenge a landmark agency determination known as the endangerment finding, which provides the legal basis for Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan and other global warming policies. These critics say that Mr. Pruitt is hacking only at the branches of current climate policy. They want him to pull it out by the roots. “The endangerment finding must be redone, or all of this is for naught,” said Steven J. Milloy, who runs a website, JunkScience.com, aimed at debunking the established science of human-caused climate change, and who worked on the Trump administration’s E.P.A. transition team. "

While the next nationwide elections are not until 2018, Republicans have grown fearful that these voters are recoiling from what they see as lamentable conditions in Washington: a government entirely in Republican hands that has failed to deliver on fundamental goals like overhauling the health care system. Early missteps by President Trump and congressional leaders have weighed heavily on voters from the party’s more affluent wing, anchored in right-of-center suburbs around major cities in the South and Midwest. Never beloved in these precincts, Mr. Trump appears to be struggling to maintain support from certain voters who backed him last year mainly as a way of defeating Hillary Clinton. Interviews with Republican-leaning voters in four suburban districts — in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and New Jersey — revealed a sour outlook on the party. These voters, mainly white professionals, say they expected far more in the way of results by now, given the Republican grip on power in the capital. In opinion polls, they consistently give Mr. Trump mediocre approval ratings, even as he remains solidly popular with lower-income whites. In the past, first-term presidents have suffered grievous losses in midterm elections, when their party’s voters have stayed home while the opposition party has marched to the barricades. Former President Barack Obama saw Democrats lose 63 House seats in 2010 after Republicans and disaffected independents stampeded to the polls and grumbling Democrats did not. It is too early to say if the same dynamic is afflicting Mr. Trump. But already, Republicans have strained to prop up their candidates in a pair of special House elections in the areas around Atlanta and Wichita, Kan., both in districts that have voted overwhelmingly Republican in past congressional races.

So when it came to light last week that the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had ordered the United States Marshals Service to extend a full protective detail to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, for as much as $1 million a month, many people began to wonder about the protective pecking order in the Trump era. The answer, given the nature of the job, is difficult to know. Security forces are loath to discuss much about who they protect or what it costs, for fear, they say, of compromising their mission. But when the billionaire Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the commerce secretary, goes to dinner at a fancy Georgetown restaurant, bodyguards sit nearby. When members of Congress practice in the early mornings in an Alexandria, Va., public park for their Congressional Baseball Game, plainclothes United States Capitol Police are sitting there in a black S.U.V. The secretary of the Interior Department, who rode a horse to his first day at work, turns to the United States Park Police, better known for patrolling the nation’s national parks, often on horseback. Protecting top government officials, from the president to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, involves a patchwork of more than a dozen federal agencies and offices. It may be easier to ask who in Washington does not have a protective detail. But it is possible, based on public records, news accounts and interviews with security officials, to sketch the rough outlines. "

Responding to last week’s chemical attack in Syria and his subsequent strike on a Syrian air base, Mr. Trump characterized President Bashar al-Assad as “evil” in an interview with Fox Business Network that aired early Wednesday morning. He also again faulted President Barack Obama for not intervening in the Syrian conflict more aggressively. The comments contradicted Mr. Trump’s earlier, more dismissive attitude on chemical weapons. “Saddam Hussein throws a little gas, everyone goes crazy, ‘Oh, he’s using gas!’ ” he said at a July 2016 campaign rally. In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Trump repeatedly said that Mr. Obama should not attack Syria, and, after he was elected in November, he even questioned the incentive for intervening. FALSE.

And it is unclear how much longer he can survive in his job. His isolation inside the White House, after weeks of battle with senior aides aligned with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, appeared to grow even starker this week after Mr. Trump undercut Mr. Bannon in two interviews and played down his role in the Trump presidential campaign. “I am my own strategist,” Mr. Trump told the New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin in an interview on Tuesday, a pointed reference to what aides described as his growing irritation that Mr. Bannon’s allies are calling him the mastermind behind Mr. Trump’s victory and the torch bearer for the nationalist, conservative brand of populism that has defined his presidency. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Mr. Trump made clear Mr. Bannon’s subordinate role, calling him “a guy who works for me.” Amid the clashing egos, news media leaks and insinuations of disloyalty, the president was once again faced with having to defuse a personnel crisis that was, in part, a result of assembling a band of Washington outsiders to run his administration. And this time the crisis erupted, perhaps predictably, around the senior aide who most embodies that renegade, anti-establishment ethos: Mr. Bannon, the self-proclaimed deconstructor of the “administrative state” and field general in the war against the “opposition party” news media.

Susan Rice, former national security adviser for President Obama, announces that Syria gave up all its chemical weapons a few months before Bashar al-Assad’s regime kills scores of men, women and children with sarin gas, and people start questioning her veracity. Wells Fargo commits an enormous fraud, creating as many as two million unwanted accounts, and people want more of the company’s executives to be disciplined. Wasn’t it enough that Wells Fargo fired more than 5,000 of the low-level people who had been pushed to commit fraud by the company’s culture of pressure and ethical laxness? And poor Sean Spicer. O.K., so he denied a minor historical detail like the gassing of millions of Jews by the Nazis. It’s not like anyone else in the Trump administration has ever seemed oblivious to history, lied, insulted religious, ethnic or racial minorities or ignored the Holocaust before. Actually, all of these cases are part of a pattern. United, like the other increasingly monopolistic airlines, routinely overbooks flights, treats its passengers with contempt and inconveniences them unnecessarily. Wells Fargo is just another huge bank that has ripped off its ordinary customers and skirted or broken the law for decades, largely with impunity. Rice has a habit of repeating spin that turns out to be wrong (as on Benghazi) and Americans have heard false accounts about weapons of mass destruction before (although in President George W. Bush’s case, the weapons didn’t exist). "
1132,Tillerson and Putin Find Little More Than Disagreement in Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/world/europe/tillerson-putin-lavrov-russia-syria.html?searchResultPosition=80,2017/04/12,EUROPE,"MOSCOW — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for nearly two hours Wednesday, but the two men appeared unable to agree on the facts involving the deadly chemical weapons assault on Syrian civilians or Russian interference in the American election — much less move toward an improvement in basic relations. “There is a low level of trust between our countries,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, after the first face-to-face meetings between Russian leaders and a top emissary of the Trump administration. “The world’s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship,” Mr. Tillerson said. Both he and Mr. Lavrov said a range of issues were discussed — most notably the crises in Syria, North Korea and Ukraine — and that both sides had agreed to establish a working group to examine, as Mr. Lavrov said, “the irritants” in relations between the United States and Russia. Mr. Tillerson reiterated the American view that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia’s chief Middle East ally, was responsible for the chemical weapons assault in northern Syria on April 4 that left more than 80 people dead, sickened hundreds and outraged the world. Mr. Lavrov reiterated the Russian view that the facts about the chemical weapons attack had yet to be determined, and denounced what he described as the “media hysteria” surrounding the assault. "
1133,Uproar Over United Shows the Value of an Apology,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/business/dealbook/uproar-over-united-shows-the-value-of-an-apology.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/04/12,DEALBOOK,"When the world’s most powerful chief executive is renowned for never apologizing, it takes a special form of incompetence to be upstaged in the contrition department by President Trump’s White House. Somehow, against extraordinary odds, United Continental Holdings — an airline reliant on customer loyalty — managed this dunderheaded achievement. It took Oscar Munoz, the chief executive of the $22 billion company, more than a day, and the incineration of up to half a billion dollars of investor wealth, before he finally found the right words to respond to his company’s latest mistake. He revealed that the company enlisted airport security officers to forcibly remove a passenger from one of its planes after selling too many seats on the flight. Even the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, managed to apologize with greater finesse. In a press briefing on Tuesday he appeared to minimize the horrors of the Holocaust. From this, and United’s episode, there is a lesson to be gleaned by all businesses. The value of the humble apology is incalculable. Say sorry first, ask questions later. United is not the first enterprise to flub in penitence. Nor will it be the last. Recent corporate history is chockablock with attempts to regain the favor of customers. Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, was “deeply sorry” for the suffering that resulted from the car company’s ignition-switch fiasco. It helped that G.M. followed up by paying out $600 million to victims. Last month, Travis Kalanick, an Uber founder, expressed remorse for berating one of his drivers in a petulant exchange that, like tossing the United passenger from the plane, surfaced in a video that went viral. Mr. Kalanick even acknowledged with psychoanalytical flair that he needed help “and I intend to get it.” Mr. Munoz needed multiple attempts to make things right. He first stated that Sunday’s episode was “an upsetting event to all of us here at United.” That’s reminiscent of the sullen apology of Tony Hayward, then the BP chief executive, for the oil firm’s 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill in which he whined that he “would like his life back.” A subsequent message to United staff members seemed to suggest the passenger was at fault. By Wednesday morning, in an interview with ABC, Munoz managed to strike the right, penitential tone. An hour later, United stock regained half of its previous day’s losses. Having to say sorry isn’t hard. It should just come a lot more naturally in the executive suite. "

Here’s what you need to know: • The White House accused Russia of engaging in a cover-up of the Syrian government’s role in last week’s chemical weapons attack. Moscow emphatically denied the claim. The U.S. also said that it had confirmed that the government of Bashar al-Assad had used sarin gas in the attack. Today, the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on whether to condemn the assault. Rex Tillerson, the U.S. secretary of state, is facing an icy day of talks in Moscow, after calling on the Kremlin to drop its support of Mr. Assad. “The Daily” podcast explores how Mr. Assad went from mild-mannered ophthalmology student to brutal ruler. One remark by Mr. Tillerson at his talks in Italy with G-7 foreign ministers might have been more to Moscow’s liking: Why should U.S. taxpayers care about Ukraine, he was said to have asked his counterparts.

It’s Still a Loss for the G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/upshot/a-republican-wins-in-kansas-its-still-a-loss-of-sorts-for-the-gop.html?searchResultPosition=93,2017/04/12,THE UPSHOT,"This season’s special congressional elections are being heralded as a test of whether newly energized Democrats will fare better with an unpopular Republican president. So far, the Democrats are passing the test. On Tuesday, Republicans won an unexpectedly close race in Kansas’ Fourth Congressional District. The Republican Ron Estes won by seven points over James Thompson, even though President Trump won the district by 27 points in November. No Democrat holds a House seat as Republican as this one, so it’s startling that the seat was even competitive. In general, it’s a mistake to read too much into a single special election. They are more prone to odd results. That’s because there’s less time for recruitment, fund-raising or even opposition research. There isn’t a national campaign going on at the same time. The turnout is often low and variable. But the Kansas result is not a great sign for the Republicans, and it’s hard to dismiss. Ultimately, special elections are still elections. They reflect the national political environment in nearly the same way as regularly scheduled contests. There just happen to be a few more outlying results. In theory, if you had enough special elections you could make a pretty good inference about the national political environment. There aren’t usually enough of them in a cycle to make such a conclusion, though. Instead, every special election provides a small and imperfect bit of information about the overall national picture.

1136,Don’t Politicize the Federal Reserve,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/opinion/dont-politicize-the-federal-reserve.html?searchResultPosition=92,2017/04/12,OPINION,"I was in the room when President Bill Clinton decided to reappoint Alan Greenspan, a lifelong Republican originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. A political adviser urged Mr. Clinton to choose an administration ally, but that was never seriously considered. The president’s choice was not determined by party, or politics or ideology. That’s how it has been for decades: Federal Reserve chairmen and governors have been selected based on their ability to serve the country. President Barack Obama reappointed George W. Bush’s nominee, Ben Bernanke, as chairman. President Reagan reappointed Jimmy Carter’s nominee, Paul Volcker. The Federal Reserve System was created by statute in 1913, but the independence of its monetary policy from congressional or presidential influence is not codified by law — and it wasn’t always inviolable. In recent years, so-called reforms have been proposed to subject Fed monetary policy to congressional review, but its independence has so far been preserved. For good reason: An independent Federal Reserve led by governors who are committed to pursuing its dual mandate of price stability and full employment, as well as effective regulation — and who make decisions based on facts and analysis — is critically important to our economy, the well-being of the people and the market credibility of Fed policy making. But that independence is about to be severely tested. Daniel K. Tarullo stepped down from the Federal Reserve Board last week, adding to the board’s two existing vacancies. Instead of remaining as governors, Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman, could step down when their terms expire next year. President Trump has already said that he will not reappoint Ms. Yellen as chairwoman because she’s not a Republican. "
1137,David Souter Killed the Filibuster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/opinion/david-souter-killed-the-filibuster.html?searchResultPosition=91,2017/04/12,OPINION,"The death of the judicial filibuster last week was overshadowed by Syrian airstrikes and White House turmoil, but the moment’s significance was also diminished by its inevitability. Senators made pious noises and partisans bemoaned the state of the republic, but the widespread Washington wisdom was that this was a fait accompli: After decades of “Butter Battle Book”-style escalations in the judicial wars, a minority veto was simply too antiquated, anachronistic and pre-ideological to survive. Maybe it could have persisted had Senate Democrats played a longer game, but only temporarily; however the Senate voted on Neil Gorsuch, the same forces that doomed Robert Bork and Merrick Garland would have doomed the filibuster hereafter. Given where we are now, that Beltway wisdom was probably correct. Whether we had to end up here, though, is a harder question. It’s possible that structural forces — the ideological sorting of the parties, the decay of the republic toward an executive-judicial diarchy — were always going to push the filibuster to extinction, no matter whether Bork was Borked or Garland pocket-vetoed. But if agency and contingency have a role in history, there is a crucial turning point that deserves to be remembered: the strange nomination and career of David Hackett Souter. Under our system, control of the Supreme Court functions as a somewhat delayed reward for winning ideological battles at the presidential level, and then as a check on the next ideological coalition as it’s taking power. Thus judicial appointees of the pre-New Deal era restrained Roosevelt’s liberalism for a time, and the judicial appointees from liberalism’s New Deal-Great Society heyday continued to advance liberal causes even as the Democratic coalition fell apart. In a similar way, the many Republican appointees from the long Reagan era, 1980-2008, should have constrained liberalism in our own era even as the Reagan coalition cracked and aged and failed. And to some extent they have: In the last eight years the Roberts court reshaped Obamacare even if it didn’t kill it, limited some of the Obama administration’s power grabs and advanced certain conservative goals left over from the Reagan years (on campaign finance and gun rights, notably). But on issues of burning concern to the Republican Party’s base — abortion above all, and then the gay-rights revolution and religious liberty — the court forged by Reagan and the Bushes has often been an enemy, not an ally, either consolidating social-liberal gains or advancing liberal causes even further. True, Anthony Kennedy sided with religious conservatives in the Hobby Lobby decision and on partial-birth abortion. But on the biggest cases — Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Lawrence v. Texas, Obergefell v. Hodges — and quite a few smaller ones, the post-Reagan Supreme Court has been an agent of social liberalism notwithstanding its many Republican-appointed members. "
1138,Why Is Trump Fighting ISIS in Syria?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/opinion/why-is-trump-fighting-isis-in-syria.html?searchResultPosition=90,2017/04/12,OPINION,"The Trump foreign policy team has been all over the map on what to do next in Syria — topple the regime, intensify aid to rebels, respond to any new attacks on innocent civilians. But when pressed, there is one idea everyone on the team seems to agree on: “The defeat of ISIS,” as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson put it. Well, let me add to their confusion by asking just one question: Why? Why should our goal right now be to defeat the Islamic State in Syria? Of course, ISIS is detestable and needs to be eradicated. But is it really in our interest to be focusing solely on defeating ISIS in Syria right now? Let’s go through the logic: There are actually two ISIS manifestations. One is “virtual ISIS.” It is satanic, cruel and amorphous; it disseminates its ideology through the internet. It has adherents across Europe and the Muslim world. In my opinion, that ISIS is the primary threat to us, because it has found ways to deftly pump out Sunni jihadist ideology that inspires and gives permission to those Muslims on the fringes of society who feel humiliated — from London to Paris to Cairo — to recover their dignity via headline-grabbing murders of innocents. The other incarnation is “territorial ISIS.” It still controls pockets in western Iraq and larger sectors of Syria. Its goal is to defeat Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria — plus its Russian, Iranian and Hezbollah allies — and to defeat the pro-Iranian Shiite regime in Iraq, replacing both with a caliphate. Challenge No. 1: Not only will virtual ISIS, which has nodes all over the world, not go away even if territorial ISIS is defeated, I believe virtual ISIS will become yet more virulent to disguise the fact that it has lost the territorial caliphate to its archenemies: Shiite Iran, Hezbollah, pro-Shiite militias in Iraq, the pro-Shiite Assad regime in Damascus and Russia, not to mention America. Challenge No. 2: America’s goal in Syria is to create enough pressure on Assad, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah so they will negotiate a power-sharing accord with moderate Sunni Muslims that would also ease Assad out of power. One way to do that would be for NATO to create a no-fly safe zone around Idlib Province, where many of the anti-Assad rebels have gathered and where Assad recently dropped his poison gas on civilians. But Congress and the U.S. public are clearly wary of that. "

The phone call, reported by China’s state broadcaster, CCTV, came hours after Mr. Trump cautioned Beijing in a Twitter message and a television interview that it needed to help Washington rein in North Korea, a Chinese ally. During the call, which was initiated by Mr. Trump, Mr. Xi said that the matter should be solved through peaceful means, the state news agency Xinhua reported. Tensions escalated further on Wednesday as reports said the Japanese Navy would join the United States Navy strike group led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson in its mission off the Korean coast. Those joint exercises will take place as the American ships pass through waters close to Japan, Reuters said. The Carl Vinson and several other warships are heading toward the Korean Peninsula in a show of force intended to deter the North from testing a sixth nuclear weapon or launching missiles. North Korea celebrates the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder, on Saturday. Its current leader, Kim Jong-un, his grandson, is expected to use the occasion to either stage a nuclear weapons test or conduct a missile test, in direct defiance of the United States and China. American television networks and some newspapers have been invited to report on a military show in the North’s capital, Pyongyang, this weekend. "

1141,Choice of Pro-Immigration Economic Adviser Riles Trump’s Base,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/us/politics/choice-of-pro-immigration-economic-adviser-riles-trumps-base.html?searchResultPosition=87,2017/04/12,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The choice by President Trump of a pro-immigration economist to lead his Council of Economic Advisers is stirring a backlash among his most ardent supporters, who worry it is an abandonment of the tough stance he took on the issue during the campaign and the latest in a string of broken promises. Mr. Trump had already disappointed some of his base supporters by intervening in Syria with a military strike last week and by delaying a tough stance on trade with China and Mexico. He expressed the idea via Twitter on Tuesday morning that he would be willing to offer the Chinese government a more favorable trade deal if it helped the United States with North Korea. Now there is growing unease that immigration is the next area where he will go soft. To these supporters, the appointment of Kevin A. Hassett, announced late last Friday afternoon, as Mr. Trump’s top White House economist is another sign that the president is succumbing to the swamp he promised to drain. Like most economists, Mr. Hassett believes that immigration spurs economic growth. At times he has pilloried Republicans for becoming the “Party of White,” arguing in 2010 that Republicans like then-Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona “have too often appeared hostile to immigrants.” In 2013, Mr. Hassett said the United States should double its intake of immigrants. Mr. Hassett, who currently works at the American Enterprise Institute, is a widely respected conservative economist who previously advised prominent Republicans like Senator John McCain and Mitt Romney. But for those who backed Mr. Trump because of his promises to build a wall and deport illegal immigrants, such notions are heresy. "

Then came Campaign 2016, the Nov. 8 results and, finally, President Donald J. Trump. Suddenly, the writers who work on political television shows were competing less with one another and more with real life, because of a president who transformed their seemingly escapist scripts into something resembling nonfiction — and scrambled the traditional notions of political cause and effect that they tended to base their drama upon. (A leaked tape with lewd comments from a male candidate about grabbing a woman’s genitals? No problem!) The New York Times gathered some of the nation’s leading political dramatists for a cathartic group therapy session on the CBS Studio Center lot here last month. Gathered were Shonda Rhimes, creator of the ABC hit “Scandal,” whose stories seem to be the stuff of a political fever dream; Frank Pugliese and Melissa James Gibson, the showrunners of “House of Cards,” whose back-stabbing and bald aggression present a behind-the-curtain view of political machinations that would never take place out in the open; Barbara Hall, the creator of “Madam Secretary,” the more optimistic CBS drama, which was able to stay a step ahead of real life; and David Mandel, of “Veep,” which came up with such truly absurd scenarios that you couldn’t imagine them happening. These professionals had never met one another before. But as soon as they convened in a stark conference room here, right near where “Gilligan’s Island” was filmed, they immediately bonded over their shared situations. "
1143,Why Americans Vote ‘Against Their Interest’: Partisanship,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/upshot/why-americans-vote-against-their-interest-partisanship.html?searchResultPosition=85,2017/04/12,THE UPSHOT,"Working-class Americans who voted for Donald J. Trump continue to approve of him as president, even though he supported a health care bill that would disproportionately hurt them. Highly educated professionals tend to lean Democratic, even though Republican tax policies would probably leave more money in their pockets. Why do people vote against their economic interests? The answer, experts say, is partisanship. Party affiliation has become an all-encompassing identity that outweighs the details of specific policies. “Partisan identification is bigger than anything the party does,” said Frances Lee, a professor at the University of Maryland who wrote a book on partisan polarization. Rather, it stems from something much more fundamental: people’s idea of who they are. For American voters, party affiliation is a way to express a bundle of identities. “It more or less boils down to how you see the conflicts in American society, and which groups you see as representing you,” Ms. Lee said. “That often means race, and religion, and ethnicity — those are the social groups that underlie party identification.” That process is not necessarily conscious. “There’s sort of an embarrassment about being a partisan,” Ms. Lee said. “It’s seen as admitting to a bias.” That often leads people to say that they are independent, she said, but in fact most voters consistently lean toward one of the parties.

Earlier, President Trump, in comments to Fox Business, held Mr. Putin partly to blame for the crisis in Syria, and on Tuesday, the White House asserted that Russia had released “false narratives” to try and shift responsibility for a chemical attack away from the government of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Trump entered office praising Mr. Putin, and the new shift has left Washington and other capitals with geopolitical whiplash, our chief White House correspondent says. • An apology from Sean Spicer. The White House press secretary drew outrage for suggesting that the Syrian president was guilty of acts worse than Hitler’s and saying that the Nazi leader had not used chemical weapons, ignoring the use of gas chambers during the Holocaust. “I was trying to draw a comparison for which there shouldn’t have been one,” he later said.

Strategies of Connection in a Networked World
By Anne-Marie Slaughter
296 pp. Yale University Press. $26. At the start of the 2015 Henry L. Stimson Lectures at Yale, on which this book is based, Anne-Marie Slaughter, a distinguished political scientist, authority on international law and now president of the New America think tank, explained that the topic came to her while she was serving as director of policy planning at the State Department — in effect while she was practicing what she had preached in her academic career. The time-honored exercise of international politics as a “great game,” an endless competition for strategic advantage among sovereign and equal powers, was in urgent need of a radical update for a world in which networks spawned by the internet and social media, both benign and malignant, were shaping a far different global order. “The Chessboard and the Web” is meant as a guide for foreign policy in this new world. Whether in human interrelations or terrorism, efficient businesses or nefarious crime syndicates, government services or governments meddling in each other’s politics, Slaughter declares, we are at the dawn of a “Networked Age” when “all humanity is connected beneath the surface like the giant colonies of aspen trees in Colorado that are actually all one organism.” Yet foreign-policy makers, she argues, still play on the two-dimensional chessboard fashioned by the 17th-century Peace of Westphalia, partly because they lack the strategies for the web. The grand strategy she proposes is an international order based on three pillars: open society, open government and an open international system. Open versus closed, she declares, is the fault line of the digital age, the way capitalism versus Communism was in the last century. In the new order, in which competing states have been replaced by networks, openness means participation, transparency, autonomy and resistance to controls or limits on information. "

In September, Mrs. Trump sued The Daily Mail in Montgomery County in Maryland, as well as in London, and the tabloid quickly published a retraction. After the Maryland court dismissed that case, saying it did not have jurisdiction, Mrs. Trump filed a new case in February, in New York. "

Putin of Russia is partly to blame for the crisis in Syria and bears responsibility to help bring peace to the war-torn country, comments meant to increase pressure on the Kremlin as his secretary of state was in Moscow for a tense round of talks. “I really think there’s going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that peace happens, because frankly, if Russia didn’t go in and back this animal, we wouldn’t have a problem right now,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Putin’s support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “Putin is backing a person that’s truly an evil person, and I think it’s very bad for Russia, I think it’s very bad for mankind, it’s very bad for this world,” Mr. Trump added during an interview with Fox Business that aired Wednesday morning. His comments came as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was in Moscow for meetings with Russian leaders. Mr. Trump said his primary message to Russia was: “You should have peace in Syria; it’s enough.” Mr. Trump also recounted the scene at his Mar-a-Lago club last week after he gave the order for American forces to carry out the missile strike on a Syrian airfield that had launched Mr. Assad’s chemical attack, then boasted about it over chocolate cake to President Xi Jinping of China, who was at the Florida estate for a summit meeting. “I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you — this was during dessert,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ve just fired 59 missiles, all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable, from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which hit, amazing. Brilliant. It’s so incredible. It’s brilliant. It’s genius.” "
1149,Where Have the Prosecutors Gone? Try Debevoise & Plimpton,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/business/dealbook/where-have-the-prosecutors-gone-try-debevoise-plimpton.html?searchResultPosition=61,2017/04/12,DEALBOOK,"Over the last year, the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton has hired the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the head of that agency’s enforcement unit and a prominent federal judge. That trend will continue on Thursday, when the firm’s white-collar defense group is expected to announce another acquisition from the government ranks: Winston Paes, a federal prosecutor who specializes in financial fraud. Mr. Paes, who prosecuted a number of Wall Street cases as head of the securities fraud section at the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn, will be counsel in Debevoise’s New York office, working alongside Mary Jo White, the former S.E.C. chairwoman; Andrew J. Ceresney, the agency’s enforcement chief; and John Gleeson, who spent over two decades as a federal judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Debevoise also has hired in its Washington office David A. O’Neil, the former acting head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, and Julie M. Riewe, a senior S.E.C. enforcement official. Although the job-hopping partly reflects an exodus of Obama administration officials to several prominent firms — and a homecoming for longtime Debevoise partners like Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney — the metaphorical revolving door between Debevoise and the government is spinning fast these days. Debevoise’s lock-step compensation system, which pays partners in a narrow range according to seniority rather than revenue generated, is attractive to government officials who often prefer to focus on clients and cases rather than the credit that individual lawyers receive. To critics, this revolving door fuels a perception of coziness between the defense bar and the prosecutors they face off against. But to the firms, it can be a selling point: Debevoise boasts that it employs 16 former federal prosecutors and is the only law firm with two former attorneys general. And although a recent report in The New York Law Journal revealed that the firm’s overall profit per partner dropped, the white-collar group was among the strongest performers. “When I was coming out of the government, I looked around, and I quickly decided that Debevoise had the breadth and depth of coverage in the white-collar area,” Mr. Ceresney said in an interview, adding that it was important to hire people with “broad experiences in all the relevant regulatory agencies” across state and federal governments.

1150,Russia Vetoes U.N. Resolution Condemning Syria Chemical Attack,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/world/middleeast/united-nations-resolution-syria-russia-united-states.html?searchResultPosition=55,2017/04/12,MIDDLE EAST,"UNITED NATIONS — The United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, signaled on Wednesday morning that the Trump administration wanted to work with Russia to end the war in Syria. A few hours later, Ms. Haley drew a line in the diplomatic sand, forcing Russia to use its veto for an eighth time on a Syria resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The United States, France and Britain had sponsored a draft resolution that would have strengthened the ability of international investigators to look into the details of a chemical attack in Syria on April 4. The resolution won 10 votes, but Russia vetoed it. China abstained. After the vote, Ms. Haley said she regretted that Russia had chosen to use its veto power for the eighth time to back the Syrian government. “By its failure Russia will continue to be isolated,” she said. The measure condemned the chemical weapons attack, urged international investigators who were already authorized by the Security Council to look into it, and specifically reminded the Syrian government to cooperate, including by turning over all flight logs, flight plans and the names of commanders in charge of air operations on the day of the strike. Russia objected to the draft when it was first brought up last week, and on Wednesday it dismissed the resolution as a political tool. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said his government wanted what it called “an honest investigation.” Russia drafted an alternate resolution but did not put it up for a vote. The Russian deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, testily said that the resolution had “an anti-Syrian slant.” "

Cuomo has slowly accumulated a national political portfolio peppered with popular, if niche, liberal causes: same-sex marriage, raising the minimum wage, and juvenile justice reform. In the last four months, however, Mr. Cuomo has seemed intent on expanding his appeal by pursuing initiatives aimed at a larger constituency of vital importance to his and his party’s long-term prospects: the middle class. Riding solid home-state approval ratings amid whispered national ambitions, Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat, has taken a deep plunge into the center of the pool in 2017, rolling out a “middle-class agenda” and a “middle-class recovery act,” promising to address “middle-class wages,” “middle-class anxiety” and “middle-class frustration.” There is perhaps no better illustration of Mr. Cuomo’s current focus than the so-called tuition-free college initiative he flaunted on Wednesday at LaGuardia Community College in Queens, standing alongside another centrist Democrat, Hillary Clinton, using his roots in the borough to amplify his connection to a tax bracket to which he does not personally belong. “When you grow up in Queens, you grow up middle class, you grow up part of a working family,” the governor said, standing at a lectern that had a sign reading “Tuition-Free College for the Middle Class.” “We’re not rich in Queens,” he said, “but that’s O.K., because we believe in the future.” Speculation about the future has recently been directed toward Mr. Cuomo, and the tuition plan and its target audience have only fueled speculation that the governor is angling not only for middle-class voters in Albany and Utica, but also for those in Ohio and Iowa in 2020.

1153,Court Approved Wiretap on Trump Campaign Aide Over Russia Ties,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/us/politics/carter-page-fisa-warrant-russia-trump.html?searchResultPosition=46,2017/04/12,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department obtained a secret court-approved wiretap last October on Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, based on evidence that he was operating as a Russian agent, a government official said Wednesday. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued the warrant, the official said, after investigators determined that Mr. Page was no longer part of the Trump campaign, which began distancing itself from him in early August. Mr. Page is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in a federal investigation. The Justice Department considered direct surveillance of anyone tied to a political campaign as a line it did not want to cross, the official added. But its decision to seek a wiretap once it was clear that Mr. Page had left the campaign was the latest indication that, as Mr. Trump built his insurgent run for the White House, the F.B.I. was deeply concerned about whether any of his associates were colluding with Russia. To obtain the warrant, the government needed to show probable cause that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of Russia. Investigators must first get approval from one of three senior officials at the Justice Department. Then, prosecutors take it to a surveillance court judge. And though the Trump administration has said Mr. Page was a bit player who had no access to the candidate, the wiretap shows the F.B.I. had strong evidence that a campaign adviser was operating on behalf of Moscow. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Page have called the investigation a “witch hunt” and said it was cooked up by their political rivals for speaking out against President Barack Obama’s policies. On Tuesday, Mr. Page said in an email that it “will be interesting to see what comes out when the unjustified basis for those FISA requests are more fully disclosed over time,” using shorthand for the court.

1154,"At Meeting, Putin and Tillerson Find Very Little to Agree On",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/world/europe/united-stats-russia-putin-tillerson-meeting-trump.html?searchResultPosition=47,2017/04/12,EUROPE,"MOSCOW — Vladimir V. Putin kept his guest, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, dangling all day. It was not clear until around 5 p.m., when Mr. Tillerson’s small motorcade eased out of the Ritz-Carlton in one of the fanciest parts of Moscow and slipped into Red Square that Russia’s president was willing to engage in his first face-to-face meeting with a senior member of President Trump’s administration, even one who is an old business partner who used to show up on behalf of Exxon Mobil. If a few weeks ago critics of the Trump administration feared that Mr. Tillerson would simply fold on the sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, they need not have worried. In a two-hour meeting, as later described in sketchy terms by Mr. Tillerson, they did not agree on much — certainly not on who was responsible for fatally poisoning Syrian civilians with the nerve agent sarin, or for the interference in the American elections last year and the European elections underway now. “We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of the greatest importance to both of us,” Mr. Tillerson said at a news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov. Mr. Tillerson went on to describe how the two countries were establishing “a working group to address smaller issues and make progress toward stabilizing the relationship,” a recognition of the fact that the big issues were so big that no working group would have the authority. Dangling meetings is an old technique for Mr. Putin, used to keep other leaders off balance and demonstrate his control. But when Mr. Putin and Mr. Tillerson did meet, it was clear that they not only have different world views, but that they have different views of the facts. And that made it difficult to achieve anything other than cosmetic accords on the issues over which the two nations, in a revival of Cold War rhetoric, have charged each other with lying about. For good measure, Mr. Lavrov offered a lengthy tutorial for Mr. Tillerson about all the examples of American-led regime change in the world — from Slobodan Milosevic to Saddam Hussein to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi — that went bad, suggesting it made no sense to add President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to the list. "
1155,Why ‘Sorry’ Is Still the Hardest Word,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/business/media/apology-sean-spicer-holocaust-oscar-munoz-united.html?searchResultPosition=48,2017/04/12,MEDIA,"“I’m sorry.” Two simple words, not so simply said. On Wednesday, the public representatives of two embattled American institutions — United Airlines and the White House — found themselves on national television grappling with a delicate and increasingly common ritual of the corporate and political worlds: the public apology. Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive, recalled his “shame” upon seeing a cellphone video, shared by millions of people, of a paying passenger being violently evicted from one of his airline’s flights. Face taut, voice soft, Mr. Munoz’s televised prostration was a far cry from the robotic statement issued by United days earlier, expressing regret for “re-accommodating” a traveler. Around the same time, President Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, was denouncing himself as “reprehensible” for having favorably compared Hitler to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and referring to Nazi death camps as “Holocaust centers,” all while standing at the White House podium. The fine art of repentance is a skill taught in business schools and promoted by high-priced consultants. But all kinds of offenders in public life still seem to struggle with the execution. Corporations like BP and Wells Fargo have faced criticism for dawdling responses to cascading crises, while politicians from Bill Clinton to Anthony Weiner have had difficulty admitting to peccadilloes. The key to contrition, according to public-relations experts, is projecting sincerity, humanity, and a plain-spoken demeanor — the better to convince a cynical public. And in this age of whipsawing social media, you had better do it fast. “The head of United should never have been allowed to take three swings at correcting and apologizing for an incident that was on more social media than Kim and Kanye’s wedding,” said Mortimer Matz, a New York consultant who has guided decades’ worth of clients through crises small and large.

1156,Trump Reversals Hint at Wall Street Wing’s Sway in White House,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/us/politics/export-import-bank-janet-yellen-china-currency.html?searchResultPosition=50,2017/04/12,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump made three startling economic policy reversals on Wednesday, stepping away from pledges he made as a candidate and even policies he supported only days ago. The shifts confounded many of Mr. Trump’s supporters and suggested that the moderate financiers he brought from Wall Street are eclipsing the White House populist wing led by Stephen K. Bannon, the political strategist who is increasingly being sidelined by the president. In a series of interviews, Mr. Trump said he no longer wanted to label China a currency manipulator — a week after telling The Financial Times that the Chinese were the “world champions” of currency manipulation. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the president said he no longer wanted to eliminate the Export-Import Bank. And he said that he might consider reappointing Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve when her term ends next year. Yet before the election, he regularly denounced China and said that Ms. Yellen should be “ashamed” of herself because of what he said was her political bias. Mr. Trump’s latest pronouncements suggest he is moving toward a more mainstream economic approach, although on other issues that he discussed on Wednesday, like a tax overhaul and health care, his policy and strategy appeared muddled.

Zeke Smith, familiar to viewers of the previous season, went blank. His eyes lost focus, and it seemed, for a moment, as if he were disassociating. The thing that he had wanted to avoid was now about to unfold, on national television. Mayhem ensued. Words like “deception” were thrown around. Repeatedly, Mr. Smith was accused of having misled his fellow tribe members because, yes, he was — or had been — trans. “Survivor” is a reality show, but the issues that Mr. Smith had to deal with — and its potential manipulation by the Jeff Varners of the world — are ones that many people, both trans and not, have had to confront: What private information is ours to keep? What aspects of our history do others have the right to know? Does knowledge of people’s sexual or gender history change the way we look at them? We are judged not only by the public selves we invent but also by the things we keep private. Often the contradiction between the two seems significant. The fact that Newt Gingrich was having an affair the whole time he was busy trying to impeach Bill Clinton for lying about having an affair called into question whether Mr. Gingrich was motivated by his dedication to the moral high ground or — you think? — the opportunity to drag his adversary down. We see this again and again, especially in the long list of anti-gay family-values Republicans who have later come out — sometimes voluntarily, and sometimes as a result of being busted. There have been more documented instances of Republican congressmen being arrested for solicitation in restrooms than transgender people. Perhaps what we need is a law keeping members of the Republican Party out of men’s rooms. "

New S.U.V.s dominated media previews on Wednesday at the New York International Auto Show, the latest sign that the shift away from traditional cars is more than a short-term trend. And the new vehicles are all about muscle. Ford Motor released a more powerful version of its extra-large Lincoln Navigator. There were high-octane offerings in the Jeep and Mercedes-Benz lines. And General Motors moved to cement its leadership in the category with a midsize model capable of towing a 20-foot speedboat. In short, with oil prices half what they were three years ago, and President Trump vowing to cut back on fuel-economy regulations, automakers are raising the stakes in the S.U.V. segment. “We don’t think that the rate of growth of S.U.V.s will necessarily continue, but we do believe the shift to them is permanent,” said Mike Manley, head of Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep division. Pickup trucks and S.U.V.s have accounted for about 62 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States so far this year, compared with 57 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to the research firm Autodata.

Even as the federal courts trip up President Trump’s ban on travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries and Congress signals it is in no rush to pay for a border wall, the administration is pushing the vast border enforcement network to begin choking off illegal immigration. Homeland Security’s plan to greatly expand its Border Patrol has been known for some time and includes adding about 5,000 agents, in part by allowing some applicants to skip the polygraph test that is required for all prospective hires. That proposal has been praised by Border Patrol agents, who say the polygraph is excessively difficult, and questioned by some experts, who say the test is needed to screen out drug cartel members and other problematic hires. The memo, which was first reported by The Washington Post, outlined several other ways in which the administration is considering relaxing hiring standards and stepping up recruitment. Beyond removing the polygraph hurdle, the memo discusses eliminating a part of the entrance exam that tests the Spanish language skills of prospective hires, explaining that “few applicants fail the entrance exam solely because of these tests.” New agents will still have to obtain “the appropriate level of proficiency in Spanish” to graduate from the academy, the memo says.

In doing so, he tours much of world history, and attempts to look into the future as well. Below, Crawford tells us about the inspiration for the book, what he learned while writing it and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? JAMES CRAWFORD The inspiration came from a visit to the site of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete about eight years ago. I had studied the mythological history of the site — the labyrinth, the Minotaur, Theseus, Ariadne, Daedalus and Icarus — but was largely unaware of the early-20th-century story of Arthur Evans, the English antiquarian who partially reconstructed the ruins in reinforced concrete. I found exploring Knossos a confusing and at times surreal experience. You can’t help but try to spot where the rebuilding (and garish redecorating) stops and where the original remains actually begin. I was at first baffled and then intrigued by the eccentricity and audacity of Evans. Crete got under my skin, but no part of it more so than Knossos. The relatively recent intervention of a wealthy eccentric seemed such a deliciously bizarre episode in the “life” of a building. And it was this that got me thinking about the very idea of the lives — and indeed deaths — of buildings. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? CRAWFORD It’s difficult to know where to start with this. The book spans some 7,000 years of human history, moving from the birth of civilization up to the present day. But the stories of each of the individual buildings I write about also often span thousands and thousands of years. As a result, the research could become a rabbit hole, and I found myself doing massive chunks of reading around subjects as diverse and niche as the Marquis de Sade’s prison eating habits, the sex lives of Byzantine emperors, French New Wave filmmaking in Cold War East Germany, the opium-fuelled poetry of Chinese princes, viral social-media shaming in South Korea, and how to 3-D print a 2,000-year-old Syrian temple. A particular favorite was discovering that the Stasi held a file on Bruce Springsteen — which commented approvingly on his lyrics about working-class economic depression in America — and that they permitted him to play a concert to 300,000 people in East Germany, a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? CRAWFORD Time and again in my research I found structures with compelling narratives. This is what I had expected — or had certainly hoped for. What I hadn’t anticipated was the extent to which the lives and deaths of buildings, old and new, appeared to be having a profound impact on global politics and global culture today. "

He also copyrighted and trademarked the three-and-a-half-ton sculpture that stands near Wall Street. Since March 7, “Charging Bull” has faced off against “Fearless Girl,” a statue of a girl posed with her fists on her hips that was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, a financial firm based in Boston. Mr. Di Modica said that “Fearless Girl” was an insult to his work, which he created after the stock market crashes in the late 1980s. “She’s there attacking the bull,” he said. Even as Mr. Di Modica was denouncing “Fearless Girl” at a news conference in Midtown Manhattan, State Street Global’s home page highlighted the statue for its message about “the power of women in leadership” and urged “greater gender diversity on corporate boards.” Mr. Di Modica and his lawyers did not disagree with that idea at a news conference — “None of us here are in any way not proponents of gender equality,” said one of Mr. Di Modica’s lawyers, Norman Siegel, a former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. They demanded that “Fearless Girl” be moved somewhere else. "

That morning, he stepped down from guiding Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, after a brief tenure during which Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination, Democrats’ emails were hacked and the campaign’s contacts with Russia came under scrutiny. Dogged by revelations about past financial dealings in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort retreated from public view. But behind the scenes, he was busy with other matters. Papers were recorded that same day creating a shell company controlled by Mr. Manafort that soon received $13 million in loans from two businesses with ties to Mr. Trump, including one that partners with a Ukrainian-born billionaire and another led by a Trump economic adviser. They were among $20 million in loans secured by properties belonging to Mr. Manafort and his wife. The purpose of the loans is unstated in public records, although at least some of them appear to be part of an effort by Mr. Manafort to stave off a personal financial crisis stemming from failed investments with his son-in-law. The transactions raise a number of questions, including whether Mr. Manafort’s decision to turn to Trump-connected lenders was related to his role in the campaign, where he had agreed to serve for free. They also shine a light on the rich real estate portfolio that Mr. Manafort acquired during and after the years he worked in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort, often using shell companies, invested millions of dollars in various properties, including apartments and condos in New York, homes in Florida and Virginia and luxury houses in Los Angeles. Mr. Manafort’s ties to Ukraine and Russia have come under scrutiny as federal officials investigate Russian meddling in the American presidential election. Investigators are known to have examined aspects of his finances, including bank accounts he had in the secretive tax haven of Cyprus; there is no indication his recent loans are part of the inquiry.

During the campaign, Mr. Trump fawned over Russia’s assertively proud leader, Vladimir Putin, praising him for “doing a great job” and calling him a “stronger leader” than Barack Obama. As to policy, he seemed almost an apologist for Mr. Putin’s aggressive behavior in Syria, his annexation of Crimea and his transparent efforts to undermine the NATO alliance. Findings by the American intelligence community that Russia had intervened in the election on Mr. Trump’s behalf seemed further evidence of a bromance, if not something more sinister. Three months into the Trump presidency, Russia-American relations are as tense as ever, a casualty of Mr. Putin’s ruthless behavior and Mr. Trump’s changing views and whiplash approach to policy, infuriating Russians who had every reason to believe they would have a pal in the White House. While both men could end up losers, there is a greater chance that Mr. Trump, a foreign policy neophyte who has bungled his presidential debut, will find it hard to prevail over the nefarious ways of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent. Mr. Putin’s approach to international engagement, which involves expanding efforts to meddle in countries from Europe to Libya and beyond, has been largely consistent; Mr. Trump’s has been anything but. This, in turn, has shaken the confidence of allies that depend on America for prudent, steady leadership. "

The strike was the first combat use of what is formally named the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast. President Trump has bestowed additional authority on the Pentagon in his first months in office, which the military has argued will help it defeat the Islamic State more speedily. Mr. Trump did not say whether he had personally approved Thursday’s mission. “What I do is I authorize my military,” Mr. Trump said after a meeting with emergency workers at the White House. He called the bombing “another very, very successful mission.” The Pentagon gave no casualty totals for the bombing, part of an intense air campaign against the militant group in Afghanistan. But in a separate announcement, the Pentagon said that an airstrike in Syria by the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State there had killed 18 Syrian fighters allied with the United States, raising concerns about whether the White House is applying any rigor to the process of approving airstrikes in hot spots from Afghanistan to Syria. The Syria strike — on Tuesday near the town of Tabqah, which Syrian fighters and American advisers are trying to capture — was the third American-led airstrike in a month that may have killed civilians or allies. Earlier bombing runs killed or wounded scores of civilians in a mosque complex in Syria and in a building in the west of Mosul, Iraq. "
1166,Trump’s Previous View of NATO Is Now Obsolete,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/europe/nato-trump.html?searchResultPosition=24,2017/04/13,EUROPE,"WASHINGTON — As a candidate, President Trump disparaged NATO as a musty relic of old thinking, an alliance focused on long-gone adversaries rather than new-era threats, a burden that drained American resources on behalf of ungrateful partners who did not pay their share. In a word: “obsolete.” That was then. After 82 days in office, Mr. Trump officially pronounced NATO rehabilitated, taking credit for transforming it into a modern, cost-sharing, terrorism-fighting pillar of American and European security. “I said it was obsolete,” the president noted on Wednesday as he hosted NATO’s secretary general. “It’s no longer obsolete.” Never mind that the alliance has changed very little if at all in the last three months, and that whatever modest changes have been made were in train long before Mr. Trump entered the doorway of the White House. After weeks of being lobbied, cajoled and educated by the leaders of Britain and Germany, not to mention “my generals,” as he likes to call his national security team, Mr. Trump has found fresh virtue in a venerable organization. “Nothing has changed at NATO in the last 80 days,” said Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “It’s gratifying to see the president affirming that NATO is ‘no longer obsolete’ — it never was. Perhaps the one important thing that has changed in the last 80 days is that as president, Mr. Trump has come to appreciate the importance of this alliance and how it contributes to security and stability in Europe and beyond.” Mr. Trump’s about-face on NATO was only part of a day of flip flops at the White House. Within a matter of hours, the president determined that China is not a currency manipulator after all, embraced the Export-Import Bank that he once called unnecessary and suggested he might keep Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman he said he would replace after her term expired. Most striking, he pivoted 180 degrees on Russia, lashing it for supporting rogue nations after years of praising President Vladimir V. Putin. The Russia reversal and the NATO turnabout were inherently linked, of course. As Russia appears more ominous, NATO seems more necessary. But the shift in attitude also offered one of the starkest examples yet of Mr. Trump’s evolving views on domestic and foreign policy, as the first president ever elected without political or military experience settles into the role of commander in chief.

1167,Assad Says Videos of Dead Children in Syria Chemical Attack Were Faked,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/middleeast/assad-syria-video-faked.html?searchResultPosition=23,2017/04/13,MIDDLE EAST,"Vilified by accusations of using a chemical bomb, Syria’s president intensified his counterpropaganda campaign on Thursday, suggesting that child actors had staged death scenes to malign him and that American warplanes had bombed a terrorist warehouse full of poison gases, killing hundreds of people. In his first interview since an April 4 attack on the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed over 80 people, sickened hundreds and outraged the world, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria not only repeated the government’s denials of responsibility but contended without evidence that the episode had been fabricated as a pretext for an American retaliatory missile strike. “We don’t know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhoun,” Mr. Assad told Agence France-Presse in the television interview from Damascus, which was recorded on Wednesday. “Were they dead at all?” The decision by the increasingly isolated Syrian president to give an interview to a Western news organization appeared to reflect a calculation that his best option, even in the face of incriminating evidence, was to repeatedly deny responsibility for the attack, one of the worst in the six-year-old Syrian war. Medical examiners in Turkey, where many of the Khan Sheikhoun victims were taken, have said that autopsies showed they had been attacked with sarin, a lethal nerve agent and a banned chemical weapon that Syria had claimed to have eradicated. In a further sign that sarin was used, the British delegation to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the global group that polices adherence to a treaty banning such munitions, said samples taken from the attack had tested positive for sarin, Reuters reported.

1168,Trump Signs Law Taking Aim at Planned Parenthood Funding,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/us/politics/planned-parenthood-trump.html?searchResultPosition=22,2017/04/13,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump signed legislation on Thursday aimed at cutting off federal funding to Planned Parenthood and other groups that perform abortions, a move cheered by conservatives who have clamored to impose curbs on reproductive rights. The measure nullifies a rule completed in the last days of the Obama administration that effectively barred state and local governments from withholding federal funding for family planning services related to contraception, sexually transmitted infections, fertility, pregnancy care, and breast and cervical cancer screening from qualified health providers — regardless of whether they also performed abortions. The new measure cleared Congress last month with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. The previous Department of Health and Human Services regulation, which took effect two days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, said that states and localities could not withhold money from a provider for any reason other than an inability to provide family planning services. Mr. Trump has shown ambivalence about Planned Parenthood, voicing support for its health-related services other than abortion, and his daughter Ivanka has urged him to tread carefully on the issue, concerned about the possible political repercussions of the Republican effort to defund the organization altogether. As a middle ground, Mr. Trump has proposed preserving federal funding for Planned Parenthood if it stops providing abortion services. The organization has said it will never accept such a deal. And federal law already prohibits government funding for abortion, except in cases of rape or incest, or to save a woman’s life. "

It is a question as evocative as it is provocative. It was also the headline in The New York Times at the top of Tuesday’s front page essay about London that generated a spirited trans-Atlantic discussion. The essay by Sarah Lyall, with striking visuals by Sergey Ponomarev, is the first in a series of articles examining how Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, could affect London. Ms. Lyall looked closely at the British capital: a teeming multicultural metropolis of 8.7 million people, with a Muslim mayor, where some native Britons no longer feel at home. London is a center of international culture and commerce whose resilience and openness became a symbol of postwar European unity. It’s expected that in two years it will no longer be a part of that European experiment. In Britain, and around the world, the response to the article was swift, if hardly unanimous. Readers, commentators in the British news media, members of Parliament and people across social media weighed in and continued to do so on Thursday. No matter how rapidly the media landscape is changing, headlines still matter. “Will London Fall?” clearly struck a nerve; some people reacted to the headline more than the article. Some viewed it as unduly inflammatory or sensationalistic. #WillLondonFall became a trending topic on British Twitter. Some thought it provoked unwanted memories of the much-maligned disaster movie, “London Has Fallen.” Others thought it was fine. Passionate responses poured in from a city that has survived fire, plague and the Blitz, among them: Not everyone was so high-minded. To some people on Twitter, London had already succumbed to immigration, globalization and more. Venom seeped through some Twitter feeds, reminiscent of the anger that surfaced during the vote, to the annoyance of some others. "
1170,Ford Foundation Is an Unlikely Convert to ‘Impact’ Investing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/business/ford-foundation-mission-investment.html?searchResultPosition=19,2017/04/13,BUSINESS,"Peter A. Nadosy is a pillar of the Wall Street establishment — he spent 27 years at Morgan Stanley, rising to vice chairman. He served a stint managing the endowment at Harvard, his alma mater, and he’s also a life trustee and member of the investment committee at Amherst College. He’s on multiple boards of nonprofit institutions, including the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and St. Andrew’s Dune Church in Southampton, N.Y. He is, in short, about the last person you’d expect to throw his support behind an investment strategy that makes fossil-fuel divestment — something Mr. Nadosy opposes — look tame by comparison. Yet, as chairman of the Ford Foundation’s investment committee, which oversees the foundation’s $12 billion-plus endowment, he’s now in the vanguard of an approach to endowment management that breaks with generations of investment orthodoxy. Last week, the foundation announced that it would commit $1 billion to investments that “earn not only attractive financial returns but concrete social returns as well,” as it said in a news release. “When we first started talking about this nine months ago, I was very wary,” Mr. Nadosy told me. “I’m on 10 different boards and investment committees. It’s deeply ingrained that your goal is to maximize returns, because that’s how performance is measured.” “Everywhere I go, people want to know, ‘What quartile are you in?’” he added. “Like it or not, that’s the world we live in.” Earning high returns isn’t just a matter of bragging rights — endowment income supports the missions of nonprofit institutions, whether education, as with college and universities, or broader social programs, as at many private foundations. By law, tax-exempt foundations must spend at least 5 percent of their endowment every year on charitable purposes. In Ford’s case, that amounts to over $600 million. "

In Chicago, where live, I invite you to a monthly meeting, mostly of women in their 60s, 70s and 80s. On our agenda, for starters, are electing more women to public office, addressing gun violence, fighting for decent housing, health care for all and retirement security. Our protests take multiple forms: phone calls, letters, postcards, emails, marches and town hall visits, to name just a few. Such meetings are replicated throughout the city. Listen in and you will hear passionate and informed women referring to websites, apps and other technical supports for activism. This president has reawakened many ’60s activists while kindling first-time activism in others. I, for one, thought that my marching days were over, but in today’s chaotic, scary political context, my boots are ready to go and my brain is in overdrive as I consider how to resist the interlocking oppressions that mark our society today.

No Border Wall, Lawsuit Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/us/no-environmental-impact-study-no-border-wall-lawsuit-says.html?searchResultPosition=11,2017/04/13,U.S.,"PHOENIX — An environmental group and an Arizona congressman have sued to block the construction of President Trump’s wall along the southern border, threatening to derail one of his marquee projects well before it gets off the ground. The Center for Biological Diversity and Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Natural Resources, claimed in a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday in Tucson that the Trump administration had failed to study the wall’s environmental impact before gearing up for its construction. Mr. Trump’s plan to strengthen the border includes the hiring of 5,000 Border Patrol agents, increasing by 25 percent the ranks of the largest law enforcement agency in the country. The lawsuit seeks to stop any work until the government agrees to analyze the impact of construction, noise, light and other changes to the landscape on rivers, plants and endangered species — including jaguars, Sonoran pronghorns and ocelots — and also on border residents. The suit appears to be the first legal action against the wall, but it is only one of the many challenges the project faces, including who will pay for it and what form it will take. An estimate by the Department of Homeland Security put the cost at nearly $22 billion. Mr. Trump’s budget sets aside $1.4 billion for the wall’s initial development. Included in the proposals turned in to the federal government last week were a wall of solar panels and another topped by a monorail. "

One writer quoted in the accompanying article explained that she would channel strength, positive energy and a broader spirit of noncompliance through “offbeat bright colors, bold prints and my grandmother’s gold necklace.” The age of activism that Donald J. Trump’s presidency unleashed has given us, as its two most ubiquitous symbols of defiance, the pink knit hat that women around the world have embraced as a means of communicating their distaste for President Trump’s regressive views on women and a T-shirt blaring “Nasty Woman” — now available in a special $35 Earth Day edition — a subversion of the president’s remarks about Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Although a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of some of the shirts — there are many types and various purveyors — go to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, the whole gambit recalls a time when the relationship between politics and style seemed less preoccupied with telegraphing aphoristic opinions and more concerned with direct social and economic remediation for those left behind by American consumer culture. In 1966, a small store called Liberty House, with precisely this in mind, opened at 343¼ Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. Abbie Hoffman, through his involvement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, was the manager. Liberty House sold handbags, book bags, dresses, children’s clothes, pillows, quilts and other “crafts of freedom,” as they were known, produced by an outfit called the Poor People’s Corporation. The P.P.C. was founded by a young civil rights worker named Jesse Morris, who decided to open a chain of small cooperative factories in Mississippi to help provide incomes to poor black people who were not only beholden to the seasonal nature of farm work but also facing the threat of losing their jobs if their white employers discovered they had exercised their rights. “If you were in a car with a white person, if you were registering to vote, if a civil rights worker came to your place, then you would get a visitor the next day telling you that you had to leave the land you were sharecropping,” Doris Derby, the activist and photographer who moved from New York to Mississippi in the 1960s and became instrumental in the P.P.C., told me. “The idea was to give black people something beyond sharecropping.” "

China released the first-quarter trade data just days after President Trump urged its leader, Xi Jinping, to clamp down on trade with North Korea. The two leaders met at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last week. With signs indicating that North Korea could be planning a nuclear or missile test as early as Saturday, a United States Navy strike group led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson is steaming toward the Korean Peninsula in a show of force. But the Trump administration has indicated that economic pressure — particularly imposed by China, with which North Korea conducts almost 90 percent of its trade — is its preferred form of deterrence. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said in interviews that he had encouraged Mr. Xi to solve the North Korea problem, offering China a better trade deal if he did so. Recent satellite images indicate that North Korea may be preparing for an underground nuclear test, which would be its sixth in a decade. North Korea often conducts such tests on important anniversaries, and Saturday is the 105th anniversary of the birth of the country’s founder, Kim Il-sung. The data released on Thursday showed that China’s trade with North Korea grew 37.4 percent in the first quarter of this year from the period in 2016. Chinese exports surged 54.5 percent, and imports increased 18.4 percent, the General Administration of Customs said at a news conference in Beijing. "
1178,The Evangelical Roots of Our Post-Truth Society,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/opinion/sunday/the-evangelical-roots-of-our-post-truth-society.html?searchResultPosition=15,2017/04/13,SUNDAY OPINION,"THE arrival of the “post-truth” political climate came as a shock to many Americans. But to the Christian writer Rachel Held Evans, charges of “fake news” are nothing new. “The deep distrust of the media, of scientific consensus — those were prevalent narratives growing up,” she told me. Although Ms. Evans, 35, no longer calls herself an evangelical, she attended Bryan College, an evangelical school in Dayton, Tenn. She was taught to distrust information coming from the scientific or media elite because these sources did not hold a “biblical worldview.” “It was presented as a cohesive worldview that you could maintain if you studied the Bible,” she told me. “Part of that was that climate change isn’t real, that evolution is a myth made up by scientists who hate God, and capitalism is God’s ideal for society.” Conservative evangelicals are not the only ones who think that an authority trusted by the other side is probably lying. But they believe that their own authority — the inerrant Bible — is both supernatural and scientifically sound, and this conviction gives that natural human aversion to unwelcome facts a special power on the right. This religious tradition of fact denial long predates the rise of the culture wars, social media or President Trump, but it has provoked deep conflict among evangelicals themselves. That innocuous phrase — “biblical worldview” or “Christian worldview” — is everywhere in the evangelical world. The radio show founded by Chuck Colson, “BreakPoint,” helps listeners “get informed and equipped to live out the Christian worldview.” Focus on the Family devotes a webpage to the implications of a worldview “based on the infallible Word of God.” Betsy DeVos’s supporters praised her as a “committed Christian living out a biblical worldview.” The phrase is not as straightforward as it seems. Ever since the scientific revolution, two compulsions have guided conservative Protestant intellectual life: the impulse to defend the Bible as a reliable scientific authority and the impulse to place the Bible beyond the claims of science entirely.

1179,U.N. Votes Unanimously to End Peacekeeping Mission in Haiti,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/americas/un-peacekeeping-haiti-cholera.html?searchResultPosition=18,2017/04/13,AMERICAS,"UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Thursday to end its 13-year-long peacekeeping mission in Haiti, and replace its blue-helmeted soldiers with police officers. The mission, often a source of embarrassment to the world body, landed in Haiti in 2004, after a rebellion led to the removal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It became arguably best known for introducing a deadly cholera strain to the country — and then refusing for years to take responsibility for it. The cholera outbreak, which began in 2010, has killed at least 9,500 people so far and infected hundreds of thousands of Haitians. The United Nations apologized last year and proposed to compensate affected Haitians, but has yet to raise money for the effort. Of the $400 million that the United Nations says it needs, it has received $2.66 million, from only six countries — Britain, Chile, France, India, Liechtenstein and South Korea, according to data posted on its website. The mission has also recently been troubled by allegations of sexual abuse. A sex ring, operated by Sri Lankan soldiers who were posted there from 2004 to 2007, exploited at least nine children, according to an internal United Nations report, The Associated Press reported this week. The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, referred to the sexual abuse allegations in her brief remarks in the council chambers on Thursday. “The United States has made it clear to the U.N. and all troop-contributing countries that these abuses must stop,” she said. She did not address the cholera outbreak, nor how the United Nations can compensate survivors. The Haiti drawdown, which was recommended by the secretary general, António Guterres, comes amid pressure by President Trump’s administration to review each of the organization’s 16 peacekeeping missions. The United States is the United Nations’ largest financial contributor; it funds about 28 percent of the world body’s $7.87 billion budget, and Trump administration officials have said they want to bring that down to a maximum of 25 percent. The American contribution amounts to less than 0.1 percent of the federal budget. Missions in Ivory Coast and Liberia, which have shrunk significantly in recent years, are already scheduled to close gradually. The mission in Darfur is set to end as well. The mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo was the subject of intense negotiations recently, with the Security Council ultimately agreeing to pare it back by about 500 soldiers to a little over 16,000 troops. Ms. Haley had sought deeper cuts. In Haiti, the roughly 2,300 soldiers are scheduled to leave gradually by October. Seven United Nations police units will remain for an initial period of six months to train Haitian police officers. The decision to close the Haiti mission represented a rare moment of unity on the Security Council, with the world powers agreeing that the country had reached a new level of stability. Ms. Haley called the drawdown “a success story.” "

The strike, on Tuesday in Tabqah, Syria, was the third time in a month that American-led airstrikes may have killed civilians or allies, and it comes even as the Pentagon is investigating two previous airstrikes that killed or wounded scores of civilians in a mosque complex in Syria and in a building in the west of Mosul, Iraq. Tuesday’s strike was requested by coalition allies who were on the ground near Tabqah, the United States Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East, said in a statement. The fighters had called in the airstrikes and “identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position,” it said, using another name for the Islamic State. The Central Command statement said that the target location turned out to be a “fighting position” for the Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been fighting the Islamic State alongside the United States. It was unclear whether the strike came from an American warplane or one from the other coalition partners. “The coalition’s deepest condolences go out to the members of the S.D.F. and their families,” Central Command said in the statement, calling the episode “tragic.” Military officials said the cause is being investigated. As the American-led military campaigns against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have intensified in recent months, so, too, have reports of civilian casualties and, now, friendly fire. Military officials say that is to be expected as Iraqi forces try to retake Mosul in what is seen as the last big urban hurdle to defeating the extremist Sunni militant group in Iraq, and while forces allied with the United States are moving in on the group’s de facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria. President Trump has indicated that unlike President Barack Obama, who had his White House scrutinize many military operations, he will leave more operational decision-making to the Pentagon and to American commanders in the field. That move has been welcomed by many in the military, who often expressed frustration at what they saw as a cumbersome decision-making process in Mr. Obama’s White House. But it has raised questions about whether Mr. Trump is exercising sufficient oversight. "

1183,Trump Plan Would Curtail Protections for Detained Immigrants,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/us/detained-immigrants-may-face-harsher-conditions-under-trump.html?searchResultPosition=28,2017/04/13,U.S.,"For more than 15 years, jails that hold immigrants facing deportation have had to follow a growing list of requirements: Notify immigration officials if a detainee spends two weeks or longer in solitary confinement. Check on suicidal inmates every 15 minutes, and evaluate their mental health every day. Inform detainees, in languages they can understand, how to obtain medical care. In disciplinary hearings, provide a staff member who can advocate in English on the detainee’s behalf. But as the Trump administration seeks to quickly find jail space for its crackdown on illegal immigration, it is moving to curtail these rules as a way to entice more sheriffs and local officials to make their correctional facilities available. According to two Homeland Security officials who had knowledge of the plans but declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly, new jail contracts will contain a far less detailed set of regulations. They will make no mention of the need for translation services, for example. A current rule that detainees’ requests for medical care must be evaluated by a professional within 24 hours will be replaced by a requirement that the jails merely have procedures on providing medical care. The new contracts will require that the jails maintain policies for suicide prevention, solitary confinement and other concerns, but will not specify what those policies should contain. The changes, which will coincide with the closing of an office that develops regulations, will essentially hold these jails to the same standards they must follow for criminal inmates. That is a break from a long-held philosophy that people held on immigration violations, who are considered by law to be “civil” detainees, should be treated differently, and is in line with the president’s belief that the government should be tougher on unauthorized immigrants.

Wherever Mr. Dean goes, talk of Watergate is never far behind, and Mr. Rushdie mentioned that he knew Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters whose investigative work at The Washington Post in the 1970s helped run President Richard M. Nixon out of office and get Mr. Dean sentenced to a jail term. “We shared the same agent, David Obst,” Mr. Dean told Mr. Rushdie, recalling Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein. “We had lunch together once. We went to a Chinese restaurant. Obst speaks Chinese and he wanted to order for us in Chinese. I don’t know if the waiter understood him.” They laughed, and Mr. Rushdie asked Mr. Dean, a hotshot lawyer in his 30s when he worked in the Nixon White House, if he had known Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein back in those days. “No,” Mr. Dean said. “I was never a source.” At 78, Mr. Dean no longer wears the signature horn rims that set him apart from the crowd of nervous staff members testifying on live television before a Senate committee in 1973. Since then, he has written four books about the Nixon administration and made himself a regular on the lecture circuit. As if in expiation for his role during the Nixon years, the main theme in his books and speeches is to sound the alarm about abuses of presidential power. He was in New York at the invitation of the Ethics Center of Australia, at a cocktail party at the Library Hotel; the next morning he would give a talk on his views of President Trump, and how his actions may wind up intersecting with those of his old boss. While Mr. Dean was in town, the news of the day — with its talk of investigations and wiretaps — seemed an echo of the Watergate era. Amid investigations into the Trump administration’s ties to Russia, the president had accused his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of wiretapping the phones at Trump Tower. Surreptitious recording is something Mr. Dean knows all too well: Mr. Nixon taped 37 of their conversations in the White House. “That’s the silliness of Trump’s tweet saying Obama tapped him,” Mr. Dean said. “He could find that out within one phone call.” "

But in a war with many dilemmas, this may be among the most intractable, analysts say. It is driven by Mr. Assad’s own grim strategy and the limitations of American power, but also something deeper: the fundamental nature of the Syrian conflict and of chemical weaponry. What follows are some of the forces prompting Mr. Assad to opt to use chemical weapons in Syria and why they are so resilient. Mr. Assad relies on airstrikes, backed by allied Russian forces, which have helped him turn the war’s tide. But his greatest weakness is manpower: His ground forces, eroded by years of fighting, are simply too few to hold, much less advance, every front line. Aaron Stein, who studies the Middle East and arms control at the Atlantic Council, a research group, said that for a leader like Mr. Assad, who appears unconcerned with civilian death, chemical weapons presented a way to solve his battlefield problems. “They are effective weapons,” he said, that were best suited to capitalize on Mr. Assad’s air power superiority and compensate for his manpower shortages.

1186,How to Make the Nuclear Button Safer,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/opinion/how-to-make-the-nuclear-button-safer.html?searchResultPosition=43,2017/04/13,OPINION,"WASHINGTON — As we mark the centenary of the United States’ entry into World War I, I recall the words of a participant in the Versailles Treaty, which ended that conflict. “This isn’t a treaty of peace,” the American diplomat William Bullitt declared. “I can see at least 11 wars in it.” The world once again seems to be preparing for war: a wider conflict in Syria, greater friction with Russia and possible military action on the Korean Peninsula. In the event of war, the president of the United States has unrestricted powers to use nuclear weapons first. Concerns about the absence of checks and balances on the first use of nuclear weapons have spiked because of Donald J. Trump’s bellicose temperament and shallow understanding of nuclear flash points. These concerns have led some on Capitol Hill to introduce legislation that would prohibit the president from launching a nuclear first strike without a declaration of war by Congress. The intention is understandable, but this remedy is unworkable and unachievable. No president in the modern era has accepted the absolute requirement of congressional consent on war-making powers. Moreover, any scenario for the first use of nuclear weapons implies great urgency because, over time, America’s conventional military advantages would presumably suffice. A congressional debate authorizing first use would have to be very hurried, and this process could speed up hostile actions rather than slow them down. And when the executive branch has occasionally sought support for war-making powers, Congress has seen fit to provide that backing, rather than deny it. A far more realistic check on the first use of nuclear weapons by the United States can be found, oddly enough, in the case of a Soviet diesel submarine that was depth-charged to the surface during the most harrowing days of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Back then, diesel submarines had limited capabilities to remain submerged and to “phone home.” So the captain, second captain and deputy political officer on the B-59, a Foxtrot-class vessel, observed a compact in the event that they were unable to receive instructions from Moscow authorizing the use of a nuclear-armed torpedo on board. They agreed that to fire the torpedo against a surface ship, their vote had to be unanimous; if not, they would hold their fire. "

The vote reflected how President Trump’s plan to mend ties with Moscow has given way to acrimony. “We may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia,” Mr. Trump said, as he met NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, at the White House. Mr. Trump also said that NATO was “no longer obsolete.” Meanwhile in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin sat down with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for two hours yesterday evening, after keeping his guest dangling all day. They did not agree on much, according to Mr. Tillerson. _____ "
1188,The Broken Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/opinion/the-broken-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=40,2017/04/13,OPINION,"When he was discussing military strategy or diplomacy, Gen. Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, liked to invoke what he called the Pottery Barn rule: “If you break it, you own it.” Well, the Republicans broke the Supreme Court confirmation process. Now they own the Supreme Court. What do I mean? After all, didn’t Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, confirmed last Friday by a vote of 54 to 45 and sworn in on Monday, simply replace another Republican-appointed justice, Antonin Scalia? If the Republicans own the court now, wasn’t that true before Justice Scalia died in February of last year? There’s a crucial difference. Justice Scalia reached the Supreme Court in 1986 by the normal route, events following one another in typical fashion. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger announced his retirement. President Ronald Reagan chose a sitting associate justice, William H. Rehnquist, to replace him, simultaneously naming then-Judge Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to the Rehnquist seat. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducted a confirmation hearing, and the full Senate confirmed Justice Scalia unanimously to the seat he went on to occupy for nearly 30 years. Contrast that route to the one that brought Justice Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. The Senate’s Republican majority engaged in a 10-month blockade of President Barack Obama’s nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the same appeals court where Justice Scalia served, based on the astonishing argument that despite having been twice elected by wide margins, President Obama wasn’t entitled to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that arose on his watch. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has boasted that keeping the seat open — and thus keeping the future of the Supreme Court alive in conservative voters’ minds as a concrete issue because of an actual vacancy — played a decisive role in Donald Trump’s election. “The single biggest issue in bringing the Republicans home in the end was the Supreme Court,” Senator McConnell gloated to The Washington Post in February. In other words, it was raw politics all the way down, without even a fig leaf of a nonpolitical rationale. I’m not naïve. All presidents yearn for a Supreme Court legacy, and many tell fibs about the nominees they choose. President Reagan presented Robert H. Bork as a “moderate.” He wasn’t. President George H. W. Bush described Clarence Thomas as the best-qualified person for the job. He wasn’t. That’s all just part of the game. Of course the Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process is political; how could it be otherwise? But the Republicans rewrote the rules well before their decision last week to abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court confirmation votes. Making an existing Supreme Court vacancy a highly visible part of an electoral strategy stamps the court as an electoral prize, pure and simple. In doing so, it places the court in a position of real institutional peril. "
1189,How to Stand Up to Trump and Win,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/opinion/how-to-stand-up-to-trump-and-win.html?searchResultPosition=39,2017/04/13,OPINION,"BOSTON — After President Trump’s election, a wave of furious opposition erupted. It was an emotional mix of denial and anger, the first two stages of grief, and it wasn’t very effective. Yet increasingly that has matured into thoughtful efforts to channel the passion into a movement organized toward results. One example: the wave of phone calls to congressional offices that torpedoed the Republican “health care plan.” Yes, Trump opponents lost the election and we have to recognize that elections have consequences. But if “resistance” has a lefty ring to it, it can also be framed as a patriotic campaign to protect America from someone who we think would damage it. So what are the lessons from resistance movements around the world that have actually succeeded? I’ve been quizzing the experts, starting with Gene Sharp, a scholar here in Boston. Sharp’s works — now in at least 45 languages and available free online — helped the Baltic countries win freedom from Russia, later guided students in bringing democracy to Serbia, and deeply influenced the strategy of Arab Spring protesters. Sharp is THE expert on challenging authoritarians, and orders for his writings have surged since Trump’s election. "

What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Jimmy Kimmel took some cracks at the White House on Wednesday for the trouble it seemed to be having with the annual Easter Egg Roll. “This sort of thing should be the easy stuff,” Mr. Kimmel sighed. This year, the company that typically provides wooden eggs for the event resorted to Twitter to remind members of the Trump family that the deadline for orders was nearing. And the problems seem to have continued. Mr. Kimmel says he thinks he knows why: President Trump assumed the Easter Egg Roll “was a menu item at P. F. Chang’s.” Conan O’Brien piled on, too. Kids these days, they aim high. Too high sometimes, Jimmy Kimmel says. When he heard about “celebrity promposals” — a trend where high schoolers ask stars to prom in elaborate ways, and sometimes even get to yes — he took those self-important whippersnappers down a notch.

Robert Bentley, the now-famous “Love Gov”? Bentley resigned this week after a long-running sex scandal. Trump, who used to be a king of sex scandals, doesn’t have any presidential ones. When the day is done and the moon is high, our chief executive now appears to be moved mainly by the siren song of Fox and Twitter. But nobody’s forgotten those girl-grabbing tapes from the campaign. There’s also currently a grope-related lawsuit. And recently, his sympathetic take on Bill O’Reilly’s multiple sexual harassment problems. Plus, face it: These days we cannot possibly talk about anything without bringing up Donald Trump: chocolate cake, funny dog videos, Easter, professional wrestling, Millard Fillmore.… But first, Governor Bentley. Our story begins in 2014, when he was re-elected by a whopping margin, wearing the image of a kindly family man. However, during the march to victory, his wife recorded her husband having a conversation with campaign aide Rebekah Mason that centered heavily around feeling up Mason’s breasts. And his staff couldn’t help noticing that the governor started calling Mason “baby” during staff meetings. Lots and lots of incidents later, Mrs. Bentley filed for divorce after 50 years of marriage. She also gave investigators a ton of love texts — thanks to what appeared to be a certain technological ineptitude on the part of her husband. (They included the immortal “Bless our hearts. And other parts.”) "

s we took a seat in the back of the Commissary, a restaurant on the Sony Pictures Studios lot, Mike Judge pointed out a man seated two booths away. It was Tom Rothman, the chairman of Sony Pictures and former head of Fox’s film division, where he oversaw the rocky release of Judge’s 2006 film, “Idiocracy.” The movie imagined America 500 years in the future, populated and ruled by absolute morons, its infrastructure crumbling, its cities piled high with trash, everyone anesthetized by impossibly stupid television like the hit show “Ow! My Balls!” Though the film finished shooting in 2004, the studio mothballed it for more than a year. When “Idiocracy” was finally released, it wasn’t screened for critics or promoted in any other way — there wasn’t even a trailer — and it was shown in only seven cities, New York not among them. The studio, it seemed, was fulfilling the bare minimum of its contractual obligations, as if hoping that the movie would just go away. I asked Judge about a rumor that surrounds the film: that Fox spiked it because it lampooned so many of Fox’s advertisers, not to mention Fox News itself. (Its anchors, in the film, look as if they just walked in from a porn set.) Judge explained that, actually, the movie had tested abysmally with audiences. And because his first live-action film, “Office Space,” had become a hit despite initially bombing, Fox figured it might as well not bother with much marketing — that the movie would take off on its own or recoup its budget in the home-video market. But he’d heard the other version of the story too. As if on cue, Rothman approached our table, wearing glasses and a pinkish Oxford, carrying an antique lacrosse stick with a tennis ball in the basket, cradling it back and forth as he talked. He was with a friend named Lars Tiffany, who was wearing a Virginia Lacrosse shirt and, as a matter of fact, had recently been installed as the head coach of men’s lacrosse at the University of Virginia, and had taken his team to the studio to meet Rothman. “This is Mike Judge himself,” Rothman said to Tiffany. Then Judge introduced me to Rothman, explaining that I was from The Times: “Be careful what you say.” “You’re doing a profile of Mike?” Rothman asked, beaming with excitement, which seemed to be his default mode. “You can’t possibly do a profile of Mike without talking to me! About his [expletive] movie career! Goddamn right! ‘Office Space’! ‘Office Space’ and ‘Idiocracy’!” Judge, who speaks so softly I often found myself nudging my recorder closer to him, was beginning to tell Rothman that we had just been talking about “Idiocracy” when Rothman started up again. “O.K., so lemme just say, I’ll give you the simple answer: ‘Office Space’ is to his credit, and ‘Idiocracy’ is entirely my fault.” He turned to Judge. “Right?” “I agree,” Judge said. “He was [expletive] ahead of his time. As always. As always.” “I should’ve made it 10 years later and set in the present.” Rothman turned to me. “He had it. You’re gonna see it. How absolutely. Terri-fy-ingly. Prescient it is.” He was picking up momentum. “Right now? ‘Idiocracy’? One of the great documentaries of our era!” he said, physically punctuating his point in such a way that he managed to thump a diner sitting behind him with the lacrosse stick. "

1196,Which Force is More Harmful to the Arts: Elitism or Populism?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/books/review/which-force-is-more-harmful-to-the-arts-elitism-or-populism.html?searchResultPosition=32,2017/04/13,BOOK REVIEW,"In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Adam Kirsch and Liesl Schillinger discuss the art yielded by populist and elite mind-sets. Adam Kirsch The division between ‘real Americans’ and ‘coastal elites’ seems to be deepening into an abyss. The question of whether literature can, or ought to, appeal to a wide audience is one that tends to become urgent in times of political crisis. When a whole civilization is in danger, it is natural to feel that all hands are needed on deck, fighting in defense of cherished values. And how can an undemocratic art be enlisted in the cause of democracy? Isn’t it vital to appeal to the whole people, rather than just a few highbrows? No wonder these issues are beginning to be raised again in the age of Trump, as the division between “real Americans” and “coastal elites” seems to be deepening into an abyss. The last time this debate dominated American letters was the 1930s, when the Depression at home and the rise of fascism in Europe led most literary people to positions on the left. The question that divided them was whether political virtue meant writing about and for “the people” — as followers of the Popular Front, a Communist-inspired coalition of left groups, believed — or whether the most radical and progressive work was necessarily too difficult for mass consumption. The critic Lionel Trilling complained about the average liberal’s assumption that “wit, and flexibility of mind, and perception, and knowledge were to be equated with aristocracy and political reaction, while dullness and stupidity must naturally suggest a virtuous democracy.” The truth is, however, that few writers ever make a conscious choice between elitism and populism, difficulty and accessibility. Writers write as their minds and fates compel them to: Virginia Woolf could not have written a populist epic like “The Grapes of Wrath” any more than John Steinbeck could have written a modernist study like “To the Lighthouse.” The same holds true for writers who are classed as nonliterary, authors of genre best sellers. I would wager that even the most commercial writers seldom produce work cynically, according to a formula. Rather, they write as they can and must, and their talent happens to be of a kind that produces best sellers. "

With Hillary Clinton standing by his side yesterday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law a first-of-its-kind program providing free tuition to students at public colleges and universities in New York State. But it’s more complicated than it sounds, and it comes with caveats. We checked in with David W. Chen, a New York Times investigative reporter who has been covering the free-tuition plan, called the Excelsior Scholarship, to understand how it will work. How free is free tuition? It’s actually not. Excelsior would fill in the gaps of costs not covered by financial aid, Mr. Chen said. It would need to be added on top of other scholarships and grants to make college free. For students who are not receiving any other financial aid — those who are making too much money to qualify for need-based support — Excelsior would help even more. “It’s primarily aimed at middle-class families,” Mr. Chen said, “and the governor has been clear about that from the beginning.” How much would a family pay after the scholarship? The total cost — tuition, fees, and room and board — for four years at a State University of New York college is about $83,000 — roughly $21,000 per year or $10,000 per semester. This program would pay about $26,000. Families would still need to shoulder nearly $60,000 to send a student to college. "

Mr. Trump no longer wants to label China a currency manipulator or to eliminate the Export-Import Bank. He might also consider reappointing Ms. Yellen when her term ends next year. His approach to issues like taxes and health care appears more muddled, but there is some suggestion that he is edging toward a mainstream economic approach. To Debevoise & Plimpton, apparently. In the past year, the law firm has hired the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the director of the agency’s enforcement unit, and a prominent federal judge.

The political, social and even medical consequences of this recession have been duly noted, but even so the depths of its effects are only now becoming clear. One we’re still learning more about is how the rural, less populated regions of the country (known among demographers as nonmetropolitan counties), which already suffered from higher than average poverty rates, recovered from the recession at a far slower pace than more populous metropolitan counties. The fact that people living outside big cities were battered so acutely by the recession goes a long way toward explaining President Trump’s victory in the last election. In Luzerne County, in northeast Pennsylvania, population 316,383 and falling, the unemployment rate in February 2017 was 6.7 percent, substantially higher than it had been at the start of the recession (it was at 4.6 percent in October 2007). The total number of people in the county labor force declined by 2,544. In 2016, Luzerne County, which had twice previously cast majorities for Obama, supported Trump 57.9 to 38.6 percent.

The case concerned a Missouri program to make playgrounds safer that excluded ones affiliated with churches, but it had implications for all kinds of government aid to religious institutions. “This is a clear burden on a constitutional right,” Justice Elena Kagan said of the exclusion in the playground program. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, the court’s newest member, said the program amounted to “discrimination on the basis of status of religion.” “We know that’s happened in this case, right?” he asked, leaving no doubt that he thought the answer was yes. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the most consistent voice on the other side, though she seemed to be in the minority. “They’re just saying,” she said of the state, “we don’t want to be involved with the church.” The question in the case, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, No. 15-577, is whether officials in Missouri were entitled to reject an application from a Lutheran church for a grant to use recycled tires to resurface a playground. "

Trump made coal miners a central metaphor of his presidential campaign, promising to “put our miners back to work” and look after their interests in a way that the Obama administration did not. Now, three months into his presidency, comes a test of that promise. Unless Congress intervenes by late April, government-funded health benefits will abruptly lapse for more than 20,000 retired miners, concentrated in Trump states that include Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Many of the miners have serious health problems arising from their years in the mines. In mining areas like Uniontown, Pa., and surrounding Fayette and Greene Counties, which Mr. Trump carried 2 to 1, it is an upsetting and potentially costly prospect. “It’s just a terrible, terrible feeling,” said one of the retirees, David VanSickle, who spent four decades at work in the mines. “I think about that 25 times a day.” The president has offered no public comment on the issue, even as he has rolled back regulations on mine operators, an omission that has not escaped the notice of Mr. VanSickle and other retired miners. “To me, that was kind of a promise he did make to us,” Mr. VanSickle said about Mr. Trump, whom he supported last fall. “He promised to help miners, not just mining companies.” Responsibility for the retirees’ health plans has increasingly shifted to the federal government in recent years, as struggling coal companies have shed their liabilities in bankruptcy court. Congress voted last fall to finance benefits for a large group of retirees for several months, but House and Senate Republican leaders have yet to agree on a longer-term solution. "
1202,Tom Brady Skips Patriots’ White House Visit Along With Numerous Teammates,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/sports/-new-england-patriots-visit-white-house-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=87,2017/04/19,SPORTS,"During a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday, President Trump singled out several members of the New England Patriots, including wide receiver Danny Amendola, calling for them to raise a hand or step forward for acknowledgment. But Amendola was not there, nor were two dozen or more other players for the Super Bowl champions. The customary White House visit for sports champions has become especially fraught since Trump was elected, with some athletes saying they would reject an invitation for political reasons. The issue was stark on Wednesday, when a relatively small contingent of Patriots players flanked the president. A Patriots spokesman, Stacey James, said Wednesday night that 34 players had attended, similar to the turnout when President George W. Bush hosted them in 2004 and 2005. He said that more than 45 players attended the ceremonies in 2002, after the franchise’s first Super Bowl, and that in 2015, when Barack Obama was president, the number of players approached 50. James said that one reason substantially fewer players showed up this time as compared to 2015 was that some veteran players did not see the need to go twice in three years. James said, however, that the size of the Patriots’ full delegation for each trip to the White House has been roughly the same. Some photos of the ceremonies include support staff, he said, making the turnout appear bigger. That, he said, was the case in 2015. The White House did not immediately respond to an email inquiring about Wednesday’s turnout. Quarterback Tom Brady was among those who did not attend Wednesday’s ceremony, citing family matters. Trump did not mention Brady, the Super Bowl’s most valuable player,during the ceremony. Brady had been spotted in 2015 with one of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” hats in his locker. "

Mr. Chaffetz, 50, a Utah Republican who relished his oversight role more under a Democratic administration, said he was ready to return to the private sector after more than 13 years in public service, calling his decision a “personal” one. “I have long advocated public service should be for a limited time and not a lifetime or full career,” he said in a statement posted on Facebook. “After more than 1,500 nights away from my home, it is time.” He said his decision was not based on health or political concerns, adding that he was “confident” of his re-election should he have pursued it and retained support from Speaker Paul D. Ryan for his committee chairmanship. More than 18 months out from the election in the heavily Republican district, there were already possible signs of a challenging race in Mr. Chaffetz’s future. Kathryn Allen, a physician and political newcomer running as a Democrat, has raised nearly $400,000 more than Mr. Chaffetz this year, The Salt Lake Tribune reported Sunday — most of it from donors outside Utah. And Mr. Chaffetz had also acquired a primary challenger: Damian W. Kidd, a lawyer and another newcomer who accused the congressman of caring more about himself than his district. Last year, Mr. Chaffetz publicly weighed running for governor of Utah in 2020, when his committee chairmanship would expire. "
1204,Dave Chappelle Is an American Folk Hero,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/t-magazine/dave-chappelle-profile.html?searchResultPosition=85,2017/04/19,T MAGAZINE,"Eleven years on the road doing standup has given the comedian a unique empathy for the people of this country. TWELVE YEARS AND two presidents ago, he suddenly bolted from his mega-hit Comedy Central series, “Chappelle’s Show,” leaving a $50 million contract on the table. Over those years, Dave Chappelle became a human “Where's Waldo,” his every sighting a TMZ or social media moment: There he is getting coffee in Santa Monica! There he is hosting “Juke Joint,” his live music showcase, in a sweaty cow barn in Ohio! There he is at the 2016 Academy Awards, supporting his homie, Chris Rock! There he is at his Ohio town hall, attending a meeting on police-community relations! And there he is hosting “Saturday Night Live” last November, for the first time ever, days after Donald Trump’s victory, because creator Lorne Michaels begged him to do so, “before I die.” For Chappelle, the show was also a way to pay tribute to A Tribe Called Quest’s recently deceased Phife Dawg. For the audience, it was the revelation of: Yes, that dude is still the funniest man in America. Michaels had also specifically wanted Chappelle to be the first postelection host, which might have struck some as mad risky — “I have this reputation for being, like, unpredictable,” Chappelle admits — and this was the comedian’s first time performing live on network television, in a divided America no less. For Chappelle himself, the moment “felt bigger than Trump winning the election,” he says. “Trump winning the election felt like a force of nature. Me coming back to television in that fashion felt like the arduous task. I bumped into Louis CK the night before and he told me, don’t do your actual monologue in rehearsal, and that was probably the best advice anyone had given me. ... I just did a fake monologue at rehearsal.” The actual monologue had a shocker, ending with a peace sign to the new president, all the more powerful coming from Chappelle: He said, give Trump a chance, and vice versa. “I said we demand he gives us a chance,” says Chappelle. “I didn’t softball ’em.” He did not vote for Donald Trump, but “welcome to the world, this is how it goes — tyranny of the majority, or tyranny of the minority in this case,” he says. And, if nothing else, “I feel like a lot of people in America understand what the political process felt like for disenfranchised people.” "
1205,5 Takeaways as Georgia House Race Heads to Overtime,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/georgia-election-takeaways.html?searchResultPosition=84,2017/04/19,U.S.,"Democrats nearly captured Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday night, as the party’s candidate, Jon Ossoff, took 48 percent of the vote in an open primary. The race, which now heads to a runoff, was closely watched as a test of Republican strength — and Democratic energy — in a conservative-leaning district. Here are some of our top takeaways. Mr. Ossoff, 30, a documentary filmmaker and former congressional staff member, fell short of a majority, but by winning 48 percent of the vote he signaled that the race is a long way from over. Republicans acknowledged that the June 20 runoff is likely to be competitive and that Mr. Ossoff’s Republican opponent, Karen Handel, 55, a former Georgia secretary of state, will have to work hard to raise money and energize rank-and-file conservatives. A one-on-one contest may favor Ms. Handel. The district is more Republican than Democrat and a standard-issue, right-versus-left message has typically worked there in the past. But Ms. Handel is also quite likely to face a delicate political challenge: appealing to right-of-center voters, in a suburban Atlanta area where President Trump is not especially popular, without alienating his passionate fans. She will need strong support from both groups to defeat Mr. Ossoff. Special elections are often sleepy affairs that draw only die-hard voters to the polls. That’s not what happened in Georgia. Strategists tracking the race thought that a turnout of 160,000 voters would be a lot. In the end, more than 194,000 people voted, nearly matching the turnout in the 2014 midterms. "

A Lesson Plan About the Recent Rise of Europe’s Far-Right Parties,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/learning/lesson-plans/echoes-of-history-a-lesson-plan-about-the-recent-rise-of-europes-far-right-parties.html?searchResultPosition=83,2017/04/19,LESSON PLANS,"Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Front party, is expected to produce a strong showing in France’s first round of presidential elections on April 23. Her campaign is emblematic of a growing movement of far-right parties across Europe and the globe. Ms. Le Pen’s promise to give “France its freedom back, and give the people a voice” is echoed in nationalist, populist rally cries worldwide. In this lesson, students will analyze the growth of far-right  movements in Europe and around the world. They will explore the movements’ geneses, uncover their core messages and compare and contrast their leaders across time and place. _________ Warm Up: Voices from Europe’s Far Right In the past few years Europe’s far-right parties have achieved electoral success unseen since World War II. While the particularities of each party vary from nation to nation, they share underlying messages of national pride and xenophobia. At the core of their platforms is the belief that the political establishment has failed to provide for its people. Far-right party leaders call for a new era of politics powered by the people for the people, though their definition of “the people” is narrow, limited to a nativist ideology. The establishment finds the far right’s success at the polls inconceivable, but the far right claims that their popularity is not without precedent. They point to the failures of globalization, stagnant economies and rising immigration, particularly from Muslim nations, as the sources of their progress. Part 1 We begin the lesson with Time Magazine’s short video “Voices from Europe’s Far Right.” As students watch, we invite them to create a See-Think-Wonder chart and to consider the following questions: • What images or symbols do you see?
• What words or phrases do you see and hear?
• What issues do you think are at the heart of Europe’s far-right movements?
• What questions do you have about the far right in Europe? After viewing the video one or two times, we encourage students to share their observations, ideas and questions. Record student questions on a poster to drive the inquiry process throughout the lesson. "

Mr. O’Reilly, on vacation in Italy for the past week, sat in a V.I.P. section and shook hands with Francis. The encounter came hours before 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, announced that Mr. O’Reilly had been forced out of his position after dozens of advertisers abandoned his highly rated program and the Murdoch family, which owns 21st Century Fox, began to show signs of eroding support. The family had supported Mr. O’Reilly in the past, but a New York Times article this month detailing harassment allegations against him put his standing atop cable television news in jeopardy. The Vatican said last week that no official audience with Mr. O’Reilly was scheduled or would occur. But the weekly audience is a large event open to the public, with tens of thousands of the faithful filling the square. The special section beside the stage holding the papal throne, where Mr. O’Reilly sat, is exclusive and can be entered only with special tickets. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, wrote to the Vatican several months ago requesting tickets for Mr. O’Reilly and his family, according to Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for Cardinal Dolan. “The Cardinal is often asked to assist people from the Archdiocese of New York who are going to Rome, and always does his best to help,” Mr. Zwilling wrote in an email. “As in all cases, the decision is ultimately up to Rome.” "

Human rights officials have warned that bombing Al Hudaydah could lead to a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and Mr. Mattis’s remarks were in line with those of many officials in the region that the Saudi coalition’s war against the Houthis, begun two years ago, cannot be won militarily. American officials hinted at additional military and intelligence support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen. They said a stepped-up military campaign against the Houthi fighters who have taken over the capital and portions of the country may be necessary to bring the group and its ally, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen, to the negotiating table. “In Yemen, our goal is to push this conflict into U.N.-brokered negotiations to make sure it is ended as soon as possible,” Mr. Mattis said during a short news conference after a night and a day of meetings with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The defense secretary said Iranian support for the Houthis was destabilizing Yemen, and he talked up the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Relations are enjoying salad days in the Trump administration after years of friction between the administration of Barack Obama and the Saudi leadership, which thought Obama officials were too friendly with Iran. Mr. Mattis’s two-day visit, the start of a weeklong tour of the region, is setting the stage for President Trump’s first visit as president to the oil-rich nation. While no date has been announced, Saudi officials visiting Washington last month broached the idea of a visit with their Trump counterparts, which got a positive reception from the president and his team. “Now that we have the blessing of our leadership, it’s important that we actually do something with it,” Mr. Mattis said. “So what we can do here today could actually open the door possibly to bringing our president to Saudi Arabia.” "

One thing that gave us hope, given President Trump’s personality, was that the adults around him would restrain his wilder tendencies and make sure that truth prevailed. I expected better of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. I expected them to be fully informed, and I expected them to be willing to stand up to this president. The times we live in are truly more dangerous than I thought. MARTIN G. EVANS

The United Nations General Assembly could agree, by majority vote, to enter into a treaty negotiated by the Secretariat with one or more directly affected countries — Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, even Iraq — to set up a hybrid tribunal with extraterritorial jurisdiction over the Syrian situation, including crimes of ISIS. There is more than enough evidence already being compiled to make this feasible. Trials in absentia pending ultimate arrest may be necessary. There are precedents in the tribunals for Sierra Leone, Lebanon and Cambodia to help guide such an initiative. The Russians and the Chinese could not wield a veto in the General Assembly. The United States, European governments and wealthy Arab states should exercise moral courage to co-sponsor a United Nations resolution and fund a special tribunal for Syria. DAVID SCHEFFER, CHICAGO The writer, a professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, is a former United States ambassador at large for war crimes issues (1997-2001). To the Editor: Justice does not come in the middle of a war. There is no time for reflection then. The culpability of the vanquished can be determined only by trusted arbiters based on evidence adduced after the end of hostility. History is instructive: hearings before the Permanent Court of International Justice (later the International Court of Justice) after World War I; the Nuremberg Tribunal after World War II; and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. Seeking justice for Syria’s war victims at the hands of President Bashar al-Assad at this time runs the risk of a conflagration between Russia and the United States, which have become enemies as surrogates of the pro- and anti-Assad protagonists in Syria. But relief for Syria’s surviving war victims is readily available if the insecurity, selfishness and racism of isolationists can be addressed. The United States is repeating its sin of denying refuge to Jews during the Holocaust. WILLIAM ROGERS SCHLECHT

1211,Review: Worried About a Sustainable Tomorrow? There’s Hope,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/movies/tomorrow-review.html?searchResultPosition=77,2017/04/19,MOVIES,"You’ll want to see “Tomorrow” if you’re fuming over President Trump’s proposed slashing of the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget, his vow to exit the Paris climate accord or the fact that there’s a general perception (not just among politicians) that the effects of climate change are far-off. This French documentary convincingly explains why those views are gravely misguided, but its real triumph is its pervasive feeling of hope. It’s refreshing to see concrete solutions at work, many of them at the grass-roots level. And the optimism of those countering ineffective politicians and big business is infectious. The filmmakers — the French actress Mélanie Laurent and the civic activist Cyril Dion — interview their subjects during an intercontinental expedition that takes them to Detroit and Todmorden, England, where urban gardening initiatives flourish; San Francisco, which has an enviable recycling and composting program; Normandy, France, where intercropping ensures that “each plant plays a role in the ecosystem”; a village near Chennai, India, whose decentralized democracy reflects the residents’ priorities; Copenhagen, with its renewable energy model and biking culture; and many points in between. At times, it feels as if the strikingly composed “Tomorrow” — fast-paced and divided into chapters focusing on food, energy, the economy, democracy and education — would have better served viewers as a multi-episode documentary series, with each theme getting its own segment. Yet the editing team helps evoke an overall sense of lighthearted adventure; the narration is punchy and personal; the pop score (mostly by Fredricka Stahl) is catchy; and the hopscotching visuals are as vibrant as the subjects profiled. The overriding message? It takes a community to make change. To paraphrase the Leonard Cohen song “Everybody Knows,” the dice may be loaded, but good guys can win, especially when they band together.

1212,Can Elections Like Georgia’s Help Predict Future Races?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/georgia-6th-congressional-bellwether.html?searchResultPosition=76,2017/04/19,U.S.,"The congressional election in Georgia this week was billed as having potential national implications, as an early test of whether anti-Trump energy could fuel Democratic victory in a traditionally Republican district. It seems likely that the same will be said for scattered upcoming special elections in other states. But political scientists and pollsters who analyze races for a living say that so-called bellwether races are tricky to evaluate — if they even exist at all. Edward R. Tufte, a professor of political science and statistics at Yale who wrote a landmark paper on the subject in 1975, was brief in his response to a question about the validity of using such races to predict the results of midterm elections in 2018. “Bellwethers only exist after the fact, are astrology, and indicate only that it’s a slow day at the national news desk,” he wrote in an email. Other experts were more circumspect. While races for seats like the Sixth Congressional District in Georgia this week, the Fourth District in Kansas last week and the coming election for Montana’s sole House seat in May do not necessarily have predictive power, they said, the outcomes could serve as a finger in the wind for the political conditions that President Trump’s administration has imposed on the country. David Rothschild, an economist at the Microsoft Research Lab who studies forecasting and public sentiment, said that elections like those in Georgia give experts actual voting data, a contrast to the stream of polling and punditry that usually animates political conversation.

But, he predicted, “they’re coming in.” They may have little choice. After a hard-fought campaign to fill a House seat in the Atlanta suburbs fell just short of outright victory on Tuesday, the House seat in Montana vacated by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is up next, and a groundswell of new activism on the left is demanding attention. Democrats have now chalked up a closer-than-expected loss in a House special election in Kansas this month and a near miss in Georgia, leading logically to discussions of how hard to play going forward — not only in the June 20 runoff between their first-time candidate Jon Ossoff and the Republican Karen Handel in Georgia, but also in looming House races in Montana and South Carolina. But grass-roots liberals are not about to let party leaders lapse back into traditional red state, blue state assumptions. Instead, the Democrats’ enthusiastic base is demanding to compete on terrain that once seemed forbidding, a formula for disputes now and in 2018 about where to put the party’s money and field operations. “The party clearly has no clue how to build and nurture a movement,” said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the liberal website Daily Kos, which has taken the lead in raising money for Democratic candidates first in Georgia, then Kansas and now Montana. “‘We’re going to lose, so stay out’ is not a winning message, ever, and it certainly doesn’t work in these times, when we have a national resistance energized and looking for ways to engage.” "

An oil industry official confirmed the account. The waiver application was made under the Obama administration, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, and the company has not dropped the proposal. The proposal is now before the Trump administration at a delicate time in Russian-American relations, with rising tensions over the war in Syria and a looming congressional inquiry into reports of Russian efforts to influence the United States presidential election. The appeal did not come up during Senate confirmation hearings for Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was Exxon Mobil’s chief executive before his nomination by President Trump and was known to have a strong working relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At the time, Mr. Tillerson and other company officials said they had not lobbied against the sanctions, which were imposed on Russia in response to its military intervention in Ukraine. But Mr. Tillerson and company officials did note that Exxon Mobil had received a waiver to complete drilling of an exploration well in Russia’s Arctic waters. Company officials also disclosed that they had urged Obama administration officials to make American sanctions consistent with European Union sanctions, which gave greater latitude to European companies to continue taking part in some Russian projects. The Exxon Mobil waiver request for the Black Sea was reported Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal. Asked about the waiver application, Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said, “We don’t comment on ongoing issues.” A Treasury representative said the department would not comment on individual licenses or waiver requests.

It is filled with the people who help make our smartphones, our favorite games, the apps we download. But many have also come to make something else, perhaps — a new life in America. These are just a few of the 85,000 people who come to work at American companies from as far away as India and China on H-1B visas, which are granted to highly skilled workers from overseas. Many, like Kaushik Gopal, land jobs at technology firms that have struggled to find enough American citizens with advanced math and science skills to fill their cubicles. Often, they hope to call the United States home. “What I have loved about the U.S. is that it didn’t matter where you came from,” Mr Gopal said. “Your past, your color or religion didn’t matter. If you did good work, there was a place for you here.” President Trump’s plans to change the rules that govern work visas and immigration have thrown the lives of many visa holders into limbo. “I’m always on guard because there is a chance that suddenly I’ll get the news that I’m no longer welcome,” said Mr. Gopal, 32, who first came to the United States in 2012.

While tech has often clashed with Mr. Trump, at least on this issue, many executives are cautiously optimistic. Why? They are not the biggest users of H-1B visas — that distinction goes to outsourcing companies — and some hope that changes to the program will help them bring highly educated workers to the United States. The tempered comments from technology executives stood in contrast to their opposition to earlier orders by Mr. Trump banning travelers from a handful of predominantly Muslim countries. Immigrants have risen to the pinnacle of the industry, leading icons like Google and Microsoft, and many rank-and-file workers from abroad have become entrepreneurs behind the most successful start-ups. Neeraj Agrawal, a venture capitalist with Battery Ventures in Boston, is supportive of the proposal to reform the visa lottery system, but he believes Mr. Trump should make it clear that people with skills and ambition are still wanted in the United States. “While they’re tweaking the system, I think it’s really important for the headline to read, ‘Immigrants Are Still Welcome Here,’” Mr. Agrawal said. “What I’m really worried about is, the undercurrent of tone and message people are hearing is that they’re no longer welcome. We have to get that right.” "

Adelson wants some big things from the Trump administration: banning the online poker sites that compete with his luxury casinos, for example, and moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. And while President Trump was not Mr. Adelson’s first choice during the Republican primary season last year, he has been generous since: The billionaire donated $5 million to the committee organizing Mr. Trump’s inauguration festivities — the largest single contribution given to any president’s inaugural committee. Some of the country’s wealthiest Republicans and its largest corporations had similar impulses. Documents released this week by Mr. Trump’s inaugural organizers provide a glimpse of the big-dollar frenzy of influence-seeking and peacemaking surrounding Mr. Trump’s swearing-in, which raised $107 million, twice as much money as any other inauguration. The stream of money is a striking contrast to the way Mr. Trump funded his campaign, chiefly with small donations and his own fortune. While some big checks for the inauguration came from longtime Trump friends and associates, much of the money came from the industries that have traditionally excelled at wielding Washington influence: telecommunications, tobacco and pharmaceutical giants, which have bankrolled presidential inaugurations for Republicans and Democrats alike. And a generous amount came from people who had been hostile to his candidacy. If the crowds at Mr. Trump’s swearing-in celebrations were relatively small, the checks paying for all the nonofficial festivities were not: Freed of many of the voluntary restrictions adopted by Mr. Trump’s predecessors, 48 people or corporations gave $1 million or more, according to the disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. Besides Mr. Adelson, they included a trust controlled by the coal industry billionaire Joseph W. Craft III; the parent company of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; and Robert Mercer, the billionaire investor and close ally of Stephen K. Bannon, a White House adviser.

The abrupt and once-unthinkable defenestration of Mr. O’Reilly on Wednesday leaves Fox News without the top-rated host in cable news — and with a potentially far-reaching shake-up in the channel’s vaunted evening lineup. Tucker Carlson, a conservative provocateur who joined Fox News’s prime-time ranks only three months ago, has been tapped to replace Mr. O’Reilly at 8 p.m. Eastern, beginning on Monday, the network said. Mr. Carlson has become, seemingly overnight, one of the network’s most vital players, a remarkable turnaround for a pundit whose bow-tied heyday had seemed behind him. Fox News’s afternoon ensemble show, “The Five,” which features a chatty round table of hosts, will take over Mr. Carlson’s 9 p.m. slot. If the exit of Mr. O’Reilly were not enough to rattle the executive suites at Fox News, the network must now navigate a drastic on-air overhaul at a rare moment when the channel is facing a challenge from its rivals. Fox News’s prime-time dominance over the last 15 years is a mantra inside the network. But last month, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC surged past Mr. Carlson at 9 p.m. in the coveted 25-to-54-year-old age bracket. CNN just announced a prime-time test next week for Jake Tapper, whose sharply critical analysis of President Trump has made him a journalistic star of the moment. "
1220,Chinese Activist Who Wanted Asylum in Taiwan Returns to China,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/asia/taiwan-china-asylum-zhang-xiangzhong.html?searchResultPosition=91,2017/04/19,ASIA PACIFIC,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s government said on Wednesday that a Chinese political activist who intended to apply for asylum had voluntarily returned to China after meeting with the immigration authorities. His departure spares the government a potential diplomatic tangle as it continues to seek information on the detention of a Taiwanese rights advocate in China last month. Zhang Xiangzhong, 48, an anticorruption campaigner who spent three years in prison in China, had arrived in Taiwan on April 12 as part of an eight-day group tour. The next day he abandoned the group and on Friday said in an interview with Radio Free Asia that he planned to apply for political refugee status. But according to a statement from Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, Mr. Zhang flew back to China on Wednesday morning with his tour group. Mr. Zhang, who had called for greater transparency from the Chinese government, was detained in 2013 for “gathering a crowd to disrupt public order.” In 2014 he was sentenced on what his lawyers said was a trumped-up charge of credit card fraud, and he was released last July. Mr. Zhang told Radio Free Asia that his conviction was based on a forced confession obtained through torture and that his health had deteriorated while in prison because of a lack of medication for his asthma. “There’s legitimate concern about Zhang’s safety after he’s sent back to China,” said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. Taiwan does not grant political asylum to Chinese citizens, although it has granted long-term residence for political reasons on a case-by-case basis. Taiwan had previously offered asylum but ceased doing so after several hijackings of planes by Chinese asylum seekers in the 1990s. China claims self-governed Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to annex it, adding an extra layer of complexity to cases of Chinese political refugees. "

Mr. Ossoff received 48.1 percent of the vote, just short of the 50 percent threshold needed to win the seat, and he will face Karen Handel, the top Republican vote-getter, in a June runoff. A documentary filmmaker and former congressional staff member, Mr. Ossoff, 30, had hoped to avert a runoff in the Sixth District, a Republican-dominated section of the Atlanta suburbs that had been represented by Tom Price, who is now Mr. Trump’s health and human services secretary. But despite his financial advantage — Mr. Ossoff had raised $8.3 million, more than quadruple that of the next-closest candidate — and a highly energized liberal base, a majority was just out of reach in a district that has not sent a Democrat to Congress since the Carter administration. Mr. Ossoff released a statement early Wednesday after the race was called. “This is already a remarkable victory,” he said. “We defied the odds, shattered expectations, and now are ready to fight on and win in June.” Mr. Ossoff’s strong showing will ensure that national Democrats continue to compete here and will increase pressure on the party to contest a special House election next month in Montana that it has so far ignored. Combined with Democrats’ better-than-expected performance in a special House election in Kansas last week, the Georgia result will be an immediate boon to Democratic groups, lifting their fund-raising and bolstering candidate recruitment efforts, while sobering Republicans who are assessing whether to run in Mr. Trump’s first midterm election. Already, Republican candidates and outside groups have had to spend over $7 million against Democrats in a series of deeply conservative districts. Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump, who had posted a number of Twitter messages on the contest in the last few days, claimed a victory for Republicans before the race was called. "

Yet all this is being played out in parallel with the crisis over the bellicose efforts by North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, to assemble a nuclear arsenal and the threatening rumbles this has provoked in Washington. It’s hard to imagine a worse time for a country to have a political convulsion. But want it or not, that’s where South Korea finds itself. And it need not prove disastrous: The fall of the president, Park Geun-hye, over arrant corruption marked the coming-of-age of a democracy that had hitherto regarded political malfeasance as a necessary adjunct of economic development. The challenge now is for the election of her successor to be an equally responsible exercise in selecting a president who can both advance the deep reforms demanded by the protesters and provide the intrepid leadership demanded by the military threat. The popular uprising against Ms. Park reflected more than indignation over the bribes she is accused of extorting with a shadowy confidante, Choi Soon-sil; it was a demand to end the cozy and sometimes collusive relationship between government and the family-controlled conglomerates that has dominated the economy for decades. In the best of times, that would be a tough task; the next president will enter office with Ms. Park on trial and Mr. Kim rattling missiles. "
1224,Why Are Republicans Making Tax Reform So Hard?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/why-are-republicans-making-tax-reform-so-hard.html?searchResultPosition=107,2017/04/19,OPINION,"In the aftermath of the health care blowup, President Trump and the Republicans need a legislative victory. Tax reform probably should have gone first, but now is the time to move it forward with urgency. Unfortunately, the White House seems all over the map on the subject. One day there is a trial balloon for a value-added tax. The next, the idea of a carbon tax or a reciprocal tax. And now we are hearing the curve ball of a payroll tax cut. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has thrown cold water on the idea of any tax bill meeting the August deadline. One sure lesson from the health care setback is the old admonition “Keep it simple, stupid.” The Republicans tried to fix the trillion-dollar health insurance market instead of keeping the focus on repealing Obamacare. They have a chance to make amends with a new tax bill and still hit the August deadline. We advised President Trump during his election campaign and we believe the Republican Party’s lesson for tax reform is this: Don’t try to rewrite the entire tax code in one bill. Instead, the primary goal of Mr. Trump’s first tax bill should be to fix the federal corporate and small-business tax system, which has made America increasingly uncompetitive in global markets and has reduced jobs and wages here at home. The White House and the Treasury already have a tax plan that we were involved with last year. The three most important planks of that plan are: First, cut the federal corporate and small-business highest tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, which is now one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Second, allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of their capital purchases. Full expensing of new factories, equipment and machinery will jump-start business investment, which since 2000 has grown at only one-third the rate recorded from 1950 to 2000. "
1225,Coal Museum Sees the Future; Trump Doesn’t,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/coal-museum-sees-the-future-trump-doesnt.html?searchResultPosition=106,2017/04/19,OPINION,"Did you catch this gem on CNN.com from April 6? “The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum in Benham, owned by Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College, is switching to solar power to save money. … Communications director Brandon Robinson told CNN affiliate WYMT that the project ‘will help save at least eight to ten thousand dollars, off the energy costs on this building alone.’” Go figure. The coal mining museum is going solar, for solid economic reasons, and President Trump is reviving coal, with no economic logic at all. This bizarre contrast speaks to a deeper question of leadership and how we judge presidents. Trump took two major national security decisions in the past few weeks. One was to strike Syria for using poison gas. Trump summoned his national security team, asked for options on Syria, chose the cruise-missile strike — which was right — and won praise for acting “presidential.” The other decision you didn’t see. It was Trump dismantling budgets and regulations undergirding U.S. climate and environmental protection policies — in his nutty effort to revive U.S. coal-fired energy — while quietly announcing plans to withhold a promised $32.5 million U.S. contribution for the U.N. Population Fund, which supports family planning and maternal health. Unlike the Syria decision, Trump made the second move without seeking a comprehensive briefing from experts — he controls the world’s greatest collection of climate scientists at NASA, NOAA, the E.P.A., the Pentagon and the C.I.A. — and without ever asking for an intelligence briefing on how the combination of climate change, environmental degradation, drought and population explosions helped trigger the civil war in Syria, spawn terrorist groups like Boko Haram around Africa’s central Lake Chad (which has lost 90 percent of its water mass since 1963) and become the main force pushing tens of thousands of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa into Europe each year, and from Central America up to the U.S. I promise you that Trump will spend the rest of his presidency dealing with the disruptions caused by this cocktail of population explosion and climate/environmental degradation — and his generals know it. But in today’s politics, bombing is considered presidential and ignoring science and defunding family planning, when populations are exploding and droughts expanding, are ho-hum back-page news. "
1226,A Requiem for ‘Girls’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/a-requiem-for-girls.html?searchResultPosition=105,2017/04/19,OPINION,"The romance between this newspaper and the HBO show “Girls” is somewhat legendary. Between its debut in 2012 and its finale last Sunday, according to some exhaustive data journalism from The Awl, The New York Times published 37 articles about the show, its fans, its creator and star, Lena Dunham, plus her co-stars’ clothes and paintings and workout routines and exotic pets. Except, fact-check: I made up the exotic pets, and The Awl’s list unaccountably failed to include my own contribution to The Times’s Dunham-mania, a love letter to the show’s flirtations with cultural reaction. Was some of this coverage excessive? Well, let’s concede that the ratio of thinkpieces (all over the web, not just in this newspaper) to actual viewers was considerably higher for “Girls” than for, say, “Game of Thrones.” Let’s concede that the media loved to talk about the show in part because it was set among young white people in Brooklyn, a demographic just possibly overrepresented among the people who write about pop culture for a living. Let’s concede that Dunham’s peculiar role in electoral politics, as one of the most visible and, um, creative millennial-generation surrogates for Barack Obama and then Hillary Clinton, played some role in the press’s fascination with her show. But now that we have the show in full, I think the scale of coverage actually holds up quite well — my own small part in it very much included. Indeed, I suspect that “Girls” will be remembered as the most interesting and important television show of the years in which it ran, to which cultural critics will inevitably return when they argue about art and society in the now-vanished era of Obama. Of course there are different kinds of cultural importance. Because its audience was small and its characters difficult and unpleasant and its material sometimes weird and often gross, “Girls” didn’t have (and didn’t seek) the kind of aspirational influence achieved by its young-hip-bedhopping-urbanite predecessors “Sex and the City” and “Friends.” Nor did it inspire the obsessive viewer love and endless imitators of Golden Age of Television™ dramas like “The Sopranos” and “Mad Men.” It was a niche taste with a niche audience; nothing substantial in American culture or the television industry was altered by its episodic story. But it was the equal of the prestige dramas and superior to “Friends” and “Sex and the City” as a scripted-acted-shot achievement, and reliably funnier (in a wince-inducing way) than any of them. And as a mirror held up to American culture, it showed something very different than its prestige-TV peers, something equally important and arguably more forward-looking and distinctive. "

Twenty Lessons From the Twentieth Century
By Timothy Snyder
126 pp. Tim Duggan, paper, $7.99. The months after Donald Trump was elected president have been boom times for scholars of authoritarianism. Masha Gessen wrote a widely circulated essay on the New York Review of Books website entitled “Autocracy: Rules for Survival.” In that vein, Snyder offers practical advice to #TheResistance in “On Tyranny,” a brief book that started life as a Facebook post. Unlike public intellectuals who casually toss around the word “fascist” to describe a disappointing restaurant salad, Snyder knows this subject cold. He is a Yale University historian who has written at length on fascism, Communism and the Holocaust. That gives “On Tyranny” a particular urgency. It is littered with vignettes of how Germans in the 1930s aided and abetted Hitler’s rise to power. It is impossible to read aphorisms like “post-truth is pre-fascism” and not feel a small chill about the current state of the Republic. Snyder warns, “Americans today are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism or Communism in the 20th century.” He offers political advice ranging from straightforward (“Defend institutions”) to insightful (“Be calm when the unthinkable arrives”). For such a small book, Snyder invests “On Tyranny” with considerable heft. At times, though, “On Tyranny” veers toward overwrought. Trump’s brand of populist nationalism may be illiberal, but it is also not very popular. Since his inauguration, a critical free press, independent judiciary, patriotic Civil Service and robust social movements have placed significant constraints on Trump’s actions. When Snyder intimates that 2016 might be the last free election in the United States for a while, one wonders if the book will become self-defeating because of its hyperbole. Of course, just as I was pondering whether “On Tyranny” exaggerates, Trump tweeted that the press is the enemy of the American people. That sounds awfully pre-fascist to me. So approach this short book the same way you would a medical pamphlet warning about an infectious disease. Read it carefully and be on the lookout for symptoms. "
1228,A ‘Members Only’ Public Space in Manhattan? Join the Club,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/nyregion/public-space-trump-tower.html?searchResultPosition=103,2017/04/19,NEW YORK,"During Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, a curious feature of the lobby in Trump Tower in Manhattan became a sideline distraction: Kiosks selling merchandise occupied the open public space where seating should have been. After $14,000 in fines and at least a year of back-and-forths, the benches were reinstalled. But the building continues to violate the terms of its decades-old agreement, according to a new audit completed by the office of the New York City comptroller, Scott M. Stringer. Auditors found that it lacked many of the tables it is required to provide the public, part of an agreement that had allowed Mr. Trump to build his tower 20 stories higher than originally allowed. The building was one of more than 180 properties where public spaces did not comply with the city’s rules — more than half of all locations with privately owned public spaces in New York, according to the audit. Privately owned public spaces, commonly known as POPS, are areas that developers have agreed to provide the public in exchange for leniency on certain zoning requirements. They have been a quirk of the New York landscape since the 1960s, when they were pioneered before spreading to other cities around the world. And they are plentiful in Manhattan — Zuccotti Park, of Occupy Wall Street fame, is one — where they have been a popular mechanism for developers to build taller, more valuable buildings in areas with limited space.

Others cheered for Washington, calling the deployment a powerful symbol of its commitment to deterring the North. On Wednesday, after it was revealed that the carrier strike group was actually thousands of miles away and had been heading in the opposite direction, toward the Indian Ocean, South Koreans felt bewildered, cheated and manipulated by the United States, their country’s most important ally. “Trump’s lie over the Carl Vinson,” read a headline on the website of the newspaper JoongAng Ilbo on Wednesday. “Xi Jinping and Putin must have had a good jeer over this one.” “Like North Korea, which is often accused of displaying fake missiles during military parades, is the United States, too, now employing ‘bluffing’ as its North Korea policy?” the article asked. The episode raised questions about whether major allies of the United States, like South Korea and Japan, had been informed of the carrier’s whereabouts, and whether the misinformation undercut America’s strategy to contain North Korea’s nuclear ambitions by using empty threats. Compounding their anger over the Carl Vinson episode, many South Koreans were also riled at Mr. Trump for his assertion in a Wall Street Journal interview last week that the Korean Peninsula “used to be a part of China.” Although Korea was often invaded by China and forced to pay tributes to its giant neighbor, many Koreans say the notion that they were once Chinese subjects is egregiously insulting.

This experience has made me familiar with the North Koreans’ views on safeguarding their country’s security. I believe that President Trump is making a big mistake if he thinks that the threat of a military strike and escalating sanctions will persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Following a two-month review, the Trump administration has moved to implement a policy that emphasizes pressure — including the threat of military force and new sanctions against North Korea, as well as new restrictions intended to punish Chinese businesses with ties to Pyongyang. While the theory is that doing so will persuade North Korea to stop its provocative behavior, return to negotiations and give up its nuclear weapons, it won’t work that way. These threats will make the North Korean government only more likely to dig in its heels and move forward with its nuclear and missile programs, embroiling the United States in a festering crisis on the Korean Peninsula that could escalate out of control. For more than 60 years, North Korea has successfully resisted not only pressure from great powers, mainly the United States, but also attempts at manipulation by its patrons, the Soviet Union and China. This reflects a strong nationalism but also a principle dear to the North Koreans: that as a small country in a life-or-death confrontation with the world’s most powerful nation, any display of weakness would amount to national suicide. A longstanding, deeply ingrained view in Pyongyang is that Washington’s real agenda is to get rid of the North Korean regime because of the military threat it poses to American allies like South Korea and Japan, its widespread human rights violations and now its nuclear arsenal. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tried to reassure the North during his visit to Tokyo last month, saying, “North Korea and its people need not fear the United States or their neighbors in the region who seek only to live in peace with North Korea.” But Vice President Mike Pence’s assertion in Seoul this week that the United States seeks to end repression in North Korea, when viewed from Pyongyang, clearly translates into a policy of regime change. Threats like these reinforce a view in Pyongyang that North Korea needs nuclear weapons to shield it against a much larger, much more powerful country. That’s a message I have heard repeatedly from the North Koreans, most recently in a private meeting I attended with government officials who stated that their country would not have developed nuclear weapons if it did not see the United States as a threat or had not been subjected to American and South Korean provocations. American actions in other countries — whether backing regime change in Libya or launching airstrikes against Syria for its use of chemical weapons — strengthen that view. "

He raised a jaw-dropping $8.3 million, more than quadruple the haul brought in by the next-best fund-raiser, the Republican Dan Moody. Much of that money came from angry liberals outside Georgia hoping to send Mr. Trump a message at the ballot box. Locally, Mr. Ossoff was aided by formal and informal networks of progressives that sprouted and grew like mushrooms after Mr. Trump’s victory. Many participants were political neophytes and women who had taken part in the anti-Trump marches after the inauguration. Hundreds of highly motivated volunteers knocked on doors, wrote postcards to voters and drove them to the polls. ■ Georgia’s Sixth District, which encompasses a number of majority-white suburbs north of Atlanta, is home to a well-heeled professional class, and Mr. Ossoff’s résumé, if not necessarily his politics, is the type that would make any soccer mom proud. He received degrees from Georgetown University and the London School of Economics, and worked for five years on the staff of Representative Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat. Mr. Ossoff said he specialized, on Capitol Hill, in foreign affairs and national security issues. He currently leads a small documentary film company that produces content for international broadcasters. ■ Republicans grew increasingly worried about Mr. Ossoff in recent weeks as polls showed him leading the crowded pack in a district that has not elected a Democrat in decades. Their attack ads emphasized his youth and alleged inexperience, portrayed him as a “yes man” for Nancy Pelosi’s “liberal agenda,” and described darkly how his company produced films for Al Jazeera, which was called a “mouthpiece for terrorists.” Mr. Ossoff was also criticized for overstating his national security experience and living outside the district. Though his campaign used the slogan “Make Trump Furious,” Mr. Ossoff, in person, takes the opposite of a sound-and-fury approach. As a candidate, he tends to run more cool than hot, with a deliberative, professorial style somewhat similar to Barack Obama’s. He is unabashed about his support for traditional liberal causes, including abortion rights, but in television ads, he often emphasizes more anodyne positions, like fighting wasteful spending in Washington and creating more tech jobs at home. Early Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Mr. Ossoff would be “a disaster in Congress” and “VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes.” "
1236,Lawsuit Accuses Alt-Right Leader of ‘Terror Campaign’ Against a Jewish Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/splc-neo-nazi-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=95,2017/04/19,U.S.,"The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the publisher of a popular alt-right website, claiming that he orchestrated a “terror campaign” against a Jewish woman in Montana. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the woman, Tanya Gersh, accuses the publisher of The Daily Stormer, Andrew Anglin, of unleashing a “troll storm” by publishing an article in December that listed Ms. Gersh’s contact information and exhorted readers to “take action” against her. In the weeks and months that followed, the lawsuit contends, Mr. Anglin continued to publish pieces about Ms. Gersh. Along with her family, she received more than 700 harassing messages, including death threats, and a message on Twitter to her son suggesting that he pursue a free Xbox located inside an oven, the suit says. Speaking with reporters by telephone on Tuesday, Ms. Gersh said she is no longer working and attends trauma therapy twice a week. As a result, Richard Cohen, the law center’s president, said the group, along with its Montana-based co-counsel, intends to seek a “very, very substantive” award for damages, which will send a message that the “kind of hate” Mr. Anglin coordinated “has to stop.” “Our case is one about harassment and assault,” he said. “These actions have put Tanya in fear for her life, and that’s what they were intended to do.” Mr. Anglin did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Tuesday’s 64-page complaint is the latest salvo in a story that has engulfed the small city of Whitefish, Mont., a town nestled in the northwestern part of the state that, until recently, was known mostly for its mountains and other stunning slices of nature.

1237,Tillerson Toughens Tone on Iran After U.S. Confirms Nuclear Deal Compliance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/middleeast/trump-administration-grudgingly-confirms-irans-compliance-with-nuclear-deal.html?searchResultPosition=94,2017/04/19,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson described a landmark Iran nuclear deal as a failure on Wednesday, only hours after the State Department said Tehran was complying with its terms. But the top United States diplomat stopped short of threatening to jettison the 2015 agreement that was brokered by world powers, or saying whether the Trump administration would punish Iran with new sanctions. The whiplash left Republicans on Capitol Hill, who had universally excoriated the agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program and voted against its implementation, uncertain of how to respond. Its architects, however, said they were cautiously optimistic that the deal would stay in place. The nuclear deal “fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran,” Mr. Tillerson said. “It only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.” He said that Iran continued to threaten the United States and the rest of the world, and he announced that the Trump administration was reviewing ways to counter challenges posed by Tehran. It was an attempt to clarify a State Department certification, issued shortly before a midnight deadline on Tuesday, that said Iran was complying with the nuclear agreement that also eased crippling international sanctions against the Islamic republic’s economy. During the 2016 campaign, President Trump denounced the agreement as “the worst deal ever,” and Vice President Pence promised to rip it up. In a hastily called news conference at the State Department on Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson likened Iran to North Korea, whose nuclear weaponry and burgeoning missile technology is what the administration now believes is the gravest risk to world peace and security. Mr. Pence visited Seoul, South Korea, this week to declare that the United States was united with its allies to stem North Korea’s threat. "
1238,Georgia Didn’t Affirm Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/georgia-didnt-affirm-trump.html?searchResultPosition=93,2017/04/19,OPINION,"There are people who blushingly downplay their impact on the events around them. Then there is President Trump. “Glad to be of help!” he tweeted early this morning, in response to the results of a special Congressional election in Georgia, where a young Democrat with enormous momentum fell shy of the 50 percent of votes he needed to avoid a runoff in June. It was classic Trump, taking both an unwarranted victory lap and dubious, outsize credit. What happened in Georgia was hardly an affirmation of his leadership or sway. It was a dodged bullet: nothing more, nothing less. It wasn’t the end of the story, either. With just over 48 percent of the vote, the Democrat, Jon Ossoff, did well enough for liberal groups and party leaders to maintain enthusiasm going into the runoff, which pits him against Karen Handel, the top Republican finisher. Trump won this conservative Congressional district by just 1 percentage point in November, so the fact that Ossoff missed the 50-percent mark by 2 points will be credibly interpreted by some observers as a sign that there has been no great turn here away from Trump, no tide of disenchantment that amounts to a dire prophecy for Republicans in 2018. But this Congressional district can just as plausibly be seen as prime and enduring evidence of how underwhelming the support for Trump is and always was. The district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 23 percentage points. "
1239,Morning Agenda: What Happened at Goldman?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-earnings-.html?searchResultPosition=101,2017/04/19,DEALBOOK,"What kind of business do you associate with Goldman Sachs? The trading of bonds, currencies and commodities? Well, that’s a core part of its business. But the bank’s performance in those areas so far this year has been weak — an embarrassing setback when compared with strong profits in those businesses for competitors, like Bank of America and Citibank. So what happened? Clients sent fewer orders their way and less volatility in markets made it harder to profit from price swings. Goldman Sachs doesn’t want people to read too much into just one quarter’s earnings. But this is Goldman, so all of Wall Street was trying to work it out. (Investors punished the bank’s stock, which closed down 4.7 percent.) It wasn’t all bad. Goldman’s net revenue was higher than expected, and the firm is still first in the rankings for advising on mergers and acquisitions and for underwriting corporate stock offerings. Looking forward, Antony Currie writes in Breakingviews that the bank’s internal technology revolution cannot come soon enough. Goldman needs the higher returns that could come with its online retail banking unit, but it could still be a while before that makes enough to cover the shortcomings in other areas. "

Chairman, Moves to Roll Back Telecom Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/technology/ajit-pai-fcc-telecom-deregulation.html?searchResultPosition=69,2017/04/19,TECHNOLOGY,"WASHINGTON — Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, is taking the next steps to unwind Obama-era rules and other regulatory efforts that had restricted the abilities of telecommunication companies and broadcasters. With two items up for vote on Thursday that are expected to pass, Mr. Pai is carrying forward a swift Republican attack on telecom rules. The rollback will empower big telecom and media firms that have lobbied aggressively for deregulation, but consumer groups say it may also eventually put consumers at risk of higher prices and fewer options for services and media. Since being appointed by President Trump in January to lead the commission, Mr. Pai has abolished a plan to open the cable box market, suspended several participants from a program for low-income broadband subsidies, and chipped away at net neutrality, which guarantees consumers equal access to all internet content. A proposal to roll back net neutrality rules is expected as soon as this month. “In just three months, he’s taken many steps to reduce choices for consumers, make services more expensive or roll back the rights people thought they had online,” Phillip Berenbroick, the senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a left-leaning consumer group, said of Mr. Pai. The two specific items to be voted on Thursday include a plan to make it easier for broadband providers to charge other businesses higher prices to connect to the main arteries of their networks. The action would clear the way for internet service providers like AT&T and CenturyLink to raise connection fees charged to hospitals, small businesses and wireless carriers in many markets where there is little or no competition for so-called backhaul broadband service. The other item up for vote is a move to ease the limit on how many stations a broadcast television company can own. The action is expected to invite more consolidation in that sector. "

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Last weekend, a mostly abandoned town on the Salton Sea was transformed into a pageantry of art and opera and weirdness. The three-day Bombay Beach Biennale was free to attend, unpublicized and driven by a mission of local engagement. Call it the anti-Burning Man. The idea came from Tao Ruspoli, a Los Angeles filmmaker, who years ago became fascinated by the Salton Sea, a onetime tourist mecca straddling the Imperial and Coachella Valleys that has succumbed to environmental decay. He started visiting often and even bought a house in Bombay Beach, a speck of a town on the eastern shore. “This idea of Bombay Beach Biennale popped in my head because rather than play up the sadness of the place,” he said, “I thought it would be more interesting to play on the surrealness of the place.” "

An American Story
By Amy Goldstein
351 pages. Simon & Schuster. $27. Over the course of his career, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, has been described as a policy nerd, a lightweight, a canny tactician, a dreadful tactician, a man of principle and a man whose vertebrae have mysteriously gone missing. But in the opening pages of “Janesville: An American Story,” Amy Goldstein’s moving and magnificently well-researched ethnography of a small Wisconsin factory city on economic life support, Ryan is just another congressman, pleading on behalf of his hometown, population 63,000. It’s 2008, and Ryan has just received a phone call from Rick Wagoner, then the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, to alert him that the company will shortly be stopping all production in Janesville. The news is too improbable to register. Janesville has a storied place in labor history, changing and repurposing itself as the times required. Barack Obama used its plant as a backdrop for a speech about the economy early on in his 2008 campaign. Most presidential candidates eventually buzz through. The place has been manufacturing Chevrolets for 85 years. The congressman is stunned. “Give us Cavaliers,” he begs. “Give us pickups.” Any model other than the unpopular SUVs the plant is currently churning out, he means. “You know you’ll destroy this town if you do this!” he yells into the phone. Whether the closure of this fabled 4.8-million-square-foot facility does or does not destroy Janesville is for the reader to decide. Goldstein, a longtime staff writer for The Washington Post who was part of a reporting team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2002, opts for complexity over facile explanations and easy polemics. (Neither Obama nor Ryan comes off looking particularly good; and no, she does not conclude that these layoffs put Donald J. Trump in the White House.) Her book follows a clutch of characters over the course of five years, from 2008 to 2013, and concludes with an epilogue in the present, when unemployment in Janesville is less than 4 percent. "
1244,The Nine and a Half Months That Shook Fox News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/media/fox-news-timeline.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/04/19,MEDIA,"The ouster of Bill O’Reilly, the top-rated cable news host, from Fox News capped an extraordinary period of upheaval at the company, marked by a series of sexual harassment allegations that resulted in the downfall of Roger E. Ailes, the powerful chairman of the network, as well as a damaging exodus of advertisers. Here is a look at the nine and a half months that shook the network: JULY 6, 2016 Gretchen Carlson, a prominent Fox anchor, sends shock waves through the media world when she files a lawsuit against the Fox News chairman, Roger E. Ailes, accusing him of forcing her out after she refused his sexual advances and complained to him about persistent harassment in the newsroom. Ms. Carlson’s charges included an allegation that Mr. Ailes, during a meeting in his office, explicitly asked her for a sexual relationship, a public attack on a towering figure in broadcast journalism and Republican politics who had typically enjoyed absolute loyalty from his employees. JULY 20, 2016 The accusations do not stop with Ms. Carlson. The law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, hired by 21st Century Fox, the network’s owner, to investigate Ms. Carlson’s allegations, takes statements from at least six women who describe inappropriate behavior by Mr. Ailes, according to people briefed on the inquiry.

Mr. Ailes, the founding chairman of Fox News, envisioned a news network that would speak for those forgotten Americans who thought the rest of the media was talking down to them while abetting a liberal takeover of their country. He found one of those concerned citizens in the person of a midcareer, midlevel broadcaster named Bill O’Reilly, of Levittown, Long Island. With a white working-class background, and a perfectly perched chip on his shoulder, Mr. O’Reilly was the ideal personality for Mr. Ailes to build his network around. Mr. O’Reilly quickly climbed to the top of the cable ratings, then pulled the rest of the network along with him as he became one of the biggest stars in television news history. In so doing, he empowered Mr. Ailes to build Fox News into more than America’s No. 1 cable news network. Much more significantly, Mr. O’Reilly helped Mr. Ailes turn it into the beating heart of a new, populist conservative movement, one that reshaped the political landscape while making its parent company, 21st Century Fox, billions. And, finally, it became an important vehicle in the conservative convoy that delivered their mutual friend Donald J. Trump to the White House. "
1246,Donald Trump Threatens to Sabotage Obamacare,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/donald-trump-threatens-to-sabotage-obamacare.html?searchResultPosition=59,2017/04/19,OPINION,"After Republican leaders in Congress failed to destroy the Affordable Care Act last month, President Trump tweeted that the law would “explode.” Now he seems determined to deliver on that prediction through presidential sabotage. Mr. Trump is threatening to kill a program in the A.C.A. that pays health insurers to offer plans with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses to about seven million lower-income and middle-class people. The president thinks that this will get Democrats to negotiate changes to the 2010 health law. This is cruel and incredibly shortsighted. Without these subsidies, health care would be unaffordable for many Americans, including people who voted for Mr. Trump because they were frustrated by high medical costs. These subsidies lower the cost of medical care for people who earn between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that income is $24,600 to $61,500 a year. For example, the deductible on qualifying Obamacare policies for families living at the poverty line in Charlotte, N.C., would be $1,000, compared with $10,000 for a standard policy, according to government data. In Philadelphia a similar family would have no deductible, compared with a $5,000 deductible for policies without subsidies. The government is expected to spend $7 billion on subsidies in 2017, and nearly 60 percent of the 12.2 million people who bought Obamacare policies for 2017 benefit from them. Conservatives have been trying for years to end these subsidies in an effort to destabilize the A.C.A. House Republicans filed a lawsuit in 2014 to prevent the Obama administration from making these payments to insurers without appropriations from Congress. A Federal District Court ruled in the Republicans’ favor, but President Barack Obama appealed the case and the payments have continued — so far, at least. Mr. Trump has to decide how to proceed. It is not surprising that Mr. Trump would see the subsidies as a bargaining chip. Governing, to him, is a matter of quick-hit deals, and he shows no concern about gambling with the health of millions of people. Even if Mr. Trump does not end the subsidies, experts say, many insurers are already skittish about the administration’s animosity toward the A.C.A. They could stop selling Obamacare policies if the payments went away. Some counties in red states like Arizona, Oklahoma and Tennessee could be left with no insurers for individuals and families that do not get coverage through employers. Companies that remain would increase premiums by an average of 19 percent to make up for the loss of government money, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. "
1247,Trump Adviser’s Visit to Moscow Got the F.B.I.’s Attention,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/politics/carter-page-russia-trump.html?searchResultPosition=58,2017/04/19,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Ever since F.B.I. investigators discovered in 2013 that a Russian spy was trying to recruit an American businessman named Carter Page, the bureau maintained an occasional interest in Mr. Page. So when he became a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign last year and gave a Russia-friendly speech at a prestigious Moscow institute, it soon caught the bureau’s attention. That trip last July was a catalyst for the F.B.I. investigation into connections between Russia and President Trump’s campaign, according to current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials. It is unclear exactly what about Mr. Page’s visit drew the F.B.I.’s interest: meetings he had during his three days in Moscow, intercepted communications of Russian officials speaking about him, or something else. After Mr. Page, 45 — a Navy veteran and businessman who had lived in Moscow for three years — stepped down from the Trump campaign in September, the F.B.I. obtained a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing the authorities to monitor his communications on the suspicion that he was a Russian agent. From the Russia trip of the once-obscure Mr. Page grew a wide-ranging investigation, now accompanied by two congressional inquiries, that has cast a shadow over the early months of the Trump administration. At a House Intelligence Committee hearing last month, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, took the unusual step of publicly acknowledging the investigation of Russian interference in the election, which he said included possible links between Russia and Trump associates. Developments beyond Mr. Page’s trip may have heightened the F.B.I.’s concern about Russian meddling in the campaign. Paul Manafort, then Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, was already under criminal investigation in connection with payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. WikiLeaks and two websites later identified as Russian intelligence fronts had begun releasing emails obtained when Democratic Party servers were hacked. "

China’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the country had asked Interpol, the global police organization, to arrest the billionaire, Guo Wengui, hours before he appeared on television to deliver what he said would be a “nuclear bomb” of corruption allegations against the families of top Communist Party officials. Mr. Guo, 50, has lived abroad for the past two years after a business deal to acquire a brokerage went sour. In March, he accused the son of a former top Communist Party official of corruption. On April 15, The New York Times, citing corporate records and an interview with one of the official’s relatives, reported that some of his allegations could be substantiated. China asked Interpol to issue a so-called red notice to its member countries for Mr. Guo’s arrest, Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters on Wednesday in Beijing. Mr. Lu said that the notice had been issued, but that Mr. Guo’s name does not appear on Interpol’s wanted list. Interpol, in a statement, said that any of its 190 member countries could request that wanted notices not be publicized. Mr. Guo is accused of giving 60 million renminbi, or about $8.7 million, in bribes to a former top intelligence official, Ma Jian, The South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter whom the newspaper did not identify. Mr. Ma has been referred to in Chinese news outlets as Mr. Guo’s political patron. Countries do not have to honor red notices, and as of Wednesday, Mr. Guo was not in custody. Instead, he was at his penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which he bought in 2015, through a shell company, for $67.5 million. Two reporters from Voice of America’s Chinese-language service conducted a live television interview with him in the apartment. "

Mr. Murdoch’s Fox News announced Wednesday that it will part with its star host Bill O’Reilly weeks after a New York Times investigation into sexual harassment charges led more than 50 companies, under pressure from protesters, to pull their ads from “The O’Reilly Factor.” This wasn’t the only recent boycott. Last month, North Carolina passed a face-saving reversal of its bill that prevented transgendered people from using the bathroom of their choice after a host of companies and organizations, including the N.C.A.A., said they wouldn’t do business in the state. A campaign by the group Sleeping Giants has shamed hundreds of marketers into pulling their ads from the right-wing Breitbart News. A threatened boycott has extracted a promise from United Airlines that it will no longer violently remove passengers in favor of a company employee. If you’ve flown United recently, you’ll know that’s progress. What’s driving these about-faces? There’s little evidence that broad-based boycotts actually hurt a company’s bottom line; in fact, loyal customers often increase their patronage. Mr. O’Reilly’s ratings rose after the Times investigation. After the Cracker Barrel chain fired gay employees in 1991, visits to the restaurants rose in the face of protests. In 1977, when a Georgia group threatened a boycott of the Girl Scouts of America for its endorsement of the Equal Rights Amendment, cookie sales went through the roof. But boycotts can cause a significant drop in share price, according to a 2007 study of boycotts over a 28-year period. In other words, shareholders react to their own fear of what might happen to the company’s brand, and not to what’s actually happening to its revenue. The economist A. O. Hirschman might describe this as a triumph of voice over exit. Protesters (voice) cause a shift in corporate behavior, even if consumers don’t exercise their option to stop buying the product (exit). None of the companies that pulled out of “The O’Reilly Factor” or Breitbart News are exactly a profile in courage. The basic allegations against Mr. O’Reilly have been known since 2004, when he settled his first lawsuit, but that didn’t stop companies from advertising until more women came forward. Though in some cases, corporate cowardice is a good thing. American business is often accused of producing a bland, monolithic culture — “Disneyfication” — but sometimes the fear to offend instills a kind of civility that other spheres of public life lack. "

But Republicans were also pleased that they had forced Mr. Ossoff into a June runoff against a seasoned candidate they believe their fractured party can unite behind. This closely watched race in the suburbs north of Atlanta has been widely billed as a referendum on Donald J. Trump’s presidency, and local residents are girding themselves for a new bombardment of money and messaging as the two major parties fight for the chance to brand the Republican president as either damaged goods or a wily survivor. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, as divisive and catalyzing as ever, is waiting in the wings, amid speculation that he may be mulling a more personal involvement in the race that could end up stoking Republican excitement, Democratic anger — or both. “I think we could be facing all-out war here for the next two months,” Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Ga., said Wednesday. Mr. Ossoff is a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker virtually no one had heard of until a few months ago. But he has become a sort of instant celebrity as liberals around the country sniffed weakness in a district that previously sent Newt Gingrich to Congress — but which Mr. Trump barely won in November. Activists have filled Mr. Ossoff’s campaign chest with $8.3 million, and more is on the way: On Wednesday, Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, sent a fund-raising email encouraging party members to “go all-in and elect Jon,” and “send a big, loud message to Donald.” "

In fact, the election of President Donald Trump has coincided with a swell of like-minded candidates all over Europe: Politicians like Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, who was defeated in the country’s general election this March, and Marine Le Pen, who hopes to advance to France’s runoff presidential election after the first round of voting takes place on Sunday; as well as similar figures in the Alternative for Germany party and Italy’s Northern League. But have the New York Times reporters tasked with covering those candidates found that they share Mr. Trump’s adversarial approach when it comes to the news media? In the case of Ms. Le Pen, not exactly. Adam Nossiter, a Paris correspondent who has covered her throughout this election season, said that while she was “pugnacious, and she has a kind of mocking affect, she’s far from closed.” Ms. Le Pen has sought to distance her party, the National Front, from the racism and anti-Semitism espoused by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who stepped down as its leader in 2011 and was expelled from the party by Ms. Le Pen in 2015. Part of that effort is an active engagement with the world media. (For the most part, at least.) “She answers every question, she’s very thorough, she explains her thinking. I hesitate to say she’s exactly generous, but she’s not grudging,” said Alissa Rubin, the Paris bureau chief for The Times. “She’s a busy, capable politician.” "
1253,Berkeley Cancels Ann Coulter Speech Over Safety Fears,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/berkeley-ann-coulter-speech-canceled.html?searchResultPosition=65,2017/04/19,U.S.,"SAN FRANCISCO — The University of California, Berkeley, on Wednesday canceled a scheduled speech by the conservative author Ann Coulter, in the latest blow to the institution’s legacy and reputation as a promoter and bastion of free speech. University administrators said in a statement that they could not let Ms. Coulter speak because of active security threats. In a letter to the Berkeley College Republicans, which was sponsoring the speech, two vice chancellors said the university had been “unable to find a safe and suitable venue for your planned April 27 event featuring Ann Coulter.” The letter, written by Scott Biddy, the vice chancellor, and Stephen Sutton, the vice chancellor for student affairs, said it was “not possible to assure that the event could be held successfully — or that the safety of Ms. Coulter, the event sponsors, audience and bystanders could be adequately protected.” After the cancellation was announced on Wednesday, Ms. Coulter said in an email that she would “definitely” speak at Berkeley next week. “I was invited to speak by two groups on campus, so I intend to speak,” she said. With Berkeley’s reputation as one of the country’s most liberal universities, the campus and surrounding areas have become a target for small, militant and shadowy right-wing groups that have clashed in recent months with equally militant and shadowy anarchist groups based in the San Francisco Bay Area. On Saturday, at the latest of these violent encounters, the police arrested more than 20 people. One video that went viral on social media showed a man identified as a member of a white supremacist group sucker-punching a woman who identified herself as an anarchist. These fight-club-type episodes, both on campus and in the city of Berkeley, have escalated since President Trump’s election. "

They spoke in Arabic and carried a selfie stick. In Times Square, the families, 25 Syrian refugees in all, encountered Ecuadoreans in Elmo costumes and Nigerians hawking double-decker bus tours. In Central Park, two cousins bounded up the ancient rocks, no longer displaced persons, but 9-year-old conquerors of a famous playground. In Battery Park, a family from France watched as the group took turns posing with the Statue of Liberty in the background. “Freedom is good,” Rihab Taki, a 33-year-old mother of four, said through a translator. Her family had spent three years in Jordan before arriving in August. Ms. Taki said she struggled with depression while adapting to her new home in Northern New Jersey. “You see life in a different way when you are in this place,” she said. Most New York sightseeing tours are about history. This one was about savoring the present. Real New York Tours, a family-run outfit in its 10th year, is offering a week of free walking tours for 150 Syrian refugees who were recently resettled in New Jersey. The attendees were chosen by the state chapter of ICNA Relief, a Muslim-American social services charity. Luke Miller, 48, the founder of the tour company, said he and his wife, Amber Cameron, first had the idea to provide free tours in the days after President Trump issued his first executive order suspending the resettlement of Syrian refugees and banning travelers from a group of Muslim-majority countries. “We wanted to do something to counteract this,” he recalled. “So we said, ‘Let’s do what we’re good at.’” "

Toni: Ossoff started off his campaign with the idea to “Make Trump Furious,” but some people might not realize that he proceeded to run a moderate, tame campaign. What do you think it suggests about the broader issue of where Democrats will be positioning themselves heading into 2018 and beyond? Nate: Yeah, it was one of the most anodyne campaigns I can remember. He took bold stances against corruption and wasteful spending. He wants Atlanta’s north side to become the “Silicon Valley of the South.” Toni: He wants babies and puppies to grow up to be healthy and for skies to be sunny. Nate: This is probably a tactic that a lot of Democrats will adopt in traditionally conservative, well-educated districts where Trump struggled in November. I think the good news for Democrats is that progressives were excited about this race, even though Ossoff didn’t give them any red meat. In a lot of these Republican-leaning districts, the Democrats will need both high progressive turnout and some inroads among voters who don’t always vote Democratic. It wouldn’t surprise me if Ossoff goes even further in the runoff. You could imagine him coming out in favor of a lower corporate tax rate, for instance. "

New York is considered one of the most exciting, dynamic and cosmopolitan cities in the world. One thing it’s not? The cleanest. Our city generates a lot of trash. The Department of Sanitation collected 3,196,200 tons of residential trash (excluding recyclables) last year. That’s around 749 pounds per New Yorker, or just over two pounds per resident per day. Inevitably, some of it ends up on the street. It’s not hard to find a street strewn with garbage, whether it’s on the shores of Brooklyn or on the blocks of the Upper East Side. We examined calls made last year to the 311 complaint line to find the blocks with the most reports of dirty conditions, which include things like messy streets and sidewalks, litter and dog waste. (Full disclosure: A small number of people, or one really annoyed person, can generate many complaints on a single instance of litter, so the “most” superlative is not exactly scientific.) In 2016, the four corners on the intersection of Watson Avenue and Boynton Avenue in the Bronx were the subject of the most complaints to 311 about dirty conditions: 470, of the 865 complaints logged for the Top 10 most griped-about streets.

And even as Pakistani officials proclaim that their nuclear assets are secure, evidence, including internal Pakistani documents, suggests that they know better. Having served in senior roles in Afghanistan’s intelligence services, I have good reason to be skeptical about Pakistan’s ability to keep its nuclear weapons safe from extremists. The international community, working with the United Nations Atomic Energy Agency or the United Nations Security Council, must take action to prevent a global catastrophe before it is too late. Pakistan is believed to have the fifth-largest nuclear arsenal in the world, larger than Britain’s. It also has an established history of giving nuclear technology to countries like Iran and North Korea. As the Trump administration begins developing its policies toward Pakistan and toward nuclear nonproliferation, it should make Pakistan a top priority. Pakistanis with the most knowledge of the country’s nuclear program are among the most worried. On Dec. 16, 2014, the Taliban launched a deadly attack on an army-run school in the Pakistani city of Peshawar. Afterward, Pakistan’s Atomic Energy Commission sent an urgent letter to the director general of the Strategic Plans Division, which is responsible for securing Pakistan’s nuclear assets, expressing concern. The Atomic Energy Commission requested that the military devote more resources to ensuring that the personnel with knowledge of the nuclear program are monitored. This letter, which has been kept secret until now, reveals just how concerned some Pakistani officials are — and how worried the rest of the world should be. The Atomic Energy Commission is not the only group sounding alarms about the role of extremists inside Pakistan. In early 2014, the ministry of interior issued a policy paper called the National Internal Security Policy 2014-2018, a classified document that outlined the government’s security priorities. It warns that Pakistan is home to hundreds of terrorist and extremist groups, and points out that many of them are operational in all four provinces of Pakistan, including in the areas in Punjab near some of Pakistan’s nuclear facilities. This document also raises concerns over the growing influence of certain terrorist groups, in particular Lashkar-e-Taiba, inside the Pakistan Army and intelligence agencies, and within the families of senior and midlevel military officers.

Helping parents pay for that care would be expensive for society, too. Yet recent studies show that of any policy aimed to help struggling families, aid for high-quality care has the biggest economic payoff for parents and their children — and even their grandchildren. It has the biggest positive effect on women’s employment and pay. It’s especially helpful for low-income families, because it can propel generations of children toward increased earnings, better jobs, improved health, more education and decreased criminal activity as adults. Affordable care for children under 5, long a goal of Democrats, is now being championed by Ivanka Trump. The Department of Health and Human Services says child care should cost 7 percent of a family’s income at most — but 42 percent of families who buy care for young children spend considerably more than that, according to census data analyzed by Beth Mattingly at the University of New Hampshire. A report by New America and Care.com put the average cost of child care in the United States at $16,514 a year. It’s children with parents who can least afford high-quality care who benefit most from it, research has found. That is because affluent children have better alternatives. For well-off children, some studies have linked day care, especially low-quality care early in life, to achievement and behavior problems. A powerful new study — which demonstrated long-term results by following children from birth until age 35 — found that high-quality care during the earliest years can influence whether both mothers and children born into disadvantage lead more successful lives. The study was led by James J. Heckman, a Nobel laureate economist at the University of Chicago. "
1260,The Coming Crisis With Iran,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/the-coming-crisis-with-iran.html?searchResultPosition=44,2017/04/20,OPINION,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has flip-flopped many times during his first months in office. But none may be as consequential as his decision on April 18 to certify that Iran is abiding by the nuclear deal of 2015, paving the way for further waiving of sanctions. In just a few months, Mr. Trump has gone from promising to “tear up” the nuclear deal to allowing its extension. The administration has now said it will conduct a 90-day review of whether lifting sanctions — as required by the nuclear deal — will be in line with American national security interests. But that timeline is not long enough to save the deal and stop the United States and Iran from sliding dangerously back to a path toward war. There are a number of potential land mines on the near horizon. The first is in Congress, where a bipartisan effort is underway to introduce new sanctions on Iran that, despite the protestations of the legislation’s sponsors, would violate the terms of the nuclear agreement by adding new conditions onto the deal. If this legislation reaches the president’s desk, he will have a choice between rejecting it and keeping the nuclear deal alive, or signing it and causing an international crisis. By certifying to Congress that Iran is in compliance with the deal, it is now more difficult for Mr. Trump to push the United States out of compliance by adopting new sanctions or failing to renew the sanctions waivers. But anything is possible. Another emerging threat comes from Iran’s domestic politics. Presidential elections next month may put Iran’s foreign policy back into the hands of the country’s hard-liners, who, much like Mr. Trump, define their country in opposition to the world. Despite the overwhelming support among the Iranian public for the nuclear deal, and despite projected economic growth of 6.6 percent, the re-election of President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, is by no means a certainty. While Iran’s economy has been growing, the recovery has been driven by renewed oil exports. As a result, most Iranians have yet to see much economic benefit from the sanctions relief brought by the nuclear deal. Real economic growth will require sizable foreign direct investments but international banks have remained hesitant about financing projects in Iran largely because of lingering American sanctions and the fear that the Trump administration will scrap the nuclear deal.

So he had the “Late Show” camera pan away for a solid 20 seconds. Mr. Colbert played a news clip mentioning that Mr. O’Reilly was, by ratings standards, the most accomplished TV host. “By moral standards, he was a self-righteous landfill of angry garbage,” Mr. Colbert added.

1262,‘The Handmaid’s Tale’: A Newly Resonant Dystopia Comes to TV,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/arts/television/the-handmaids-tale-elisabeth-moss-samira-wiley-margaret-atwood-hulu.html?searchResultPosition=46,2017/04/20,TELEVISION,"TORONTO — This is how a war on women ramps up: First, their bank accounts are frozen, and then they’re forbidden to work. Protesters gather, waving signs and chanting. Then, in this flashback scene from the first episode of the new Hulu series “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the police open fire on the demonstrators. Bloodied bodies fall, and the camera holds tight on the story’s heroine, Offred, played by Elisabeth Moss, whose disbelieving face seems to ask, What world is this? Based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 dystopian novel, the series tells the story of a country reinvented: A violent religious coup has turned the United States into Gilead, a theocracy where women have been stripped of their rights and the more fertile conscripted into “handmaids,” forced to bear children for the elite. Though the protest scene was filmed last fall, and, like the series itself, conceived long before a dizzying election season and aftermath that have catapulted Ms. Atwood’s book up the Amazon best-seller list, the television adaptation arrives with a newfound and unexpected resonance in Trump’s America. Before the series even debuts on Wednesday, April 26, references to “The Handmaid’s Tale” — shorthand for repressive patriarchy — seem ubiquitous. A photo of a group of male Republicans at the White House debating maternity services with nary a woman in sight earned the social media hashtag #Gilead. Last month, women in Handmaids’ red dresses and bonnets sat side-by-side in the Texas State Capitol to protest anti-abortion measures under consideration. “We thought about it in a different way,” said Samira Wiley (“Orange Is the New Black”), who plays Moira, Offred’s best friend, referring to the cast and crew’s changed relationship to the show since the election. “Suddenly it was dangerously close to the climate that we were starting to live in. We were hoping to be relevant, but we weren’t hoping it would be this relevant.” The tonal dread and brutality of Ms. Atwood’s novel are omnipresent in the series, but there are potential pitfalls to adapting a feminist touchstone so faithfully while also having to speak to a political moment the creators did not anticipate. Will fans of the novel want to subject themselves to 10 hours of immersion into their deep fears? "

For Rudy Giuliani, it was the righteous snarl. For Michael Bloomberg, the smirky insult. For Mayor Bill de Blasio, it’s looking like: the petulant whine. It’s been evident for months that the mayor hates it when he thinks reporters at public events aren’t asking the right questions, or are being too hostile or skeptical, or are getting the facts wrong, or are trying to stray off topic when he wants to stay on, on, on. As J. David Goodman and William Neuman reported in The Times on Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio has taken message-controlling to unusual lengths. Taking beatings from beat reporters has been in the mayoral job description forever, but this mayor has apparently decided that face-to-face interaction with reporters is overrated. At one appearance after another, he took no questions, even at benign events like a ferry ride on the East River to announce some new ferry routes. It seems the press was included simply so it could exult with him in the magnificence of the achievement. When the press refuses, you get episodes like this one, on March 23, when reporters kept asking questions unrelated to the topic of the day. He resisted; they persisted; he walked out. As a snippet of transcript shows, if you take the Q. out of Q. and A., what remains is absurdist theater: O.K., Mara. You’re smart — I’m here to talk about this. Mara, I’m here to talk about this. If you want to ask question about this — I’m here to talk about this. If you want to talk about this, great, if not, we’ll take questions another way, another time. Does anyone want to ask about the mansion tax? Same thing. Guys, you can ask all you want. Here’s what we are here to talk about. Last call, anyone want to talk about mansion tax? About mansion tax.

1264,Paging the Trump Armada,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/paging-the-trump-armada.html?searchResultPosition=52,2017/04/20,OPINION,"Let’s consider the case of the wrong-way warships. Last week, North Korea was planning a big celebration in honor of its founder’s birthday. For North Koreans, holiday fun is short on barbecues and high on weaponry. The big parade in Pyongyang featured monster canisters that theoretically contained intercontinental ballistic missiles. It’s possible they were actually empty and that right now, North Korea only has bragging rights in the big-container race. But its intentions were definitely bad, and the United States was worried there might be a missile launch or an underground nuclear test. What should Donald Trump do? “We’re sending an armada,” said the president. Possible confrontation? As a concerned citizen, you had to be very worried. North Korea is, in every way, a special and dangerous case. It has a leader who is narcissistic to the point of psychosis, with a celebrity fixation and a very strange haircut. O.K., maybe not entirely unique. Trump was talking about bringing in four warships, one of them an aircraft carrier. Was this going to mean real shooting? His critics back home had to decide whether to protest, wave the flag in support or simply stock the fallout shelter. (This would be the fallout shelter you repurposed a couple decades ago as a wine cellar, but lately you’ve been thinking it can work both ways.) Everybody was talking about the dangers. If North Korea sent up a missile, would the U.S. retaliate? Then what would happen to South Korea and Japan? People debated all the variables. The only thing that did not come up was the possibility that the American flotilla was actually no place near the neighborhood. Yet, as Mark Landler and Eric Schmitt reported in The Times, at the moment the president was announcing his armada, the warships in question were actually going in the opposite direction, en route to a destination 3,500 miles away, where they were to take part in joint exercises with the Australian Navy.

But there is little doubt when one is going off the rails. So perhaps it should surprise no one that so many lawmakers have chosen to avoid such outings with constituents during this two-week break from an institution most Americans disdain. There can be no viral video headaches from an event that never happened. Still, among those adventurous enough to take on all comers, the forums have often been telling. Here is what we’ve learned, or relearned, during the recess so far: Few Republican senators need to sweat much before the midterm elections next year. But in a party now defined by President Trump, and all the attendant volatility that promises, some must proceed cautiously. At the moment, only two Senate Republicans are viewed as potentially vulnerable: Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Both faced voters this month. Mr. Heller plainly does not relish the town-hall format: He told a conservative group last week that the events were “one of those boxes you gotta check,” according to audio obtained by The Nevada Independent. And at a gathering on Monday in Reno, Mr. Heller’s genial sidestepping was greeted at times with chants of “Answer the question!” "
1266,Australia Plans to Raise More Barriers to Citizenship,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/world/australia/citizenship-turnbull-integration-immigrants-refugees.html?searchResultPosition=37,2017/04/20,AUSTRALIA,"DARWIN, Australia — When Nhan Do heard that Australia planned to make it more difficult to become a citizen of the country he had called home for 25 years, he was overcome with confusion. “I have to ask, Why do they keep making it harder?” said Mr. Do, 41, who fled Vietnam with his family as a teenager. “It’s hard enough.” On Thursday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull proposed tough new requirements for would-be citizens, including stricter standards for English-language proficiency, an “Australian values” test and a four-year wait. Mr. Do, a citizen who has made his life here in Darwin, now worries that his wife, Lahn, a permanent resident who can barely read or write, will never obtain citizenship and fully belong. “We want this to be our country,” Mr. Do said. “We’ve been here a long time.” The proposed changes are the latest challenge to Australia’s proud multicultural image, after a tightening of skilled worker visas this week. Taken together, the moves put Australia at the forefront of a global movement to limit migration, and to turn citizenship from something meant to help people integrate into what Mr. Turnbull called a “big prize” — a reward for having assimilated. Those who favor raising the barriers, including members of the Trump administration, argue that citizenship is a privilege that should be given only to those who can prove they have made a significant effort to adapt to their new country. Populists in Europe, the United States and elsewhere — including, in Australia, Pauline Hanson, a senator who has called for a ban on Muslim immigration — have often relied on this argument to rally frustrated working-class voters who fear Islam or believe they are competing with immigrants for jobs or government resources.

1267,The North Korea-Trump Nightmare,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/the-north-korea-trump-nightmare.html?searchResultPosition=50,2017/04/20,OPINION,"President Trump is scary in many ways, but perhaps the most frightening nightmare is of him blundering into a new Korean war. It would begin because the present approach of leaning on China to pressure North Korea will likely fail. Trump will grow angry at public snickering at the emptiness of his threats. At some point, U.S. intelligence will see a North Korean missile prepared for a test launch — and it may then be very tempting for a deeply frustrated rogue president to show his muscle. Foreign Affairs describes just such a scenario in an excellent new essay by Philip Gordon imagining how Trump might drift into war by accident: “He could do nothing, but that would mean losing face and emboldening North Korea. Or he could destroy the test missile on its launchpad with a barrage of cruise missiles, blocking Pyongyang’s path to a nuclear deterrent, enforcing his red line, and sending a clear message to the rest of the world.” Alas, no one has ever made money betting on North Korean restraint, and the country might respond by firing artillery at Seoul, a metropolitan area of 25 million people. The upshot of a war would be that North Korea’s regime would be destroyed, but the country has the world’s fourth-largest army (soldiers are drafted for up to 12 years) with 21,000 artillery pieces, many of them aimed at Seoul. It also has thousands of tons of chemical weapons, and missiles that can reach Tokyo. "
1268,How to Stop Drug Price Gouging,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/how-to-stop-drug-price-gouging.html?searchResultPosition=51,2017/04/20,OPINION,"One of Donald Trump’s few universally welcomed campaign promises was to do something about the prices of pharmaceutical drugs. Most Americans recognize that prices are too high, and are bothered by the rise of pharmaceutical price gouging: the giant price increase for decades-old drugs and devices by the likes of Martin Shkreli with Daraprim or Mylan with the EpiPen. But what few people realize is that the president already has the power to do something about drug prices if he really wants to. If Mr. Trump wishes to show he’s serious about his populist promise, the place to start is by declaring war on the price gougers. The key power is found in the “import relief” law — an important yet unused provision of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 that empowers the Food and Drug Administration to allow drug imports whenever they are deemed safe and capable of saving Americans money. The savings in the price-gouging cases would be significant. Daraprim, the antiparasitic drug whose price was raised by Mr. Shkreli to nearly $750 per pill, sells for a little more than $2 overseas. The cancer drug Cosmegen is priced at $1,400 or more per injection here, as opposed to about $20 to $30 overseas. The remedy is simple: The government can create a means for pharmacies to get supplies from trusted nations overseas at much lower prices. Doing this would not only save Americans a lot of money but also deflate the incentive to engage in abusive pricing in the first place. Why hasn’t the law been used? Over the years, the industry has tried to describe the statute as a nuclear option, repeatedly warning of the catastrophic danger of relying on the drugs used by those reckless Canadians. More legalistically, the industry has insisted that the Department of Health and Human Services (which oversees the F.D.A.) cannot reliably certify that imports would “pose no additional risks to public health and safety” as the statute requires. But Health and Human Services is an executive agency, bound to obey the president, and the needed cost and safety determinations are well within its capacity. The safety fears, if not purely imaginary, are wildly exaggerated. Twenty-five percent or more of drugs labeled American-made are actually manufactured in other countries, in plants inspected by the F.D.A. (So are 80 percent of the active ingredients used in the production of drugs in American factories.) The “imports” that the industry refers to are the same pills as those “American-made” drugs, produced by the same F.D.A.-inspected plants overseas. The only difference is that some of those drugs are shipped to countries like Canada, while others are sent directly to the United States, where they are sold for 10 or sometimes hundreds of times the Canadian price. The F.D.A., in other words, is already regulating imported drugs. It might as well use those powers to fight price gouging. Indeed, over the past six years the F.D.A. has been allowing imports of drugs to deal with shortages in accordance with a 2011 executive order. For example, when facing shortages of the cancer drug Doxil, the F.D.A. authorized imports of a substitute, Lipodox, manufactured at an F.D.A.-inspected plant in India. Lives have been saved, not lost, and the practice confirms that this country already knows how to ensure that importing drugs from trusted nations can be safe. The industry’s “safety” warnings are more politics than reality. "

For many of us, this is affirmative reinforcement; for others, it is devastating revelation. But it is those who believed — and cast supportive ballots — who should feel most cheated and also most contrite. You placed your faith in a phony. His promises are crashing to earth like a fleet of paper airplanes. He oversold what he could deliver because he had no idea what would be required to deliver it, nor did he care. He told you what you wanted to hear so that he could get what he wanted to have. He played you for fools. That wall will not be paid for by Mexico, if in fact it is ever built. If it is built, it will likely look nothing like what Trump said it would look like. His repeal and replace of Obamacare flopped. That failure endangers his ability to deliver on major tax reform and massive infrastructure spending. China is no longer in danger of being labeled a currency manipulator. The administration is now sending signals that ripping up the Iran nuclear deal isn’t a sure bet. Trump has done a complete about-face on the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, and when was the last time you heard him threaten to lock up Hillary Clinton? This is by no means an exhaustive list of the positions he took for in-the-moment advantage that have been quickly converted into in-reality abandonment. "
1271,Texans Gone Wild,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/texans-gone-wild.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/04/20,OPINION,"AUSTIN, Tex. — IN the wee hours of Nov. 9, I had an overwhelming urge to climb up on my roof here with a megaphone and shout to the rest of the country, “Welcome to Texas, y’all!” Republicans have controlled all three branches of government in my home state for more than a decade. Many policies now being championed by President Trump and Congressional leaders seem old hat to Texans: defunding public education, going after immigrants, shredding the safety net. But rather than resting their boots on the table, political leaders in Texas have moved farther to the right. Our 140-day every-other-year Texas legislative session began in January. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick — who controls the Senate and is arguably more powerful than Gov. Greg Abbott — is leading the far-right charge. Under his sway, the Senate has already passed bills that starve government, crack down on undocumented immigrants and discriminate against transgender people. Despite opposition from law enforcement, business and nonprofit groups like mine, the bills sailed through the Senate and await consideration in the House. One Senate bill threatens local law enforcement officials and department heads with criminal prosecution and police departments with loss of state money if they fail to comply with federal immigration orders. Even before the bill passed the Senate in February, Governor Abbott cut $1.5 million in criminal justice funding to Travis County (which includes Austin) to punish it for its policy of reducing cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. During the same period, immigration raids in Austin terrified immigrant families and led to the arrest of 51 people, most of whom had no previous convictions. Lieutenant Governor Patrick also championed a “bathroom bill” modeled on the one North Carolina recently repealed, which would require transgender people to use public bathrooms that match the sex on their birth certificates. When the N.F.L., shortly after this year’s Super Bowl in Houston, dared to suggest that the law would be a factor in scheduling future N.F.L. events in Texas, Governor Abbott — in a “me too!” gesture to Mr. Patrick’s pandering — told league officials “to get the hell out of politics.” The Senate passed the bathroom bill in March. The Texas Senate also recently passed a school vouchers bill that would drain millions from public school funds to pay for private tuition. Having starved state government for years, the Legislature is now determined to make it harder for cities and counties to raise money for themselves. The latest crusade began last spring, when Paul Bettencourt, a Republican state senator from Houston, used bogus math to whip local taxpayers into a frenzy over alleged property tax increases. The result was the passage in March of a Senate bill that limits the ability of cities and counties to raise the revenue needed to pay for education, health care and public safety. "
1272,Mother of All Bombs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/mother-of-all-bombs.html?searchResultPosition=49,2017/04/20,OPINION,"ACHIN, AFGHANISTAN — I spent the evening of April 13 with a cousin and two aunts in the upscale Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood in Kabul, Afghanistan. My aunts mostly talked about their relaxed, liberal early youth in the 1960s among the Kabul elite. As we waited in the driveway for our car, my cousin told me about an explosion in Nangarhar, the eastern province of Afghanistan, where our family comes from. We scrolled through our phones. As we drove out, it became clear it wasn’t the beginning of the Taliban’s so-called Spring Offensive. Around 8 p.m. Afghan time, the United States had dropped a 21,600-pound, $170,000 bomb on Asadkhel, a tiny village nestled between two forested hills, to attack a decades-old tunnel system that was being used by fighters claiming allegiance to the Iraq- and Syria-based Islamic State. Afghanistan has been at war for almost four decades now. Our people lived through the Soviet occupation and the war the mujahedeen fought against the Soviets with the support of the United States; freedom from the Soviet occupation was stained by a brutal civil war between mujahedeen factions (warlords had ruled large parts of the country and exacted a terrible human cost). The Taliban rule followed. We watched them being bombed into submission and escape after Sept. 11, celebrated a few years of relative calm, and saw the Taliban return to strength and wage a long, bloody insurgency that continues to this day. We watched the world tire of our forever war and forget us. Throughout the years of war, we had come to make lists of many firsts in Afghanistan — horrors, military victories, defeats, weapons used, atrocities committed, improbable lives saved. The explosion of the “mother of all bombs” on April 13 was a striking addition to the list of “firsts.” Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump barely mentioned Afghanistan during the long presidential campaign. Yet President Trump had chosen to use the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the world on a remote Afghan village. "

It took a few moments, but Mr. Xi’s eyes widened in surprise, and he asked his translator to repeat what was said, according to three people who spoke with Mr. Trump after that night two weeks ago. This was exactly the response he was hoping to elicit — surprise, uncertainty and a sense that the rational, predictable statecraft of President Barack Obama had given way to Mr. Trump’s more assertive vision of American power. Mr. Trump’s confrontational and improvisational approach to foreign affairs has lifted his mood, fortunes and poll numbers in recent days. There are signs it has also made an impact on the Chinese, prodding them to finally use their leverage with their errant neighbor, North Korea. But Mr. Trump’s mix of chest thumping and real action — the missile attack and the use of a huge bomb against Islamic militants in Afghanistan — entails serious risks overseas. It could also backfire at home, where a majority of Americans, and many of the populist conservatives who backed him in 2016, oppose long-term military commitments. The biggest risk, critics say, is that Mr. Trump will talk himself into a war. Only slightly less dangerously, he could weaken the nation’s standing by backing off from a threat to use force. “In Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, they are recalibrating their strategies — you can’t deny it — because they don’t have any idea of how Trump will respond,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the highest-ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee.

The guests included Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who had acted as a surrogate for Mr. Trump during his campaign, and another prominent lawyer, Michael B. Mukasey, who served as attorney general in President George W. Bush’s administration. The purpose of the visit by Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey was rather extraordinary: They hoped to reach a diplomatic deal under which Turkey might further aid the United States’ interests in the region. In return, the United States might release the two men’s client, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish gold trader being held in a Manhattan jail whose case had attracted Mr. Erdogan’s interest. Mr. Mukasey, in court papers made public on Wednesday, characterized the meeting as part of an effort to seek “a state-to-state resolution of this case,” and he hinted at some progress, saying, “Senior officials in both the U.S. government and the Turkish government remain receptive to pursuing the possibility of an agreement.” Plea bargaining, even for the best-connected of defendants, is normally conducted by defense lawyers and prosecutors, often in courthouse corridors or drab government offices. But the efforts being made on behalf of Mr. Zarrab show the way that political access and diplomatic overtures can also be employed. Mr. Zarrab, 33, is a well-known figure in Turkey, where he moved as an infant after being born in Iran (he is a citizen of both countries). He is married to a Turkish pop star and is regarded as a member of Mr. Erdogan’s circle of friends and associates. Photographs show Mr. Erdogan’s wife, Emine, attending at least one charity event alongside Mr. Zarrab and his wife. "

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) President Trump this month signed a resolution to undo internet privacy rules that would have kept companies like AT&T and Comcast from selling users’ browsing histories and other personal data. Almost immediately, a number of states — among them Washington, Connecticut and Massachusetts — moved to pass new rules that would in effect replicate those nullified by Congress. But California, a pioneer of privacy protections, has so far been silent. That could soon change. Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat who heads the Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee, said he was holding meetings on steps the Legislature could take to safeguard personal information. “California has been at the leading edge of innovation in approaching privacy issues and consumer protection for years, and there is no reason for that to change,” he said in a statement. Some lawmakers have argued that the privacy rules, drafted last October by the Federal Communications Commission, would have unfairly targeted telecom carriers, while sparing web companies like Google and Facebook that also provide access to user data.

They are believed to be the only civilians living inside the two-and-a-half-mile-wide demilitarized zone that separates North Korea from South. Two years after the 1953 armistice that suspended the Korean War and created the DMZ, both sides agreed to build model villages inside the zone to demonstrate the superior virtues of the two countries. South Korea built Taesung and the North built a hamlet named Kijong just 440 yards away. Only a field separates the two. The South Korean military says no one really lives in Kijong, a sprinkling of turquoise buildings with a North Korean flag flying from a 540-foot pole.

And late Thursday night, a lawyer for the Berkeley College Republicans, which invited Ms. Coulter to campus, threatened to sue the university unless it permits the speech to go ahead. At a news conference on Thursday, Nicholas B.

Some recent speeches at Berkeley and other colleges have attracted violent protests. The university had said Wednesday that it would try to reschedule her appearance in September, but on Thursday Mr. Dirks said it had found “an appropriate, protectable venue that is available on the afternoon of May 2.” He said the university would reveal the location when it completed the details. “It can accommodate a substantial audience,” he added.

Mr. Trump’s comments came during a White House news conference with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, who implored the United States to step up its “critical” involvement in Libya, a former Italian colony. “We need a stable and unified Libya,” Mr. Gentiloni, who has been in office since November, said, discussing a conflict that has sent thousands of asylum seekers across the Mediterranean to Italy and other European countries. “A divided country, and in conflict, would make civility worse.” In his scripted opening remarks, Mr. Trump thanked Italy’s leaders “for your leadership on seeking stabilization in Libya, and for your crucial efforts to deny ISIS a foothold in the Mediterranean,” adding, “You fought hard.” Ansar al-Shariah, an affiliate of ISIS — the Islamic State extremist group, based in Syria and Iraq — has been operating in Libya since 2012. But the president — who was not wearing an earpiece that would have allowed him to understand Mr. Gentiloni’s challenge, issued in Italian — quickly contradicted his guest. “I do not see a role in Libya,” Trump said. “I think the United States has, right now, enough roles. We’re in a role everywhere.” Mr. Trump did not, however, rule out involvement in the effort to root out Islamic militants in Libya and other countries in North Africa and the Middle East. “I do see a role in getting rid of ISIS. We’re being very effective in that regard,” he said. “We are effectively ridding the world of ISIS. I see that as a primary role, and that’s what we’re going to do, whether it’s in Iraq or in Libya or anywhere else. And that role will come to an end at a certain point.” The conflict in Libya — which began with the killing of the country’s longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 2011 — has divided the desert nation into warring regions, with Islamic State-linked fighters dominating the western part of the country. In 2016, President Barack Obama said that not preparing for the chaos that was certain to follow the United States’ military intervention in Libya was probably the worst mistake of his presidency. The meeting on Thursday was Mr. Trump’s first with Mr. Gentiloni, and took place a month before the president’s planned visit to Sicily for a Group of 7 summit meeting, a gathering of the world’s seven most developed economies.

It is increasingly rare for documentaries to be released in theaters at all, no matter how good they might be; when they are shown they often come and go quickly, playing for a few nights in places never far from brownstone Brooklyn or Harvard Square. “Citizen Jane: Battle for the City,” will be shown in close to 20 cities around the country, as if it were a chronicle of how Kylie Jenner’s new lipstick line made it to the marketplace. The film has already been screened in Europe and Canada, where it had a prime spot at Baconfest, named for Edmund N. Bacon, who remade much of Philadelphia in the 1950s and ’60s, and which is described in press materials as “Calgary’s favorite urban planning film festival.” That we live in a world with an urban planning film festival at all is in some sense a testament to Jacobs’s celebrated antipathy toward the discipline. She came to prominence with the publication of “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” in 1961, conveying her fiercely held convictions about the futility of what passed as visionary thinking in shaping the character of urban environments. Had she been alive, she would have turned 100 last year and late last summer two new books, one a biography and another a compilation of her short works, provided an occasion to wrestle with her legacy. That, of course, was before the country elected Donald J. Trump as its president. Just this past week, Chuck Schumer, Kirsten E. Gillibrand and other metropolitan-area Senate Democrats urged the Trump administration to consider an enormous rail and tunnel renovation in the Northeast Corridor as part of its proposed $1 trillion infrastructure package. Federal infrastructural investment has been a singular kind of neutralizer at this divisive moment; a lot of people can get excited about it, and a lot of people want a piece of the cake. Jacobs would have advised caution, if not outright terror, because she feared the collusion and self-dealing that can accompany these kinds of projects. She looked around her at urban renewal, and at housing projects in particular, and saw only disastrous outcomes for the poor and enrichment for the developer class. "

Nonetheless, Kremlin opponents have linked the institute to such efforts as trying to dissuade Sweden from closer ties to NATO and subvert Montenegro’s impending membership in the alliance. Attention was focused on the institute this week when Reuters, quoting what it described as seven former and current American officials, reported on Wednesday that the institute had provided the “framework and rationale” to interfere in the Nov. 8 United States presidential election to help Donald J. Trump win. "

But this hulking shell of a mill here shows why China is likely to keep pumping out more and more steel, inflaming trade tensions between the two countries. The Hangzhou steel mill, a vast labyrinth of blast furnaces, warehouses, chimneys and worker dormitories covering hundreds of acres, was one of Mao Zedong’s favorite projects. Built in just 13 months in the late 1950s, it once employed 25,000 workers. Pollution and the march of progress made the mill a liability. But closing a mill eliminates well-paying jobs — a central reason China keeps factories churning out steel the world doesn’t need. When authorities do manage to shutter a plant, it is a costly ordeal, as the story of Hangzhou shows. With the help of a $34 million grant from government officials, the Hangzhou plant owner, Hangzhou Iron and Steel Group, offered the 12,000 remaining workers lavish severance benefits and pensions. “I don’t have to wake up early,” said Tang Guomin, 49, who had labored at the blast furnaces since he was 18 years old. He received nearly six years’ pay from the company as severance and when he turns 50 in a few months, he will be able to collect an inflation-adjusted pension from the government equal to 90 percent of his previous pay for the rest of his life.

Mr. Nugent — a guitar demigod, knife-between-the-teeth hunter and conservative provocateur — offered an inside glimpse of a gracious, relaxed and house-proud president with ample time to offer his thoughts on a wide array of topics, from entertainment to existential geopolitical perils. “We were there for four hours, man!” Mr. Nugent, a 68-year-old Detroit native, said in a telephone interview on Thursday, using a four-letter expletive to signal his amazement at Mr. Trump’s willingness to spend so much time with his three casually dressed visitors. “He gave us a wonderful personal tour of every room and talked about the origins of every carpet and every painting — there was a Monet — and then we had dinner,” said Mr. Nugent, who has referred to former President Barack Obama as a “mongrel” and to Hillary Clinton with an array of unflattering epithets. The encounter included a tour of the executive residence, a grip-and-grin session with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and an impromptu snapshot — featuring a sneering Ms. Palin — in front of Mrs. Clinton’s official portrait as the three guests and their families left through the East Wing.

By April 11, the final time Bill O’Reilly hosted the 8 p.m. show on Fox News, that number had dwindled to 10. The advertising exodus, which followed a report by The New York Times disclosing that five women had received settlements over accusations of inappropriate behavior by Mr. O’Reilly, rattled the network. While the financial fallout may not have been dire, given that many advertisers shifted their spending to other programs on the network, it was difficult to ignore the image of at least 50 major brands — like Mercedes-Benz and Allstate — declining to associate with Fox News’s most popular personality. Now that Mr. O’Reilly is gone, dismissed on Wednesday by 21st Century Fox, the network’s parent company, the question is: Will the advertising situation on Fox News return to normal? Mr. O’Reilly, who has denied the allegations against him, will be succeeded in the 8 p.m. Eastern slot by Tucker Carlson, who had been the host at 9 p.m. The round-table show “The Five” will move to 9 p.m. and Sean Hannity will stay as the 10 p.m. host. Mark Young, chief executive of an ad agency called Jekyll & Hyde, works with several brands that advertise on Fox News, including Australian Dream, a pain relief cream that recently ran commercials on Mr. O’Reilly’s show even after others had begun to boycott it. Mr. Young said on Wednesday evening that Fox News had not contacted him to discuss any changes to its lineup, nor did it say anything when the host Megyn Kelly recently left the network, adding, “Most networks play this kind of thing down and just operate as business as usual.” Mr. Young also said the companies he worked with bought time blocks rather than time during specific shows. Australian Dream advertises on all the cable networks and aims “not to make any political statement but to reach as many people as possible,” he said. "
1294,Theater in the Trump Era: A Broadway Revival of ‘An Enemy of the People’ Is Planned,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/theater/trump-era-theater-broadway-revival-of-an-enemy-of-the-people.html?searchResultPosition=29,2017/04/20,THEATER,"In the months since Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States, theaters around the country have announced that they will be mounting productions of “An Enemy of the People,” the play by Henrik Ibsen about a man who is ostracized by his community for daring to criticize a dangerous government initiative. Now, the play is coming to Broadway. The producer David Binder (“Hedwig and the Angry Inch”) said Thursday that he would be bringing a contemporary adaptation of the 19th-century play to Broadway during the 2017-18 season. He did not specify when during the season, or at which theater, but he is aiming for next spring. The new production of the oft-adapted play was developed at a German theater, Schaubühne, in Berlin, and has since had productions around the world, including at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2013 and at the Barbican Center in London in 2014. The adaptation is by Florian Borchmeyer and Thomas Ostermeier, and will now be further adapted into English for Broadway by the playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (“Gloria”). Mr. Ostermeier, resident director of the Schaubühne, will direct the production. The play is about a small-town doctor who discovers that the public baths are contaminated, but is then run out of town for potentially damaging an amenity that is essential to the town’s tourism business. The title phrase has gained new currency, as Mr. Trump has used it in a critique of the news media. There have been 10 previous Broadway productions of the play, the most recent of which was in 2012. “An Enemy of the People” is the second play announced for the next Broadway season that seems prompted by the Trump presidency; the first was a new theatrical adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984,” which is scheduled to open in June at the Hudson Theater. The Trump presidency is also leading to new theater work. The Pulitzer-winner Robert Schenkkan (who also wrote the Tony-winning “All the Way”) has written “Building the Wall,” responding to Mr. Trump’s restrictive immigration initiatives, that is being mounted around the country and will have an Off Broadway production at New World Stages beginning next month.

Not anymore. On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to take votes on two measures that would continue efforts to unwind rules created during the Obama administration. The first would make it easier for broadband providers to increase charges on other companies that connect to their networks. The second would ease the limit on how many stations a broadcast television company can own. While other Trump administration priorities have stalled, the speed at which telecommunications regulations are being changed has been startling. As Cecilia Kang writes, since Ajit Pai was appointed by President Trump in January to lead the F.C.C., he “has abolished a plan to open the cable box market, suspended several participants from a program for low-income broadband subsidies, and chipped away at net neutrality, which guarantees consumers equal access to all internet content.” A proposal to roll back net neutrality rules could come as early as this month.

Mr. Pai said on Thursday that his visits with executives at Facebook, Cisco, Oracle and Intel were constructive and that he believed the companies wanted to find “common ground.” Web companies have supported net neutrality, saying the protections guard them from paying tolls to get their content in front of consumers. Mr. Pai said that he agreed with the broad principles of net neutrality but that the rules, created by the commission in 2015, went too far in restricting broadband providers. “I think they were appreciative,” Mr. Pai said of the tech companies. “I have been soliciting thoughts on online protections.” Mr. Pai spoke at a news conference on Thursday after pushing through more rollbacks of Obama-era regulations. Appointed by President Trump in January, Mr. Pai has been on a deregulation charge. He has abolished a proposal to open the cable box market and frozen a program for broadband subsidies for low-income households. On Thursday, he passed two actions that will ease pricing restrictions on telecom giants and give broadcast television companies greater latitude to bulk up through mergers. Mr. Pai’s biggest targets are net neutrality and the classification of broadband like a utility. He has the broad support of Republican lawmakers and is expected to introduce a plan that would weaken aspects of the net neutrality rules as soon as this month. Mr. Pai said on Thursday that he wanted to overturn the declaration of broadband as a utility-like service, which puts stricter rules on broadband providers, akin to what phone services face today. "

Unlike I.R.S. agents, who are not usually allowed to call delinquent taxpayers by telephone, the outside debt-collection agencies will have free rein to do so. Consumer watchdogs are fearful that some of the nation’s most vulnerable taxpayers will be harassed and that criminals will take advantage of the system by phoning people and impersonating I.R.S. collectors. Additionally, one of the four companies that the I.R.S. has hired, Pioneer Credit Recovery, a subsidiary of Navient, was effectively fired two years ago by the Education Department from its contract to collect delinquent debt for misleading borrowers about their loans at what the department called “unacceptably high rates.” Proponents of the plan, who include Democrats and Republicans, point out that the debtors are shirking their tax obligations and that collecting from them will add to the Treasury’s coffers. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new debt-collection program had the potential to gain a net $2.4 billion over the next 10 years. “Collecting tax debt that’s due and not in dispute is a matter of fairness to the many taxpayers who pay what they owe,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. “It’s been clear for a long time that the I.R.S. isn’t collecting the debt that these contractors will focus on.” Twice before, in 1996 and 2006, the I.R.S. has tried to farm out some of its collection duties. Both times, the programs were shut down and deemed failures. The most recent attempt cost millions more than it took in. It also generated thousands of complaints, including one oft-repeated horror story about an older couple who received more than 150 phone calls in less than a month. "

In the wake of electoral upheavals around the world, including the victory of Donald J. Trump and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, the vote is one of several in Europe being closely watched worldwide. The president wields broad powers — although the prime minister, as the head of government, also plays an important role in the constitutional system, as does Parliament. Presidents are elected for a five-year term, for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The incumbent, François Hollande, a Socialist, has struggled to reduce unemployment and has had to deal with a string of deadly terrorist attacks. The demands are high for the next president to keep the country safe, jump-start its economy and manage the sometimes competing goals of improving the labor market and the maintaining a social safety net. France’s role in the European Union is also in question. Elections for the National Assembly, France’s lower and more powerful house of Parliament, are in June, and whoever wins the presidency will want to secure a favorable legislative majority. As with many elections in France, this one has two rounds. The first round, on Sunday, includes 11 candidates. If no one wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will proceed to a runoff on May 7. (No one has won the first round outright since direct popular voting for the presidency began in the 1960s.) The elections are across France and in its overseas territories; there are 45.7 million registered voters. The vast majority of voting is by paper ballot, counted by hand: There is no electronic voting and very few voting machines. Campaign spending is limited, and equal media exposure is enforced. "

1300,What Is the Antiquities Act and Why Does President Trump Want to Change It?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/climate/antiquities-act-federal-lands-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=97,2017/04/26,CLIMATE,"President Trump on Wednesday ordered the Interior Department to review the size and scope of national monuments larger than 100,000 acres created since 1996. He wants recommendations on whether any of those large tracts should be scaled back by presidential authority or by Congress. Mr. Trump, signing the order at the Interior Department, described the designations as a “massive federal land grab” and ordered the agency to review and reverse some of them. “It’s time to end these abuses and return control to the people, the people of Utah, the people of all of the states, the people of the United States,” the president said. National monuments are designated by presidents under a century-old law called the Antiquities Act. What does the law do, what changes in it does President Trump want and what lands might be affected? The law was enacted in 1906 to prevent looting of Indian artifacts from archaeological sites. The act has mostly been used since then by presidents to turn public land into national monuments protected forever from commercial development or future mineral exploitation. It was in the news at the end of the Obama administration after President Barack Obama created several national monuments, setting aside millions of acres on land and sea. At the time, some Republicans in Congress said they wanted to reform the act, which they said encouraged federal government overreach, a claim that has dogged the law since it was adopted. "
1301,Commander Takes Responsibility for Confusion Over Aircraft Carrier,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/asia/harry-harris-carl-vinson-north-korea.html?searchResultPosition=96,2017/04/26,ASIA PACIFIC,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s top commander in the Pacific accepted full responsibility on Wednesday for a bewildering chain of events this month that mistakenly left the impression that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson was rushing to confront an increasingly belligerent North Korea, when it was not. “That’s my fault for the confusion,” the officer, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., told the House Armed Services Committee during a hearing on security challenges in the region. “I’ll take the hit for it.” Admiral Harris, the head of the Pacific Command, ordered the Carl Vinson and three other warships this month to cancel a port call to Australia and “sail north” from Singapore into the western Pacific. An ill-timed news release by the Navy’s Third Fleet created the impression that the carrier was headed north immediately, but in reality it was steaming south to join the Australian Navy in a secretive, truncated exercise in the Indian Ocean, 3,500 miles southwest of the Korean Peninsula. “Where I failed was to communicate that adequately to the press and the media,” Admiral Harris said in response to a question from Representative Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat. “That is all on me.” South Korean and Japanese news media, as well as The New York Times, reported Admiral Harris’s order as evidence that the crisis was intensifying. While an aircraft carrier is not the weapon of choice for a strike on North Korea — such an operation would more likely involve long-range bombers and cruise missiles — it sends a vivid message of military might. The confusing sequence of events — including a partially erroneous explanation later by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis — were only fully revealed about a week later when the Navy posted photographs of the carrier sailing south through the Sunda Strait, which separates the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra.

Now, as President Trump approaches his 100th day in office, we wanted to circle back to some of the voters — most of them Trump supporters — we had spoken with around the start of his presidency about the issues that had driven their votes. Had Mr. Trump fulfilled his promises? Did his struggles and slack poll numbers disappoint them? Was he pleasing any of his detractors, or proving worse than they had feared? Many of his biggest backers said they had no regrets. No matter how few legislative accomplishments Mr. Trump can list, no matter the problems facing “the Wall,” no matter if his Twitter posts make them wince, they praised his swagger, his executive orders and his Supreme Court appointment. “Hitting it out of the ballpark,” said Dianna Ploss, a former nurse in Massachusetts. Others who opposed him then said they oppose him even more now. “When I get up in the morning, I think, ‘Well, what did Trump do now?’” said Diane Kirt, 64, of Reedsburg, Wis. But his critics have newfound energy and inspiration from protests that have propelled millions into the streets and nudged some to make first-time runs for public office. And then there are those somewhere in between. Some who were reluctant in November say they are happy with a growing economy and his support for the military. Some who cast a hedged, qualified vote for Mr. Trump say they are frustrated with his temperament and repeated falsehoods and would consider supporting a primary challenger. Others say: Give it more time — 100 more days, or 1,000. "

Senior White House officials, led by Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, have relentlessly pressed Republicans to revive the health care push before Mr. Trump’s hundred-day mark on Saturday, and with conservatives falling into line, the bill has a chance to get through the House, possibly as early as Friday. It was not clear whether conservative support for the revised legislation would be matched by losses in the center, especially among Republicans representing districts won by Hillary Clinton. But the rest of the House Republican Conference was left with a stark choice: Reject the measure and take the blame previously left at the feet of conservatives for undermining a central goal of the administration, or give it the nod, please voters who want a repeal, and risk taking a potentially fatal hit in the next election for approving a measure expected to leave tens of millions of Americans without insurance. “Members went home and got an earful,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, saying that voters were wondering, “Why can’t you get something done?” Mr. Cole said he was now “cautiously optimistic” that the measure could pass on the floor. The latest proposal, drafted by Representative Tom MacArthur, a moderate Republican of New Jersey, would allow states to obtain waivers from federal mandates that insurers cover certain “essential health benefits,” like emergency services, maternity care, and mental health and substance abuse services, which many Republicans argue have driven up premiums. It would also permit states to get waivers allowing insurers to charge higher premiums based on a person’s “health status,” if a state had a program to help pay the largest claims or had a high-risk pool where sick people could purchase health insurance.

His family’s real estate firm, the Kushner Companies, would spend about $190 million over the next few months on dozens of apartment buildings in tony Lower Manhattan neighborhoods including the East Village, the West Village and SoHo. For much of the roughly $50 million in down payments, Mr. Kushner turned to an undisclosed overseas partner. Public records and shell companies shield the investor’s identity. But, it turns out, the money came from a member of Israel’s Steinmetz family, which built a fortune as one of the world’s leading diamond traders. A Kushner Companies spokeswoman and several Steinmetz representatives say Raz Steinmetz, 53, was behind the deals. His uncle, and the family’s most prominent figure, is the billionaire Beny Steinmetz, who is under scrutiny by law enforcement authorities in four countries. In the United States, federal prosecutors are investigating whether representatives of his firm bribed government officials in Guinea to secure a multibillion dollar mining concession. In Israel, Mr. Steinmetz was detained in December and questioned in a bribery and money laundering investigation. In Switzerland and Guinea, prosecutors have conducted similar inquiries. The Steinmetz partnership with Mr. Kushner underscores the mystery behind his family’s multibillion-dollar business and its potential for conflicts with his role as perhaps the second-most powerful man in the White House, behind only his father-in-law, President Trump. Although Mr. Kushner resigned in January from his chief executive role at Kushner Companies, he remains the beneficiary of trusts that own the sprawling real estate business. The firm has taken part in roughly $7 billion in acquisitions over the last decade, many of them backed by foreign partners whose identities he will not reveal. Last month, his company announced that it had ended talks with the Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese financial firm linked to leading members of the ruling Communist Party. The potential agreement, first disclosed by The New York Times, had raised questions because of its favorable terms for the Kushners. "
1305,F.C.C. Chairman Pushes Sweeping Changes to Net Neutrality Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/technology/net-neutrality.html?searchResultPosition=91,2017/04/26,TECHNOLOGY,"WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday outlined a sweeping plan to loosen the government’s oversight of high-speed internet providers, a rebuke of a landmark policy approved two years ago to ensure that all online content is treated the same by the companies that deliver broadband service to Americans. The chairman, Ajit Pai, said high-speed internet service should no longer be treated like a public utility with strict rules, as it is now. The move would, in effect, largely leave the industry to police itself. The plan is Mr. Pai’s most forceful action in his race to roll back rules that govern telecommunications, cable and broadcasting companies, which he says are harmful to business. But he is certain to face a contentious battle with the consumers and tech companies that rallied around the existing rules, which are meant to prevent broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast from giving special treatment to any streaming videos, news sites and other content. “Two years ago, I warned that we were making a serious mistake,” Mr. Pai said at the Newseum in Washington, where he laid out the plan in a speech. “It’s basic economics. The more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you’re likely to get.” His plan, though still vague on the details, is a sharp change from the approach taken by the last F.C.C. administration, which approved rules governing a concept known as net neutrality in 2015. The rules were intended to ensure an open internet, meaning that no content could be blocked by broadband providers and that the internet would not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. The policy was the signature telecom regulation of the Obama era. It classified broadband as a common carrier service akin to phones, which are subject to strong government oversight. President Obama made an unusual public push for the reclassification in a video message that was widely shared and appeared to embolden the last F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, to make the change. "

This research provides fundamental understanding of the processes that advance medical treatment, an example being the development of a vaccine against the Zika virus. Such research leads to understanding of basic science and engineering at the atomic level, leading to technical innovation and invention, and inevitably drives growth of the economy. Government support of basic research over the last 70 years has brought to this country the best minds from abroad. Thus, support of basic research in the biological, chemical and physical sciences is one of the best investments we can make.

Mr. Trump’s skeletal outline of a tax package, unveiled at the White House in a single-page statement filled with bullet points, was less a plan than a wish list. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of Mr. Trump’s National Economic Council, laid out the bare bones to reporters, part of a mad dash toward the administration’s 100th day on Saturday that has included the resurrection of a health care bill and near-daily signings of executive orders. But they offered none of the standard accouterments of such rollouts, such as detailed charts showing the cost of each provision, phase-in periods, the impacts of the proposals on people and testimonials on the program’s potential benefits. “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big,” Mr. Cohn said. “President Trump has made tax reform a priority, and we have a Republican Congress that wants to get it done.” The proposal envisions slashing the tax rate paid by businesses large and small to 15 percent. The number of individual income tax brackets would shrink from seven to three — 10, 25 and 35 percent — easing the tax burden on most Americans, including the president, although aides did not offer the income ranges for each bracket. Individual tax rates currently have a ceiling of 39.6 percent and a floor of 10 percent. Most Americans pay taxes somewhere between the two. "
1308,"Obama’s Photographer Gains a New Following, and a Book Deal",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/pete-souza.html?searchResultPosition=93,2017/04/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Pete Souza, the former chief White House photographer who became so close to President Obama that he held his wedding in the Rose Garden, is encountering newfound notoriety on social media for a personal Instagram account that has subtly taken aim at President Trump since Inauguration Day. Now, after nearly 100 days and over one million Instagram followers, the natural next step, it seems, is a book deal. Mr. Souza is working on a book, “Obama: An Intimate Portrait: The Historic Presidency in Photographs,” the publisher Little, Brown and Company announced this week. The book, scheduled for publication in November, will contain a collection of over 300 of Mr. Souza’s photographs. In an email, Mr. Souza said that he was narrowing his choices from a pool of about 10,000 photos, and that he would aim to show Mr. Obama “in all facets of his life.” “There are pictures that certainly show him stressing in the Situation Room over major decisions,” Mr. Souza wrote, “but also pictures of him interacting in fun moments with his girls.” On social media, Mr. Souza has amassed an audience of people who visit for archived photos of the Obama family, leaving comments like “I miss them” and “Thank you.” When he started the Instagram account, the mix of photos Mr. Souza published from his archive served as a nostalgic haven for millions of Democrats mourning the end of the 44th presidency. But shortly after Inauguration Day, the commentary grew edgier, and Mr. Souza, who has been openly critical on social media of Mr. Trump’s policies, offered his Obama-era commentary on everything from Trump administration staff members’ reported inability to operate light switches to the rocky implementation of a travel ban that the courts have blocked so far.

On May 4, Donald J. Trump is coming back to New York for the first time since moving into the White House. The president will visit the U.S.S. Intrepid, the decommissioned aircraft carrier on the West Side of Manhattan, according to Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. There he will meet with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia to commemorate the 75th anniversary of a naval battle the countries fought alongside one another during World War II. And the city, where protests against Trump policies have erupted in parks, airports, schools, churches, synagogues, mosques, museums, restaurants and streets, to name just a few locations, is girding for what, in the inflamed atmosphere, may be a battle of its own. “The mayor embraces this as an opportunity to remind the president that New York is the greatest city in the world because of, not in spite of, our diversity and inclusiveness,” said Eric Phillips, a mayoral spokesman. The New York City Police Department, he said, “is plenty prepared to handle the president’s security and the expected outpouring of New Yorkers who look forward to greeting him.” At 5:56 p.m. on Tuesday, organizers for the Working Families Party got word of the visit via Twitter. By 6:02 they had agreed to hold a protest the day he returns, said Nelini Stamp, the party’s national membership director. In less than 24 hours since the event was posted on the group’s Facebook page and with protest plans still being figured out, more than 2,000 people had expressed interest in going. “We want to make it as difficult as possible for him to be able to just walk onto the Intrepid and give this speech,” Ms. Stamp said.

1310,Donald Trump’s First 100 Days: The Worst on Record,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/opinion/donald-trumps-first-100-days-the-worst-on-record.html?searchResultPosition=109,2017/04/26,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Franklin D. Roosevelt invented the idea of a president’s first 100 days. Roosevelt was actually referring to the first 100 days of a special Congressional session to fight the Great Depression, as Robert Speel of Penn State notes. But the idea soon came to mean the 100 days that start on Jan. 20 and that, for President Trump, will end on Saturday. No doubt, you’ve seen a torrent of coverage in recent days of the milestone. And while it’s certainly an arbitrary milestone, it’s also a meaningful one. Presidents are at their most influential in their early months, which makes that period a particularly important one for a presidency. Here’s my reading of Trump’s start: It’s the least successful first 100 days since the concept existed. Even if you forget about the content of his actions — whether they strengthened or weakened the country — and focus only on how much he accomplished, it’s a poor beginning. His supporters deserve to be disappointed, and his opponents should be cheered by how unsuccessful his agenda has been so far. Before now, the weakest starts probably belonged to Bill Clinton and to John F. Kennedy. Partly as a result, neither of them ended up being as consequential presidents as, say, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan or Barack Obama. And yet Trump’s first 100 days have been vastly weaker than Clinton’s or Kennedy’s: Trump has made no significant progress on any major legislation. His health care bill is a zombie. His border wall is stalled. He’s only now releasing basic principles of a tax plan. Even his executive order on immigration is tied up in the courts. By contrast, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan had made substantial progress toward passing tax cuts, and Barack Obama had passed, among other things, a huge stimulus bill that also addressed education and climate policy. "
1311,‘American Gods’: Why a Story About Ancient Deities Is Relevant Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/television/american-gods-neil-gaiman-starz.html?searchResultPosition=101,2017/04/26,TELEVISION,"Early in “American Gods,” a new Starz series based on Neil Gaiman’s acclaimed 2001 novel, an old grifter played by Ian McShane sneers at America’s existential anxiety. “This is the only country in the world that wonders what it is,” he mutters. He doesn’t know the half of it — the scene was written and shot months before a polarizing presidential contest and new administration made fretting over the soul of America a national pastime. But it’s just one of the ways that this audacious series, debuting Sunday, April 30, possesses surprising relevancy for a 16-year-old story about deities that have been worshiped for millenniums. “American Gods,” at its core, is a road story about an ex-con named Shadow (Ricky Whittle), who takes up with Mr. McShane’s enigmatic Mr. Wednesday. Their mission involves a rivalry between fading “old gods” — ancient mythological figures like Loki, Kali and Anansi, who were brought to life in America via the beliefs of immigrants — and new gods who have arisen to replace them, borne of more modern obsessions like technology and celebrity. Phantasmagorical and terrifically violent high jinks ensue, among other arresting visuals. (A reanimated corpse totes her amputated arm like a satchel. A love goddess consumes partners with her vagina.) But beneath the extraordinary imagery is a story about the power and evolution of faith, and of immigrants who helped to build and define American culture, only to see said culture turn against them. This overarching theme, as well as smaller vignettes about American newcomers, have taken on the sheen of advocacy, the show’s overseers say, since Donald J. Trump’s election and proposed immigration bans. The show, which finished shooting in October, was never planned as a political statement. But “what has changed, bizarrely and drastically and unfortunately, is that now immigration is seen by too many as something to be vilified,” said Michael Green, who created the series with Bryan Fuller. The new gods’ hold on the American mindshare has also become exponentially more consuming since the book was written, years before Facebook, TMZ or iPhones. All of which suggests that while various “American Gods” adaptations have been proposed since the novel came out, to no avail, there’s never been a better time for one to come to fruition. "
1312,Ivanka Trump and the Issue of Image in Berlin,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/fashion/ivanka-trump-berlin.html?searchResultPosition=102,2017/04/26,FASHION,"Ivanka Trump’s first official public appearance in her new position as a special adviser to her father, President Trump, was, as with many things related to the Trump administration, not without controversy. This time, at the W20 Summit in Berlin on Tuesday, the focus was on the boos she received while defending his attitude toward women. But in some ways, what she wore to the panel discussion — and what her choices said about her role — were even more telling. On the one hand, her trip wardrobe was notable for the way it supported a Buy America platform and acknowledged that her job is partly to ease negative perceptions of her father’s attitudes (and not just because the white dress she wore to the gala dinner on Tuesday practically screamed “new leaf”). As you might expect from someone who built a fashion brand on social media and her own carefully shared story, Ms. Trump is as aware as anyone that a dress is never just a dress — especially when you know the world will be watching. And especially when every time you step outside, someone takes your photograph. On the other hand, her clothing reflected the same conflicts that have bedeviled Mr. Trump’s government from the beginning. "
1313,"Over 1,000 People Are Detained in Raids in Turkey",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/europe/turkey-1000-coup-gulen.html?searchResultPosition=103,2017/04/26,EUROPE,"ISTANBUL — More than a thousand people, accused of being “secret imams” for an American-based cleric who the authorities have said was responsible for a failed coup in July, were detained in Turkey on Wednesday in the largest such sweep in months. The civilian detainees are accused of directing police officers also loyal to the cleric, effectively creating a parallel leadership. Over 9,100 police officers were suspended later in the day because of their alleged links to the movement, Anadolu Agency, a state-run news wire, reported on Wednesday night. About 45,000 people have already been taken into custody since the coup attempt, but the raids on Wednesday represented the first widespread roundup of political opponents since a referendum on April 16 to expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Some analysts had wondered whether the crackdown might slow as Mr. Erdogan tried to establish greater national consensus after winning the contentious referendum, but the scale of the raids suggested it was just as likely to accelerate. The sweeping purge of state institutions has led to the firing of about 130,000 people. The interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said officers had detained 1,009 people whom he described as high-ranking members of the Islamic group led by the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. The group is accused of infiltrating many Turkish institutions over the past three decades. According to Mr. Soylu, the “secret imams” were part of a parallel leadership structure within the police force that was ultimately answerable to Mr. Gulen, whose extradition has long been sought by the Turkish authorities. The subject of  Mr. Gulen is almost certain to be discussed at a coming meeting in Washington between President Trump and Mr. Erdogan, whose government was allied to the cleric’s movement before the two fell out publicly in 2013. The raids were a “most important step toward uncovering a group that leaked into the police force, trying to rule the police force from outside, trying to establish an almost alternative police organization, ignoring the rules of the state,” Mr. Soylu said, in remarks quoted by Anadolu. The crackdown has targeted not just those believed to be “Gulenists,” but also leftist and liberal dissidents, including journalists, soldiers, judges, lawyers, teachers and professors. Some people have been purged simply for placing their children in Gulen-owned schools or for putting their money in Gulen-owned banks. The arrests on Wednesday followed the detention of 38 opposition activists who were questioned last week in connection with their involvement in protests about accusations of voter fraud in the recent referendum.

1314,"Obama Balances Civic-Minded Side With the Lure of a $400,000 Speech",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/obama-speech-fee.html?searchResultPosition=104,2017/04/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Two post-presidential Barack Obamas emerged this week. The first was the civic-minded one, seated on a stage in Chicago, where he talked about the importance of community organizing and told a student audience that he had succeeded in politics because people believed “my values were not so different from theirs.” The other was the one set to cash a $400,000 check from Wall Street — the same amount as his yearly salary during his time in the White House — when he delivers a speech in September at a health care conference run by Cantor Fitzgerald, a trading and investment firm. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama’s spokesman defended the former president’s coming speech, saying Mr. Obama decided to give it because health care changes were important to him. The spokesman, Eric Schultz, noted that Cantor Fitzgerald is a Wall Street firm but pointed out in a statement that as a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama raised money from Wall Street and went on to aggressively regulate it. Mr. Obama will spend most of his post-presidency, Mr. Schultz said, “training and elevating a new generation of political leaders in America.” Throughout his years in the White House, Mr. Obama championed the problems of the poor even as he showed an affinity for Hollywood superstars, elite artists and technology billionaires. As he left the White House, Mr. Obama made it clear that he wanted to continue working for those who struggle to climb what he often called the “ladders of opportunity.” During his remarks on Monday to students at the University of Chicago, he spoke about the need to pursue the right things in life, not just fame or money. “If you’re more concerned with ‘I want to be a congressman’ or ‘I want to be a senator’ or ‘I want to be rich,’ some people may succeed in chasing that goal, but when they get there, they don’t know what to do with it,” Mr. Obama said.

And yet, investors seem to have finally been given a glimmer of hope for the future. But first, the bad news. On Wednesday, Twitter reported its first fall in revenue since its initial public offering in 2013, posting sales of $548 million in the first quarter, down 7 percent from a year earlier. But that beat investors’ low expectations for the company; Wall Street analysts had predicted revenue of $509 million. Twitter also surprised investors in another crucial area, adding nine million users in the first quarter, for a total of 328 million active users monthly. That is a 6 percent increase from the previous year, and the largest quarterly net increase in new users since early 2015. Investors took kindly to the news, and Twitter shares rose 12 percent to $16.34 in pre-market trading. “We’re delivering on our goal to build a service that people love to use, every day, and we’re encouraged by the audience growth momentum we saw in the first quarter,” Mr. Dorsey, the Twitter chief executive, said in a letter to investors. “While we continue to face revenue headwinds, we believe that executing on our plan and growing our audience should result in positive revenue growth over the long term.” It is a bright spot of news for the beleaguered company, which was founded 11 years ago and has struggled to maintain growth even as other social media companies, including Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, have seen their popularity and user numbers surge. Twitter has also had to contend with Facebook mimicking some of its strengths — like providing a platform for breaking news and celebrity influencers — while it has struggled to convince advertisers that its 140-character messaging service is the best place for people to see what’s happening in the world at a given moment. Under Mr. Dorsey, Twitter has sought to find ways to make its service more attractive to mainstream audiences. He has warned investors that turnarounds take time, and he has appointed new heads of product and engineering to assist him in overhauling the company. The goal for Twitter is to translate its enormous impact on media and culture, and the preferred means for President Trump to communicate, into a booming business, something that has eluded it so far. “By Wall Street standards, Twitter’s a diving joke. A company that’s hit a financial wall with no obvious upside,” Bob Lefsetz, a media industry analyst, said in his morning newsletter to subscribers. “By cultural standards, it’s a juggernaut, far exceeding the impact of Facebook and Snapchat, even Instagram.” "

1317,Defiant Trump Vows to Take Immigration Case to Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/trump-immigration-courts-california.html?searchResultPosition=107,2017/04/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump vowed on Wednesday to challenge California jurisdictions all the way to the Supreme Court after a federal judge there stopped him from withholding funds to penalize them for shielding illegal immigrants. Mr. Trump, who twice has been blocked by courts from imposing a temporary travel ban on visitors from select Muslim-majority countries, expressed frustration that once again a judge in a single district could thwart him from taking action. The judge who issued the latest ruling is in California, the same state as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which heard the previous cases. “First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “See you in the Supreme Court!” Asked by reporters later in the day whether he was surprised by the ruling, Mr. Trump said: “I’m never surprised by the Ninth Circuit. We’ll see them at the Supreme Court.” Mr. Trump may have been confused about which court actually ruled in the latest dispute, involving so-called sanctuary cities. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has not yet actually heard the case, just a district court judge located within the Ninth Circuit jurisdiction. Under normal procedures, the district court judge’s ruling would have to be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which would rule before it could be brought to the Supreme Court. But Mr. Trump’s confidence in a future victory at the Supreme Court follows the successful confirmation of his appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. In theory, at least, Justice Gorsuch bolsters the conservative wing of the court, but there is no guarantee that five justices would agree to overturn a ruling against the administration even if the case does reach them.

Now the City Council is redoubling its efforts. On Wednesday, three of its committees held a hearing on nine bills aimed at expanding protections for the city’s undocumented immigrants, as well as Muslims and residents who are gay, bisexual or transgender. “This is how we respond, with legislative fixes, through a public hearing process,” said Councilman Carlos Menchaca, Democrat of Brooklyn, the chairman of the Immigration Committee. “These bills represent the continued outcry of support that our residents are asking for.” The same day, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his own response: He designated $16.4 million for immigrant legal services to assist people in detention, children coming to the country unaccompanied and asylum seekers. In 2014, the Council made New York one of the first cities to enact laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement officials in the detention of undocumented immigrants. The laws prohibited the Police and Correction Departments from holding inmates for release until the enforcement agency, known as ICE, could collect them. The two departments could hold detainees for ICE only after receiving a warrant from a judge, and only those who had committed a violent and serious crime within the previous five years. Those policies were behind a recent war of words between the Trump administration and officials in New York City over its so-called sanctuary city status, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions asserting that New York was “soft on crime.” Mayor de Blasio and James P. O’Neill, the police commissioner, forcefully rejected that idea, and the attorney general backpedaled. "

I have no idea what Mr. Comey’s thinking was in commenting last July on what he perceived to be Hillary Clinton’s “carelessness” in connection with her private email server or in publicly reopening his investigation of her shortly before the election based on what ultimately proved to be nothing of substance. What I can say is this: In both instances he violated every rule in the book governing the conduct of federal law enforcement officials and did so in a way that was partisan and that indubitably affected the outcome of the election. During my nearly 37 years as a public prosecutor, I participated in numerous investigations of high-profile public figures. A number of those investigations resulted in no charges being brought, and in such cases we issued either no statement at all or a very brief statement to the effect that the investigation in question had yielded insufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges. Had I done what Mr. Comey had in the case of Mrs. Clinton, I would, unquestionably, have been subjected to discipline, up to and including being fired. The head of the F.B.I. is subject to the same rules as I was; he should be subject to the same discipline. ELLIOTT B. JACOBSON
SCARSDALE, N.Y. To the Editor: Even if the F.B.I. finds that there was Russian influence on the 2016 election, no one is reasonably suggesting that the Russians somehow hacked voting machines (which are not connected to the internet) or altered vote counts. No one is suggesting that the Hillary Clinton campaign emails that the Russians may have passed to WikiLeaks were not authentic or were in any way altered. So, at worst, the Russians may have made available to American voters true and accurate information about Mrs. Clinton that may indeed have influenced votes. Of course, none of this would had happened had Mrs. Clinton and her staff been more responsible with email security. "

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) This month the East Bay Times was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Ghost Ship warehouse fire that killed 36 people. The publication’s win was evidence that even after years of economic free-fall in the news business, local journalism was alive and kicking. Then, days later, word came that as many as 20 newsroom jobs would be eliminated in a cost-cutting effort, according to labor negotiators. “It’s a punch in the gut,” said Carl Hall, executive officer at the Pacific Media Workers Guild, which represents East Bay Times staff. “You cannot say this is not a high quality work force.” Neil Chase, executive editor of Bay Area News Group, which oversees the Times, said newspapers had not yet figured out how to counter slumping ad revenue. “Nobody is happy about this,” he said of the cuts. “I’m certainly not.” Since 2001, American newspapers have shed more than half of their work force. Evidence of the culling in California is everywhere: — A labor survey found that newsrooms in the East Bay and South Bay shrank by more than a third in the last five years. — With fewer than 500 newsroom employees, The Los Angeles Times is now less than half of what it was in 2000. — According to a Pew survey in 2014, the number of newspaper reporters assigned to the statehouse, 24, had fallen by a third from a decade earlier.

I grew up in affluent, suburban Scarsdale, N.Y., a town sporting quite the selection of private golf clubs. And I studied at the University of Chicago, a cloister of academics and bookish young people that is a world away from the low-income neighborhoods nearby, or the city’s industrial roots. I was keenly aware of all of this when I traveled to Indiana four times over the last year to spend time with some of the more than 2,000 assembly line workers who wound up at the center of debate in the presidential election. When Carrier and its parent, United Technologies, announced last year that it was closing two Indiana plants and moving jobs to Mexico, Donald J. Trump made the air-conditioner and furnace maker the focus of his attacks on free trade agreements and outsourcing. But I wanted to hear from the workers themselves, in addition to the economists and Wall Street analysts I often quote. And so it was that on a rainy March afternoon in 2016, I found myself standing on the far side of the entrance to the Carrier factory in Indianapolis at the end of the day shift, waiting for workers to drive out through a security gate. I began knocking on S.U.V. windows and introducing myself as an economics reporter for The New York Times. Some kept the glass rolled up. Others politely declined to discuss the impending closing. A few hurriedly gave me their cellphone numbers. I handed out as many business cards as I could. A few hours later I received a text from Nicole Hargrove, who works the 6 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift. Would I like to meet her and a few colleagues at a bar after work the next day? We arrived early, my photographer with a camera around his neck and me in my reporters’ uniform — chinos and a blue sport coat, notebook in hand.

Critics of Mr. Trump’s approach say it unfairly takes aim at a population that is less likely to commit crimes than American citizens. The office, called Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will be housed within Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for deportations. John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, said the office would offer a voice for victims. “All crime is terrible, but these victims are unique — and too often ignored,” he said. “These are casualties of crimes that should never have taken place because the people who victimized them oftentimes should not have been in the country in the first place.” ICE officials said the office would provide a hotline for victims and would be staffed by about 21 community relations officers and 27 specialists in victim assistance. They did not provide a budget for the office, saying it would be funded with existing resources. Mr. Trump announced the creation of the office when he signed an executive order on immigration in January. "

The Khuranas reached out to city and state officials for help paying their bills. They discovered, as many victims of hate and harassment do, that getting financial assistance isn’t always easy. Victims of hate crimes can sue perpetrators under state and federal hate crime or other civil rights laws for compensatory damages and, in some cases, punitive damages as well.

As Nancy Gibbs, the magazine’s editor in chief, informed the crowd from the stage, there were a number of key elements missing, including the honoree Leila de Lima, a Philippine senator, who “could not be here tonight because she is in jail, for protesting the policies of the president.” An honoree from last year, Denis Mukwege, was coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo “until he had to cancel at the last minute because one of his colleagues was assassinated,” she added. “They are not soldiers, they are doctors.” This certainly never happens at the Met Gala. Then again, the annual Time 100 bash is a most unusual gala, a glittering celebration not of celebrity, but of influence. "
1326,Trump’s Tax Plan Is a Reckoning for Republican Deficit Hawks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/trump-tax-plan-budget-deficit.html?searchResultPosition=61,2017/04/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — As President Trump’s top economic advisers faced a barrage of questions on Wednesday about the tax plan they had just unfurled, there was one that they struggled most to answer: how to keep the “massive tax cuts” they proposed from ballooning the federal deficit. The White House insists that economic growth will cover the cost, which could be as high as $7 trillion over a decade. But the question will dog Republicans and could fracture their party as they face the prospect of endorsing a plan that many economists and budget analysts warn will increase the deficit. After years of fiscal hawkishness, conservatives now face a moment of truth about whether they truly believe America’s economy is drowning in debt. Some skeptics are already ringing alarm bells, fearing that Republicans will sign on to what critics see as a dangerous plan composed by a president who called himself the King of Debt. “It seems the administration is using economic growth like magic beans: the cheap solution to all our problems,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that advocates fiscal restraint. “But there is no golden goose at the top of the tax-cut beanstalk, just mountains of debt.” Ms. MacGuineas’s group estimates that Mr. Trump’s plan could reduce federal tax revenue by $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade. The economy would need to grow at a rate of 4.5 percent — more than double its projected rate, an unlikely prospect — to make the plan self-financing. "
1327,The Drumbeats Don’t Add Up to Imminent War With North Korea,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/asia/trump-administration-north-korea.html?searchResultPosition=62,2017/04/26,ASIA PACIFIC,"WASHINGTON — President Trump summoned all 100 members of the Senate for a briefing by his war cabinet on the mounting tensions with North Korea. An American submarine loaded with Tomahawk missiles surfaced in a port in South Korea. Gas stations in the North shut down amid rumors that the government was stockpiling fuel. Americans could be forgiven for thinking that war is about to break out. But it is not. The drumbeat of bellicose threats and military muscle-flexing on both sides overstates the danger of a clash between the United States and North Korea, senior Trump administration officials and experts who have followed the Korean crisis for decades said. While Mr. Trump regards the rogue government in the North as his most pressing international problem, he told the senators he was pursuing a strategy that relied heavily on using China’s economic leverage to curb its neighbor’s provocative behavior. Recent American military moves — like deploying the submarine Michigan and the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the waters off the Korean Peninsula — were aimed less at preparing for a pre-emptive strike, officials said, than at discouraging the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, from conducting further nuclear or ballistic missile tests. “In confronting the reckless North Korean regime, it’s critical that we’re guided by a strong sense of resolve, both privately and publicly, both diplomatically and militarily,” Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the Pentagon’s top commander in the Pacific, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. “We want to bring Kim Jong-un to his senses,” he said, “not to his knees.” There are other signs that the tensions fall short of war. Mr. Kim continues to appear in public, most recently at a pig farm last weekend. South Koreans are not flooding supermarkets to stock up on food. There is no talk of evacuating cities and no sign the United States is deploying additional forces to South Korea. Nor is the American Embassy in Seoul advising diplomats’ families to leave the country. All those things happened in the spring of 1994, when President Bill Clinton was considering a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean reactor to prevent the North from extracting plutonium that it could use to make a bomb. That is the closest the United States has come to a military clash with North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. "
1328,Trump Orders Review of Education Policies to Strengthen Local Control,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/trump-education-policy-review.html?searchResultPosition=63,2017/04/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump issued a sweeping review of federal education policies on Wednesday in an executive order to pinpoint areas where the government may be overstepping in shaping operations of local school systems. The order requires Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s education secretary, to review, modify and possibly repeal any regulations and guidelines that are not consistent with federal law. Mr. Trump described the order as “another critical step to restoring local control,” and one that fulfills one of his campaign promises. “For too long, the federal government has imposed its will on state and local governments,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference to sign the order. “The result has been education that spends more, and achieves far, far, far less.” The review will be conducted within 300 days, and its findings will be published in a public report. It aims to ensure local leaders will have the final say “about what happens in the classroom,” said Rob Goad, a senior Education Department official. Ms. DeVos is already empowered to rescind guidance and regulations, and has already done so, and any attempt at overturning laws would be subjected to a legal, regulatory process. In an interview, Ms. DeVos called Mr. Trump’s order a “welcomed opportunity” and “a clear mandate to take that real hard look at what we’ve been doing at the department level that we shouldn’t be doing, and what ways we have overreached.” "

1330,President Trump’s Laughable Plan to Cut His Own Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/opinion/trumps-laughable-plan-to-cut-his-own-taxes.html?searchResultPosition=65,2017/04/26,OPINION,"As a rule, Republican presidents like offering tax cuts, and President Trump is no different. But the skimpy one-page tax proposal his administration released on Wednesday is, by any historical standard, a laughable stunt by a gang of plutocrats looking to enrich themselves at the expense of the country’s future. Two of Mr. Trump’s top lieutenants — Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, both multimillionaires and former Goldman Sachs bankers — trotted out a plan that would slash taxes for businesses and wealthy families, including Mr. Trump’s, in the vague hope of propelling economic growth. So as to not seem completely venal, they served up a few goodies for the average wage-earning family, among them fewer and lower tax brackets and a higher standard deduction. The proposal was so empty of illustrative detail that few people could even begin to calculate its impact on their pocketbooks. Further, depending on where they live, some middle-class families might not benefit much or at all, because the plan does away with important deductions like those for state and local taxes. As to the rationale offered up by Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Cohn, even many conservative economists believe that the argument that tax cuts will pay for themselves, by increasing investment and creating jobs, is the same supply-side fantasy that has repeatedly been proved wrong. This durable nonsense would instead add mightily to a federal debt that Americans will be paying off for generations to come. Here again, the long-term consequences were hard to figure, because Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin offered no estimates of the plan’s costs; guesswork by some analysts put the figure in the same ballpark as the tax plan Mr. Trump offered during the campaign, or about $7 trillion in additional debt over the first 10 years and nearly $21 trillion by 2036. Whatever the number, the outcome cannot be good. There are legitimate reasons to run deficits, including lifting the economy in tough times, strengthening the military against proven threats and building or rebuilding public infrastructure. Borrowing trillions of dollars to provide a huge windfall for people at the top is not one of those reasons. "
1331,"State Police Will Help Battle MS-13, Cuomo Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/nyregion/state-police-will-help-battle-ms-13-cuomo-says.html?searchResultPosition=66,2017/04/26,NEW YORK,"BRENTWOOD, N.Y. — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo traveled to this community in Suffolk County on Wednesday to announce the creation of an anti-gang policing initiative to combat MS-13, the brutal transnational gang that he called “a current scourge” on the area. “They are a network that has created horrendous crimes,” said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, who was joined by state and local leaders and several state troopers at a State Police barracks in Brentwood. “Their currency is fear and intimidation, and they are getting more outrageous and more obnoxious in their activities.” Most recently, the gang has been implicated in the murders of four young men whose bodies were discovered on the edge of a town park in neighboring Central Islip this month. As part of the statewide initiative, the State Police will increase undercover and uniformed operations in the area, adding 25 officers to the efforts of the local police and an F.B.I. task force to battle the gang, which has its roots in Central America. Officials said residents of Brentwood and Central Islip should expect to see a larger State Police presence in the area. The violence in the area — MS-13 was blamed for 11 murders last year in Suffolk County, including those of two teenage girls who were brutally pummeled with machetes and baseball bats near a Brentwood elementary school in September — has drawn national attention, and Mr. Cuomo said the continued violence committed by MS-13 had prompted him to act. The governor’s initiative came two days before Attorney General Jeff Sessions is scheduled to visit the area to discuss gang violence. President Trump has said the threat raised by gangs justifies his administration’s tough proposals on immigration. Amid discussions of the federal budget, Mr. Trump said Sunday on Twitter that his proposed wall along the Mexican border would “stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.” Mr. Cuomo distanced his actions from those of the Trump administration. “We’ve been talking about this for the past couple weeks,” he said. “I can’t speak to what the attorney general is doing.” In Suffolk County, law enforcement officials have expressed concern that the emphasis on deportations will drive witnesses and informants underground. “That is a problem we have all across the board,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It’s gotten worse recently.” He reiterated that the State Police do not participate in immigration enforcement or control. Mr. Cuomo said that members of the gang, which is also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, were “thugs who prey on young people and recruit young people, often unaccompanied children from Central America, and they seduce them into a life of gang violence.” The Long Island Gang Task Force that some of the state officers will join includes about 30 agents, detectives and officers from federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. More than a dozen suspected gang members were arrested in a recent sweep by the task force after the killings. The authorities said that at least 10 of those arrested were undocumented immigrants. "
1332,De Blasio Proposes $84 Billion Budget as Possible Federal Cuts Loom,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/nyregion/de-blasio-proposes-84-billion-budget-as-possible-federal-cuts-loom.html?searchResultPosition=67,2017/04/26,NEW YORK,"Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday proposed an $84.9 billion operating budget for New York City that included new spending to provide legal services to immigrants — a nod to changing federal policy under President Trump. But the spending plan, like a preliminary version unveiled in January, retained a wait-and-see-approach toward the possibility that the Trump administration would make significant cuts in federal financing that could carve a wide hole in the city’s spending plans. The proposal, for the final budget of Mr. de Blasio’s first term, provided a blueprint of sorts for a potential second term with big-ticket investments — including an additional $1.9 billion in capital spending to create more apartments for some of the poorest New Yorkers — and long-term plans, like tens of millions of dollars to start a preschool program for 3-year-olds in city public schools, and new spending on homeless shelters. The mayor’s spending plan also designates $1 billion in capital funding to design new jail facilities, in keeping with the mayor’s recent commitment to shut down the Rikers Island jail complex and replace it with jails elsewhere in the city. Mr. de Blasio said he would work with the City Council to determine possible sites for new jails, and then move on to the arduous task of designing them and getting them approved through the city’s lengthy land-use process. The level of spending in the proposed budget is most likely a low estimate for how much the city will ultimately spend on its operations over the next fiscal year. For example, at this time last year, Mr. de Blasio proposed an $82.2 billion executive budget for the 2017 fiscal year; the city now estimates that it will spend $85.5 billion by the end of the fiscal year. The mayor took some precautions for the future: The plan for the 2018 fiscal year calls for preserving $1 billion in reserves from previous budgets; efforts to find savings through measures like reducing overtime and using office space more efficiently; and a hiring freeze on some administrative positions (with no estimate of how much a freeze would save).

1333,Curb the Use of Overseas Tax Havens? Yes! But How?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/business/economy/trump-tax-plan-repatriation.html?searchResultPosition=68,2017/04/26,ECONOMY,"Wherever one may land on the applause-o-meter wired to President Trump’s latest outline for a tax makeover, it aims to fix an aspect of the code that pretty much everyone agrees is broken: the way the global profits of American corporations are taxed. The current system — in which profits earned abroad are not taxed until they are brought home — creates perverse incentives, encouraging American companies to park their money in lower-tax havens outside the United States. That stash now amounts to roughly $2.6 trillion. Repairing that system will require policy makers to confront two vexing problems. The first is how to get American companies to reel in the enormous sum and pay at least some of the tax that is due. The second is to overhaul how foreign earnings are taxed in the future so that multinationals change their ways. The broad plan unveiled on Wednesday by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, shows that the administration is eager to tackle both issues, but the plan does not provide enough detail to judge whether its approach will actually work. Republicans and Democrats have railed against the accounting acrobatics that American multinationals exploit to avoid paying taxes on foreign earnings. They buy or merge with foreign companies to establish headquarters outside the United States — a practice known as inversion — or relocate their patents and copyrights to places with low tax rates, like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. The arrangement not only deprives the United States of revenue but also increases the tax burden on American businesses that cannot or will not move their profits overseas. The current system has perpetuated a lot of waste and nonsense, said Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The nominal corporate rate is 35 percent, roughly 10 points above the average rate in most developed European nations. That differential encourages tax avoidance, Mr. Viard said. "

However, the viral spread of a 10-month-old New York Times story has potentially given millions of internet users misleading impressions to the contrary. Following the web traffic and social media commentary around the article illustrates how a hot-button cultural issue can be taken out of context and amplified by hyperpartisan bubbles, inflaming passions and spreading misinformation. On June 14, 2016, The Times published a story online with the headline, “Senate Votes to Require Women to Register for the Draft.” The story reported on the approval of a budget amendment by the Senate. The final version of the bill, which President Barack Obama signed six months later, in December, did not include the provision. In late January 2017, the article was shared by several Facebook pages in the military community, leading to an increase in traffic. In April, after President Trump launched a strike on a Syrian air base, fan pages for Senator Bernie Sanders spurred a smaller spike in readership. In total, nearly 2 million people have clicked on this 2016 congressional procedural story, making it one of the 100 most-read Times stories of 2017 so far. And Google Trends data shows an obvious bump in searches for questions like “Do women have to register for the draft?” around the spikes in viral social sharing. A scan of the thousands of comments left on the different Facebook posts reveals obvious confusion. Some readers, responding only to the dated headline, are under the impression that Congress recently voted to draft their daughters or, alternatively, to finally move the army toward greater gender equality.

An amendment drafted by Tom MacArthur, a New Jersey congressman, would keep much of the American Health Care Act in place. But it would set up a waiver program that would allow states to apply to eliminate three major insurance regulations established by Obamacare. States could get a waiver if they attested that the changes would achieve one of five broad policy goals, such as increasing the choice of health plans. The change has won the endorsement of the conservative Freedom Caucus, which had opposed the original bill. Broadly speaking, states with such waivers would be worse for Americans with more complex health care needs, but would have lower insurance premiums for people without a history of illness. Here are the rules that states could apply to waive under the new proposal. A basic set of benefits, including hospital care, prescription drugs and maternity care, that must be included in all health insurance. Under Obamacare: The benefit rules established a floor for all insurance products. They also created a benchmark for related rules on how much patients could be asked to pay directly for care. But they have been criticized for increasing the cost of insurance. Republicans’ plan, with Tuesday’s amendment: States could waive the benefit rules and set up their own standards instead. "

Ms. Coulter, the acid-penned conservative writer, canceled a planned appearance on Thursday after the political organizations that invited her rescinded their support over fears of violence. “It’s a sad day for free speech,” she said. But across the country, conservatives like her are eagerly throwing themselves into volatile situations like the one in Berkeley, emboldened by a backlash over what many Americans see as excessive political correctness, a president who has gleefully taken up their fight, and liberals they accuse of trying to censor any idea they disagree with. The situation adds up to a striking reversal in the culture wars, with the left now often demanding that offensive content be excised from public discourse and those who promote it boycotted and shunned. Berkeley has again become a symbolic flash point. The university was not just the cradle of the Free Speech Movement but also the site of a violent 1969 crackdown that delighted many protest-weary Americans when Ronald Reagan, then California’s governor, ordered the National Guard to move in on student demonstrators. The broader point that conservatives now say they are making resonates far beyond academia, and in many ways echoes some of the most bitter undercurrents of the 2016 presidential election. "

Second, the president told the leaders of Mexico and Canada that he would not terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement for now, keeping in place what he once called the worst trade deal ever signed by the United States.

Ms. Trump’s comments, which seemed to question the basis for President Trump’s two executive orders that tried to bar migrants from Syria and other predominantly Muslim nations, set off a minor scramble in the West Wing. Advisers grappled with a political problem unique to Mr. Trump’s family-business White House: how to manage an officially empowered daughter who is prone to challenging elements of the president’s conservative agenda. “I think there is a global humanitarian crisis that’s happening, and we have to come together and we have to solve it,” Ms. Trump told NBC when asked about the refugee crisis in Syria, which has created a nativist backlash in European countries. Asked whether that would include admitting Syrian refugees to the United States, she replied: “That has to be part of the discussion. But that’s not going to be enough in and of itself.” The remarks, in an interview that was recorded Tuesday, came at the end of Ms. Trump’s rocky 24-hour trip this week to Germany, her first official foray since taking a West Wing office last month. A spokeswoman for Ms. Trump did not respond to questions about her position on immigration — or about whether her remarks were intended to pressure her father. "

Why, you announce a tax cut! And in your self-absorbed way, you announce a tax cut that will hugely benefit yourself. Imagine those millions saved! You feel better already! I’m deeply skeptical that President Trump will manage to get a tax reform package passed into law, and that’s just as well. Trump’s new tax “plan” (more like an extremely vague plan for a plan) is an irresponsible, shameless, budget-busting gift to zillionaires like himself. This isn’t about “jobs,” as the White House claims. If it were, it might cut employment taxes, which genuinely do discourage hiring. Rather, it’s about huge payouts to the wealthiest Americans — and deficits be damned! If Republicans embrace this “plan” after all their hand-wringing about deficits and debt, we should build a Grand Monument to Hypocrisy in their honor. Trump’s tax “plan” is a betrayal of his voters. He talks of helping ordinary Americans even as he enriches tycoons like himself. For example, it’s great that the tax plan promises help with child care costs, a huge burden for low-income families, especially single moms. But Trump doesn’t explain what form his help will take. "

Reviews for the series have been rapturous, and it could provide Hulu with an elusive signature hit. But none of this would have been possible without Danny and Fran. Until recently, the production company run by Daniel Wilson, 87, and his business partner, Fran Sears, 70, had more or less been dormant. Work had dried up, and Hollywood had stopped getting in touch many years ago. Whenever the phone rang, they assumed that people were “trying to find out if we were, in fact, still alive,” Ms. Sears said in a recent interview, laughing. But Mr. Wilson had something special stowed away: He controlled a big chunk of the TV and movie rights to the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which he had made into an otherwise forgettable 1990 feature. If Hulu wanted to bring the story to television, it would have to deal with Daniel Wilson Productions. So through a twist of fate, prescient deal-making and an intensely competitive television landscape — where studios seem to be willing to turn over any stone to find a hit — Danny and Fran are back in business. In short order, they had to, among other things, revive a production company that had gone dark and study up on a vastly changed television landscape, in which streaming services were becoming increasingly important. They also had to acquaint themselves with tasks foreign to them — like creating an online imprint. "

That strategy seemed apparent when one of Mr. Cosby’s daughters released a statement defending her father and Mr. Cosby himself gave a rare interview for an article that led with a depiction of his blindness. “He loves and respects women,” Evin Cosby, 40, said of her father in a statement that she released to select media outlets. “He is not abusive, violent or a rapist.” Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for Mr. Cosby, denied that the defense had begun a coordinated public relations campaign in advance of jury selection next month. “It’s not one of those strategies,” he said. But Mr. Wyatt said Mr. Cosby and his family do plan further interviews or statements in coming weeks. And Ms. Agrusa in a separate interview made clear that she hoped to change public opinion as part of her defense of Mr. Cosby, who faces charges that he drugged and assaulted a Temple University staff member in his home north of Philadelphia in 2004. “I can’t identify one other case in which the public has so conclusively come to the verdict of guilty,” she said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s like the court of public opinion has found him guilty, and our job as lawyers is we now have to convince not just the judge but also the public why the initial verdict is wrong. The burden of proof for this one human being has shifted.” "

Joseph R. Swedish, the company’s chief executive, set a deadline of early June for a decision on the subsidies, saying Anthem would weigh increasing rates by at least 20 percent next year. These subsidies, called cost-sharing reductions because they reduce the amount people must pay out of pocket when they go to the doctor, have become a political football as President Trump and House Republicans try to repeal the federal health care law and negotiate a spending bill with a deadline looming this week. While Republicans successfully sued the Obama administration to discontinue funding the payments, the decision is on appeal, and Mr. Trump has recently indicated that he wants to use the subsidies as a bargaining chip with Democrats. On Wednesday, Republican leaders were seeking to assure Democrats that the subsidies would continued to be funded, although there was no guarantee. If the subsidies ended in 2018, the lack of funding “would cause further market instability,” Mr. Swedish said, which would make the company’s participation in the federal market “even more challenging.” "
1343,Winners and Losers in the Trump Tax Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/upshot/winners-and-losers-in-the-trump-tax-plan.html?searchResultPosition=78,2017/04/26,THE UPSHOT,"The tax plan the Trump administration released Wednesday consists (so far) of a single page of bullet points. If this were a more rounded plan, we could wait for the tax wonks at various think tanks to run it through their models and tell with some precision how it would affect people at different income levels and who would benefit from different deductions. Lacking that level of detail, we can know only in broad-brush strokes which Americans would win and which would lose. In a homage to the Trump plan itself, here are those winners and losers in bulleted form. ■ Businesses with high tax rates. The plan would cut the 35 percent corporate income tax to 15 percent. While few businesses pay the full 35 percent rate, those that pay something close to it are in line for a huge tax cut. ■ High-income earners. The plan would reduce the top rate on individual income tax — now 39.6 percent for income over around $470,000 for a married couple — to 35 percent. But that’s only part of the gain for high-income earners. It also would eliminate a 3.8 percent tax, used to help fund Obamacare, that applies to investment income over $250,000 for a couple. ■ People with creative accountants. The 15 percent business tax rate could open a huge loophole for people to receive business income through a limited liability company or other pass-through entity instead of as wages. Depending on how the law is drafted, that could enable some people to pay that low 15 percent rate on their earnings instead of an individual income rate up to 35 percent. People who already receive their income through investment vehicles wouldn’t have to change anything for a windfall. "

Roberts Jr. tried to test the limits of the government’s position at a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday by confessing to a criminal offense. “Some time ago, outside the statute of limitations, I drove 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour zone,” the chief justice said, adding that he had not been caught. The form that people seeking American citizenship must complete, he added, asks whether the applicant had ever committed a criminal offense, however minor, even if there was no arrest. “If I answer that question no, 20 years after I was naturalized as a citizen, you can knock on my door and say, ‘Guess what, you’re not an American citizen after all’?” Chief Justice Roberts asked. Robert A. Parker, a Justice Department lawyer, said the offense had to be disclosed. Chief Justice Roberts seemed shocked. “Oh, come on,” he said. The chief justice asked again whether someone’s citizenship could turn on such an omission. Mr. Parker did not back down. “If we can prove that you deliberately lied in answering that question, then yes,” he said. "
1346,Trump Tells Foreign Leaders That Nafta Can Stay for Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/nafta-executive-order-trump.html?searchResultPosition=81,2017/04/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump told the leaders of Mexico and Canada on Wednesday that he would not immediately move to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, only hours after an administration official said he was likely to sign an order that would begin the process of pulling the United States out of the deal. In what the White House described as “pleasant and productive” evening phone calls with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Mr. Trump said he would quickly start the process of renegotiating Nafta — not abandon it, as he said he would do during the 2016 presidential campaign if he could not rework the deal to his satisfaction. “It is my privilege to bring NAFTA up-to-date through renegotiation,” Mr. Trump said in a statement issued by the White House at 10:33 p.m. “I believe that the end result will make all three countries stronger and better.” The announcement appeared to be an example of Mr. Trump’s deal-making in real time. It followed a day in which officials signaled that he was laying the groundwork to pull out of Nafta — a move intended to increase pressure on Congress to authorize new negotiations, and on Canada and Mexico to accede to American demands. It was not clear whether the president would still sign an executive action to authorize renegotiation of Nafta, which he once called the worst trade deal ever signed by the United States. Washington must give Canada and Mexico six months’ notice before exiting the trade agreement, which came into force in 1994. Any action to that effect would start the clock. But the prospect of the United States’ pulling out obviously alarmed the Canadian and Mexican leaders and prompted their calls to the White House. "

Workers at the plant, run by Whirlpool in Mr. Macron’s hometown, Amiens, have been striking to prevent the factory from closing. Far from being welcomed as a favored son, Mr. Macron was jeered and booed by a hostile crowd as tires burned, while Ms. Le Pen paid a surprise visit and was greeted with hugs and selfies as activists with her National Front party distributed croissants. Their separate visits, covered live on French television, showed how Ms. Le Pen’s anti-globalization message resonates in regions struggling with factory closings and the loss of jobs, as well as the hostility that many workers feel for Mr. Macron, a centrist former investment banker who wants to loosen labor rules. The contrasting styles, policy approaches and loyalties of the candidates, who face each other in a runoff election on May 7, were on full display in Amiens, sometimes painfully so. Mr. Macron met first with a few union representatives from the factory at the local chamber of commerce; Ms. Le Pen beat him to the plant itself. Mr. Macron said that he could not stop companies from firing workers, but that he would fight to find a buyer for the plant or to retrain workers. Ms. Le Pen promised to save the plant and the nearly 300 jobs there that are supposed to be shifted to Poland next year, and said she would discourage companies from moving jobs abroad with a 35 percent tax on any products imported from plants that are outsourced from France.

1348,The 7 Key Elements of the White House Tax Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/white-house-tax-plan.html?searchResultPosition=82,2017/04/26,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — Here are the most important changes in the tax plan proposed Wednesday by President Trump. The number of tax brackets for individuals is reduced from seven to three: 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. That lowers the top rate by nearly 5 percentage points, easing the tax burdens on most Americans, including the rich. The Trump administration did not say where those brackets begin and end. Currently, individuals can deduct $6,350 and married couples can deduct $12,700 from their taxable income. Mr. Trump’s plan would double the standard deduction. That is intended to put more money in the pockets of the average taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions. It has the added benefit of simplifying the preparation of tax returns for more people. The alternative minimum tax makes it harder for very rich individuals to game the tax system and pay less tax. It is an aggravating tax for the well-to-do, what Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin called a “complicated” additional system of taxation. The provision cost Mr. Trump an additional $31 million in federal income taxes in 2005, and now he wants to kill it. Under the plan, the top federal capital gains rate is cut from 23.8 percent to 20 percent. This is achieved by eliminating a 3.8 percent tax that is used to fund the Affordable Care Act. The reduction is meant to create greater incentives for people to invest. What some Republicans called the “death tax” dies under the Trump plan. According to the Tax Foundation, America’s inheritance tax as of 2014 is the fourth highest in the world. Although the administration said that the tax was a burden on farmers and small businesses, critics of Mr. Trump will likely complain that he is helping his family and rich friends. Mr. Trump wants to eliminate all individual tax deductions except for those that relate to mortgage interest and charitable giving. Those are two of the most popular. However, these could become unnecessary to most taxpayers because of the much higher standard deduction. State and local taxes would no longer be deductible, a concern for people in high-tax states. Lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent is one of the most aggressive moves in the plan. The administration says it gets the rate down to where it is for most other industrialized nations. The Tax Foundation says this will reduce revenues by $2 trillion over 10 years and it is not clear that it will generate enough economic growth to compensate for that. The plan also calls for a special one-time tax—though the rate was not disclosed—to entice companies to bring back money they made overseas. "
1349,A Closer Look at the Evidence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/retro-hair-analysis.html?searchResultPosition=83,2017/04/26,U.S.,"Reverence for science has not been a conspicuous guiding spirit of the Trump administration, and forensic science is no exception. That was affirmed this month when Attorney General Jeff Sessions ended an advisory panel created under President Barack Obama to improve the reliability of crime-solving techniques like hair analysis, ballistics testing, bite-mark evidence, blood typing and shoe-print comparisons. This panel, the National Commission on Forensic Science, was made up of scientists, judges and lawyers whose brief was to raise the standards of laboratory work in criminal cases. What will emerge in its place is not clear. But perhaps not surprisingly, prosecutors in the main applauded the Sessions decision, and defense lawyers fretted that the rights of their clients could be undermined. The reality is that forensic science is not the infallible discipline that television shows like “CSI” may lead many viewers to believe. That point is underscored in this brief offering from Retro Report, a series of video documentaries re-exploring major news stories of the past. In real life, crime labs are not the exclusive domain of unerring Gil Grissoms and Dr. Quincys. Mistakes happen. And often enough, errors send innocent people to prison and even, in some instances, to death row. The video focuses on hair analysis, a staple of forensic work for decades. The advent of DNA testing in the late 1980s showed that hair samples found at crime scenes did not necessarily match those of criminal suspects, no matter what lab technicians may have concluded. “About 11 percent of the time, mitochondrial DNA said: ‘No, that hair actually came from someone else,’” Max M. Houck, a former forensics expert for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told Retro Report. “It kind of shook us up.” And so it should have, says the Innocence Project. That advocacy group, based in New York, relies on DNA analysis to absolve people wrongly convicted of crimes. It has overseen more than 300 exonerations, and faulty hair analysis was a factor at least 20 percent of the time. This is not to suggest that the jails are filled with innocents. DNA testing routinely confirms suspects’ guilt previously established by hair samples, bite marks and other evidence. Still, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences found “serious problems” with lab results. Aside from DNA analysis, the committee said in a 2009 report that “no forensic method has been rigorously shown to have the capacity to consistently, and with a high degree of certainty, demonstrate a connection between evidence and a specific individual or source.” Mr. Sessions said that with the fade-out of the old commission, an in-house group at the Justice Department would work on a new strategy for forensics procedures. Nonetheless, his critics say they are troubled that an independent voice on science has been silenced. "

Then he added with a grin: “So I don’t really get what’s going on here, but I really liked how she was speaking into that microphone.” In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Watters denied any implication that the comment was sexual. “During the break we were commenting on Ivanka’s voice and how it was low and steady and resonates like a smooth jazz radio DJ,” he said in a statement. “This was in no way a joke about anything else.” "

The soldiers were taking part in a lengthy raid that was supported by airstrikes from American warplanes and that was targeting the Islamic State in Nangarhar Province, said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. A number of Islamic State fighters have been engaging in a long-running battle with Afghanistan security forces in the Achin district. Achin is where the Pentagon deployed on April 13 what is nicknamed the “mother of all bombs,” aimed at Islamic State fighters who were hiding in caves and a tunnel complex. The Defense Department deemed the operation successful, but fighting has continued there and the Afghanistan military, supported by the Defense Department, has yet to clear the area of remaining Islamic State fighters. Defense Department officials were waiting until immediate family was notified before releasing the names of the two soldiers killed. Officials said that a third soldier was wounded when they came under attack during the raid. “The fight against ISIS-K is important for the world, but sadly, it is not without sacrifice,” said Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of United States Forces Afghanistan, using another name for the Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan. “On behalf of all U.S. forces and our coalition partners, I offer our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and fellow service members of our fallen comrades.” "

Trump embraced the cause of fiscal responsibility and accused President Barack Obama of shackling the country with a “mountain of debt.” Mr. Obama “doubled our national debt. Doubled it,” Mr. Trump claimed in a speech in Virginia Beach. Then on Wednesday, Mr. Trump unveiled the outlines of his much-anticipated tax overhaul, calling for steep tax cuts with only modest offsetting revenue increases. Economists I spoke to this week estimate it would add trillions to the national debt over the next decade. “We’ve only done the rough numbers, but this looks like a tax cut of a magnitude of about $5 trillion,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan advocacy organization for fiscal responsibility. “That is simply unimaginable given our fiscal situation and the size of the deficit, which is already the worst since World War II.” The sense of incredulity was widely shared. “Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady must be beside themselves in private,” said Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, referring to the House speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman. “They put in years of work on a tax reform plan that at least tried to be revenue-neutral,” meaning tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes, “and wouldn’t explode the deficit.” Or as Steven M. Rosenthal, a business tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, put it: “Mr. Trump’s plan basically is tax cuts for everyone. Real reform, with revenue neutrality, is difficult. There are winners and losers, but Trump apparently just wants winners.” "

He has called sustained funding of H.I.V./AIDS programs “highest priorities” in his budget. He intends to preserve an executive order maintaining L.G.B.T. nondiscrimination in federal contracting. And he has preserved a State Department job tasked with advocating global L.G.B.T. human rights at a time when gay men are being rounded up, tortured and executed in Chechnya. His United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, issued a statement on the matter, declaring that the Trump administration is “against all forms of discrimination, including against people based on sexual orientation.” Your editorial closes by saying “for the foreseeable future, the federal courts are likely to be the only avenue of progress.” That may be true, but the last three times the Supreme Court issued landmark rulings in support of L.G.B.T. equality, it was Justice Anthony M.

The schism between the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank and led by President Mahmoud Abbas, and Hamas, which seized full control of Gaza in 2007, has left Palestinians deeply divided and has hurt efforts to reach a peace deal with Israel. Palestinian analysts speculated that Mr. Abbas was trying to flex his muscles before an expected meeting with President Trump in the White House, possibly in early May. Hamas officials denounced the move, describing it as a “dangerous escalation.” “It is a clear aggression,” Hazim Kassim, a Hamas spokesman, said of the Palestinian Authority’s decision. “Abbas aims to blow up the situation in Gaza.” The two million residents of Gaza already suffer from acute power shortages, with electricity rationed to about four hours a day. With its own power station out of commission, Gaza is dependent on the electricity lines from Israel, and a smaller, less reliable supply from Egypt. The Israeli agency that liaises with the Palestinians on civilian affairs, known as Cogat (an acronym for Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories), said Israel supplies Gaza with 30 percent of its total electricity needs at a monthly cost of about $11 million. Israel did not immediately cut off the supply, apparently hoping that international donors would step in and pay. The United Nations said on Thursday that it had allocated $500,000 for the purchase of emergency fuel for hospitals. "

Flynn, the former national security adviser, was explicitly told in 2014 to seek approval for any payments he accepted from a foreign government, documents released on Thursday show. But a year later, he was paid $45,000 by a Kremlin-backed news organization to give a speech in Moscow, an arrangement lawmakers say he failed to disclose the next month when he submitted paperwork to renew his security clearance. The disclosure on Thursday also included a letter showing that the Defense Department’s inspector general opened an investigation this spring into whether Mr. Flynn failed to properly report a payment from a foreign government. As a retired military intelligence officer, Mr. Flynn was required to vet all foreign payments with the Pentagon and the State Department, according to an October 2014 letter that was released as lawmakers investigate allegations of ties between President Trump’s associates and the Russian government. The April 11 letter from the inspector general did not specify what payment from a foreign government was at issue. But Mr. Flynn is known to have been paid more than $45,000 by RT, the Kremlin-financed news network, to give a speech in Moscow in December 2015. More than two months after Mr. Flynn was fired as national security adviser, his links to Moscow continue to bedevil the Trump administration, which itself has been dogged by reports of ties between Russian officials and the president’s associates. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the F.B.I. are investigating allegations that Mr. Trump’s associates colluded with Russia before and after last year’s presidential election. "

Mr. Watters, who denied that his comment about President Trump’s daughter was sexual, announced his upcoming absence near the end of Wednesday night’s edition of “The Five.” He will miss two days of the show’s first week in prime time after it took over the 9 p.m. slot from “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and he will miss his “Watters’ World” show on Saturday. A Fox News spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the vacation had been planned before “The Five” moved to its new time slot, or if the time off was related to the criticism Mr. Watters had received throughout much of Wednesday.

Trump wanted to buy an airplane. He sensed that the seller of the Boeing 727 was desperate, so he first offered a mere $5 million, “which was obviously ridiculously low,” he wrote in “Art of the Deal.” He boasts of buying the plane, worth $30 million new, for just $8 million. This week, we saw the public policy equivalent of a $5 million offer for a $30 million plane. The Trump administration demanded funding of its border wall as part of a deal to keep the government open, proposed a huge cut in taxes on businesses that would reduce government revenue by trillions, and leaked plans to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement to try to force Canada and Mexico to agree to better conditions. It is an approach that has defined Mr. Trump’s deal-making career: Make some seemingly outlandish offer as a starting point for negotiations to try to shift the entire frame of reference for the haggling that will follow. This strategy can certainly work in some circumstances. It also has distinct limits in complex negotiations like those in public policy, as the administration’s experience this week shows. This strategy is also the opposite of the one often pursued by the last occupant of the Oval Office. President Obama tended to introduce policy proposals that were relatively close to where a negotiation with Congress might plausibly end up — often to the consternation of liberals, who felt he was negotiating against himself. The Trump approach can have an “anchoring effect” of shaping the terms of the negotiation. “The benefit of starting aggressively is that if a deal is reached, it is likely to be more advantageous to you,” said Deepak Malhotra, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of “Negotiating the Impossible.” “But there are also many risks, and these risks are much greater in politics.” In particular, staking out an extreme position can very well shut down any further negotiating. If you think your negotiation partner is fundamentally unreasonable, you might choose not to engage at all. Think of how you might respond if you were selling a house that you believed was worth $500,000, and somebody offered $100,000. You’d probably be unwilling to discuss a sale unless the bidder came back with a more plausible number. "
1360,Trump’s Losing Streak in Courts Is Traceable to Conservative Judges,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/trump-legal-defeats.html?searchResultPosition=27,2017/04/27,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s losing streak in courts around the nation has in large part been a product of precedents established by conservative judges in the Obama era. It turns out that legal principles meant to curb executive overreach are indifferent to the president’s party. Republican officials had great success under President Barack Obama in persuading judges to block or complicate his efforts to expand health care, shield immigrants from deportation and protect transgender students. Now Democratic officials are using the principles established in those cases to frustrate President Trump’s efforts to limit travel from predominantly Muslim countries and to punish so-called sanctuary cities. Both sides have shown remarkable dexterity in their understanding of the law, abruptly switching positions on issues like whether states have standing to sue, whether individual federal judges may issue nationwide injunctions and whether a federal threat to withhold funds can amount to a constitutional violation. Josh Blackman, a law professor at South Texas College of Law, said Democratic officials should strive for more consistency, even if only as a matter of self-interest. “Whatever California can do to resist immigration law,” Professor Blackman said, “Texas can do to resist environmental laws.” Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, made a similar point from the opposite direction about the decision on Tuesday to block efforts to withhold federal money from sanctuary cities. “Some conservative Republicans may not like the outcome of this specific case,” he wrote on The Volokh Conspiracy, a legal blog. “But they will have reason to celebrate it the next time a liberal Democratic president tries a similar move.” "
1361,5 Hurdles to the Adoption of Trump’s Tax Plan This Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/white-house-tax-plan.html?searchResultPosition=26,2017/04/27,POLITICS,"The introduction of President Trump’s tax plan has left many lawmakers, policy analysts and tax accounting experts with more questions than answers. There were no details on individual tax brackets, the tax rate at which overseas cash would be repatriated or how cutting the corporate tax rate won’t encourage more tax avoidance schemes, so there are few real numbers to crunch. “This was all ponies and no manure,” said Michael Graetz, a Columbia University tax law professor and a former Treasury Department official. But now that Mr. Trump has revealed his hand, the obstacles he faces for getting tax overhaul done this year are even more apparent. White House officials expressed tepid optimism that Democrats might get behind their tax plan for the good of the country. But there was no palpable support for anything that Mr. Trump’s economic team proposed. In fact, Democrats quickly took a page from the Republican Party’s playbook, accusing Mr. Trump of crippling the economy with debt. The difficulty of repealing the Affordable Care Act without the help of any Democrats is a good indicator that tax reform will be at least as challenging. Technically, Republicans do not need Democrats to sign on to their plan if they are willing to use the Senate’s budget reconciliation process to push the legislation through Congress. But they will need their own party to be united. Some deficit hawks appear ready to shed their feathers in the name of cutting taxes, spurring economic growth and giving Mr. Trump a victory. However, enough are likely to cling to their fiscal rectitude to cause a problem for the president. "

But Liu Xiyu, a real estate executive in Beijing, still lacks the convenience he says he most wants in life: an American green card. Fed up with China’s rampant air pollution and the rigid school system his children endure, Mr. Liu pledged $500,000 to a California housing development last year in hopes of obtaining a special visa for investors, known as EB-5, which would allow his family to spend more time in the United States. Now, President Trump’s vow to tighten immigration policies and new scrutiny after a series of fraud and abuse scandals have spurred thousands of Chinese applicants like Mr. Liu to seek a visa before more stringent requirements can be put in place. Lawmakers are discussing the EB-5 program this week as they try to reach a deal on the budget and avert a government shutdown. “I’m trying to help America’s economy grow,” Mr. Liu, 47, said. “I don’t understand why anyone would be opposed.” "
1363,A Poised Mexico Sees Trump Anew: a ‘Bluffer’ at the Poker Table,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/americas/mexico-trump-nafta-trade.html?searchResultPosition=33,2017/04/27,AMERICAS,"MEXICO CITY — There was a time when Donald J. Trump — first as a candidate and then as president — could rile Mexico without really trying. His threats to build a border wall and make Mexicans pay for it would ignite firestorms of patriotic fury and resentment. His promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants would send politicians off to draft contingency plans. His vows to re-engineer the North American Free Trade Agreement and bring Mexico to heel would shake the foundations of the state. But on Wednesday, the suggestion from the White House that Mr. Trump was finalizing an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the United States from Nafta revealed a different, more experienced Mexico: one learning to live with what it considers Mr. Trump’s bluster and stagecraft, and not inclined to react publicly too quickly. “It seems like he’s sitting at a poker table bluffing rather than making serious decisions,” said Senator Armando Ríos Piter, a Mexican legislator. “In front of a bluffer, you always have to maintain a firm and dignified position.” Still, as rumors of the executive order circulated in Washington and Mexico City on Wednesday, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico called Mr. Trump. And later that night, Mr. Trump issued a statement saying that he was not seeking to withdraw from Nafta, but instead “to bring Nafta up-to-date through renegotiation.” Mr. Peña Nieto then issued a brief statement of his own, saying he, Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada had a “shared objective to modernize” the trade agreement.

In fact, they were learning how to don gas masks in the event of chemical or biological attacks from North Korea. Several giggled as they wrenched off the masks, while others gasped for air. This is what schoolchildren sometimes do on field trips to the War Memorial of Korea, built as a reminder of the costs of warfare on the Korean Peninsula. Lately, talk of war is in the news again, but people here in Seoul are mostly responding with shrugs and nervous giggles rather than emergency drills. They’ve been through this before. For about 25 million people in South Korea who live within 50 miles of the North Korean border — including residents of Seoul, the capital — it has long been a sobering reality that they are the most vulnerable to attack by the government in Pyongyang, with which South Korea has technically been at war for decades. That perennial threat has intensified in recent weeks, with the Trump administration warning that it would consider all options, including military strikes, to thwart North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. North Korea, meanwhile, has conducted missile tests and huge live-fire artillery drills, and analysts say it is prepared to conduct its sixth test of a nuclear weapon. "
1365,Failing the ‘Mnuchin Test’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/failing-the-mnuchin-test.html?searchResultPosition=41,2017/04/27,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The best test for judging any Trump administration tax plan is the Mnuchin test — the standard that President Trump’s own Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, laid out a few months ago: “Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions, so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class. There will be a big tax cut for the middle class, but any tax cuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay for it.” I’ll repeat the key phrase for emphasis: “there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.” Mnuchin was right to make this commitment. While middle-class incomes have stagnated, the top 0.01 percent of earners have had their average inflation-adjusted income roughly quadruple to $11.3 million since 1980. Their taxes have fallen, too. There’s no justification for cutting those taxes further. Yet on Wednesday Trump, with Mnuchin as the pitch man, proposed precisely that, violating Mnuchin’s own standard. The Trump plan will overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, cutting the top income-tax rate, cutting taxes on stock holdings, cutting corporate taxes and eliminating the estate tax. And when a reporter asked Mnuchin yesterday about all the benefits that would flow to the affluent, he ducked the question and offered a vague talking point. The straightforward Mnuchin of a few months ago was nowhere to be seen. It would be entirely possible to put together a conservative tax plan that simplified the code without exacerbating inequality. But the Trump plan is nowhere near that plan. In The Times, Nick Kristof cuts through the rhetoric about the plan. Elsewhere, Len Burman of the Tax Policy Center explains “the enormous tax shelter” in the plan. Dylan Matthews of Vox walks through why it’s a “a really, really huge giveaway to Donald Trump, the Trump Organization, and the entire Trump family.” The Times editorial board also has a piece on the many problems with the plan.

1366,Health Law Repeal Will Miss Trump’s 100-Day Target Date,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/republicans-propose-short-term-funding-plan-to-avert-shutdown.html?searchResultPosition=40,2017/04/27,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — An 11th-hour White House push to give President Trump a major legislative victory in his first 100 days in office broke down late Thursday as House Republican leaders failed to round up enough votes for their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Some White House officials had hoped for a vote on Friday on a measure to prove that Mr. Trump was making good on his promise to undo the sweeping health law — President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement — in his first 100 days in office. But seesawing commitments and the reservations from numerous lawmakers throughout Thursday laid bare the difficulty that Republican leaders faced in trying to push through a repeal bill. While revisions to their bill won over conservative hard-liners in the Freedom Caucus this week, those same changes threatened to drive away other members, even some who supported the first version. A senior House aide said late Thursday that there would not be a vote on the health bill this week. At least 18 House Republicans oppose the latest version of the bill, the American Health Care Act, and leaders can lose no more than 22 to win passage if all members vote. “We’re going to try and measure three times and saw once,” Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said late Thursday. “A lot of people around this town have tried their best to try and rush it, rush it, rush it.” He urged patience, saying the health bill “will find its time.” The lost opportunity was perhaps the biggest blow to the future prospects of Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, who has a long relationship with Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Mr. Priebus had pushed aggressively for the House to schedule a vote this week, according to several people who spoke with him within the West Wing and on Capitol Hill. "

We look at the seven most important changes in President Trump’s tax proposal, which our White House reporters describe as less of a plan than a wish list. It would sharply reduce income tax rates for individuals and businesses, but how it would be financed is unclear, and deficit hawks are worried. We break down what the plan would cost, and our chief economics correspondent looks at who wins — including the president himself — and who loses. • New life for a G.O.P. health bill. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-line conservatives who were instrumental in blocking President Trump’s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act last month, approved a more conservative revision on Wednesday. We look at what might have changed their minds. • Drumbeats that don’t add up to war. Recent threats and military muscle-flexing make a clash between the U.S. and North Korea seem more likely than it really is, according to Trump administration officials and experts who have followed the Korean crisis for decades.

But one crucial issue they left unaddressed: how the administration plans to deal with the so-called carried interest loophole, a tax treatment enjoyed by some of the richest people on Wall Street. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to close the loophole and make its beneficiaries, private equity and hedge fund executives among them, pay their fair share of taxes. He once proclaimed that “hedge fund guys are getting away with murder.” So far, it is unclear just how the skeletal proposal announced by the Trump administration on Wednesday will address this issue. But already, there is reason to believe that the president will not soon fulfill that campaign pledge. Carried interest, which is essentially the profits reaped by hedge fund managers and private equity executives, is currently taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is about half the roughly 40 percent ordinary income rate for the highest earners. Critics argue that these executives should pay the full rate, while industry groups say they are entitled to the lower rate because they are taking entrepreneurial risks. "

What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com Trevor Noah expressed his amazement on “The Daily Show” on Wednesday that something called Confederate Memorial Day still exists, even if it’s just in Alabama and Mississippi. “What are black people supposed to do on this holiday?” he asked. He imagined the dilemma: “So I either don’t get the day off, or I support slavery? Man, I’ll take the day off, but I’m watching B.E.T. the whole time.” President Trump, who as a candidate criticized President Barack Obama’s use of executive orders, is now touting the fact that he will have signed 30 of them within his first 100 days. On “Late Night,” Seth Meyers hit on a way to understand — and maybe even predict — Mr. Trump’s apparently contradictory statements. Also less than clear is the timetable for Mr. Trump’s proposed wall along the Mexican border. Mr. Meyers played a clip of the president being barraged with questions about when the wall would be built. Asked if it would be during his first term, he seemed reluctant to answer, then abruptly said, “Yeah, sure.” "
1370,Tillerson in No Rush to Fill Nearly 200 State Department Posts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/state-department-diplomats-tillerson.html?searchResultPosition=51,2017/04/27,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The stampede of diners who once rushed through the State Department’s vast cafeteria has ebbed, with diplomats who previously grabbed quick bites between meetings now lingering over Korean barbecue and checking their phones for some kind of news. Many have little to do until the Trump administration starts filling the nearly 200 jobs at the department that require Senate confirmation, and their agendas look increasingly as though they will remain empty. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has done almost nothing to select leaders for the White House’s consideration, and nominations for assistant secretaries and others who largely run the State Department are unlikely to be made for months. In an unusual interview, R. C. Hammond, Mr. Tillerson’s spokesman, said the secretary intended to embark within days on a listening tour of the building and then a restructuring of the department’s operations. Only after those are underway will he begin to name his wider leadership team. With a Senate confirmation process that takes months, that means the department will remain largely leaderless until well into 2018. And no other department in the federal government is as dependent on political appointees, or as paralyzed when the appointment process freezes. State Department veterans reacted to Mr. Tillerson’s timetable with incredulity. “There is a crisis with North Korea now, at a time neither State nor Defense have the bench of senior leaders needed, and with State facing a massive budget cut,” said Wendy R. Sherman, a top diplomat in the Obama administration. “How do you execute a policy with the quality you need in that circumstance?” Fill-in leaders, like those who are conducting diplomacy in the absence of political appointees, do not always instill confidence in foreign governments, said Siddharth Mohandas, another Obama administration diplomat.

1371,Black People Are Not All ‘Living in Hell’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/black-people-are-not-all-living-in-hell.html?searchResultPosition=52,2017/04/27,OPINION,"Contrary to Donald Trump’s indiscriminate portrayal of African-Americans as “living in hell,” the black upper middle class is ascending the economic ladder at a faster rate than its white counterpart. Scholars have begun to focus their attention on this phenomenon. William Julius Wilson, a sociologist at Harvard and the author of “The Truly Disadvantaged,” is working on a book about upward social mobility among African-Americans. In an email, he wrote me: In an NBER paper issued in November 2016, Patrick Bayer, an economist at Duke, and Kerwin Charles, a professor of public policy at the University of Chicago, published comparable findings, reporting that In a summary of their work, Bayer and Charles made the same point more succinctly: “Over the past 75 years, the gap in economic rank” — that is, the gap between blacks and whites — “has narrowed sharply among men at the top of the earnings ladder.” Bayer and Charles conclude that the improvement in earnings for upper-income black men have had an uneven impact on African- American communities generally: Census income data supports the conclusion reached by Wilson, Bayer and Charles that there was significant income growth among well-off African-Americans during the first 15 years of this century, in contrast to much smaller percentage gains among affluent whites. African-American households on the highest rungs of the economic ladder — the top 5 percent of all black households — experienced a substantial 19.8 percent income increase from 2000 to 2015. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in inflation-adjusted 2015 dollars, these households saw a $41,871 gain, from $211,425 in 2000 to $253,296 in 2015. The top five percent of white households had incomes above those of African-Americans in this category, but they experienced a $4,498 or 1.2 percent, household income loss between 2000 and 2015, from $368,852 to $364,354. There remains a wide disparity in absolute income levels. In 2014, 8.1 percent of black households had incomes of $100,000 or more compared with 14.0 percent of white households. "

All of a sudden there’s a one-page tax plan and a raft of deal-making, while the Senate was bused over to the White House grounds for a briefing on North Korea. Maybe the president believes that when you can make an entire chamber of Congress ride around like so many tour groups, the world will understand that you’re a can-do kind of guy. Trump wasn’t actually in public for any of this. Outside of congratulating the National Teachers of the Year, the man himself was in sight only for events in which he announced that a cabinet member had been directed to look into something. On Day 97, Trump first appeared before the cameras to tell us the secretary of the interior is going to review previous presidents’ habit of saving federal lands from development. Federal land, Trump reminded the audience, “belongs to all of us.” He then called for turning it over to the states. His recent predecessors have tried to defend places like a gorgeous section of Utah called Grand Staircase-Escalante by declaring them national monuments. You can do that because of a law called the Antiquities Act that goes back to Theodore Roosevelt. Republicans love to brag about Theodore Roosevelt, except when he was protecting the wilderness. People, I want a show of hands: How many of you would like to see coal mining at the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument? I thought so. "
1373,Spreading Plan C to End Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/spreading-plan-c-to-end-pregnancy.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/04/27,OPINION,"After lunch on a Saturday in late January at her home in Los Angeles, Francine Coeytaux, 63, an abortion rights activist, retrieved a Priority Mail envelope from her office and announced to her guests, a group of young women she had recruited to her cause, the results of a recent experiment. “A couple weeks ago, we Googled ‘abortion pills’ and tried ordering from a few of the sites that came up,” she said. The pills, misoprostol and mifepristone, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use by a licensed provider to end a pregnancy within the first 10 weeks, or what is known as “medical abortion.” Mifepristone works by blocking the effects of progesterone, a hormone without which the lining of the uterus begins to break down, while misoprostol, to be taken 24 to 48 hours later, induces contractions of the uterus that expel its contents. Medical abortion now accounts for close to half of all legal abortions in the United States. Serious complications are rare, but the risk increases as the pregnancy progresses, and it isn’t clear yet how far into pregnancy the drugs should be used. With the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone in 2000, many people believed the reproductive revolution had arrived; the drug, which studies had shown could be safely provided by nurse practitioners, midwives and physician assistants, would dramatically expand access to abortion. But that didn’t happen; approval of mifepristone came with tight restrictions on how it can be distributed — only in clinics, medical offices and hospitals; only by, or under the supervision of, a doctor certified to prescribe the drug; and only to patients who have signed an F.D.A.-approved patient agreement. The F.D.A. warns against purchasing the drugs from online vendors, but women in the United States are doing it anyway. Increasingly, advocates of access to the drugs say, women are turning to the internet to procure the pills for use in their homes. Ms. Coeytaux and her colleague, Elisa Wells, who lives in Portland, Ore., were curious: Who are these vendors? Will they steal your credit card information? Will the pills get held up in customs? Will the police come knocking on your door? Are the drugs real? “And guess what?” Ms. Coeytaux said, then paused, eyebrows arching. “It worked.” Within two weeks, she said, the pills had arrived on her doorstep. The cost, including shipping, came to just over $200, but the question remained: Was this the real thing? Ms. Coeytaux passed the envelope around the table. Inside was a blister pack bearing the names of the medicines. The pack is marketed as the Mifegest Kit, but Ms. Coeytaux and colleagues call it Plan C. "

He has already changed course when presented with new information: After all, China is no longer a “currency manipulator,” and NATO is no longer “obsolete.” In this case, improving the Affordable Care Act would not only be good policy for millions of Americans but would also be farsighted politics for Mr. Trump. The obvious obstacles are his repeated claim that the law is a “disaster” and internal Republican Party dynamics. But his endorsement of the House Republican bill last month ended in one of the biggest embarrassments of his first 100 days. And the new attempt this week to revive the effort might have a similar fate. So he shouldn’t let his past criticisms preclude him from pivoting from “repeal and replace” to “repair and rebrand.” A rebranded Affordable Care Act would be consistent with the vision Mr. Trump offered during the campaign. Then, he promised that everyone would be “beautifully covered,” with “much lower deductibles,” and “taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.” He said he wouldn’t cut Medicaid and would provide coverage for those who can’t afford care. As former White House aides who worked on the health care law, we remember why reform was desperately needed. Our system was broken, with 50 million uninsured, skyrocketing premiums and no relationship between cost and quality. That was then. Now we have the lowest percentage of uninsured Americans on record and the slowest rate of inflation in health care spending in 50 years. Medicare beneficiaries have saved $27 billion on prescription drugs, quality of care is improving, and nearly 600,000 unnecessary hospital readmissions have been prevented. "

It was the biggest dismissal of its kind in American history. And it should have happened years earlier. Instead, prosecutors dragged their feet like sullen children avoiding homework, making one excuse after another for why they shouldn’t have to do the right thing and dismiss convictions based on obviously tainted evidence. The scandal is far from the only one to come out of forensic labs, and for a simple reason: Prosecutors and other law enforcement officials, who oversee the labs, want to win cases. As a result, they cling to techniques that are of questionable value at best, if they aren’t provably useless. A 2015 review by the F.B.I. found that its forensic hair-sample analysts testified wrongly in favor of the prosecution 96 percent of the time. And even reliable scientific practices require strict protocols and aggressive oversight to protect against the Annie Dookhans of the world. "
1377,U.S. Antimissile System in South Korea Is Said to Be Nearly Operational,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/asia/north-korea-thaad-missile-defense-us-china.html?searchResultPosition=47,2017/04/27,ASIA PACIFIC,"HONG KONG — The antimissile system that the United States deployed in South Korea over China’s objections is close to becoming operational, giving the two allies the capability to defend against missile attacks by the North, the South’s Defense Ministry said on Thursday. The United States deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as Thaad, in South Korea in early March, after the North fired four missiles into the Sea of Japan. Beijing has vigorously opposed the system, fearing it could give the American military the ability to quickly detect and track missiles launched in China. On Thursday, Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said the system would soon go into “actual operation.” “The positioning of some equipment means that South Korea and the U.S. have the capability to cope with North Korea’s provocations,” he said, referring to the North’s growing missile capabilities. The comments by Mr. Moon followed remarks by Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., commander of the United States Pacific Command, who told a congressional hearing in Washington on Wednesday that Thaad would become operational “in the coming days.” The United States deployed radar and other crucial components of Thaad in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, this week. Alarmed by the development, China’s Ministry of National Defense said on Thursday that the antimissile system would undermine its own security, underlining Beijing’s persistent concerns about Thaad being placed into operation so close by. “The real goal of the United States and South Korea in deploying Thaad is as a move in the game of the United States’ global antimissile defense system,” Maj. Gen. Cai Jun, a senior officer in the Joint Staff Department of China’s Central Military Commission, said at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, the Chinese Ministry of Defense said online. “This will further tighten the Asia-Pacific antimissile barrier enclosing China and Russia, and will weaken their strategic capacities — something we adamantly oppose.” General Cai said that broader American antimissile plans “are in fact seeking an absolute unilateral military advantage, and this will exacerbate regional tensions, triggering localized antagonism and even an all-out arms race, and ultimately this will damage global and regional strategic stability.” Late Wednesday, a report emerged from North Korea about soaring gas prices and hoarding of fuel in the capital, Pyongyang. The Associated Press, which employs one of the few Western reporters based there, said that a kilogram of gas, which had cost 70 to 80 cents, was now selling for $1.40 at one station, and that the apparent shortage had led to rumors that China was behind the problem. The Trump administration has been encouraging Beijing to put economic pressure on North Korea to curtail its nuclear and missile tests, and the Chinese state news media recently hinted that the government would cut off fuel supplies if Pyongyang conducted its sixth atomic detonation.

But for analysts and investors — who parse every word spoken by Mario Draghi, the president of the bank, alert to even subtle changes in language or tone — there was plenty to focus on. The upshot on Thursday was that the central bank’s Governing Council has become more optimistic about the eurozone economy, moving ever so cautiously toward the day when it will begin withdrawing its stimulus measures and, eventually, raise interest rates. The euro rose as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar shortly after Mr. Draghi started speaking, but it has since given up most of those gains. Here is a guide to phrases they were listening for as Mr. Draghi spoke on Thursday: The European Central Bank repeated its promise to keep buying government and corporate bonds — a form of economic stimulus — until the end of the year, “or beyond, if necessary.” Observers of the central bank are obsessing about when in 2018 the bank might begin to wind down, or taper, those bond purchases. A few subtle changes in the language used by Mr. Draghi signaled that the central bank is laying the groundwork for tapering, but that it is still on the distant horizon. "

As we struggled through several days of hair-gone-wrong and umbrellas turned inside out, we wondered whether there was any truth to that old saying, “April showers bring May flowers.” So we asked one expert on weather, and another on flowers. Here’s what we learned: The rainiest time of year in New York City is, indeed, late March through May, said John Homenuk, a meteorologist at New York Metro Weather. Precipitation is heavier in April, he said, but there are more rainy days, on average, in May. This time of year, we’re shifting from a drier, colder air mass in the winter to a warmer, more humid air mass in the summer, Mr. Homenuk explained.

President Trump unveiled his tax package on Wednesday, a single-page wish list with no details on the cost of each provision, phase-in periods or potential impacts. Here’s what it included: • A cut to the rate paid by businesses, large and small, to 15 percent. • A reduction in the number of individual tax brackets. • The elimination of the estate tax and alternative minimum tax (a system that primarily hits wealthier people by limiting the deductions and other benefits available to them). • Eliminating tax on corporations’ foreign profits, and a special, one-time rate to encourage companies to bring home cash parked overseas. • A doubling of the standard deduction for individuals, which would essentially eliminate taxes on about $24,000 of a couple’s earnings. • Lower capital gains taxes, down to 20 percent, from 23.8 percent. • A repeal of inheritance tax. The plan leaves in place tax breaks for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings. "
1382,New Balance Court Ruling in China Is Rare Win Against Piracy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/business/new-balance-china-trademark.html?searchResultPosition=43,2017/04/27,BUSINESS,"BEIJING — New Balance has won a rare legal victory in China in an intellectual property dispute: A court has ordered five shoe manufacturers and sellers to pay the state $250,000 for using the American shoemaker’s signature slanting “N” logo. In previous years, the company has battled legions of counterfeit manufacturers, taken on a rogue supplier who exported its shoes at a deep discount and, most recently, struggled in court to win the use of its Chinese name. In a preliminary decision, the Suzhou Intermediate People’s Court on Monday fined the five companies for breaching an injunction issued in September prohibiting them from selling shoes with the logo, according to a report in China Intellectual Property Magazine. The $250,000 in fines will go to the state. The court will issue its final judgment at the end of May, at which time New Balance could get damages. Amy Dow, New Balance’s senior global corporate communications manager, confirmed the penalty, saying the brand used by all five was called New Boom. Ms. Dow said New Balance sued under China’s Anti-Unfair Competition Law because the country’s trademark laws “currently provide slight loopholes for these brands to exist.” “These actions are significantly more costly than traditional counterfeit enforcement measures, but New Balance believes strongly in the protection of our intellectual property,” she said.

1383,Trump’s Day of Hardball and Confusion on Nafta,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/trump-says-he-will-renegotiate-nafta-or-terminate-it.html?searchResultPosition=42,2017/04/27,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — For much of Wednesday, the Trump administration played hardball, spreading word that it was considering the shocking step of withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Advisers to President Trump said he wanted to announce an executive order beginning the process of withdrawing from the deal at a Saturday evening rally marking his 100th day in office. The rally is being held in Harrisburg, Pa. — in the heart of a region where many people regard Nafta as a dirty word. But by the end of the night, the White House was in full retreat after the news caused panic in Washington, Ottawa and Mexico City. The president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada both called Mr. Trump to warn against such a precipitous step. Mr. Trump said Thursday morning that he had been persuaded by their calls to focus on reworking the trade agreement. “I decided rather than terminating Nafta, which would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system, we will renegotiate,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. He added that he was still ready to pull the United States out of the deal if he could not rework it to his satisfaction. White House officials quickly portrayed the confusion as a vindication of Mr. Trump’s management style and said he had succeeded in bringing Mexico and Canada to the negotiating table — casting it as a signal accomplishment for a president hungry for victories. But Democrats just as swiftly dismissed the events as another example of what they call Mr. Trump’s feral and feckless government by improvisation. They also noted that Mexico and Canada have long been sitting at the table, waiting for the United States. The messy 24 hours were part of a week in which the West Wing has erupted with an all-guns-firing-at-once frenzy intended to prove that Mr. Trump is an effective leader on the cusp of his 100th day in office. His staff has been alarmed by a trend: A decreasing percentage of Americans, even supporters of Mr. Trump, view him as capable of executing on his muscular if vague campaign promises. "

Lacking a core set of political ideals, Mr. Trump has shown himself to be easily influenced by his advisers (the Stephen Bannon/Stephen Miller-inspired Muslim ban), his allies (Paul Ryan’s “repeal and replace” health care plan) and television news (the Syrian missile attack). He has cavalierly reversed past positions and campaign promises to accommodate his message of the moment. In foreign affairs, Mr. Trump’s lack of a strategic and diplomatic perspective has led to unnecessarily embarrassing moments with key American allies and created a policy vacuum that leaves the world, and the American people, questioning what role the United States intends to play on the global stage. But worse still is the secrecy, misinformation, conflicts of interest, nepotism, cronyism and vitriol that characterize the Trump White House. He has demonstrated no respect for the concept of public service or the accountability demanded of elected officials. While Americans seek leadership, vision and substance, Mr. Trump indulges his personal ambitions while flailing from issue to issue with ambiguity and incoherence. JOHN F. GEARY
WESTFORD, MASS. To the Editor: When did we start benchmarking the president in the first 100 days? It started with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, when 15 major bills were pushed through Congress to help lift the country out of the Depression. I just spoke to hundreds of aspiring chief nurse executives about their first 90 days, and my advice was to do nothing! I have received this advice over and over in new executive positions, and it is the wise thing to do. This gives you time to get your senior team together, to meet everyone, to assimilate the administrative staff and to assess your leadership. I have found it an excellent time to prepare for the first crisis. "

Hardly anyone likes the alternative minimum tax, a provision that both President Trump’s skeletal tax plan and the House Republican overhaul would eliminate. At its most basic, the A.M.T.’s goal is simple: In a tax system with enough loopholes to fill a macramé tapestry, the idea was to ensure that the richest taxpayers were not able to skip out on paying altogether. A version was introduced in 1969 after Congress discovered that — are you ready? — 155 taxpayers with taxable incomes over $200,000 paid no tax. But critics across the political spectrum have long complained that it has failed to live up to the promise. Both Mr. Trump and the House Republicans’ proposed overhaul of the code would eliminate the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. During his Democratic presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont suggested replacing the A.M.T. with a flat 28 percent rate on deductions for high-income households. Even the National Taxpayer Advocate within the Internal Revenue Service once called it the most serious problem facing taxpayers. The minimum tax has gone through several iterations, but the essential intent has not changed: to limit the amount of deductions available to the richest Americans. Over the years, though, inflation has eaten away at its effectiveness — as has the exclusion of interest and dividend income, which insulates the richest Americans. About 30 percent of households earning $200,000 to $500,000 in 2016 are being hit by the minimum tax, as are 63 percent of those earning $500,000 to $1 million, according to calculations from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. But only a fifth of the total earn more than $1 million and face the minimum tax. "

1388,"Only Captivity Will Save the Vaquita, Experts Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/americas/only-captivity-will-save-the-vaquita-experts-say.html?searchResultPosition=21,2017/04/27,AMERICAS,"TIJUANA, Mexico — It was not the first time Robert L. Brownell Jr. had seen a dead vaquita, the rare and endangered porpoise that was lying on the stainless-steel necropsy table inside the Tijuana Zoo on Monday. But it might well be one of the last. Mr. Brownell, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, had in effect discovered the porpoise, finding the first full, dead specimen in 1966. The world’s smallest member of the cetacean grouping, which includes whales and dolphins, the vaquita was the most recent cetacean to be recognized by modern science. Now it may well become the latest to go extinct. A high-level, bilateral panel of Mexican and American scientists met this week and is expected to announce that it believes efforts to save the animal have, essentially, failed. That announcement would mean that the only hope for the vaquita’s recovery would be to capture the surviving animals, if any can be found. Some of the scientists involved think the surviving vaquitas now number as few as two or three, and the latest two vaquitas found dead could even be the last ones — though it could take years to confirm that. The vaquita has been described, by some of the few people who have seen one of the elusive porpoises alive, as the smiley-faced sea panda because of the dark outlines around its mouth and the black circles around its eyes. Its plight has drawn in celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Leonardo DiCaprio, and spurred cooperation among scientists and environmentalists, north and south of the border, in and out of government. But the push has been imperiled by traffickers in the body parts of endangered species, unscrupulous fishermen and uneven enforcement efforts. The problem can be traced to Chinese demand for a rare swim bladder from the endangered totoaba fish, which shares the vaquita’s range, in the northern tip of the Gulf of California. According to Mexican scientists, that demand has grown so much that prices for the bladders, used for a homeopathic remedy, rival the wholesale price of cocaine — as much as $10,000 per kilogram. Mexican officials and those from the Mexican-American panel, the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita, say Mexican drug cartels have been attracted to the trade by the high profits, and by the assurance that no fisherman has ever gone to jail for trafficking in swim bladders.

Mr. Trump appeared to soften his demand late on Monday, saying he would settle for additional funds for border security. But then on Tuesday, he insisted again, “The wall’s going to get built, folks.” In the run-up to this divisive debate, John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, has escalated his rhetoric about threats facing the United States. “The risk is as threatening today as it was that September morning almost 16 years ago,” Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, said in a speech last week at George Washington University. Mr. Kelly suggested that undocumented immigrants may not be the only threat coming across the border with Mexico, pointing to the possibility of terrorists using the same smuggling routes to infiltrate the United States. “We have tremendous threats, whether it’s drugs, people, potential terrorists coming up from the south,” Mr. Kelly told CBS’s “Face the Nation” last Sunday. The secretary’s comments raise several questions about the threat of terrorists sneaking across the border with the aid of cartels, the connection between drug smuggling and the recent surge in overdoses, and marijuana as a “gateway drug.” "

After telephone calls with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in late April, Mr. Trump said he would start the process of renegotiating Nafta, a treaty that he had scorned during his presidential campaign, calling it “the single worst trade deal” ever signed by the United States. Whatever his criticisms, Nafta has had a major impact on the American economy in the decades since it was signed, and any renegotiation would affect certain industries. Here are four potentially vulnerable sectors. Perhaps no industry is more closely entwined with Nafta, or has more at stake in any shift in trade policy, than the automotive sector. The sector is a major employer in all three member nations — Canada, Mexico and the United States. Hundreds of thousands of workers in the United States are tied to the industry, while Mexico and Canada each rely on automaking for tens of thousands of jobs. "

For Ex-Presidents, It Is Now the Norm",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/400000-for-one-speech-for-ex-presidents-it-is-now-the-norm.html?searchResultPosition=16,2017/04/27,OPINION,"As a soon-to-be ex-president, Harry Truman was not lacking in lucrative offers from the private sector. Several corporations had allegedly offered him more than $100,000 to sit on corporate boards or to serve in symbolic positions when he left office. But Mr. Truman, whose reported income in 1954 was just $13,564.74 — about $120,000 today — steadfastly refused. Explaining his decision, he later wrote, “I could never lend myself to any transaction, however respectable, that would commercialize on the prestige and dignity of the office of the presidency.” Only by signing a contract with Life magazine for a goodly sum to write his memoirs was the former president able to exit from his financial difficulties. Fast forward to 2017. This week it was announced that former President Barack Obama, whose net worth upon leaving office has been estimated at $12 million or more, agreed to give a speech for $400,000 — about seven times the median income of American families and precisely the amount of his annual salary as president — at a conference run by Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street firm. A shortage of money can hardly explain Mr. Obama’s decision; according to press reports, he and Michelle Obama recently signed book contracts that may be worth as much as $60 million. In accepting the fee, Mr. Obama joins a recent tradition of presidents monetizing their time in office by earning lucrative sums from speeches, corporate directorships, foreign corporations and other private interests. This tradition began with Gerald Ford, who accepted membership on corporate boards of companies such as 20th Century Fox and American Express after leaving office. Capitalizing on the presidency escalated decisively when Ronald Reagan accepted $2 million for a pair of speeches at Japan’s Fujisankei Communications Group. (In today’s dollars, about twice that amount.) And it reached its current-day apex with Bill and Hillary Clinton, who earned a combined $139 million from such undertakings, including $35 million from speeches to financial services, real estate and insurance companies. Mr. Obama’s decision to accept the fee from Cantor Fitzgerald embodies an enormous attitudinal shift in the past six decades. When the financially strapped Mr. Truman turned down generous offers, he declined without hesitation, believing that it would violate his own sense of dignity as well as the dignity of the presidency. But no such normative constraints obtain in a society where the disruptive entrepreneur is the cultural hero, the public servant is held in low esteem, and inequality has risen to its highest levels since the 1920s. What was unbecoming in 1953 is now considered appropriate. One reason is that America is a radically different country from what it was in 1953, when the nation was shaped by collective efforts to overcome the Great Depression and win World War II. In 1953, the richest 1 percent held 26.5 percent of all privately held wealth in the United States, but by 2012 they owned 38.9 percent. For income, the comparable figures for the top 1 percent are 13.3 percent in 1953 and 20.8 percent in 2012. In 1950, the ratio of chief executive-to-worker salaries was 20 to 1, on average; today it is over 200 to 1. Equally revealing are the tax rates for the two periods: In 1953, the top individual tax rate was 92 percent, but today it is 39.6 percent, with President Trump now proposing to reduce it more. Also related to these figures is the declining relative strength of labor unions, which represented 35 percent of American workers in the mid-1950s, but just 11 percent today. "

To others, President Trump’s plan to end the federal deduction for state and local taxes would eliminate a costly perk for the wealthy. But to many taxpayers, the deduction is a cherished break that can save them thousands of dollars in double taxation. Mr. Trump and House Republicans, riding a wave of conservative and populist sentiment, are pushing to end the provision. Yet they must overcome a long tradition and powerful opponents, including Republican and Democratic officials in wealthy, populous states like California, New Jersey, New York and Texas. “I don’t think they’re going to seriously restrict it at all,” said William G. Gale, a co-director of the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George Bush. Congressional Republicans have indicated that they will go it alone on tax legislation, but taking on such an entrenched interest usually requires bipartisan support. “If Republicans do it by themselves, they put a big target on their backs,” Mr. Gale said. Members of Congress generally take a “political Hippocratic oath” to “never be seen to do obvious harm,” he said, but eliminating the deduction, which would increase taxes and undermine the ability of cities and states to raise revenue, would violate that precept.

Plans to bury an oil pipeline in the Nebraska dirt, through hilly grazing land near the Elkhorn River and flat expanses of corn farther south, had been halted. Farmers and ranchers who spent years opposing the project moved on with their lives. But suddenly the pipeline from Canada to Nebraska, known as Keystone XL, is back on the table. As President Trump promised on the campaign trail, he has cleared the way for the project, which his predecessor had blocked. Republican politicians, many union members and some landowners are cheering the pipeline as a way to create jobs and bring more North American oil to market. But in spots along the proposed route through Nebraska, including here on the sandy soil of the Crumly family farm, the president’s decision is being met with frustration and resolve to resume the fight. Jeanne Crumly, who sees Keystone XL as a dire threat to this land, believes Mr. Trump is supporting it without “really giving a hoot of how there are people and livelihoods at stake here.” “It was going to be where he flexed his muscle,” she said. State-level permits and easements along the three-state pipeline route are in place in Montana and South Dakota. That leaves Nebraska — where voters overwhelmingly favored Mr. Trump, but where a coalition delayed the pipeline for years during President Barack Obama’s administration — as the best chance to block construction. Nebraska regulators will hear public comment on the project at a 10-hour meeting on Wednesday. "

And with that, Mr. Trump staked claim to an issue that has become a pet cause for a group that, generally speaking, would just as soon wear a Power Rangers helmet as a “Make America Great Again” hat: the urban beards-and-selvage-jeans set who transformed the “Made in U.S.A.” clothing label into a men’s wear status symbol over the past decade. In any other year, having the president as an ally might be considered a coup. With this president? Well, for brands that have staked their identity on “Made in U.S.A.” chic, it is complicated. “Politics has become extremely contentious and polarizing in this country, and we don’t want our brand caught in the political crossfire,” said Jacob Hurwitz, a founder of American Trench, a maker of fashion-forward outerwear and hosiery in Philadelphia that prominently displays the motto “Always American-Made” on its website. “To be honest, we can’t afford it.” In fact, Mr. Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” order will have no tangible effect on the market for plaid shirts or hand-sewn leather hunting boots, since it concerns procurement policies by federal agencies, not purchases by individual consumers, on products like steel (it also aims to rework the visa program for foreign technical workers). Even so, the order helps cement the “Buy American” impulse with the protectionist “America First” policies that Mr. Trump hammered away at on the campaign trail. To some on the political left, the president’s appropriation of “Buy American” feels like a violation. "

Legislation is being considered in Congress to help 22,500 retired union miners who have received notices that their health care benefits will be cut off on Monday unless new funding is approved. A few short-term fixes have been passed by Congress in recent years. But the miners, many with black lung and other diseases from years of labor down below, deserve a long-term solution for a more secure future. Once firmly financed in the heyday of the industry, the health plan has hit the same hard times as Big Coal, with numerous companies going bankrupt and shedding their responsibility to pay into the fund. The industry has receded in the face of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, while there are fewer career miners contributing to the union’s share of the funding. Anxious miners have been buttonholing lawmakers, noting that President Trump, their nonstop champion in his election campaign, has made a show of loosening environmental regulations to help mining companies regain profits. Yet he has been publicly silent on the miners’ health care problem. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said he has talked with Mr. Trump privately and has been assured that the president supports a permanent solution for the miners. “Tell them I’m doing everything I can,” Mr. Trump was quoted by the senator. Private talk is far short of Mr. Trump’s signature tweet or public commitment. In the current muddle of federal budget negotiations, the miners’ cause could easily get lost, particularly with conservative critics asking why the federal government should bail out a private-sector union. But the miners insist their benefit plan, hard-won seven decades ago in a crippling strike, amounts to a continuing national commitment. Senator Manchin is sponsoring a 10-year solution for the health care shortfall that would cost $1.3 billion and tap in part into funds from an existing mine cleanup program. The separate and far more expensive issue of miners’ pension benefits, which are similarly failing, would be put off until next year. House Republicans have talked of another short-term bailout of less than two years to cover health care. But the Senate’s bipartisan approach is far better as a permanent answer. It gained momentum with the endorsement of the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who had been reluctant in the past but now is heeding pleas for help from several thousand of his own Kentucky retirees. President Trump has a chance to finally push something more than fantasy for the many coal miners who took him at his word last November. "

On January 20, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States. His message was grim but confident. “This American carnage,” he declared, “stops right here and stops right now.” The next day, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in protest for the Women’s March. President Trump’s cabinet began to take shape even before Inauguration Day. He brought together insiders like Reince Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman, outsiders like Stephen K. Bannon and millionaires like Betsy DeVos. On January 25, President Trump signed an executive order directing the construction of a Mexican border wall, a signature campaign talking point. Times video journalists looked at how the promise to build the wall gained momentum, and at the debate over who would pay for it. President Trump signed an executive order titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.” The order indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the country for 90 days. Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, resigned in February after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials about conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The Justice Department feared this lack of disclosure could make Mr. Flynn vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.” That’s what President Trump said less than a month before the Republicans failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act at the end of March. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan acknowledged that Obamacare would be the law of the land for the foreseeable future. In April, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate to become the 113th justice of the Supreme Court. Adam Liptak explained the “elaborate dance” that nominees perform in order to secure a confirmation. The final tally was 54-45. One of the worst chemical attacks of the Syrian civil war took place in April, killing dozens. The United States held President Bashar al-Assad responsible. In an exclusive interview with Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush, President Trump called the attack “an affront to humanity.” Hours later, he gave the order to drop 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on an airfield in western Syria. There are potential showdowns ahead over tax policy, health care, environmental regulations and more. No matter what happens, The Times will be here recording it all. "

The F.B.I. director, James Comey, said he felt “mildly nauseous” about the idea that he swayed the election with his 11th-hour letter to Congress about new Clinton emails. But he sharply defended his actions during a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing. He said that not informing Congress would have been tantamount to hiding information. He added that he knew the decision would be “disastrous for me personally.” _____ 2. The health care bill is headed to a House vote on Thursday.

The draft proposal, shared with The New York Times on Wednesday by participants at Syria talks held in Astana, Kazakhstan, is one of the most detailed suggestions to emerge in recent months in the rocky negotiations to halt the war, now in its seventh year. The proposal would apply to Syrian government and rebel forces in the four main areas of the country where insurgents unaffiliated with the Islamic State still hold significant territory. But it faces a number of challenges, most notably acceptance by the Syrian government and the insurgent groups attending the talks. The insurgent groups suspended participation in the talks on Wednesday to protest what they described as heavy bombing by the Syrian government’s Russian-backed forces the day before that killed dozens, including civilians. The Russian proposal does not specify measures to prevent government warplanes from carrying out such bombings. Rebels said they remained suspicious of Russian guarantees, regardless, because Russia has been unable or unwilling to curb government attacks on civilians. "
1402,James Comey Is ‘Mildly Nauseous’ About the Election. It’s Not Enough.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/opinion/james-comey-fbi-mildly-nauseous.html?searchResultPosition=63,2017/05/03,OPINION,"Being head of a secretive law-enforcement agency probably breeds circumspection, but James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., has taken understatement to a whole new level. It makes him “mildly nauseous,” he now tells us, to think that he may have affected the outcome of the 2016 election with his decision to announce just days before the vote that he had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Mildly? He should be sick at heart, because there is no doubt that he affected the election, and it seems pretty obvious that he knew that he would do just that. Comey, who went from righteous prosecutor to self-righteous politician with his fateful pre-election decision, told a Senate hearing on Wednesday that he would act the same way if had a do-over. That’s deeply unfortunate. Not only did Comey probably tip the election to Donald Trump; he also handled the investigations of Clinton’s emails and Trump’s strange relationship with the Kremlin in entirely different ways. He treated Trump with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s customary silence about ongoing probes. He talked about the Clinton investigation in extremely public and damaging ways. When Comey decided to announce the reopening of the Clinton email probe, he had no solid evidence that there was any significant new information on the newly discovered computer, belonging to the disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, that sparked the renewed investigation.

But the crowdfunding site GoFundMe froze her ability to access those donations on Wednesday after questions were raised about her story. Heather Kancso, a New York City resident, created the GoFundMe campaign on April 29, about a week after her boyfriend, Baxter Reid, 26, of Canberra, Australia, was detained by United States customs officials and held at a federal detention facility in Buffalo. Her account drew international attention this week after news media in Australia and the United Kingdom reported on her claim that he had been detained for overstaying his visa by 90 minutes. On Wednesday, a spokesman for GoFundMe, Bobby Whithorne, said that the donations, which had reached more than $9,000, had “been placed on hold until additional information can be provided about the campaign.” He said that it was “not uncommon” for the organization to seek additional information in order to protect donors. Ms. Kancso wrote on the site that Mr. Reid had been in the United States “for the last several months on a 5 year visa.” "
1404,"House Approves Spending Deal, Clearing a Hurdle to Avoid a Shutdown",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/budget-spending-government-shutdown.html?searchResultPosition=70,2017/05/03,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a bipartisan $1.1 trillion spending agreement to fund the government through September, clearing a key procedural hurdle to avert a shutdown even as scores of Republicans opposed a measure crafted under a White House and Congress controlled by their own party. The depth of Republican opposition to the measure — which passed by a vote of 309-118, with little more than a dozen “no” votes from Democrats — reflects the perception on Capitol Hill that the minority party fared strikingly well in negotiations. There are also many conservative lawmakers who tend to oppose spending bills generally. The agreement, which is expected to earn final passage with a Senate vote as soon as Thursday, includes increased funding for some of President Trump’s priorities, like military and border security spending. But Democrats have broadly cheered it as a rejection of Mr. Trump’s signature campaign pledges, most notably a border wall with Mexico, which was not included. The measure supplies tens of millions of dollars to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred protecting Mr. Trump and his family — a relief for New York City, which has worked to protect Trump Tower, where the president’s wife, Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, live. And it increases funding by $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, rebuffing the Trump administration’s request that its budget be reduced. “It’s a product to be proud of,” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said moments before the vote. Republicans also claimed a number of policy victories. Speaker Paul D. Ryan endorsed the bill as “a good one for conservatives,” citing the advancement of Republican priorities in military spending and education policy. "
1405,"In Mar-a-Lago Blunder, a Glimpse at the Difficulties of ‘Soft Diplomacy’ Under Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/magazine/in-mar-a-lago-blunder-a-glimpse-at-the-difficulties-of-soft-diplomacy-under-trump.html?searchResultPosition=67,2017/05/03,MAGAZINE,"At the beginning of April, a short blog post about Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort appeared on ShareAmerica, a web property administered by the State Department. The post was an anodyne history of the property, one of many such posts on the site, which is full of easily digestible tidbits about America meant for a foreign audience (“New York Restaurant Named Best in the World,” for example, or “The Year of the Rooster: How Are Americans Celebrating?”). It sat quietly for several weeks, until a promotional tweet from a State Department account caught the eye of Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who wondered aloud on Twitter why the federal government was in the business of advertising the president’s private club. The post was removed after the subsequent furor, an apology left in its place. The ShareAmerica site is maintained by a small group of writers employed by a division in the State Department called the Bureau of International Information Programs (I.I.P.). The bureau’s mission, according to its page on the State Department website, is to advance “U.S. foreign policy goals directly with foreign audiences in support of U.S. embassies, consulates and missions abroad.” Buried in YouTube, a webinar about ShareAmerica narrated by I.I.P. staff members puts a little more sex appeal on the project: “The official term is ‘public diplomacy,’” the director of editorial content explains. “The term they don’t like us to use is ‘propaganda.’” The I.I.P. was formed in 1999 at the State Department from the wreckage of the United States Information Agency (U.S.I.A.) — the seminal Cold War-era institution that at one time housed the Voice of America (a radio agency originally established to combat Nazi propaganda). Today, the I.I.P. runs “American Spaces,” physical locations abroad that host speakers and events and provide reading materials to foreign publics. (I.I.P. “used to send more good American writers to Europe than HUAC,” a former I.I.P. contractor told me.) It has worked with public and private institutions to sponsor contests and other programs aimed at attracting world youth to democratic ideals. But like the U.S.I.A. before it, the I.I.P.’s most tangible stock in trade is publications — in English and other languages — for global dissemination through U.S. embassies, consulates and, now, the internet. For an American reader, I.I.P.’s body of work offers a fascinating look not only at what our government wants to tell the world but also at what it wants to believe about itself. The obvious conflicts of interest that accompanied Donald Trump into office are in one sense the least of I.I.P.’s problems; the larger question is what a propaganda unit is supposed to do when the pronouncements of its head of state are so often at odds with the national vision it tries to sell to the world. Since the bureau’s inception, its web presence has gone through several major permutations (most of which are archived by the Library of Congress). I.I.P. publications, whether the web-only ShareAmerica posts written by staff members or the longer pamphlets and books solicited from subject-matter experts, often cover governance, trade and security as they pertain to America and the rest of the world or fun and inspirational facts about American culture. For every piece of lighthearted fluff about the significance of the Super Bowl (“On the menu for many: nachos, hot wings, chips and dips, and any food that can be made into a shape of an American football”), there is a pamphlet that makes more ennobling claims about American pluralism. The “American Communities” series, for example, highlights the cultural traditions of immigrants in America, including Bukharan Jews in Queens and Macedonian Roma in the Bronx. A book-length publication on American Muslims rhapsodizes about the American experiment: In some I.I.P. publications, the reader senses an obviously corrective subtext for the hypothetical foreign audience — “A Practical Guide to Journalism Ethics,” for example, or “Freedom From Fear: Creating Safe Spaces for L.G.B.T. Youth”. A post called “Have You Ever Laughed at a Politician?” advises that “leaders, no matter how powerful, have learned that accepting criticism with grace comes with their jobs.” A series called “You Asked” functions more like apologia, taking the form of an F.A.Q. page: “Who Owns Guns in America?” one nameless foreigner asks; “The true nature of that tradition has been often romanticized, exaggerated or distorted,” the I.I.P. answers. Another pamphlet, “Why Does the U.S. Have Capital Punishment?” points, almost ruefully, to the Constitution: “The answer lies in the limited power of the U.S. federal government to impose laws on the states, the interplay between state politics and federal law, and the role of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Constitution.” "
1406,Trump Is Expected to Relax Tax Rules on Churches Endorsing Political Candidates,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/trump-religion-executive-order-gay-rights.html?searchResultPosition=68,2017/05/03,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday will ease restrictions on political activity by tax-exempt churches and charities, White House officials said, but has backed away from a broader religious liberty order that would have allowed faith-based organizations and companies to avoid serving or hiring gay people. Conservative religious leaders who were fierce supporters of Mr. Trump’s candidacy had pushed the president to provide faith organizations with much more sweeping relief from Obama-era regulations that protect gay men, lesbians and others from discrimination. Instead, in an executive order, Mr. Trump will offer a vague promise to “protect and vigorously promote religious liberty.” He will also direct federal agencies to exempt some religious organizations from Affordable Care Act requirements that provide employees with health coverage for contraception. By making those promises to mark the National Day of Prayer at the White House, Mr. Trump is offering a partial remedy to the anger inside some religious communities toward federal laws they believe require them to put aside beliefs about homosexuality, contraception or other issues. Mr. Trump’s executive order on political activity, which he will sign while hosting conservative religious leaders, tries to overcome a provision in the federal tax code that prohibits churches and other religious organizations from directly opposing or supporting political candidates. Officials said Mr. Trump will direct the Internal Revenue Service to exercise “maximum enforcement discretion” so that religious organizations and other nonprofit groups are not subject to punishment for expressing political views during campaign seasons.

1407,Trump’s Immigration Proposals ‘Conspicuously Absent’ From Spending Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/trump-immigration-spending-bill.html?searchResultPosition=69,2017/05/03,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s plans to hire thousands of new deportation officers, cut off money to cities that refuse to turn over undocumented immigrants and target states that legally sell marijuana were notably omitted from the spending compromise bill unveiled by Congress to avert a government shutdown. To the displeasure of conservative groups and supporters of Mr. Trump, lawmakers from both parties rejected key elements of the president’s proposals to enforce the nation’s immigration laws more aggressively. “All the things the president talked about are conspicuously absent from the budget bill,” said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization that favors more restrictive immigration policies. The funding bill does add nearly $1.5 billion for border and aviation security. But while most attention has been paid to Congress’ decision not to include money for Mr. Trump’s border wall, an examination of the 1,665 pages of the budget and accompanying documents shows a rejection of much of the president’s approach to border security in favor of a more conventional approach by lawmakers. The funding includes money for new surveillance systems, replacing existing border fencing, and adding more unmanned aerial vehicles and other border surveillance technologies for Border Patrol agents. It also adds some money to hire Border Patrol agents, in an effort to increase the number of agents up to the level mandated by Congress. Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said the spending bill includes money “sought by the president for immigration enforcement and for additional technology, infrastructure, and enhanced support for personnel to secure the Southwest border.” "

But as Sinclair tries to expand by buying even more local television stations, it has locked horns with that other broadcast giant known for its political bent, 21st Century Fox. Now the battle for a bigger audience is on, as Sinclair and Fox each look to broaden their reach in the Trump era. Sinclair, which has little name recognition but beams local television stations into a quarter of American homes, covers plenty of standard local news, including fires, shootings and traffic. But it has also used its 173 television stations to advance a mostly right-leaning agenda since the presidency of George W. Bush. Fox, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons, has long dominated conservative political discussion with its Fox News cable channel. But Fox News is in disarray after several scandals. In the last weeks alone, Fox News lost its biggest star, Bill O’Reilly, and one of its most senior executives, Bill Shine. "
1409,Obama Says His Presidential Library Will Be a ‘Hub for the Community’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/obama-presidential-library-chicago.html?searchResultPosition=65,2017/05/03,U.S.,"CHICAGO — Barack Obama has seen presidential libraries. Sometimes they are a monument to the past, he said, standing on stage in an auditorium on Wednesday; a record of accomplishments. “And a little bit of an ego trip,” he added. “‘See what I did.’” Mr. Obama and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, returned for a day to the city they call home to unveil renderings of the Obama Presidential Center, a modern, stone-and-glass complex on Lake Michigan that they said would be a different kind of presidential library. Speaking to several hundred people on the city’s South Side, Mr. Obama, who was tieless and in a jovial mood, said that the center could be “a transformational project for this community.” “The main thing that Michelle and I contributed was just saying, ‘What is it that we want to see 10 years from now?’” he said, recounting his conversations with the architects who designed the center. “And we don’t want to see some big building that’s dead, and kids are getting dragged to it for a field trip. What we wanted was something that was alive, and that was a hub for the community and for the city and for the country.” It was the second time in 10 days that Mr. Obama had come to Chicago, as he has begun to emerge in public after the end of his presidency. He spent the weeks after the January inauguration of President Trump vacationing in Palm Springs, the British Virgin Islands and French Polynesia; on Sunday, he is scheduled to appear in Boston to accept the Profile in Courage Award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. The Obama center could be one of the biggest projects ever developed on the South Side, at a cost of at least $500 million. Expected to be completed in 2021, it will be located in Jackson Park, a space designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. The 500-acre, lakefront park already includes the Museum of Science and Industry, a beach, golf courses and athletic facilities. Mr. Obama said he wanted his library to include a children’s play area that would attract families from the neighborhood, and a community garden for schoolchildren. He said he wanted food trucks and some grills so people can barbecue, prompting chuckles from the crowd. "

s a newcomer to Sydney, I’m often asked: How do you like the city? And what do you think of Australia? Usually I bumble through a few odd observations — I’m fascinated by all the neighborhood butcher shops, for example — but lately I’ve found myself telling people that Australia strikes me as a place that’s far more complicated than it presents itself to be. Sydney in particular sometimes reminds me of an actress with perfect posture and English diction on a Broadway stage, who gets spotted at a bar after the show, sitting in a corner and speaking another language. That may not be quite right (I’m new, remember?) but two locations come to mind: John Howard’s office near the top floor of a gleaming tower in downtown Sydney, and a hot, small gym in Sydney’s western suburbs where the children of South Sudanese refugees play basketball, drawing American scouts. I spent a fair amount of time in both places reporting stories for this week’s rollout of our expanded Australia coverage, and I kept wondering what they revealed about my new home. As an American meeting Mr. Howard for the first time, I was impressed to find the former prime minister’s office so unassuming, without the heavy security found with former leaders in other countries. The walls and shelves held casual portraits of Mr. Howard with presidents. The views of Sydney from his office above the 50th floor were worth ogling. "
1411,Pre-Existing Conditions: Evaluating Competing Claims,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/health-care-fact-check-preexisting-conditions.html?searchResultPosition=54,2017/05/03,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — In the debate over how the effort to replace the Affordable Care Act would affect those with pre-existing health conditions, opponents and supporters alike have offered misleading talking points. Faced with polling indicating public support for protections, and after an emotional appeal by the television host Jimmy Kimmel that has gone viral, Republicans are making a dubious case that their updated bill provides similar coverage for those who are less healthy, while Democrats are overstating claims about how many are affected. Here’s an assessment: This is misleading. The amendment offered by Representative Tom MacArthur, Republican of New Jersey, prohibits denying coverage to people with a pre-existing condition, but, importantly, it does not shield against potentially higher costs. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to charge the same price for coverage regardless of health status, a practice known as community rating. The amended Republican bill, Mr. Ryan said in a news release, allows states to waive this rule for those with lapses in coverage, though it mandates that they provide “risk-sharing or reinsurance mechanisms.” These include high-risk pools, subsidies and a program to reimburse insurers for sicker patients. Similar mechanisms that existed before the Affordable Care Act covered few people and were underfunded, The New York Times reported. "
1412,5 Takeaways From James Comey’s Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/james-comey-hearing-takeaways.html?searchResultPosition=57,2017/05/03,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, provided his first public explanation Wednesday of why he revealed days before the election that he had reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, saying he could not risk concealing newfound information from Congress. In nearly four hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Comey was also asked about the F.B.I.’s investigation into links between President Trump’s associates and the Russian government, among other issues. Here are five highlights from Mr. Comey’s testimony: Mr. Comey was adamant that if he had to choose again, he would still have informed Congress 10 days before the election that he had reopened the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails. His decision prompted a flood of news coverage, and supporters of Mrs. Clinton later accused him of costing her the presidency. “I could see two doors, and they were both actions,” Mr. Comey said. “One was labeled ‘Speak’; the other was labeled ‘Conceal.’” “Everybody who disagrees with me has to come back to Oct. 28 with me and stare at this and tell me what you would do,” he said. “Would you speak or would you conceal? And I could be wrong, but we honestly made a decision between those two choices.” Mr. Comey acknowledged the toll that decision had taken. “Even in hindsight — and this has been one of the world’s most painful experiences — I would make the same decision,” he said.

1413,A Little-Noticed Target in the House Health Bill: Special Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/health-bill-medicaid-special-education-affordable-care-act.html?searchResultPosition=56,2017/05/03,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — While House Republicans lined up votes Wednesday for a Thursday showdown over their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Vickie Glenn sat in her Murphysboro, Ill., office and prayed for it to fail. Ms. Glenn, a Medicaid coordinator for Tri-County Special Education, an Illinois cooperative that helps more than 20 school districts deliver special education services to students, was worried about an issue that few in Congress were discussing: how the new American Health Care Act, with its deep cuts to Medicaid, would affect her 2,500 students. With all the sweeping changes the Republican bill would impose, little attention has been paid to its potential impact on education. School districts rely on Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor, to provide costly services to millions of students with disabilities across the country. For nearly 30 years, Medicaid has helped school systems cover costs for special education services and equipment, from physical therapists to feeding tubes. The money is also used to provide preventive care, such as vision and hearing screenings, for other Medicaid-eligible children. “If I could have 10 minutes with President Trump, I could help him understand what we do, why it’s important,” Ms. Glenn said. “If he understood, he would protect it, because this isn’t Republicans and Democrats. It’s just kids.” The new law would cut Medicaid by $880 billion, or 25 percent, over 10 years and impose a “per-capita cap” on funding for certain groups of people, such as children and the elderly — a dramatic change that would convert Medicaid from an entitlement designed to cover any costs incurred to a more limited program. AASA, an advocacy association for school superintendents, estimates that school districts receive about $4 billion in Medicaid reimbursements annually. In a January survey of nearly 1,000 district officials in 42 states, nearly 70 percent of districts reported that they used the money to pay the salaries of health care professionals who serve special education students.

1414,Trump Folks: Tell the Truth About Your Tax Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/opinion/trump-tax-plan-mnuchin.html?searchResultPosition=55,2017/05/03,OPINION,"Last Wednesday, President Trump unveiled his huge tax cut, unmistakably geared to helping business and the wealthy. A few days later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a business conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that there would be no net tax cut for the rich because it would be offset by closing loopholes and deductions. That was hardly the first time Mr. Mnuchin made that patently absurd assertion nor the only occasion on which he and other members of the Trump administration had similarly misled the public about the nature of the tax plan. In fact, when Mr. Mnuchin first offered his unequivocal pronouncement, at his confirmation hearing in January, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, quickly called the commitment the “Mnuchin rule.” A few weeks later, in his first television interview as secretary, Mr. Mnuchin said, “We’re primarily focused on a middle-income tax cut and simplification for business.” When the first dribblings of specifics arrived, they included lowering the top rate on earned income, eliminating a 3.8 percent levy on investment income, and doing away with the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.

1415,Apple Announces $1 Billion Fund to Create U.S. Jobs in Manufacturing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/technology/apple-jobs.html?searchResultPosition=53,2017/05/03,TECHNOLOGY,"SAN FRANCISCO — While on the campaign trail last year, Donald J. Trump lamented the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and set his sights on companies like Apple to help rectify the situation. “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” he said. On Wednesday, Apple appeared to meet President Trump halfway. While it did not announce a new manufacturing facility with thousands of manufacturing jobs, Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, said it planned to dedicate resources to American job creation with a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. The company said it would announce the first investment from its new fund later this month. The fund “can be the ripple in the pond,” Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said during an interview with CNBC in which he announced the new fund. “Those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.” In introducing the fund, Apple joined a growing list of companies that have said in recent months that they will add, promote or keep jobs — many of them related to manufacturing — in the United States. Carrier, a furnace maker that had been excoriated by Mr. Trump for potentially outsourcing jobs to Mexico, decided to keep 800 of 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. SoftBank, a Japanese company that has invested in many businesses worldwide, told Mr. Trump it would use a $100 billion technology fund to create 50,000 American jobs. This week, Infosys, a tech outsourcing company based in India, said it would hire up to 10,000 American workers. "
1416,The New Study That Shows Trumpcare’s Damage,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/opinion/trump-health-care.html?searchResultPosition=52,2017/05/03,OPINION,"When Massachusetts expanded health insurance a decade ago, state officials unknowingly created an experiment. It’s turned out to be an experiment that offers real-world evidence of what would happen if the House Republicans’ health bill were to become law. The findings from Massachusetts come from an academic paper being released Thursday, and the timing is good. Until now, the main analysis of the Republican health bill has come from the Congressional Budget Office, and some Republicans have criticized that analysis as speculative. The Massachusetts data is more concrete. Unfortunately for those Republicans, the new data makes their health care bill look even worse than the C.B.O. report did. The bill could cause more people to lose insurance than previously predicted and do more damage to insurance markets. The $8 billion sweetener that Republicans added to the bill on Wednesday would do nothing to change this reality. President Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan are continuing to push a policy that would harm millions of Americans. Here are the basics of the new study, and why it matters: The Massachusetts law subsidizes health insurance for lower-income households, and does so via four different income categories. Everyone in a category — for example, a family of four earning between $44,700 and $55,875 a year — would pay the same price for insurance. A family earning less would pay less, and a family earning more would pay more. This system creates what economists call a “discontinuity.” People who have only slightly different incomes pay very different prices for an insurance plan. A family earning $44,701 could pay a couple of hundred dollars more per year than a family making $44,699. Discontinuities are a social scientist’s friend, because they set up natural experiments. The price difference faced by the similar families I just described allows researchers to analyze how much the cost of insurance affects people’s willingness to sign up. "

There have been numerous rallies and protests around the country, with millions of new activists participating. Yet nothing has been really accomplished, as the president continues to embarrass our country. I have a suggestion: The United States Constitution should be amended to authorize the recall of federal officials. At least 19 states around the country allow for recall of public officials. Recall petitions provide a way for citizens to retain control over elected officials who are not representing the best interests of their constituents, or who are unresponsive or incompetent. A significant number of signatures would have to be collected before a recall referendum could be scheduled. In 2003, Gov. Gray Davis of California was recalled. In 1988, Arizona voters filed enough signatures to trigger a recall election for Gov. Evan Mecham, but he was impeached before the date of the scheduled recall. The American people should also have the opportunity to recall federal officials. PAUL FEINER, GREENBURGH, N.Y. The writer is Greenburgh’s town supervisor. "

She called him arrogant. He accused her of repeating “stupidities.” She cut him off and told him not to lecture her. He shook his head sadly, and she laughed sarcastically. The debate on Wednesday night between France’s two presidential candidates, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front and the centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron, was more like an angry American-style television shoutfest than the reasoned discussion of issues the French have become accustomed to. It was a study in violent verbal combat: The two talked angrily over each other, cut each other off, shook fists and pointed fingers, leaving the moderators bewildered and helpless. But it was also a stark demonstration of two radically different visions of France that voters will have to choose between on Sunday in the election’s final round. Mr. Macron, 39, the former banker and cool technocrat, educated at France’s finest schools and the beneficiary of a meteoric rise, faced off against Ms. Le Pen, 48, the scion of one of the country’s most notorious political families, the inheritor of a far-right party who has tried to move it toward the center. The two candidates did not hide their disdain for each other, and their total divergence on all the issues — Europe, terrorism, France’s stagnant economy, Russia — explained why. “The high priestess of fear is sitting in front of me,” Mr. Macron said derisively, having cast his opponent as a dangerous extremist with deep ties to her party’s dark past. He made a point of repeating her name, to remind viewers of her parental filiation: her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the National Front and is associated with its historical posture of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and stigmatization of immigrants.

The beast of fashion is one of a kind, like its owner, Ellen Christine Colon-Lugo, 66, who presides over an Alice in Wonderland world filled with hundreds of her handmade confections. They include chiffon Marie Antoinette hats that resemble layer cakes and a $19,500 fedora that took a craftsman in Montecristi, Ecuador, four years to weave; its straw feels as smooth as linen. Made in a workshop run out of the loft where she lives, Ms. Colon-Lugo’s chapeaus have been worn with Chanel and Alexander McQueen, and have graced the heads of celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker. For the cover of Harper’s Bazaar, Ms. Parker wore a hat inspired by a Victorian inkwell with a plume pen made of black ostrich feathers; the photograph was one of the images projected onto the Empire State Building for the magazine’s 150th anniversary in late April. Also Harrison Ford, who bought a simple Montecristi “that he could roll up and put in his pocket,” Ms. Colon-Lugo said. And Ivana Trump (two cloches) and Lady Gaga (a giant see-through acrylic crownless space-age halo, which the designer called “a walking canopy.”) Gwyneth Paltrow wore a cat-eye mask made of 19th-century black Chantilly lace from Ms. Colon-Lugo’s extensive collection of vintage materials, which include hatbands, hatpins, faux flowers and ribbons, spilling out of hatboxes and drawers. The retail price, $480, may seem relatively reasonable, considering that the milliner’s hats cost from $150 to the thousands. But did anyone buy it? “No,” Ms. Colon-Lugo said. “Because it’s out of the conscious level of their touchability. They want a $10 mask at the Rite Aid. They want a mask. They don’t want that mask. That’s too special. If I made some cheap version of it, yeah, we’d probably sell hundreds, but why should I? Because they’d make that in China, and who cares.” "

But the couple, who said that a son had been killed by a gang back in El Salvador and that their daughter had nearly been raped, thought they had finally reached safety. Under United States and international law, all people who ask for asylum are supposed to be allowed into the country to plead their case. But instead, they said, a Customs and Border Protection agent shooed them away. “There is no asylum here,” Francisca, 32, recalled the agent telling them. “We are not granting asylum.” Customs agents have increasingly turned away asylum seekers without so much as an interview, according to migrants and their lawyers, in a trend first noted several months ago and that appeared to accelerate after President Trump’s inauguration. That has left an untold number of migrants trapped in Mexico, where they have sometimes fallen prey to kidnappers seeking ransom or been driven into the hands of drug cartels and smugglers. Some have tried to enter the United States illegally and dangerously, through the desert or across the Rio Grande, a risky journey. “By rejecting asylum seekers at its borders, the United States is turning them away to face danger, persecution, torture, kidnappings and potential trafficking in Mexico,” Human Rights First, an organization that has studied the problem, said in a report released on Wednesday.

1423,2 Fatal Police Shootings Yield 2 Different Results,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/police-shootings-alton-sterling.html?searchResultPosition=78,2017/05/03,U.S.,"BATON ROUGE, La. — A day after the Justice Department extracted a guilty plea from a South Carolina police officer who fatally shot a black man in the back, a federal prosecutor here explained on Wednesday why the department had declined to bring charges against two officers involved in the fatal shooting of a black Louisiana man, Alton B. Sterling. The announcement brought an end to what federal officials called an exhaustive investigation into the death of Mr. Sterling, who was killed on July 5 in the parking lot of a Baton Rouge convenience store where he often peddled CDs. “It was the unanimous decision of all the prosecutors and agents in this case that we simply did not have sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either officer violated the federal criminal civil rights laws,” Corey R. Amundson, the acting United States attorney here, said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. A day earlier and some 700 miles away, Michael T. Slager, a former police officer in North Charleston, S.C., pleaded guilty to a charge of willfully using excessive force to deprive Walter L. Scott of his civil rights when he shot Mr. Scott as he fled on foot in April 2015. The two cases have been among the most explosive in the nation’s complex and emotional debate about race and policing, and the developments in each came at a time when the country waits to see how episodes of police violence, which have spurred both rioting and peaceful protests, will be addressed by a Justice Department now headed by Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama. Little can be gleaned from the Sterling and Scott cases, however, about Mr. Sessions’s leadership at the department so far: Both cases were holdovers from the era of Mr. Sessions’s predecessor as attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, and their outcomes were set in motion before Mr. Sessions was appointed by President Trump. "

Though the United States and Australia have long been allied in war and trade, Mr. Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in late January after the Australian leader urged him to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Things only soured further when Mr. Trump took to Twitter to excoriate the agreement. “I will study this dumb deal!” he declared in a post a few days later. On Thursday, the president will have a chance for reconciliation when he boards the hangar deck of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum for a dinner commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, in which United States and Australian naval and air forces fought Japan during World War II. The conflict is often remembered as “the battle that saved Australia.” “There’s a deep and broad connection between the two countries that most people don’t know enough about,” said John Berry, a former United States ambassador to Australia and the president of the American Australian Association, which is hosting the event. “I’m glad we’re taking a moment to really celebrate that.” "
1425,Should a Man Roll Up His Sleeves?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/fashion/mens-style/should-a-man-roll-up-his-sleeves.html?searchResultPosition=66,2017/05/03,MEN’S STYLE,"In spring, a young — or older — man’s fancy turns to rolling up his sleeves. Fashion etiquette makes it acceptable to roll them just below the elbow for added ventilation or above the elbow when faced with manual labor. For some of us, skin sensitivity issues play a role. I’m still recovering from the day my mother accidentally tossed one of my favorite long-sleeve shirts into a washing machine with some drapes. Neither of us realized it, but my shirt became flecked with fiberglass, making me itch all day in school, and part of me was scarred for life, if not literally. Rolled-up sleeves are also an antidote to the dreaded short-sleeve business shirt, which can make you look like Michael Douglas in “Falling Down,” albeit without the semiautomatic. But even those sleeve-rollers among us have to admit it’s a tricky look to pull off, as Speaker Paul D. Ryan reminded us in March when he rolled out his case for a new health care plan. Dispensing with a jacket, he stood before members of the news media with his sleeves almost to his elbows. Mr. Ryan didn’t look as awkward as he did in the famous cringe-worthy photo that shows him in his gym-rat attire, complete with a backward baseball cap, which made him look like the world’s last Limp Bizkit fan. But the combination of his PowerPoint presentation and his down-to-business sleeves statement unleashed a slew of internet barbs and memes. Weeks later, in a counter news conference to criticize the proposed health care act, Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, tweeted, “I might even roll up my sleeves,” and then he did just that. Mastering the roll-up can be more challenging than properly knotting a necktie. Some of us opt for the most basic but least comfortable approach: turning the cuff over and over until you hit elbow. Less constricting and easiest to undo, according to the website Real Men Real Style, is the “master roll”: pull the sleeve end to the elbow, keep it in place with a finger under the fabric and cup it around the cuff.

Political divisions will deepen and mistrust of the government will rise. Ms. Lam, who was picked to be chief executive by an election committee stacked in Beijing’s favor, has long taken a hard-line approach to suppressing dissent. As the former No. 2 official under the unpopular outgoing leader, Leung Chun-ying, she presided over the political reform process that ignited the Umbrella Movement of 2014, in which tens of thousands of Hong Kongers occupied major thoroughfares for three months demanding democratic rights. With Hong Kong’s autonomy plummeting to a 20-year low, it’s more important than ever for Washington to affirm its commitment to freedom in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, introduced by a bipartisan group of senators in February, would put the Hong Kong people’s rights at the center of United States policy toward the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The legislation, an update to a 1992 law governing relations between the United States and Hong Kong, would authorize the president to freeze United States-based assets of individuals who have suppressed freedoms in Hong Kong and deny them entry to America, require the secretary of state to issue an annual report on Hong Kong’s political situation until at least 2023 and guarantee that Hong Kongers who have participated in nonviolent assembly would not be denied American visas on the basis of their arrest. Our freedoms in Hong Kong have been increasingly squeezed since 2014, when the Chinese leadership in Beijing decided against democratizing the process for selecting our leader, inciting the months of protests.

Tillerson said Wednesday that the United States had been far too accommodating to emerging nations and longtime allies and that “things have gotten out of balance.” Righting those imbalances, he said, will be the mission of the State Department as it fulfills President Trump’s promise to put “America first.” “We were promoting relations. We were promoting economic activity. We were promoting trade with a lot of these emerging economies, and we just kind of lost track of how we were doing,” Mr. Tillerson said. “And as a result, things got a little bit out of balance.” Pacing around a stage in the department’s auditorium, Mr. Tillerson then discussed a series of specific challenges facing the United States. On reining in the nuclear program in North Korea, he described the effort to apply international pressure to further isolate Pyongyang as “a pressure campaign that has a knob on it.” “I’d say we’re at about dial setting 5 or 6 right now, with a strong call of countries all over the world to fully implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding sanctions, because no one has ever fully implemented those,” he said. "

It sits squarely in the congressional district once represented by Newt Gingrich, with excellent public schools and master-planned communities so pristine they could have been built by a model train aficionado. In 2015, the all-white City Council rejected the idea of expanding public transit out from majority-black Atlanta on the grounds that it “would increase high-density housing.” But something has been happening in Johns Creek — and, indeed, across much of the vast archipelago of cul-de-sac communities north of Atlanta that served as the launchpad for Mr. Gingrich’s 1994 Republican revolution. The promise of a suburban idyll has been increasingly attracting all kinds of people — many of whom are not white, and not Republican. Today, 24 percent of people in Johns Creek are of Asian heritage. Indian-Americans shop for saris at the Medlock Crossing strip mall and flock to the latest Bollywood hits at the multiplex. Chinese-Americans and food lovers of all stripes head to the Sichuan House, near the Target and Home Depot stores, for sliced pork ears in chili sauce and “tearfully spicy” mung bean noodles. Indeed, the northern Atlanta suburbs, once considered bastions of Republicanism, are experiencing an identity crisis — one that became acute with the success of a Democrat, Jon Ossoff, in a special House of Representatives election in Georgia’s Sixth District, which last sent a Democrat to Congress in the Carter administration.

1429,Trump Gets a Win He Wasn’t Counting On: He Saved the Filibuster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/trump-filibuster.html?searchResultPosition=109,2017/05/03,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump may have lost the spending fight, but he can celebrate at least one significant congressional accomplishment this week: He single-handedly saved the Senate filibuster. By demanding in two Twitter posts on Tuesday morning that the Senate change one of its signature legislative rules, Mr. Trump created an uncharacteristic cause for bipartisan unity. Senators in both parties rushed on Tuesday to categorically embrace the filibuster and profess that it would remain untouched. “There is an overwhelming majority on a bipartisan basis not interested in changing the way the Senate operates on the legislative calendar,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, declared, sounding like he meant it. “And that will not happen.” Mr. McConnell and his colleagues say that eliminating the supermajority threshold on legislation would change the very nature of the chamber, diminish American democracy and make the dignified Senate too much like the unruly House. All that might be true. But there are other, less obvious reasons for Republicans to want to hold fast to the filibuster given the current state of play in Washington. As the bipartisan budget agreement on Sunday showed, the filibuster also provides a check on Mr. Trump by giving Democrats a voice in legislation. "
1430,Is the New Mr. Right an Immigrant Rom-Com Hero?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/movies/kumail-nanjiani-silicon-valley-the-big-sick.html?searchResultPosition=108,2017/05/03,MOVIES,"LOS ANGELES — Kumail Nanjiani loves ’90s romantic comedies, the mushier the better. “I started doing standup because of Hugh Grant’s best-man speech in ‘Four Weddings,’ which is basically a standup routine,” he said. For the aspiring comic, Mr. Grant was the gold standard of rom-com stars, although Mr. Nanjiani never dreamed of becoming one himself. “It just felt like the people who were making those things were, like, aliens, or gods,” he said. Next month, Mr. Nanjiani tackles the lead role in the romantic comedy “The Big Sick,” based on his own experiences meeting, dating and making a hash of things with his future wife, Emily V. Gordon, who wrote the script with him. Mr. Nanjiani, 39, plays a gently tweaked version of himself, a Pakistani-American standup comedian and Uber driver; Emily (Zoe Kazan) is a therapist-to-be who heckles him — in a flirty, endearing way — during one of his sets. The relationship seems doomed from the start, seeing as how Mr. Nanjiani’s family expects him to marry a nice Pakistani woman, a fact he somehow neglects to mention to his new girlfriend. When Emily becomes ill and is placed in a medically induced coma — again, from real life — things come to an unexpectedly funny head. Seeing a Pakistani-American comic secure the romantic lead in a Hollywood film would be a rare delight under any circumstances. But what makes “The Big Sick” all the more remarkable is how little fuss is made of it. In the film, we see Kumail and his family eating and laughing and goofing off, fighting and (after a spell) making up, just like the actor’s real family. It’s a vision of a Muslim family, Mr. Nanjiani notes, rarely seen in American film. “You just don’t see Muslims being matter-of-fact Muslim,” he said. “They’re always defined by their Muslim-ness. We’re either terrorists, or we’re fighting terrorists. I remember seeing ‘True Lies’ and going, why are we always the bad guys?” When Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Gordon first began working on the film five years ago, they envisioned a personal yet relatable film inspired by improbable events. But then came the 2016 presidential election. Not only has Mr. Nanjiani since become known for his political views, taking to Twitter to criticize Mr. Trump’s abortive Muslim ban and making national news after a confrontation with Trump supporters, but audience reactions have also changed. In the Trump era, a simple tale about a Muslim immigrant falling in love with a girl in a coma is anything but. “When we started it, it was an important part of the movie, this experience of an immigrant in America,” said Judd Apatow, a producer of the movie. “What it’s turned into is an important representation that there are a billion people out there who are much closer to what we’re like than we are led to believe.” "

Lower readings on the index suggest less concern among investors. The index briefly dipped below 10 this week, the first time in more than 10 years, since before the financial crisis. (Its historical average is roughly 20.) It seems that investors are holding onto the prospect of improved wages, investment and economic growth.

Presidents often find themselves in our city, but their reasons and objectives have shifted throughout modern history, said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University. Here are a few: Homecomings. During the 19th and 20th centuries, presidential visits were often hometown trips, Professor Naftali said, since several politicians — Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt — sprang to the White House from their New York power bases. Global attention. As the homecoming trips waned, the creation of the United Nations, which was formed in 1945 and moved into its Manhattan headquarters a few years later, attracted presidential attention. “The U.N. ensured that presidents would come to the city,” Professor Naftali said.

During the 1970s and ’80s, presidents didn’t come to New York to celebrate the city’s values and successes: “It was used as a backdrop of despair, of the America that had lost its way.” "

It owns stakes in Hilton Worldwide Holdings and in the technology distributor Ingram Micro. And, as of Wednesday, it is the biggest shareholder in Deutsche Bank. HNA Group, a secretive Chinese conglomerate with ties to the Communist Party in Beijing, has emerged as a major global deal maker. But what, exactly, is HNA Group? Here is a rundown. The company was founded in China in 1993 as Hainan Airlines, in the southern island province of Hainan, with help from the local provincial government. It has since expanded considerably into several industries, and now has more than $90 billion in assets. HNA has been on an acquisition streak in recent years, broadening beyond airlines to invest in tourism, logistics and financial services. Since the beginning of 2016, it has struck deals to acquire Ingram Micro; a quarter of Hilton Worldwide Holdings, the hotel company; Carlson Hotels, owner of the Radisson and Country Inns & Suites chains; Gategroup, a Swiss airline catering business; and about a quarter of the American investment arm of the British-South African insurer Old Mutual. HNA is not a state-owned enterprise in the way that China’s banks, airlines, telecommunication companies and other pillars of the economy are. But its political pedigree runs deep. For more than a decade, HNA’s chairman, Chen Feng, has been a member of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a group of more than 2,000 that meets every five years to help determine party leadership. HNA’s ownership is murky — one major shareholder lists his address as a shabby apartment building in Beijing. The company has benefited from sizable loans from state-backed lenders and counts the son of a former top political figure as a business partner: In 2008, according to Chinese corporate records, it formed a venture with a firm that was part of a group led by a son of He Guoqiang, who was then the Communist Party’s powerful discipline chief. HNA is not just politically connected in China. Its name has also come up in the political scene in the United States. The Chinese company agreed in January to buy SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm owned by Anthony Scaramucci, a flamboyant former campaign fund-raiser for Mr. Trump who was set to be a White House liaison to business. When Mr. Scaramucci was turned down for the liaison job, one of the issues raised was the sale of SkyBridge to HNA. Because the transaction will probably take several months, questions were raised over potential conflicts of interest. At the time, HNA described the deal as giving it a crucial entry into the American market for its asset management business. "

Stories From the Long Road to Freedom
By Condoleezza Rice
Illustrated. 486 pp. Twelve. $35. “I have watched,” Condoleezza Rice says in the opening pages of her important new book, “as people in Africa, Asia and Latin America have insisted on freedom. … As a child, I was a part of another great awakening: the second founding of America, as the civil rights movement unfolded in my hometown of Birmingham, Ala., and finally expanded the meaning of ‘We the people’ to encompass people like me. … There is no more thrilling moment than when people finally seize their rights and their liberty.” Such a vision, Rice argues in “Democracy: Stories From the Long Road to Freedom,” is what should shape the mission of American foreign policy in the 21st century. This view, more widely held in the Democratic than in the Republican Party, has been eclipsed in recent years by disappointments in countries ranging from Ukraine and Rwanda to Egypt and Turkey, but Rice is a keeper of the flame. Her faith in the benefits and strategic importance of democracy promotion is as strong as, or stronger than, it was when she joined the George W. Bush administration in 2001. Rice’s continuing defense of the democracy agenda will be much noted among Republicans seeking to come to terms with the implications of President Trump’s “America First” approach to the world. She is one of the country’s most distinguished and widely respected diplomats. As hard-line advisers like Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld lost influence with President Bush in the years following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Rice as secretary of state in the second Bush term emerged as the single most influential voice shaping foreign policy. Trained as a Russia specialist, she got her first real experience in government as part of President George H. W. Bush’s team, which helped bring the Cold War to an end. The decisions made in those years would shape American policy for the next generation. With the Soviet Union out of the picture, the United States did not withdraw from the wider world. Instead, it doubled down on a policy of global engagement, seeking to build what some in the first Bush administration called a “new world order,” based on the global extension of democracy and liberal capitalism. Despite their differences, the next three presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, worked within this overall framework; only with the inauguration of Donald Trump would the United States have a president who challenged this bipartisan perspective. This early in the Trump administration, we cannot predict whether or how the president will convert his campaign rhetoric about “America First” into a foreign policy that challenges or reshapes America’s post-Cold War foreign policy. What we do know, however, is that the ambitious, wide-ranging goals of the world-order project have never been as popular with voters as they were with the foreign policy and journalistic elites. Since 1992, when voters rejected George H. W. Bush for Clinton, who was critical of Nafta and free trade with China on the stump, through 2016, when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the less globalist candidate has won the key presidential elections. George W. Bush ran in favor of a “humbler” foreign policy and attacked “nation-building” against the global agenda of Vice President Al Gore. Obama was seen as promoting a less assertive and less expensive foreign policy in 2008 than John McCain, and in 2012, the Obama team mocked Mitt Romney’s warnings that Vladimir Putin was America’s leading geopolitical foe. The results of the 2016 election make democracy promotion perhaps the most endangered element of the “new world order” agenda. Free trade has powerful defenders in the corporate world; democracy promotion is strongly supported by nongovernmental organizations — some of which, like the National Endowment for Democracy, receive government funds that could be at risk. “Democracy” is Rice’s attempt to hammer home the idea of democracy promotion as a key goal for American foreign policy. This heartfelt and at times very moving book shows why democracy proponents are so committed to their work, but also indicates why so many others are skeptical. "
1439,A Republican Primary Conundrum: How Far to Run From Christie,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/nyregion/a-republican-primary-conundrum-how-far-to-run-from-christie.html?searchResultPosition=99,2017/05/03,NEW YORK,"ROCKAWAY, N.J. — The political postcard that landed recently in New Jersey mailboxes appeared routine: piling on the Christie administration as “failed” and tying the lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, to the “wrong direction” of the state’s fortunes. In campaign season, such attacks against Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, arrive at a frequent clip. But this mailing was paid for by a fellow Republican seeking to succeed Mr. Christie: Assemblyman Jack M. Ciattarelli. “People would say to me you’re being critical and I would say I’m only being honest,” Mr. Ciattarelli said of his campaign’s language in an interview before an event here. “I’m a citizen first, and when I think an administration or a governor or a president has gotten it wrong, I think it’s important to speak up.” With less than 40 days to go before the Republican primary for governor, the two Republican candidates vying to replace Mr. Christie are gauging how best to navigate their relationship with a member of their own party who has close ties to the president but is also among the least popular governors in state history. Ms. Guadagno is leading in early polling — a new poll from Quinnipiac University released on Wednesday showed the lieutenant governor at 23 percent among likely Republican voters, compared with 12 percent among the same group for Mr. Ciattarelli in the Republican primary. And on Wednesday she picked up the endorsement of the comedian Joe Piscopo, who had been publicly flirting with a run for governor, but decided against it and instead endorsed Ms. Guadagno. But Mr. Christie’s record low approval figures will make it challenging for any Republican to win, and the Democratic Party favorite, Philip D. Murphy, was leading Ms. Guadagno 50 percent to 25 percent in a two-way contest in Wednesday’s poll of likely New Jersey voters. The poll carried a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points. "

Presidents there need to balance the demands and challenges of China, its biggest trade partner; the United States, its principal ally; and North Korea, a hostile rival with a growing stockpile of nuclear weapons and missiles. But the election this year on May 9, just over a month after the country’s ousted president, Park Geun-hye, was arrested on corruption charges and days after an American missile-defense system was activated, comes with an additional twist: President Trump. The American president has sent mixed signals about his approach to the Korean Peninsula. He has supported the deployment of the antimissile system, which has angered China, but he has also said South Korea should pay for it. He has said American warships were steaming toward the region, only for it to emerge that they were not. And he has questioned the sanity of Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, but also called him a “smart cookie” with whom he might be willing to meet. Here’s a look at South Korea’s three leading presidential candidates and how they might approach Mr. Trump. Moon Jae-in, 64, a human rights lawyer, leads the latest polls by a wide margin. A former student activist, he also served in the government of his friend Roh Moo-hyun, who was president from 2003 to 2008. "

Ravel’s “Bolero,” at once martial and sensual, wrapped the crowd in its sinister embrace, the atmosphere laced with menace. The audience murmured in the dark, expectant, awaiting deliverance. It came in a carefully orchestrated burst of bright lights and radiant chords. The far-right presidential candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, strode onto the stage, beaming. The symbolism was obvious. The darkness enveloping the hall, and France, could lift. Darkness and light: For most of her career, ever since Ms. Le Pen, now 48, broke into the political spotlight 15 years ago as the daughter and defender of the National Front’s patriarch, Jean-Marie, her path has been defined by their interplay. “She busted the TV screen wide open!” he once admiringly told an interviewer of that moment. To her admirers, she still does. Her speech before an adoring crowd of thousands in Nice last week juxtaposed the threats posed by immigrants, Islam, globalization and banks with her fierce will to crush them. And sometimes her words also offered a shaft of light. “My dear compatriots, I’m not interested in your race, your origin, your sexual orientation,” she said. “What interests me is your happiness.” Now a global figure, a far-right populist who has threatened to bring down the European Union, Ms. Le Pen is at the threshold of power as France prepares for the final round of voting for president on Sunday. Her odds, judging by the polls, are long. But even if she does not succeed against the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, Ms. Le Pen is likely to be a powerful fixture of French politics for years to come. She is a political veteran, a fierce debater and perhaps the ablest campaigner in the entire French political spectrum. "
1442,Making Sense of the Philippines,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/books/newsbook-philippines.html?searchResultPosition=79,2017/05/03,BOOKS,"The Philippines was the United States’ first experiment in colonization, and though the Asian archipelago became a fully independent nation in 1946, the two countries have continued to share strong diplomatic ties. Though criticism of the Philippines’ current president, Rodrigo Duterte, by the Obama administration caused a temporary rift in relations, tides may be turning. President Donald Trump has reached out to Mr. Duterte, even extending an invitation for him to visit the White House. Many human rights advocates view the move as an endorsement of Mr. Duterte’s violent crusade in the Philippines, where over 7,000 people suspected of using or dealing drugs have been killed by the police and citizen vigilantes since Mr. Duterte took office in June 2016. This would not be the first time the United States has supported an authoritarian leader in the Philippines. In WALTZING WITH A DICTATOR: The Marcoses and the Making of American Policy (1987), Raymond Bonner draws on dozens of interviews and thousands of previously classified United States government documents to investigate why not one but several American presidents — from Lyndon B. Johnson to Ronald Reagan — supported Ferdinand Marcos, the dictator who ruled in the Philippines from 1965 until 1986, even as his regime grew increasingly reprehensible. The book, which reveals that the United States knew Mr. Marcos would declare martial law in 1972 and even offered its support, is not devoid of opinion; there is a tenor of outrage as Mr. Bonner attempts to decipher the administrations’ decisions. It makes worthwhile reading for its thorough account of those years. For a more contemporary look at Philippine politics, one might turn to ILUSTRADO (2010) by Miguel Syjuco. Ostensibly about a fictional Syjuco’s quest to investigate the death of his invented mentor, Crispin Salvador, who is found dead in New York’s Hudson River, “Ilustrado” incorporates commentary on the political climate in the Philippines during the early aughts. As the fictional Syjuco sets out to find Salvador’s final and lost work, an amalgamation of 20 years of research that unravels the “cronyism” and “corruption” of the Filipino elite, news clippings are woven in — including a fictional interview with the Paris Review in which Salvador says, quite plainly, that politicians in the Philippines “should be presumed guilty until proven innocent,” implying that even the most saintly politicians may be hiding a corrupt streak.

But the company continues to face stiff headwinds on the print side. Print advertising revenue fell 18 percent, driving a 7 percent decline in total advertising revenue for the quarter. The company said that its digital advertising revenue rose 19 percent, to $50 million, in the first quarter, which ended in late March. It also added 308,000 net digital-only news subscriptions — the most of any quarter in its history — helping to propel an 11 percent increase in circulation revenue. The Times counted nearly 2 million digital-only subscriptions for its news products; including subscriptions to its crossword product, it has 2.2 million total digital-only subscriptions. Over all, the company reported total revenue of $399 million for the quarter, up 5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016. Its net income was about $13 million, compared with a net loss of roughly $14 million in the same period a year ago. “Print advertising remained tough,” Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The Times, said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “But it is a testimony to just how far our business has already transitioned towards digital that this steep decline did not stop us from growing our total revenue significantly in the quarter.” "

In a secluded barn just west of Fresno, the evidence of killing was everywhere — a weight scale, a blood-spattered wall, a wooden fighting ring and dozens of mutilated, dead roosters. When sheriff’s deputies arrived a couple weeks ago, roughly 100 people scattered, driving off or running through nearby fields. The deputies arrested four men, charging them in connection with an illegal cockfighting ring. Cockfighting, an ancient blood sport, pits roosters against one another in gladiatorlike combat to the death. It’s been banned in California since 1905. Yet many locations, concentrated heavily in the Central Valley, still raise roosters for fighting, said Eric Sakach, a senior law enforcement specialist for the Humane Society of the United States. Since late last year, news reports have provided accounts of cockfighting operations in Corcoran, East Palo Alto, Santa Maria and Fontana. "
1445,Health Care Fantasyland,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/opinion/health-care-fantasyland.html?searchResultPosition=93,2017/05/03,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Why is the Republican Party having a Groundhog Day experience on health care, with its House leaders continuing to push for a bill only to go through the same cycle of having their own members rebel? Because top Republicans still aren’t willing to grapple with reality. They have spent years pretending that it’s easy to fix the health care system and lying about both Obamacare and their own proposals. They’re still doing it. I found it particularly sad to watch Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, stoop to offering the same kind of obvious untruths as President Trump regularly does. On Tuesday, Ryan insisted — with no factual basis — that the new bill would protect the sick. “Politicians always stretched truth & cherry-picked facts,” the economist David Rothschild tweeted yesterday. “But very concerning that career politician, Speaker of House, just flat out lies.” This past weekend, President Trump gave an unintentionally revealing interview to CBS’s John Dickerson that I recommend reading if you didn’t already watch. In it, Trump displays no grasp of the mechanics of health policy and instead repeats a series of nice-sounding promises, most of which are simply false: “The health care bill is going to help my supporters.” “Pre-existing conditions are in the bill.” “We’re going to have lower premiums.” “This bill is much different than it was a little while ago.” Evidently — and unfortunately — you can win elections by making up your own facts about health care, among other things. But it’s hard to pass a bill based on fiction. And it will be even harder to pass the bill through the Senate, if it somehow makes it through the House. Health policy, like most of life, involves trade-offs — between helping the sick and the healthy, the young and the old, the rich and the poor, and even between benefiting doctors and patients. Just about every politician tends to downplay these trade-offs, but Trump, Ryan and some of their colleagues go further and conjure fairy tales involving easy fixes and no hard choices. So far, at least, enough members of Congress have refused to play along to prevent the bill from passing. Here’s hoping reality continues to prevail. On the same subject, I recommend Paul Krugman’s recent column, employing a balloon-and-box analogy, if you haven’t already read it, as well as Jonathan Cohn and Jeffrey Young, both in HuffPost, and Sarah Kliff in Vox.

Sure enough, the shake-up came. It just turned out to involve his advisers at Fox News. The president likes to begin and end his days with a stimulating dose of cable news, especially the warm embrace of Fox. So when Bill O’Reilly reportedly sexually harassed his way out of the No Spin Zone, there were repercussions beyond ratings. Mr. Trump had lost one of his best TV friends. But the new prime-time Fox News lineup, which debuted on April 24, offers the president and his base something better than friendship: a steady stream of enemies. Tucker Carlson is a stylistic departure from Mr. O’Reilly, whose 8 p.m. time slot he inherited (after taking over 9 p.m. from Megyn Kelly in January). Mr. O’Reilly cultivated a salt-of-the-earth personal myth, flogging his “working class” upbringing, for instance, though his father was an oil-company accountant. Mr. Carlson is more fleur-de-sel-of-the-earth. Graced with the prep-school diction of a heel from a 1980s college comedy, he’s leaned into a smirky, confrontational persona since the days of CNN’s “Crossfire.” But to assume the audience has to want to have a beer with Mr. Carlson to like “Tucker Carlson Tonight” is to misunderstand cable news and American politics.

They were both born to privilege. They both possess boundless self-confidence. Each seeks advice from a select inner circle, ignoring the big bureaucracies of his government. Mr. Trump, not known for his effusive praise of world leaders, has talked up their relationship, saying in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” last weekend that his relationship with China was “already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we’ve ever had.” He called Mr. Xi “a man that I’ve gotten to like and respect.” But beneath the bonhomie, Chinese analysts say, fundamental differences of strategic interest are likely to undermine any personal ties Mr. Trump says he has forged with the Chinese leader. The romance, they say, may be more a short marriage of convenience. Mr. Trump’s public effusiveness is barely reciprocated in China. The state-run media accords Mr. Trump polite coverage, much more so than it did President Barack Obama — a signal that the government, for the time being, would like the Chinese people to view the American president in a positive light. Among foreign policy experts, however, there is skepticism that Mr. Trump’s flattery of Mr. Xi, and his reliance on the Chinese leader to bear down on North Korea over its nuclear program, will bring the results he wants.

The two Republican lawmakers had come out against the health care legislation, warning that it did not do enough to protect the sick, but they threw their support behind it on Wednesday. President Trump blessed Mr. Upton’s proposal at a White House meeting with the two lawmakers as he pressed hard for a vote that could at least ensure House approval of the bill, which embodies one of his central campaign promises. The vote Thursday will carry enormous potential consequences — for millions of patients, for Mr. Trump’s legislative agenda and for Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who has failed twice in recent weeks to bring the bill to the House floor. The measure faces a wall of opposition from health care providers, patient advocates and retirees, and has been derided by many Senate Republicans, who are all but certain to reject vast portions of it should it clear the House. But clearing the House is a necessary step to keep alive the Republican promise — seven years in the making — to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. "

Fairooz, 61, of Bluemont, Va., said she was undeterred. “We’ll face the music when we get to that,” she said. A two-day trial in District of Columbia Superior Court in Washington ended on Tuesday. All three had pleaded not guilty, rejected a plea deal and demanded the trial. In verdicts returned shortly after noon Wednesday, the jury also convicted two other activists in the group she was with, Tighe Barry and Lenny Bianchi, who were dressed as Ku Klux Klan members with white hoods and robes and stood up before the Jan. 10 hearing started. In an April court filing, the office of the United States attorney for the District of Columbia had argued that all three protesters shared a common goal to “impede and disrupt” the hearing. Ms. Fairooz, the office said, had “created a scene.” "

The action sent Puerto Rico, whose approximately $123 billion in debt and pension obligations far exceeds the $18 billion bankruptcy filed by Detroit in 2013, to uncharted ground. While the court proceedings could eventually make the island solvent for the first time in decades, the more immediate repercussions will likely be grim: Government workers will forgo pension money, public health and infrastructure projects will go wanting, and the “brain drain” the island has been suffering as professionals move to the mainland could intensify. Puerto Rico is “unable to provide its citizens effective services” because of the crushing weight of its debt, according to a filing on Wednesday by the federal board that has supervised the island’s financial affairs since last year. The total includes about $74 billion in bond debt and $49 billion in unfunded pension obligations. While many of Puerto Rico’s circumstances are unique, its case is also a warning sign for many American states and municipalities — such as Illinois and Philadelphia — that are facing some of the same strains, including rising pension costs, crumbling infrastructure, departing taxpayers and credit downgrades that make it more expensive to raise money. Historically, Puerto Rico was barred from declaring bankruptcy. In the end, however, financial reality trumped the statutes, and Congress enacted a law last year allowing bankruptcy-like proceedings. Puerto Rico has been in a painful recession since 2006, and previous governments dug it deeper into debt by borrowing to pay operating expenses, year after year. For the last two years, officials have been seeking assistance from Washington, testifying before stern congressional committees and even making fast-track oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court.

Mr. Xi’s outreach to Mr. Duterte appeared to be part of efforts by the Chinese to woo a longtime American ally and strengthen their sovereignty claims in the South China Sea. Chinese news media said North Korea and other issues were discussed in the phone call. On Saturday, Mr. Trump, surprising his own staff, telephoned Mr. Duterte and invited him to visit the White House. Mr. Trump’s gesture was widely condemned over concerns about human rights abuses in the Philippines carried out under Mr. Duterte’s auspices. In a sign of lingering tensions between the two countries, Mr. Duterte later said he might be too busy to make the trip. In Mr. Xi’s follow-up to Mr. Trump’s overture, he pledged to deepen ties with the Philippines and called the country a “friendly neighbor,” according to Chinese news media reports. Mr. Xi also said Manila would be an “important partner” in his plan to invest in infrastructure overseas. The remarks were in line with China’s recent attempts to capitalize on tensions between the United States and the Philippines and draw Mr. Duterte’s government closer with promises of economic aid. But they also appeared to be a way of thanking the Philippines for not provoking China over disputed South China Sea islands claimed by both countries. "

County Republican leaders in New York concluded during a conference call over the weekend that Mr. Dietl did not have enough support among their ranks to get a so-called Wilson-Pakula certification that he needed to run as a Republican. Without the party, his chances of mounting an effective challenge against Mayor Bill de Blasio in November’s election seemed severely damaged, if not doomed. Mr. Dietl, who is not a registered member of a political party, appeared to have harmed his candidacy during a Republican candidate screening last week when, in the final minutes, he compared a state judge to Mr. de Blasio’s wife; both women are black. “Bo Dietl is not going to be on a major party line,” Adele Malpass, the chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party, said on Tuesday. “He proved he’s having trouble transitioning from being a celebrity to a serious candidate. We have other people running who have proven track records who can take on Bill de Blasio.” Party leaders had been intrigued by his name recognition, ability to draw news media attention and capacity to tap well-heeled donors. Ultimately, his unscripted style, which is reminiscent of President Trump, was apparently not the right fit for the party as it tries to defy the odds in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.

The Fed, as expected, did not raise rates on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. But it remains likely to raise rates in the coming months. • The Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate in a range from 0.75 percent to 1 percent. • Officials are not worried about the slow pace of growth during the first three months of the year. The Fed said the slowdown was “likely to be transitory,” meaning it expects a rebound. • The Fed remains on course to raise rates at least two more times this year. Investors expect an increase at the Fed’s next meeting, on June 13 and 14. The government estimates that the economy grew at an annual pace of just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, and prices continue to rise more slowly than Fed officials would prefer. But the Fed, in a statement issued Wednesday after the meeting of its committee, said the economy’s engine was still looking good, even if the car was moving a little slowly. "
1454,"Trump, Bullish on Mideast Peace, Will Need More Than Confidence",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/middleeast/mahmoud-abbas-trump-white-house.html?searchResultPosition=84,2017/05/03,MIDDLE EAST,"WASHINGTON — Ever since Britain declared 100 years ago that there should be a Jewish homeland in Palestine, harmony has eluded that dry, benighted land. Presidents and kings and prime ministers and diplomats and special envoys have labored for a century in a futile search for peace. President Trump, however, is not daunted by the challenge of bringing together Israelis and Palestinians. “It’s something that, I think, is frankly maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years,” he said on Wednesday. Whatever else may be said of him, Mr. Trump does not suffer from a confidence deficit. As he hosted the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. Trump proclaimed that he would be the president who finally makes peace in the Middle East. “We will get this done,” he said. He even suggested that, with his leadership, “hopefully there won’t be such hatred for very long.” Never mind that he also thought repealing and replacing his predecessor’s health care program would be “so easy.” Or that he predicted he would have no trouble bending North Korea to his will, or forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall. Then there was Mr. Trump’s assertion as a candidate that he knew more about the Islamic State than the generals. And his insistence that he could “fairly quickly” pay off the entire $19 trillion national debt accumulated over the last 182 years. Braggadocio, of course, has been at the center of Mr. Trump’s persona for decades, and arguably helped make him into a swaggering celebrity real estate tycoon and reality television star with enough appeal to win the presidency. In the White House, though, it has historically been more problematic. Presidents who make bold predictions often come to regret them. All Mr. Trump would have to do is ask those who, for decades, have banged their heads against the Middle East brick wall. “When the president says we’ll do this deal, he thinks in terms of a one-off real estate deal,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator who spent years trying to bring Israelis and Palestinians together. “And while that’s partly true,” the specific issues dividing Israelis and Palestinians “transcend the ‘art of the deal’ in ways I’m not sure he can now even begin to imagine.” "

Based on the dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood, Hulu’s TV adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale” is one of the year’s most acclaimed shows. The series, which was renewed for a second season, begins after a religious totalitarian regime has taken over what used to be the United States. Because of environmental toxicity, very few women are able to carry healthy babies to term; those who can are forced into reproductive slavery as “handmaids,” assigned to the wealthy and powerful. The series’s fifth episode is now available on Hulu, with new episodes available each Wednesday. Before you head back to the Republic of Gilead, catch up on our writing about the show, from interviews with its creators to individual episode recaps. (This article updates as new episodes are released.) ‘“The Handmaid’s Tale”’s Closing Songs Are Slyly Genius’ “By the end of each episode,” writes Jen Chaney in Vulture, the urge to rebel against an oppressive system “has built up to such an intense degree that it must be released. Since the characters can’t do the releasing, the music steps in to handle the job.” She takes a look at the songs featured at the end of the first four episodes and speculates on the meaning of each. ‘“The Handmaid’s Tale” Treats Guilt as an Epidemic’ “What makes someone complicit — in a crime, in a moment of violence, in a slow-moving atrocity?” asks Megan Garber in The Atlantic. The totalitarian Republic of Gilead was built by many moments of “small complacencies,” she writes, which the handmaids themselves perpetuate in the cathartic but violent Salvaging ceremonies. Guilt is a powerful emotion. "

Trump’s warm words as candidate for President Vladimir V. Putin, the Kremlin anticipated a starring role as foreign policy partner No. 1 under the Trump administration. Instead, while President Trump has been feting every Theresa, Justin and Abdel Fattah at the White House or at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, including a high-profile dinner with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Putin has had to content himself with three measly telephone calls since the inauguration. “They feel slighted,” Vladimir Frolov, a prominent foreign policy analyst and columnist, said of the Russian leadership. For one thing, it looks bad at home. Mr. Putin, after all, sold Russian interventions in Ukraine and especially Syria as proof that Moscow was back on the global stage as the indispensable equal to the United States in world affairs, just as in the Soviet days. Second, it has left the Kremlin perplexed as to how it can move forward in its relations with Washington, especially as Russia slouches toward a presidential election campaign in March 2018, although Mr. Putin has not yet officially declared his candidacy for a fourth term. Worse, instead of heralding a new chapter in relations, Washington seems to be piling on the demands. Even anticipated friends like Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state awarded a medal by Mr. Putin when he was head of Exxon Mobil, have proved disappointing. "

Unlike other countries, Australia explicitly favors Christians, even though they are a minority of those seeking refuge. The Australian experience is a case study for Europeans grappling with an influx of refugees and for Americans considering the long-term implications of the Trump presidency: When Muslims are demonized, state-directed prejudice is more likely. Data I obtained through Australia’s freedom of information law shows that 78 percent of the approximately 18,563 refugees from Syria and Iraq granted entry from July 1, 2015, to Jan. 6 of this year identified themselves as Christian. This figure is significantly out of proportion to Christians’ presence among the region’s displaced peoples. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees puts the number of registered Christian refugees from Iraq at around 15 percent. The figure for Syria is just under 1 percent. Australia’s conservative coalition government has never denied that religion is an important factor in choosing who will be admitted from Syria and Iraq. The favoritism is justified by the claim that Christians are more at risk from the Islamic State and other groups that engage in indiscriminate murder. "

It is unusual but not unprecedented for a leader of one European country to express support for a like-minded candidate in another. In 2012, Ms. Merkel drew sharp criticism from the center left in Germany after backing President Nicolas Sarkozy, who eventually lost to the Socialist candidate, François Hollande. The stakes in this year’s French election are even higher, with the fate of the European Union potentially in the balance. Ms. Merkel made her preference clear in an interview with the Kölner Stadt Anzeiger newspaper published in Cologne. “It is and of course remains the decision of the French voters, in which I am not interfering,” she said. “But I would be pleased should Emmanuel Macron win, because he stands for a consistent, pro-European policy — that I will say too.” Ms. Merkel, who heads the center-right bloc in the German Parliament and faces elections in September, when she will be seeking a fourth term, added that success for Mr. Macron “would be a positive signal for the political center, which we also want to keep strong here in Germany.” In a speech on Wednesday to business leaders attending a forum ahead of the Group of 20 meeting in July, Ms. Merkel continued to push the theme that isolation was not the way forward in the global economy. The message seemed clearly directed at Britain and the United States. "

Clearly he didn’t either. “I’m sorry,” he began his monologue Monday night. “I try not to get emotional.” But he was — his voice immediately caught in his throat — as for 13 minutes he laid out the story of how his newborn son, Billy, was born with heart defects and nearly died. Mr. Kimmel was not the first late-night wiseacre to give a speech about a heart and find his own. In 2000, David Letterman returned to the air after bypass surgery and paid a humane, spellbinding tribute to the professionals who saved him. In retrospect, it was the beginning of Mr. Letterman’s late-career phase, when he moved from prankster to raconteur. I can’t tell you if this is the start of something different for Mr. Kimmel. But it was something different to watch. First because Mr. Kimmel’s story was so raw, grateful and — but for the occasional wisecrack — sincere. Then because he turned from his own story to the current debate over who gets access to this kind of miraculous care, and how. Mr. Kimmel doesn’t try to get emotional. He also, generally, doesn’t try to get political. He unloaded on Donald J. Trump at the Oscars, but night by night he hasn’t bird-dogged politics like Stephen Colbert, or played catch-up on it like Jimmy Fallon. "

The angry commentary, attributed to a writer named Kim Chol and carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday, came as President Trump was pressing China to increase the enforcement of sanctions against its neighbor to contain its nuclear and long-range missile programs. “One must clearly understand that the D.P.R.K.’s line of access to nukes for the existence and development of the country can neither be changed nor shaken,” the commentary said, referring to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s official name. “And that the D.P.R.K. will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China, risking its nuclear program which is as precious as its own life, no matter how valuable the friendship is.” It is unusual for the state news media of North Korea to issue such a direct criticism of China, which accounts for 90 percent of its external trade and provides almost all of the country’s oil imports. “China should no longer try to test the limits of the D.P.R.K.’s patience,” the commentary said, adding ominously, “China had better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of the D.P.R.K.-China relations.” A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, sounded conciliatory when asked about the commentary at a regular news briefing on Thursday. “China’s position on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula is consistent and clear, and so is our position on developing good-neighborly and friendly relations with the D.P.R.K.,” Mr. Geng said.

But Mr. Trump’s stops — in Saudi Arabia, Israel and Rome — are equally revealing as a contrast to the first trip to the Middle East made by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. The stark differences between that trip, in June 2009, and Mr. Trump’s later this month speak to how the world has changed in the last eight years and how this new president plans to confront it. “Tolerance is the cornerstone of peace,” Mr. Trump said at a ceremony at the White House, in which he said he would go to “Saudi Arabia, then Israel, and then to a place that my cardinals love very much, Rome.” Mr. Obama also traveled to Saudi Arabia in June 2009, but not to Israel. The centerpiece of his trip was a landmark address to the Muslim world at Cairo University in the Egyptian capital. Mr. Trump’s aides said nothing about a speech, suggesting that the president would mainly transact his business with leaders behind closed doors. White House officials said foreign leaders would be more willing to help the United States if disagreements over human rights and other issues were aired in private. They cited the recent release of an Egyptian-American aid worker detained in Egypt, which was negotiated in quiet talks with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. “Obama’s approach was to build support with the Arab public through his Cairo speech,” said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution. “Trump’s approach is to deal with the Arab leaders, not speak to their people, which is much more comfortable for the leaders.” "

At first, you could not even believe it existed — a two-and-half-acre underground factory in the middle of the theater district, from which hundreds of thousands of inky newspapers emerged every day. The factory closed in 1997. The fantasy will endure. A month ago, I found myself in a space once occupied by portions of Press P-15, Press P-13 and Press P-10.

1464,Google Agrees to Pay Italy $334 Million in Back Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/technology/google-italy-tax.html?searchResultPosition=31,2017/05/04,TECHNOLOGY,"When it comes to the huge profits of American technology giants, Europe wants a slice of the cake. Google on Thursday became the latest company to agree to pay back taxes, in this case 306 million euros, or $334 million, to the Italian authorities for its operations in the country from 2002 to 2015. Under a similar agreement in late 2015, Apple agreed to pay Italy €314 million in back taxes. But Apple and the Irish government are appealing a separate €13 billion tax charge levied by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, which said the company owed more tax on its businesses in Ireland. As European lawmakers grapple with how much tax technology companies should pay on their overseas operations, industry executives are considering repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars under the Trump administration’s proposed “tax holiday,” which would shrink the current levy of 35 percent, before deductions, on such income. American multinationals now hold an estimated $2.6 trillion overseas, most of it from tech companies’ global operations, and a reduction in the tax rate could inspire them to return a sizable amount of cash to the United States. While changes to the tax system are at an early stage in Washington, some European policy makers worry that funds returned to the United States would allow American companies to avoid paying their fair share of tax in Europe, an accusation that tech industry officials reject. Despite this potential sour point between the United States and Europe, politicians worldwide have joined forces to revamp the global tax system as a way to make multinational companies pay more tax on their foreign operations and restrict the transfer of profit to low-tax havens like Ireland and Bermuda. On Thursday, Google confirmed that it would pay the back taxes to Italy, on top of what it already paid during 13 years of operations through 2015. Last year, the search giant handed over 130 million pounds, or $168 million, in a similar settlement with the British tax authorities, although critics said the clawback should have been bigger. Attention is now likely to turn to an investigation by the French tax authorities that could lead to a bill this year of more than $1 billion for Google. The company says that it has paid its fair share in France, but that it is cooperating with the inquiry. "

We have a fantastic relationship, I love Australia, I always have,” Mr. Trump told reporters who witnessed a portion of the meeting between the two wealthy, iconoclastic, deal-making politicians in a room near the ship’s main dining area. The two attended a dinner aboard the Intrepid, now a museum docked in the Hudson River, to honor the 75th anniversary of the strategic victory of the United States and Australia over Japan in the Battle of the Coral Sea during World War II. Their earlier encounter, an acrimonious first phone call in February, was spoiled by Mr. Trump’s hostile reaction to a deal with Australia that President Barack Obama negotiated in the final weeks of his second term. In it, the United States agreed to take in as many as 1,250 refugees that Australia was holding at offshore detention centers. During that call, Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement would hurt his new administration politically, officials said at the time. The president said on Twitter after the phone conversation that the deal was “dumb” and that he would study it, raising concerns that the United States might back out. "

In 2004, voters approved Proposition 71, a bond measure amounting to $6 billion with interest, which created a stem cell agency to help fund research. It was in part a response to limits on federal funding for stem cell research imposed by the government over concerns about destroying human embryos. Campaigners at the time suggested the research could yield cures for afflictions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and cancer. The measure passed with 59 percent in support, and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, based in Oakland, was born. "

But a first visit back to New York is still a first visit, and hundreds of protesters responded to a day that was, for them, weighted with meaning far beyond what actually happened. President Trump, a New York City product whose identity is as woven into the place as the steel rebar in the buildings that bear his name, was, for the first time since taking office in January, back in town. The protests on Thursday were muted in comparison to those of the throngs who had gathered outside Trump Tower on many nights after the election. Some attributed the lower turnout to the president’s change of schedule; others, to apathy, a loss of energy after Mr. Trump’s absence. Those who showed up outside the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum watched and shouted as the president’s motorcade passed and turned into the aircraft carrier complex. Mr. Trump was originally scheduled to spend a total of six hours at multiple stops in Manhattan, arriving around 3 p.m. and meeting Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia in the Peninsula Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The president was then expected to make a homecoming at Trump Tower, a little over a block away. Finally, he, his wife, Melania Trump, Mr. Turnbull and his wife, Lucy Turnbull, were to attend a black-tie reception and dinner aboard the Intrepid in honor of veterans of the Battle of the Coral Sea, in which the United States and Australia fought side by side against the Japanese in May 1942.

First published in 1949, a year after Leopold’s death, it chronicled and celebrated the natural life amid the changing seasons around his scruffy weekend retreat and family farm, in a dirt-poor region of Wisconsin that starts an hour’s drive north of Madison, the state capital. The area is still dirt-poor, particularly once you get away from the honky-tonk tourist attractions and water parks surrounding the Wisconsin Dells. The nearest big city is Milwaukee, more than 150 miles away. O’Hare airport, in Chicago, is four hours by car; so are the Twin Cities. It’s not exactly the first place that comes to mind when one thinks of building a world-class golf resort. But nestled near the tiny towns of Rome and Nekoosa, about 100 miles from Madison, hidden away for decades under vast rows of red pine trees planted to produce pulp, was something extraordinary: a stunning section of the exposed sandy bottom of a prehistoric glacial lake that, geologists say, flooded a large area of central Wisconsin about 18,000 years ago, when an ancient ice dam collapsed. Mike Keiser, who made a fortune in the greeting card business, is known to avid players for creating the golf mecca Bandon Dunes on the Oregon coast, a long 250-mile drive from Portland. He found his way to this equally far-off-the-beaten-path spot in Wisconsin in 2013. It lacked the year-round playing possibilities of places like Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Scottsdale, Ariz., and the picturesque seaside locale that Mr. Keiser had considered essential to luring golfers away from home, but he fell in love with the place anyway. What the land had, in spades, was immense tumbling dunes, some 50 feet high or more. And the potential, once the nonnative trees were cleared, of becoming home to not just one but four or five spectacular courses. The firm, sandy fairways, long open views, and exposure to strong winds would evoke the famous links of Scotland and Ireland and pay direct homage to the less well-known but well-loved “heathland” courses outside London. Mr. Keiser bought 1,700 acres from a tree plantation owner. He commissioned the golf design team of Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw, a former touring pro, to create a new course, to be known as Sand Valley. It opened last week. I’ve managed to play at some of Wisconsin’s better known public-access golf courses, including Erin Hills outside Milwaukee, where the United States Open will be held in June, and Whistling Straits, along Lake Michigan, which anchors the Kohler luxury resort complex. It is one of four courses, all designed by Pete Dye, that offer a rare combination of links-style and parkland golf within proximity of one another. "

At an open-air rally in Harrisburg, Pa. on Saturday that was timed as a counterstrike to the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, Trump pounded home his core message — that no matter what he does and no matter what Washington tries to do to him, he and he alone is on the people’s side. “A large group of Hollywood celebrities and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation’s capital right now,” Trump said. Looking out at his audience, with its Make America Great Again caps and its Deplorable Lives Matter T-shirts, Trump made the contrast between his people and Washington’s even more direct: His goal, of course, was not only to ally himself with the crowd against the black-tie-wearing media celebrating at the Washington Hilton, but to goad and troll his opponents. Many liberal Democrats think that Trump’s taunting rhetoric will soon wear thin. According to this view, as decent jobs increasingly demand college degrees, as automation continues to decimate manufacturing employment and as voters lose key benefits of the liberal welfare state (pared down health coverage under a new Republican program, for example), support for Trump will fade away. “Trump campaigned as a champion of rural America and small and midsize Rust Belt cities, but — much like his proposed Obamacare repeal — his budget brings the hammer down on the very people who put him in office,” Tim Murphy wrote on March 16 in Mother Jones.

1474,What to Watch For: Turnbull’s First Meeting With President Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/world/australia/turnbull-trump.html?searchResultPosition=42,2017/05/04,AUSTRALIA,"■ Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia is in New York preparing to meet President Trump for the first time since they had a testy phone call in January. The meeting on Thursday is the highlight of Mr. Trump’s first trip back to New York since he moved to the White House in January. ■ The two leaders are scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. New York time at the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan before heading to the U.S.S. Intrepid, a decommissioned aircraft carrier, for a reception dinner to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, in which the United States and Australia fought Japan during World War II. ■ Here is a taste of what to expect: Mr. Turnbull flew to New York on a Royal Australian Air Force plane, arriving Wednesday evening. It’s a “flying visit” for the prime minister, who’ll be back in Australia late on Saturday, he said, in time for Tuesday’s release of the country’s federal budget. The reception dinner on the Intrepid is being hosted by the American Australian Association, and the guests of honor will include veterans from the Battle of the Coral Sea, both American and Australian, as well as other notable figures. Mr. Trump and Mr. Turnbull are expected to make remarks. “People with big, big business interests on both sides of the Pacific will be there,” said Simon Jackman, chief executive of the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney. The visit marks the 75th anniversary of what Mr. Turnbull called the “great turning point” in World War II, when the United States Navy and the Royal Australian Navy together turned back a Japanese invasion force headed for Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Above all, he said, they would be honoring “that rock-solid alliance between Australia and the United States.” "

She had looked at her phone, and her eyes widened at a piece of news just then ricocheting around the art world, that Thomas P. Campbell, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for eight years, had resigned under pressure amid budget and leadership problems. “I don’t have any idea what the circumstances are,” Ms. Phillips said, “but, look, no matter what, it’s just a very hard job.” And she should know: At 63, Ms. Phillips has been running an art museum in New York longer than anyone except Glenn Lowry at the Museum of Modern Art (she took over in 1999, he in 1995.) She is one of only two directors in the city who has overseen the construction of a brand-new building (the New Museum’s unorthodox Bowery home, opened in 2007; Adam Weinberg, at the Whitney Museum of American Art, opened his new building in the meatpacking district two years ago.) And she is now in the midst of an $80 million capital campaign to double her museum’s size, a project notable at least so far for its sotto-voce nature, in sharp contrast to the expansion Mr. Lowry is overseeing, which has involved the widely criticized razing of the former home of the American Folk Art Museum. “Even with the expansion, it’s not about bigger being better, which has become the reflex position,” she said. “Yes we need space. But it’s more about using the space and the money we raise to think about what the museum needs to become in the 21st century.” She added: “The concept of soft power has become a bit of a cliché, I guess. But it’s the way I’ve always thought about what I do, and I think it’s the way this museum has made a difference.” "
1477,"In French Elections, Alt-Right Messages and Memes Don’t Translate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/technology/french-elections-alt-right-fake-news-le-pen-macron.html?searchResultPosition=50,2017/05/04,TECHNOLOGY,"The digital call to arms came shortly after the first round of the French presidential election. On an online message board frequented by extremists in the United States, an anonymous user last month urged others to bombard social media sites in France in support of Marine Le Pen, the far-right French candidate, by using memes, hashtags and other digital tricks that they successfully employed during last year’s American presidential election. Within days, the online thread — and similar discussions across the internet — was flooded with hundreds of users in the United States offering to help the digital campaign. But the American tactics have not translated overseas. Despite such efforts, the far right in the United States and elsewhere has so far failed to reach much of the French electorate ahead of the country’s vote this weekend, according to a review of social media activity done for The New York Times. The analysis, which was based on a review of millions of Twitter messages related to the election since last summer, showed that more than one-third of posts linked to certain political hashtags originated from the United States, although few went viral in France. “There’s a big cultural gap that these groups have to jump over to expand their message,” said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank, who has studied the far right’s recent efforts in France. “The language and iconography of the alt-right is pretty specific. Most of it just isn’t going to translate well.” The French presidential election is the latest front in the digital assault by the American far right or alt-right, a diverse and loosely connected group of internet-based radicals who have garnered attention by using memes — online satirical photographs with often biting captions — and other tactics to further their views worldwide. The activists, a combination of white supremacists, anti-Semitic campaigners and other far-right types, were closely linked to the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, although the extent of their influence remains unclear. Their efforts have fallen flat in France, with memes often written in English and extremist photos and images that do not resonate with the French electorate. American-style fake news and other digital misinformation have also failed to gain traction in France, where its own domestic issues and ways of campaigning still dominate. The muted response in France could portend a similar response by voters in Britain and Germany when they head to the polls later this year in their own national elections. "
1478,2017 Could Prove to Be a Turning Point for Plug-In Hybrids,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/automobiles/wheels/plug-in-electric-hybrid-automobiles.html?searchResultPosition=27,2017/05/04,WHEELS,"Until recently, if you wanted to ditch your gas guzzler and go electric, there were few choices. You could take the high road and opt for a $70,000 luxury vehicle, like the Tesla Model S, or take the low road and choose a more modest commuter, like the $31,000 Nissan Leaf. But this year, all that appears to be changing. Over 40 new electrified vehicles are coming out this year in the United States, according to Baum & Associates, a research firm. Models include the Honda Clarity electric sedan and a Chrysler Pacifica minivan. Even the tiny Smart Fortwo line will abandon gas entirely in the United States in favor of all-electric powertrains. More important, say automakers, there promises to be a proliferation of plug-in hybrids similar to the Chevrolet Volt. Plug-in hybrids can drive in electric mode or use gas when the battery runs down. This technology is proving flexible enough for a variety of vehicles from sports cars to compacts — and it eases the consumer fear that a driver will run out of power before finding a charging station. More and more, plug-in hybrid models will go head-to-head with different versions of the same car. The current Kia Niro, for example, a hybrid that relies on a gas engine and braking to recharge its battery, will compete later this year with a plug-in hybrid sibling, with similar features and amenities including luggage space — and with a price to match, around $23,000. “We want to be price-neutral for the consumer,” said Steve Kosowski, long-range strategy manager for Kia Motors America. “When you walk into the showroom, it should be, why wouldn’t you buy this one?” Some of the pricing parity relates to economies of scale. “Battery prices have decreased by 70 percent over the last six years,” said Simon Mui, a director at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

1479,Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski of ‘Morning Joe’ Are Engaged,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/business/media/morning-joe-engaged.html?searchResultPosition=25,2017/05/04,MEDIA,"Speculate no more. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the co-hosts of “Morning Joe” on MSNBC whose off-air relationship had been the source of rumors, are now engaged. An MSNBC spokeswoman confirmed the engagement. In an interview in Vanity Fair, the couple described how their relationship evolved. “Over the past year and a half, I realized I had to face these feelings and that it was time to stop putting them in a box,” Ms. Brzezinski told the magazine. “It was not an easy process and it was not an easy set of decisions for either of us. It was something I couldn’t deny anymore.” Mr. Scarborough, who has been married twice before, told Vanity Fair he thought he would “never, ever do this again in a million years.” “Then it occurred to me that with us working together and being live on the air every day for three hours that we were forced, no matter what disagreements we had, what misunderstandings we had, to work through it and get right with each other by 5:59 a.m.,” he said. They have hosted the morning show together since 2007, but they spent most of that time in other relationships. Mr. Scarborough divorced his wife in 2013, and Ms. Brzezinski split with her husband in December 2015. The couple had never publicly discussed their romantic relationship. The closest they came was in April, when Mr. Scarborough told The Hollywood Reporter that “we have a crackling on-air chemistry, and a crackling off-air chemistry, too.” According to Vanity Fair, President Trump offered to host the wedding at the White House or at Mar-a-Lago, and even to officiate the wedding himself. “The mental picture is just fascinating, but the reality is just … no. No, no, no, no, no,” Ms. Brzezinski said. "
1480,Don’t Take the Senate for Granted on Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/opinion/obamacare-repeal-senate.html?searchResultPosition=11,2017/05/04,OPINION,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. After the House passed a cruel and unpopular health care bill on Thursday, many people (including me, I’ll confess) immediately began talking about the likely effects on the 2018 midterms. Smart political observers believe that Republicans just increased their odds of losing House control, which would be a very big deal. But there is plenty of time later to worry about the 2018 midterms. The focus now should be on the Senate. If 50 senators (plus Vice President Mike Pence, who breaks ties) vote for a bill anything like the House bill, it would do great damage to the country. It would harm people who suffer from a wide range of health conditions, including birth defects, cancer, diabetes and just about every other disease — including many people who are perfectly healthy today but could one day fall sick. The bill would also transfer billions of dollars from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy, who are doing just fine already, thank you. So as disappointed as people might be about the House’s vote — and as eager as they might be to start the 2018 campaign — another project needs to take priority. The same groups and individual citizens, across left, center and right, that helped shine a light on the House health care bill, delaying its passage and making it so unpopular nationwide, need to shift their attention to the Senate. If every Democratic and independent senator votes against the bill, three Republicans would also need to do so to defeat it. It would be a big mistake to take for granted the result in the Senate. It would be akin, Politico’s Matthew Nussbaum noted, to the overconfidence that people felt after Donald Trump won the Republican presidential nomination. As impressive as the activism around the House bill was, it ultimately fell short — and there are now some signs of exhaustion. My advice: Take a little time to study up on the dynamics in the Senate. Think about what you can do to prevent 24 million Americans from losing health care. And remember that making phone calls or attending events is a lot more effective than merely posting to social media. For overviews of health care in the Senate, check out Perry Bacon Jr. of FiveThirtyEight and Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News. Topher Spiro of the Center for American Progress is worth following on Twitter, where he often makes detailed suggestions about how people can get involved. And for a rundown of what’s in the bill and whom it could hurt, read this Times editorial. "
1481,"Review: Revisiting the Mystery of Julian Assange, in ‘Risk’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/movies/risk-review-julian-assange-laura-poitras.html?searchResultPosition=12,2017/05/04,MOVIES,"“Risk,” Laura Poitras’s new documentary, was first shown at the Cannes Film Festival last May and has been updated since then. Even so, it feels unfinished in a way that is at once fascinating, frustrating and entirely understandable. The story Ms. Poitras has to tell is still unfolding, and opinions about the person at its center — the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange — continue to evolve. Much of the film casts a weirdly nostalgic spell, as it transports the audience back to a recent moment in history that nonetheless seems very far away. From 2010 to 2013, when most of the interviews in “Risk” were conducted, Mr. Assange emerged as a glamorous and controversial figure, a media-savvy and politically astute champion of radical transparency dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct. WikiLeaks, which specialized in the highly publicized release of huge troves of classified documents and communications, challenged governments and journalistic conventions. The organization and its allies seemed to be on the vanguard of a global movement toward openness and democracy, enabled by digital technology and fueled by the idealism and skepticism of an army of hackers. Things look different now. The connotations of the word “hacker” have darkened, and so, perhaps, have perceptions of the digital future. This is partly because the political and media context — and indeed the apparent direction of history — have changed dramatically. Remember Barack Obama’s first term? Remember the Arab Spring? Remember social media before the trolls and fake-news hucksters took it over? “Risk” will take you back, briefly, to that era. It is possible to imagine circumstances — a different result in the 2016 presidential election, say, but not only that — in which this movie would be a more or less straightforward prequel to “Citizenfour,” Ms. Poitras’s Oscar-winning documentary about Edward J. Snowden. That film is in a sense tucked inside “Risk,” as Ms. Poitras abruptly leaves London, where she met with Mr. Assange, for Hong Kong, summoned by a message from an anonymous whistle-blower who will turn out to be Mr. Snowden. She sees less of Mr. Assange after that, and you get the impression that he was not altogether pleased with the shift in the filmmaker’s (and the rest of the world’s) attention away from him. It would be simplistic to describe “Risk” as the chronicle of Ms. Poitras’s disillusionment with Mr. Assange. She is a discreet and careful observer, inserting herself into the story only when it might seem evasive to do otherwise and refraining from passing judgment on Mr. Assange. But any interesting portrait is necessarily the record of a relationship between artist and subject, each of whom is invested in controlling the outcome. And to some degree in spite of Ms. Poitras’s journalistic intentions — though very much as a consequence of her rigorous honesty — the picture that emerges is complicated, unsettling and intriguingly ambivalent.

1482,The Trumpcare Disaster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/opinion/obamacare-house-vote.html?searchResultPosition=13,2017/05/04,OPINION,"The House speaker, Paul Ryan, and other Republicans falsely accused Democrats of rushing the Affordable Care Act through Congress. On Thursday, in a display of breathtaking hypocrisy, House Republicans — without holding any hearings or giving the Congressional Budget Office time to do an analysis — passed a bill that would strip at least 24 million Americans of health insurance. Pushed by President Trump to repeal the A.C.A., or Obamacare, so he could claim a legislative win, Mr. Ryan and his lieutenants browbeat and cajoled members of their caucus to pass the bill. Groups representing doctors, hospitals, nurses, older people and people with illnesses like cancer opposed the bill. Just 17 percent of Americans supported an earlier version of the measure, and Republicans have made the legislation only worse since that poll was conducted. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Ryan seemed bothered by this overwhelming criticism of their Trumpcare bill, the American Health Care Act. They seemed concerned only about appeasing the House Freedom Caucus, the far-right flank of their party. Mr. Trump in particular has been spreading misinformation and lies about health care, arguing that the legislation would lower costs while guaranteeing that people with pre-existing health conditions could get affordable health insurance. It would do the opposite. Here is what the bill actually does: Takes a machete to Medicaid. The bill would cut $880 billion over 10 years from Medicaid, the program that provides health care to about 74 million poor, disabled and elderly Americans. That’s one-fourth of its budget. As a result, 14 million fewer people would have access to health care by 2026, according to a C.B.O. analysis of the earlier bill, which contained similar Medicaid provisions. The cuts would also hurt special education programs, which receive about $4 billion from Medicaid every year. Slashes insurance subsidies. It would provide $300 billion less over 10 years to help people who do not get insurance through employers and have to buy their own policies. This would hurt lower-income and older people the hardest. For example, a 60-year-old living in Phoenix and earning $40,000 would have to pay an additional $12,370 a year to buy a policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Many people who find themselves in this situation would have no choice but to forgo insurance. Eliminates the individual mandate. Many people hate that the A.C.A. requires people to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. But without the mandate, fewer younger and healthier people would buy coverage. This would lead to what health experts call a “death spiral” as insurers raise rates because they are left covering people who are older and sicker, leading to even more people dropping coverage. Eventually, companies could stop selling policies directly to individuals in much of the country. "

The shock in the postdebate commentaries, in print and across the airwaves, was revealing: France had never witnessed such a brutal political confrontation in real time. The consensus was that, far from being the knockout blow Marine Le Pen needed and many anticipated, the result was the opposite. The candidate of the far-right National Front had not improved her already difficult position against the centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron. With her sneering mockery of Mr. Macron, her tone and her use of epithets, she had revealed something essential about herself despite years of effort to soften her party’s image, in the view of commentators. “I was myself surprised, as she revealed herself as what is worst about the far right in France,” Gérard Grunberg, a veteran political scientist at the Institut d’Études Politiques, known as Sciences-Po, said in an interview. Even her own father, the National Front patriarch and founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, declared that she “wasn’t up to it” during the two-and-half-hour debate, though he still supports her. A poll taken immediately after for BFMTV found that 63 percent of viewers thought that Mr. Macron had carried the day. "

The F.B.I. actually completed that task several days before the election, but I’m sure that putting a few extra agents on the job could have gotten it done sooner, as the vast majority of the emails were instantly dismissible. It is tough enough for the rest of us to live with the consequences of his folly without having to listen to his absurd self-justification. HOWARD M. RICHARD, TUCSON To the Editor: I am willing to take James Comey at his word and accept that he believes he made the right legal and ethical decision when he notified Congress of the reopening of the Clinton email investigation. But nothing justifies the wording of his letter, which to both Hillary Clinton supporters and opponents suggested that a smoking gun may have been found in the newly discovered emails. Given that Mr. Comey fully understood the political implications of his letter, why did it not clearly state that nothing was meant to imply that the new material being looked at would result in a different conclusion? I also wonder why the possibility that he helped elect a president who is so manifestly unsuited for the office makes Mr. Comey only “mildly nauseous.” MICHAEL ESTEROWITZ, BROOKLYN To the Editor: Re “Clinton Attacks Trump as Struggling and Unprepared” (news article, May 3): Hillary Clinton need look no further than in the mirror to pinpoint the main reasons for her loss. Her decision to skew the thrust of her campaign to a select demographic, women and minorities, rather than to a broader, more diverse constituency was shortsighted. Furthermore, whether James Comey’s letter 11 days before the election was warranted or not, it was her foolish decision to use a private email server in the first place that brought the resulting investigation upon her. No amount of late-night humor or Donald Trump-bashing skits can ease the pain of those of us who, either enthusiastically or reluctantly, put our faith in her. However, the least I would hope for is that she not try to deflect the blame for what was primarily a self-inflicted failure. LLOYD BINEN, BAYSIDE, QUEENS "

It wasn’t necessarily over the idea that Mr. Comey tipped the race to Donald Trump by revealing shortly before Election Day that the F.B.I. was looking at new emails possibly connected to its Hillary Clinton investigation. It was over his use of the word “nauseous.” Or rather, misuse. According to The New York Times stylebook (and dictionaries, and the style guides of many other publications), “nauseous” is the property of making other people feel sick to their stomachs. A bad smell, for instance, could be nauseous. So too could be a sea voyage or a top law enforcement official’s actions in the days before the most consequential presidential election in generations. People on the receiving end, however, get “nauseated.” So, properly speaking, Mr. Comey should have been “nauseated” by his “nauseous” thoughts. It’s a distinction that has been drilled into countless English students over the years. But it’s a distinction that’s increasingly ignored. The language guide “Garner’s Modern American Usage,” for instance, says the swap of “nauseous” for “nauseated” is “becoming so common that to call it an error is to exaggerate,” though it adds that “careful writers tend to be sickened by the slippage.” So it’s probably inevitable that “nauseous” will one day completely take the place of “nauseated.” And that’s not so bad since English has a fine, if longer, word that says what nauseous in its strict sense does: “nauseating,” which frees up “nauseous” to take on new duties. One opinion writer, in fact, reacted to Mr. Comey’s use of “nauseous” in the way he meant it. “Mildly?” the Op-Ed columnist Andrew Rosenthal wrote. “He should be sick at heart, because there is no doubt that he affected the election, and it seems pretty obvious that he knew that he would do just that.” For now, that sense of “mildly nauseous” will surely remain in quotation marks in the news pages of The Times, or will be paraphrased into “nauseated.” And lexical sticklers — or at least the ones bitterly ruing Mrs. Clinton’s loss — might tell Mr. Comey that they find him a lot more than just mildly nauseous.

1488,Republicans Get Their Health Bill. But It May Cost Them.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-republican-health-bill.html?searchResultPosition=19,2017/05/04,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — In voting to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, House Republicans finally made progress on a key Trump administration goal and on a campaign promise that they have made for the better part of a decade — but at a potentially steep price. After failing to get the votes for an original replacement measure in March, Speaker Paul D. Ryan worked tirelessly to do what his predecessor, John A. Boehner, could not, bringing together his most conservative members and their moderate colleagues behind a piece of legislation laden with political peril. The victory may give momentum to the rest of President Trump’s agenda — particularly the arduous task of rewriting the tax code — and it helps restore Mr. Ryan’s reputation, at least for now. No longer is he the guy who speaks loftily about policy but cannot deliver results; now he has proved that he can produce the votes. His volatile relationship with Mr. Trump, too, may settle down for now. But by leaning on members to vote for a bill that many fear will leave millions of people unable to afford health care, Mr. Ryan has exposed moderate Republicans to withering political attacks. This is especially true in the roughly two dozen districts represented by Republicans where Hillary Clinton prevailed over Mr. Trump in November, but it is also the case in places where the Affordable Care Act’s popularity has been increasing. “If you’re in a very moderate-to-Democratic district — yeah,” said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, conceding the potential risk to Republicans. "

And he has prodded some companies into cooperating by calling them out on Twitter or in other public venues, or by pressuring them with his policies. Several tech companies have appeared to respond to Mr. Trump’s speech and actions around jobs in recent months. Asian companies including Alibaba and SoftBank have promised thousands of new jobs in the United States. In February, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip manufacturer, said it would invest $7 billion to finish a factory in Arizona, adding 3,000 jobs. This week, the pace of job announcements from tech companies surged. Infosys, a leading outsourcer based in India, said on Tuesday that it would hire up to 10,000 Americans to serve its clients in the United States. On Wednesday, the most valuable public tech company, Apple, said that it, too, was focused on job creation in the United States. The iPhone maker, which produces most of its devices overseas, said it was starting a $1 billion fund to foster advanced manufacturing and would make its first investment this month, write Katie Benner and Nelson D. Schwartz, reporters at The New York Times. “We can be the ripple in the pond,” Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, told CNBC about the new fund. “Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around — those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them, because you have a service industry that builds up around them.” "

In 2015, nearly 77 million Americans lived in places where the water systems were in some violation of safety regulations, including the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act, according to the report released on Tuesday from the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental advocacy group. It’s not only that some tap water has high levels of lead, nitrates, arsenic or other pollutants, said Mae Wu, a senior attorney with the council’s health program. It is that too often, a lack of reporting means residents cannot be sure whether their drinking water is contaminated or not. The issue is not new; tap water safety violations across the United States have been reported again and again and again. The new study is an attempt to tell the big-picture story, Ms. Wu said, as a backdrop to the piecemeal reports coming out of towns and cities across the country. These include the story of a sinkhole outside Tampa, Fla., which opened up in September, leaking contaminated water and endangering a major aquifer; Florida’s Department of Environmental Protection took weeks to notify nearby residents. Or Jim Hogg County, Tex., where thousands of people were exposed to high levels of arsenic in their drinking water for years, according to a report last year from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit group based in Washington.

Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. (Unfortunately, streaming information provided in our Watchlist listings applies only to viewers in the United States.) ‘Anvil! The Story of Anvil’
Starts streaming: May 1
Add it to your Watchlist Sacha Gervasi’s serio-comic documentary about a long-in-the-tooth Canadian heavy-metal outfit has been dubbed a real-life “This Is Spinal Tap” for several eerie similarities, including trips to Stonehenge and Tokyo and a drummed named Robb Reiner. But for all the laughs over quarter-filled venues and behind-the-scenes pomposity, “Anvil!” grows into a sad, poignant, and even inspiring portrait of men pursuing their rock ’n’ roll dreams well past the expiration date.
— ‘Belle’
Starts streaming: May 1
Add it to your Watchlist Inspired by a painting of Dido Elizabeth Belle, the mixed-race daughter of a Royal Navy officer and a slave, standing next to her aristocratic cousin, Lady Elizabeth Murray, “Belle” tries for both a complex study of social mores in 18th century England and an eye-catching period romance. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is immensely appealing and powerful as Belle and confusion over her character’s status makes a folly of the class system.
— ‘Big Trouble in Little China’
Starts streaming: May 1
Add it to your Watchlist John Carpenter’s affectionate goof on kung fu mythology dug a large hole for itself among critics and audiences back in 1986, but it’s been steadily clawing its way out in the years since. Through the story of a swarthy American truck driver (Kurt Russell, in full John Wayne mode) who gets mixed up in a mystical Chinatown turf war, Carpenter creates a glorious, lighthearted alchemy from the genre traditions of East and West.
— ‘Office Space’
Starts streaming: May 1
Add it to your Watchlist There’s not much plotting involved in Mike Judge’s cult comedy, which is about little more than a cubicle drone (Ron Livingston) who decides, one day, to stop doing work. But the accumulation of workaday details — the passive-aggressive boss (“Mmmm … yeah, that would be great”), the malfunctioning copy machine, territorial disputes over desks and staplers, “Hawaiian shirt day” — add up to a definitive portrait of white-collar drudgery in the late 20th century.
— ‘The Fault in Our Stars’
Starts streaming: May 1
Add it to your Watchlist Based on John Green’s YA novel, this romance between a plucky 16-year-old girl (Shailene Woodley) with terminal cancer and the sensitive boy (Ansel Elgort) she meets at her support group has the courage to play out a love story with a short, predetermined shelf life. Despite a few missteps — a trip to the Anne Frank house foremost among them — “The Fault in Our Stars” is earnest and affecting, with a built-in urgency that squeezes out the tears like a vise.

1493,"Trump’s Order on Religious Liberty Pleases a Few, but Lets Down Many Conservatives",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/us/politics/religious-organizations-executive-order-trump.html?searchResultPosition=24,2017/05/04,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON — President Trump signed his long-awaited executive order on religious liberty Thursday with a full-throated reassurance that he would protect the freedom of American believers. But the reactions of religious leaders across the country suggested that it instead promised freedoms many of them did not want — and failed to deliver concrete legal protections that conservatives had been led to expect. The centerpiece of the order is a pledge to allow clergy members and houses of worship to endorse political candidates from the pulpit, fulfilling a campaign promise that Mr. Trump repeatedly used to rally his most fervent supporters. Public opinion polls show, however, that neither the American public as a whole nor religious leaders in particular — even evangelicals, who voted for Mr. Trump in droves — think that partisan politicking by churches is a good idea. “I don’t actually know anybody who has endorsed or who wants to endorse a politician from the pulpit,” said Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, an umbrella group representing about 40 denominations and 45,000 churches. “My idea is that church is about teaching the Bible, it’s about discipleship and evangelism. It’s not about politics.” The order was also a stinging disappointment for conservative religious leaders who had expected that it would exempt their organizations from Obama-era regulations aimed at protecting gay people from discrimination. The executive order does not mention anything about relief for religious groups and charities that object to serving or hiring gay, bisexual or transgender people, and that were looking to Mr. Trump for legal cover. “In failing to deliver for people of faith, President Trump risks alienating the single constituency most responsible for his election,” said Brian S. Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, a group that has fought to stop same-sex marriage. “Quite strangely, he is rewarding L.G.B.T. extremists who strongly opposed his election.” "
1494,Tough Scrutiny at Borders,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/opinion/tough-scrutiny-at-borders.html?searchResultPosition=18,2017/05/04,OPINION,"To the Editor: “A Severe Reception at America’s Front Door” (news article May 2) is commendable for its careful refusal to ascribe tough scrutiny at United States borders solely to President Trump. While the behavior of some Homeland Security officers at entry points can be brusque, officious and wholly intrusive, the problem of what America has become for visitors and citizens alike is owed to misconceived laws that have reshaped us, not to those few people charged with border enforcement. A country with draconian security laws and increasingly unfriendly borders is no longer the America we and foreign travelers once knew and of which we could be proud. That this sad fact is reflected so assertively at our “front door” daily should be no surprise. RICHARD GILBERT, RHINEBECK, N.Y. "
1495,Senators Save the Empire,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/opinion/senator-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=45,2017/05/04,OPINION,"In the movie “Gladiator,” the Roman emperor Commodus storms back to his palace after paying a visit to the senate. In the senate, he bemoaned his father’s time spent at study and was quickly chided about his inexperience as other senators laughed. He angrily laments to his sister: “Who would deign to lecture me?” His sister tries to impress upon him the importance of the senate, but Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is not moved. He continues: “I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they will love me for it, and they’ll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men.” Commodus realizes that the one thing standing between him and his authoritarian impulses is the senate, its rules and its traditions, and he is furious about its constraints on his power. I have thought of this movie often since Donald Trump was elected, and this scene seems particularly relevant this week. The film is a work of fiction based on some historical figures, but it has some incredibly compelling parallels to what’s happening today in America. First, Commodus was indeed a real person — cruel and slipping into insanity, self-indulgent and despised, impetuous and thinking he was greater than he was. As historian Cassius Dio wrote, “This man was not naturally wicked, but, on the contrary, as guileless as any man that ever lived. His great simplicity, however, together with his cowardice, made him the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature.” "
1496,Way Too Many Trumps,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/opinion/too-many-donald-trumps.html?searchResultPosition=44,2017/05/04,OPINION,"Oh gosh, we’ve got another Trump. This has been very difficult, people. Every day concerned citizens put together their critique of the president’s policies, and before nighttime he’s a completely different dude. You remember the Somewhat Normal Republican Trump, who answers to both SNORE and SNORT, depending on his energy level at the moment. He mainly likes to repeal federal regulations — free mentally ill people to buy guns; don’t let a little clean water stand between coal owners and their yen to dump trash. Last week SNORT issued a tax reform plan that was classic G.O.P. in its extreme vagueness on how to pay for its multitude of cuts. (“Eliminate tax breaks for special interests.”) Then suddenly, out of nowhere, came Weirdly Liberal Trump (WELT). He mused about breaking up the big banks; special aide Ivanka plugged helping Syrian refugees. Liberal Trump even expressed interest in a gas tax hike to pay for infrastructure repairs. “It’s something that I would certainly consider,” he told Bloomberg News. The idea of a Republican administration, bound at the hip to the energy industry, championing a gas tax hike is a little stunning. It would, of course, pay for a ton of construction jobs, repair crumbling roads and bridges and be great for the environment. But I guarantee you Mike Pence would never bring it up. Perhaps we should rethink all that impeachment talk. Lately Congress has been in an uproar over health care, and House Speaker Paul (My Life Is Ruined) Ryan is going crazy trying to placate both sides on the matter of insurance coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. WELT wants to be the progressive hero. “Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be,’” Trump told CBS’s John Dickerson. That was shortly before Trump went off the handle when Dickerson asked about his claims of being wiretapped by Barack Obama. “I don’t stand by anything,” Trump said, unnecessarily, before he tossed Dickerson out of the Oval Office for pressing him on the matter.

1497,New York Today: Preparing for President Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/nyregion/new-york-today-preparing-for-president-trump.html?searchResultPosition=34,2017/05/04,NEW YORK,"Updated, 11:46 a.m. Good morning on this cloudy Thursday. He’s back. (Almost.) President Trump will arrive in New York later today for a dinner reception with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid. But his return is already being felt. Expect protests, increased security and temporary closings in the vicinity of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum at Pier 86 on 12th Avenue and 46th Street, and Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets. Plan for delays or rerouting of service on buses in those areas, even though the president will probably be in town for only a few hours before heading to his house in Bedminster, N.J., for the weekend. NYC Ferry and the New York Waterway may also have delays and temporary closures around Wall Street/Pier 11 starting around 3 p.m. Some good news: Subway, Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit riders should expect normal service. But that’s not the case for some local businesses. Manhattan Kayak, a school and sightseeing company on Pier 84, is recalling its watercraft at 3 p.m. and closing on orders of the Police Department, said the owner, Eric Stiller. "
1498,U.S. Investigates Work at Pacific Island Casino Project With Trump Ties,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/business/saipan-casino-illegal-chinese-workers-trump.html?searchResultPosition=47,2017/05/04,BUSINESS,"HONG KONG — Han Dong was operating a crane in China’s rust belt last August when he heard about a chance to make it big in America. Local recruiters told him he could make as much as $2,900 a month, or nearly four times the average wage in China — and could even eventually apply for an American green card. Instead, Mr. Han said, he ended up working on the construction site of a casino on Saipan, part of an American commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean, where federal officials are investigating working conditions at a project managed by Chinese construction firms. An American green card, which would allow him to be employed legally there or anywhere in the United States, no longer appears very likely. “They tricked us to come here,” Mr. Han said of the agents that transported him to Saipan, where he put up scaffolding for 12 hours a day in the tropical heat. Before the fees he paid out to middlemen to get hired, he made only half what he was promised, he said. The casino project in Saipan, an island about 3,700 miles west of Hawaii, illustrates a challenge for China, even as it throws an unusual look into the issue of undocumented workers on American soil. For China, high-profile regional construction projects are crucial to programs like President Xi Jinping’s “One Belt, One Road.” That program, which envisions economic development across the Asia-Pacific region led by China, would expand the country’s influence and demonstrate its construction and development know-how even as it provides a potential outlet for Chinese industrial overcapacity. So far, despite the promise of subsidies from China, One Belt, One Road’s progress has been slow — and being outed as an exporter of illegal construction workers to an Asia-Pacific neighbor does not help that agenda.

1499,Don’t Like Trump’s Bluster? Sometimes It Works.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/opinion/donald-trump-foreign-policy.html?searchResultPosition=46,2017/05/04,OPINION,"As President Trump ended his first 100 days in office last week, I found myself in China, a good place to judge how he has transformed the presidency’s bully pulpit. During the campaign, Mr. Trump denounced Chinese trade policies, saying he would not allow Beijing “to rape our country” any longer. In early April, when President Trump met President Xi Jinping of China at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., he continued the tough talk. He and his aides told the Chinese delegation that the administration would impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States if Beijing did not lower its barriers to American investments in China. It is too soon to tell whether the Chinese will change their policies. But there are signs that the president’s antagonistic approach has opened the door to strategic cooperation on one of the world’s biggest problems: North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. China already has suspended coal imports from Pyongyang in compliance with United Nations sanctions, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that China would impose more sanctions if North Korea continues its nuclear testing program. China’s foreign ministry spokesman said last week, “I can say in terms of solving the North Korean crisis, China’s efforts can’t be overstated.” There are also signs that Mr. Trump’s style is resonating with ordinary Chinese. Considering the harshness of his past statements about China, I was surprised by the number of people I met there who expressed respect for him. “He is a very successful businessman,” one said. “He is strong,” another said. One person noted, “I think in the past your country respected such people.” Apparently, the Chinese never took Mr. Trump’s campaign rhetoric personally. They saw it as his starting point — a “negotiating position,” as Mr. Trump himself might say. "
