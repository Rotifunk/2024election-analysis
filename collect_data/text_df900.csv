0,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s rift with the U.S. judicial system is deepening. He lashed out at a three-judge federal appeals panel that appeared skeptical of his order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, calling the hearing “disgraceful” and hinting that the judges were politically motivated. His nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, called the president’s attack on the independent judiciary “demoralizing” and “disheartening.” Mr. Trump also attacked the retailer Nordstrom, which is one of several retailers who have pulled away from his daughter, Ivanka Trump. _____ • The Daily: In today’s podcast, we listen in on the travel ban litigation and revisit the words of the novelist and essayist James Baldwin.

1,"A hearty cheer some 50 voices strong greeted the eight members of the Khoja family Tuesday night as they wheeled their luggage into the arrivals area of Kennedy International Airport. It came from volunteers of Rutgers Presbyterian Church on Manhattan’s Upper West Side who signed on to sponsor this family of Kurdish Syrian refugees months ago, only to find them caught up in a maelstrom of presidential politics, judges’ decisions and delays. The volunteers cried, and the Khojas could not stop smiling. “We heard that we can’t go to America and now we are here and we can’t believe our eyes,” Suzan Khoja, 28, said in breathless English. Ms. Khoja; her five siblings, ages 12 to 31; and her parents left Aleppo and had been living in Istanbul for a few years. Their arrival at Kennedy, just before an appellate court in San Francisco heard arguments about whether President Trump’s indefinite ban on Syrian refugees should be reinstated, was the dramatic end to 12 days fraught with confusion, deferred dreams and cautious hopes. “When the plane landed, I felt that now this is a reality,” said the patriarch, Mahmoud Khoja, 58. On the ground in the United States, the groups working to bring refugees in — often affiliated with churches and synagogues — had been going through their own whipsaw of emotions. Rutgers Presbyterian’s refugee task force put a typical New York spin on the crisis, turning to its high-placed contacts and deep pocket of donations to see if it could bring the family into the country despite the ban on refugees. The group enlisted several immigration lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union and human rights professors in Istanbul. Someone had a number for Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, but then learned that to go to Canada, the family would have to start the three-year application process again.

2,"WASHINGTON — In seeking to rent space in the 58-floor skyscraper that is President Trump’s home in Manhattan, the Defense Department is continuing a long tradition of finding a place close to the commander in chief for his top military aides — including the ones who carry the “nuclear football” of launch codes that follows the president everywhere. The Defense Department has regularly paid for space near temporary or part-time presidential residences, including near the Chicago home of President Barack Obama. Before that, the Pentagon placed a heavily secured trailer at the Crawford, Tex., ranch of President George W. Bush. But it is hard to put a trailer with the nuclear football right outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, officials say. Even so, a move into the Manhattan high-rise raises questions of taxpayer money going directly to Mr. Trump. The football — essentially the briefcase of nuclear codes and communications systems — follows the president wherever he goes, held 24/7 by a military aide who must be able to get it to him in minutes if necessary. Whoever is taking care of the nuclear football needs a place to sleep, close to the president. Thus, the need to rent space in Trump Tower, officials say. “In order to meet official mission requirements, the Department of Defense is working through appropriate channels in accordance with all applicable legal requirements in order to acquire a limited amount of leased space in Trump Tower,” Lt. Col. J. B. Brindle, a Pentagon spokesman, said statement. “The space is necessary for the personnel and equipment who will support the POTUS at his residence in the building,” he said, using an acronym for president of the United States. Since the military aide cannot move into the three-story apartment that Mr. Trump shares with his wife, Melania, and son Barron, that leaves looking to lease space elsewhere in the building. The Defense Department did not say how much it would pay for the space. Leasing agents say a floor in Trump Tower can rent for $1.5 million a year, but it was unclear whether the Pentagon would rent that much space. One possibility would be for the Pentagon to lease a condominium from a resident in the building who owns the space. Renting space from a president is not without precedent. The Secret Service paid Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. $2,200 a month to rent a cottage adjacent to his home in a Wilmington, Del., suburb. The Secret Service also has an arrangement in Trump Tower. Administration officials declined to comment on why the two agencies could not share the space.

Music students unexpectedly rushed the stage to join them in a soaring section of the Fifth Symphony, and incognito choristers popped up among the audience members to sing the Ninth’s “Ode to Joy.” But the high-energy concerts — part of a five-city American tour that concludes on Sunday in Boston — were briefly thrown into doubt by President Trump’s chaotically instituted travel ban. As the orchestra prepared to leave Hungary last week, it was informed that one of its cellists, a longtime Hungarian citizen, would not be allowed to enter the United States because he also held citizenship in Iraq, one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries named in the ban. Mr. Fischer — who has become known as a voice for tolerance and inclusion as his native Hungary has embraced nationalist and staunchly anti-immigrant policies under the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban — suddenly found himself having to make the case for openness to United States officials, whom he called to protest. “It struck a nerve in me, a very strong feeling that I will never allow anybody to single out a musician in my orchestra and disadvantage that person because of their origin, skin color, religion or any other factor,” Mr. Fischer said in an interview at his hotel on Tuesday. Mr. Fischer, 66, who is Jewish and lost grandparents in the Holocaust, said that he had often thought of Jewish musicians’ being singled out and removed from leading orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic, during the Nazi period, some being exiled and some killed. “Having learned this lesson,” he said, “I have a very strong determination not to allow that ever to happen.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/arts/music/budapest-festival-orchestra-triumphs-over-trumps-travel-ban.html?searchResultPosition=79

hen The New York Times decided to expand in Australia, a rift with the United States seemed about as likely as a 25-point Super Bowl comeback. Enter Donald Trump. You’ve probably already read about his phone call with Prime Minister Turnbull: the brevity of the exchange; President Trump’s rejection of a deal that would bring up to 1,250 refugees to the U.S. from Australia’s detention centers in Manus and Nauru. If you want to see who those refugees really are, watch this Times video, or just look at the photo above of Behrouz Boochani, a dissident from Iran. “Behrouz is intense when you first meet him,” said Ashley Gilbertson, the Australian photographer who shot this portrait on Manus island. “The intensity in many people wears off after first meeting — not Behrouz.” If you want more context, read Jane Perlez, writing from Beijing about how that combative call — along with Mr. Trump’s rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — threatens to push Australia closer to China.

5,"The arrival of documentary stars on the red carpet often brings a stiff blast of reality to the fairy-tale concoction that is the Academy Awards. One minute reporters are clamoring to chat up Bradley Cooper or ask J. Law about her dress, the next they are presented with a genocide survivor, a soldier ravaged by war, or a Congolese park ranger who risks life and limb to protect the last of an endangered species. If the red carpet doubles as a popularity contest — and it does — celebrities win, hands down. But this year’s batch of documentary makers and their subjects might find themselves in a brighter spotlight because of the increasingly heated political climate. Five of the 10 feature-length and short documentaries nominated for Oscars are directly or indirectly about refugees. Three of them trace the perilous paths of desperate migrants; a fourth is about Syrian rescuers who search for people buried alive in bombed buildings; and a fifth is about a Holocaust survivor who arrived on America’s shores seven decades ago. Several of the documentarians wanted to bring their subjects to the Oscar ceremony, but plans were upended by President Trump’s order banning travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. With the ban’s fate tied up in the courts, their attendance remains uncertain. So, the Bagger asked the filmmakers and a few subjects, too: Given the uproar over refugee issues fueled by the controversial ban, what would your message be if you found yourself on the Oscar stage?

6,"Was there a woman who didn’t recognize herself in the specter of Elizabeth Warren silenced by a roomful of men? The explosion of indignation, mockery and free publicity that greeted Tuesday night’s move to prevent Senator Warren from reading a letter about Senator Jeff Sessions written by Coretta Scott King resonates with so many women precisely because they have been there, over and over again. At a meeting where you speak up, only to be cut off by a man. Where your ideas are ignored until a man repeats them and then they are pure genius — or, simply, acknowledged. Being interrupted or ignored, and being one of the few women in the room, can be both inhibiting and enraging. You check your own perception: Was I being too aggressive, or did I really have a point? Is this about being a woman, or something else? Raising questions of a double standard, male Democratic senators including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jeff Merkley of Oregon later read into the record the very same letter that Senator Warren was reading when the Senate voted, along strict party lines, to ban her from further debate on the nomination of Mr. Sessions as attorney general. The firestorm came as liberal women have placed themselves in the vanguard of opposition to the administration of President Trump. Casting him as anti-woman, they cite the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, when Mr. Trump boasted of forcing himself on women; his comments that women who criticized him were ugly and overweight; a cabinet with four women in a sea of men; and policies including restricting access to abortion and contraception.

7,"Any parent who has had children in middle school is familiar with their teenage excuses. First, they complain that the teachers are mean and assign too much homework, then that the reading is boring, and then when all else fails, they give you that aggrieved look and whine, “It’s tooooo haaaaard.” The point is that whatever happens, it’s someone else’s fault. It’s annoying when it comes from a 13-year-old. When it comes from the president of the United States and his team, it’s downright terrifying. In a chilling article in The Times this week, Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman described President Trump’s Keystone Kops White House where aides meet in the dark because they can’t figure out how to use the light switches (setting them to “on” might be worth trying), and Trump wanders around his living quarters in his bathrobe watching CNN and obsessing about how mean everyone is to him. When his executive order putting Steve Bannon into the top circle of the National Security Council drew howls of protest, Trump got mad — because, Thrush and Haberman reported, he had not been fully briefed on the order before he signed it. Not fully briefed? Didn’t Trump think he should at least have a conversation about the ramifications of setting aside a seat in the Situation Room for a purely political aide with no known national security credentials? (And no, Bannon’s seven years as a junior Navy officer do not amount to national security expertise.) Did Bannon just write the order himself without telling Trump what was in it? Apparently there was not sufficient discussion of the anti-Muslim refugee and visa ban, either. Maybe the White House got overloaded with math homework or finding the light switches and couldn’t get to it. Nor was there time to discuss an order that gave the Central Intelligence Agency the power to go back into the “black site” prison business, or one that rolled back protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.

8,"Stephen Sondheim has been awarded the 2017 PEN/Allen Foundation Literary Service Award — making him the first composer-lyricist to win it. The prize is given annually to a “critically acclaimed writer whose body of work helps us understand and interpret the human condition,” according to PEN America’s news release. While the prize has mostly gone to novelists, including Salman Rushdie and Toni Morrison, Mr. Sondheim has made an undeniable impact on the last 60 years of culture by writing musicals including “West Side Story,” “Sweeney Todd” and “Company.” And the precedent for giving a literary award to a musical artist was strengthened last year, when Bob Dylan accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature. “Stephen Sondheim has really given voice to complex aspects of the human spirit: to nuance, to psychology, to inner voices,” Andrew Solomon, president of PEN America, said in a phone interview. “His work points to the significance of living a moral life, and that’s never felt more urgent than right now.” Mr. Sondheim will be honored by PEN on April 25 at the American Museum of Natural History, with Meryl Streep presenting the prize. She starred in the 2014 film adaptation of Mr. Sondheim’s “Into the Woods,” and received an Oscar nomination for her role. This weekend Mr. Sondheim’s work will be back on Broadway, with a revival of the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Sunday in the Park with George” starring Jake Gyllenhaal. And he’s working on a new musical inspired by the works of Luis Buñuel, tentatively slated to arrive at the Public Theater sometime this year. J. K. Rowling, the creator of the Harry Potter books, received the award last year; she spent part of her acceptance remarks defending Donald J.

9,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — A northern Syrian city that is one of the Islamic State’s last enclaves in the country is under assault by military forces bearing down from all sides. The complication is that the advancing forces — the Syrian Army and pro-government militias backed by Russia, and Syrian rebels backed by Turkey — are sworn enemies. Their simultaneous race to seize the city, Al Bab, has turned into a test of how a global realignment of powers supporting Syria’s antagonists could help reshape or end the nearly six-year-old conflict. Al Bab, which had roughly 100,000 people when the war began in 2011, is the last urban area held by the Islamic State west of its de facto capital, Raqqa, where the group remains entrenched. Russia and Turkey have swerved in recent months from outright hostility to working more closely in a diplomatic effort aimed at resolving the conflict, after fitful and repeated failures led by the United Nations and the United States. But in the battle for Al Bab, Russia and Turkey must transform their newfound understanding into results on the ground, with the ambitious goal of pushing their Syrian partners into de facto military cooperation. Otherwise they risk creating a new flash point. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/world/middleeast/battle-al-bab-syria-geopolitical-test.html?searchResultPosition=85

11,"Operators that organize trips to Iran have begun canceling tours citing difficulty in securing visas for American travelers in the wake of President Trump’s executive order barring citizens from seven majority Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. Though the order, issued on Jan. 27, has been blocked in a federal court, and citizens of the affected countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may resume travel, Americans may not be able to enter Iran as tourists for the next few months. Wilderness Travel, which is based in Berkeley, Calif., canceled its April and May departures after its Iranian counterparts advised the company that Iran is presently not issuing travel visas to Americans. “No visas will be issued for American citizens for the next 90 days, and it is not clear what will happen after that date,” Barbara Banks, the director of marketing and new trip development for Wilderness Travel, said in an email. “The increase of interest in travel to Iran had been a wonderful development; cultural exchange and understanding is the foundation for a peaceful world. We hope that this unfortunate situation will be resolved, and look forward to an end to the travel restrictions on both sides.” SmarTours, based in New York, had begun selling its first trips to Iran in January. It has canceled its initial July departure, but it hopes to begin monthly departures in August. “We are confident that we will be able to send lots of travelers to Iran in 2017,” Greg Geronemus, the co-chief executive of SmarTours, said in an email. “The strong push back from the judicial system in the U.S. gives us confidence that the executive order will not hold up, and our conversations with our partners in Iran clearly suggest that Iran will reverse its reciprocal ban once matters are settled in the U.S.” Abercrombie & Kent had scheduled four departures this year of its 12-day trip to Iran, with the first coming in May. The company has canceled the May trip, citing visa uncertainty. A company representative said most of those guests booked in May have expressed interest in a fall trip, and Abercrombie & Kent still plans to have departures in September and October. Other tour companies such as Intrepid Travel and Cox & Kings have said they will continue to offer Iran trips, which are popular with foreign travelers who are not American. Mir Corporation, a Seattle-based tour operator that has been guiding trips in Iran for nearly 20 years, has not canceled its small-group trips for spring continues to sell its fall departures . Until recent events, Iran was viewed by many travel companies as an emerging destination for American travelers keen to visit ancient ruins and ornate mosques.

12,"WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Sessions was confirmed on Wednesday as President Trump’s attorney general, capping a bitter and racially charged nomination battle that crested with the procedural silencing of a leading Democrat, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, survived a near-party-line vote, 52 to 47, in the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Mr. Trump strains to install his cabinet. No Republicans broke ranks in their support of a colleague who will become the nation’s top law enforcement official after two decades in the Senate. But the confirmation process — ferocious even by the standards of moldering decorum that have defined the body’s recent years — laid bare the Senate’s deep divisions at the outset of the Trump presidency. At the same time, the treatment of Ms. Warren, who was forced to stop speaking late Tuesday after criticizing Mr. Sessions from the Senate floor, rekindled the gender-infused politics that animated the presidential election and the women’s march protesting Mr. Trump the day after his inauguration last month. Mr. Sessions cast his final vote as a senator to note that he was present for Wednesday’s tally. His confirmation was met by applause from his colleagues, including a few Democrats, on the Senate floor. “I can’t express how appreciative I am for those of you who stood by me during this difficult time,” Mr. Sessions said shortly after the vote. “By your vote tonight, I have been given a real challenge.

This is a troubling time in America. Our democracy is being put to the test.

This reminded me that in the world’s first democracy, citizens of Athens gathered in huge numbers to laugh at Aristophanes’ biting satire of that city’s officials and notables. And, according to legend, when an actor playing Socrates made fun of the philosophic gadfly from the stage, the real Socrates rose from his seat and pointed to his own face to confirm that, indeed, the likeness was good. Maybe Mr. Trump can find a way to show the public and his celebrity impersonators that he’s a good sport and really understands how democracy works.

The world’s biggest tequila maker announced the price range for its stock offering on Wednesday, seeking up to 15.3 billion pesos, or $742 million, in proceeds. Factor in the “greenshoe,” Wall Street parlance for additional shares set aside to cover exceptional investor demand, and Cuervo is hoping to raise 17.5 billion pesos from its initial offering.

At the midpoint of that range, Cuervo is set to finally begin trading this week after having hired Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase last year to work on the deal. Since then, the company has had to weather volatility in the Mexican stock market, including turmoil that arose after Donald J.

The comedy scene today is so crowded and devoted to envelope-pushing that it’s easy to define it merely through the hot names of the moment. To watch this series is to remember — or, depending on your age, to be introduced to — earlier comics who were incendiary in their own way, in much less permissive times. The series is broken up by subjects, and Part 1 on Thursday night is devoted to ribaldry and raunchiness. An assortment of well-chosen current comics invoke the usual gods — Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor — as they talk about the storming of the censorship battlements, but they also note some less familiar figures. Those who know Redd Foxx only from his relatively mild 1970s sitcom, “Sanford and Son,” might be surprised at the snippets from the risqué comedy albums he was recording way back in the 1950s. The episode, which of course spends time on Carlin’s seven-dirty-words battle of the early 1970s, ends hilariously as some current comics — Sarah Silverman, Lewis Black, Penn and Teller, Patton Oswalt and more — try to list what the seven actually were. Turns out there are rather a lot more than seven. Next week’s installment, “The Funnier Sex,” traces the long struggle of female comics to be heard in the writers’ room and onstage. It, too, is full of archival material, well deployed to make clear just how stifling the environment was for a very long time and how bold the women were who broke through. Female comics today have acts full of audacious material, and the episode includes a delicious sampler, but the brashest line in the hour may come from Joan Rivers in an undated clip.

22,"WASHINGTON — As the Central Intelligence Agency was setting up its secret prisons overseas 15 years ago to interrogate terrorism suspects, a Defense Department unit was considering a proposal to establish a secret military prison abroad, according to previously undisclosed government documents. The proposal was presented in a 2002 memo written in part by Bruce Jessen, one of two psychologists who eventually helped create the C.I.A.’s “enhanced interrogation” program. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, recommended opening at least one secret overseas site where prisoners would be subjected to “constant sensory deprivation” and develop “ a profound sense of despair.” The military, though, did not act on the proposal for an “undisclosed non-U.S., unsuspected, secure location” to “hold, manage and exploit detainees.” The Department of Defense, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the extent to which the plan, which originated in the military’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was considered. Aside from sensory deprivation, the memo suggested that additional pressure tactics be permitted against prisoners, including those that “maximize cultural undesirability,” but it did not mention the brutal physical coercion techniques, such as waterboarding, later approved for use in the C.I.A. prisons. The memo is included among several government documents provided during the discovery process in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Spokane, Wash., against Dr. Jessen and the other psychologist, James E. Mitchell, by two former C.I.A. prisoners and the representative of a third man, who died in custody.

23,"WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family’s sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage — not his own family’s personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump’s products — a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores — the president took to Twitter to complain that “Ivanka has been treated so unfairly” by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then re-sent it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump’s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump’s products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the president’s tweet was not about business but about “an attack on his daughter.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/business/ivanka-trump-nordstrom-tj-maxx.html?searchResultPosition=99
24,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Calling California “out of control,” President Trump recently threatened to withhold federal funds from the state. In response, the State Senate leader, Kevin de León, said California was creating jobs faster than any state in the nation and paid more annually in federal taxes than it gets back. So what exactly do Californians get back per dollar paid in federal taxes? “There isn’t really a simple answer, unfortunately,” said Ann Hollingshead, a fiscal and policy analyst for the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. Part of the difficulty stems from the tangled web of money that flows between individuals, the state and the federal government. Perhaps the most cited figure comes from the Tax Foundation, a conservative group that found Californians got back about 78 cents in services per federal tax dollar paid in 2005. State analysts pointed out that the foundation’s figure is adjusted to include California’s share of the federal deficit. That, in effect, widens the gap between money out and money in.

After I used the phrase “must-read” in a recent column to describe Jonathan Chait’s work, a reader asked me which other journalists’ work I make a point of reading. It’s not a short list, and today I’ll add two names to it: David Frum, the former George W. Bush speechwriter who’s a senior editor at The Atlantic, and Ezra Klein, the founding editor of Vox. Yesterday, Klein published a column responding to Frum’s cover story in the current Atlantic. I highly recommend both. They revolve around what Frum calls “ominous indicators of a breakdown of the American political system.” The founders created a system in which Congress was supposed to act as the main check on the power of the president. But the polarization of politics, Frum writes, has meant that “Congress has increasingly become a check only on presidents of the opposite party.” I’d add that the radicalization of the Republican Party — playing games with the debt ceiling, refusing to consider a Supreme Court nominee, etc. — has made the problem especially acute with a Republican president. And Trump isn’t just any president. He is willing, even eager, to violate all kinds of long-held American values, threatening opponents, lying frequently and reveling in conflicts of interest.

26,"ISTANBUL — The mall was named for him. His name adorns signposts at the nearby metro station. It also looms from the sides of the twin skyscrapers that the mall sits beneath. Yet many of the diners, shoppers and store owners here at Trump Towers Istanbul on a recent evening could not quite believe that the complex — among the tallest buildings in one of the world’s largest predominantly Muslim cities — had anything to do with President Trump. Evin Sumeli, a 19-year-old training to be an anesthetist, was sitting down for a meal with her sister, Mizgin, 18, when she learned that Mr. Trump does indeed profit from the buildings. “O.K. — we’re leaving!” she declared. One floor below, Cigdem Turan, a cashier at a cosmetics store, was similarly surprised. “I actually asked people if he had anything to do with the building, but they said no,” said Ms. Turan, 25, who began working at Trump Towers early last fall. “My husband said it’s probably just a coincidence.” A coincidence, however, it is not. Technically, neither Mr. Trump nor the Trump Organization owns the property (or most of the other buildings featuring the Trump name outside the United States). But in 2010, Mr. Trump allowed the building’s Turkish owners, Dogan Holding, to brand it with his name, in exchange for a sizable fee. The total has not been disclosed, but campaign records show that by July 2015, Dogan Holding had paid Mr. Trump between $1 million and $5 million for the use of his name. It was the revelation of that deal that had the Sumeli sisters making for a premature exit. “Why should I respect a president who doesn’t respect my veil?” asked the younger Ms. Sumeli, who is studying child development. “We won’t be coming here again,” her elder sister added.

27,"WASHINGTON — The Trump White House is nearing completion of an order that would direct the Pentagon to bring future Islamic State detainees to the Guantánamo Bay prison, despite warnings from national security officials and legal scholars that doing so risks undermining the effort to combat the group, according to administration officials and a draft executive order obtained by The New York Times. White House officials have detailed their thinking about a new detainee policy in an evolving series of drafts of an executive order being circulated among national security officials for comment. While previous versions have shown that the draft has undergone many changes — including dropping language about reviving C.I.A. prisons — the plan to add Islamic State detainees to the Guantánamo population has remained constant. The latest version of the draft, which circulated this week, would direct Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to use Guantánamo to detain suspected members of “Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, including individuals and networks associated with the Islamic State.” The White House has kept similar language in the draft order despite warnings from career government national security officials that carrying out its plan would give federal judges an opportunity to reject the executive branch’s theory that the war against the Islamic State is legal, even though Congress never explicitly authorized it. The issue could arise when reviewing an inevitable habeas corpus lawsuit filed by an ISIS detainee. The Obama administration first argued in late summer 2014 that the Islamic State was part of the existing armed conflict that Congress authorized in 2001 against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But while the Islamic State got its start as Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq more than a decade ago, that theory is disputed because the two groups later split and went to war with each other.

28,"THE year was 2012. The place was Bowling Green, Ohio. A federal raid had uncovered what the authorities feared were the makings of a massacre. There were 18 firearms, among them two AR-15 assault rifles, an AR-10 assault rifle and a Remington Model 700 sniper rifle. There was body armor, too, and the authorities counted some 40,000 rounds of ammunition. An extremist had been arrested, and prosecutors suspected that he had been aiming to carry out a wide assortment of killings. “This defendant, quite simply, was a well-funded, well-armed and focused one-man army of racial and religious hate,” prosecutors said in a court filing. The man arrested and charged was Richard Schmidt, a middle-aged owner of a sports-memorabilia business at a mall in town. Prosecutors would later call him a white supremacist. His planned targets, federal authorities said, had been African-Americans and Jews. They’d found a list with the names and addresses of those to be assassinated, including the leaders of N.A.A.C.P. chapters in Michigan and Ohio. But Mr. Schmidt wound up being sentenced to less than six years in prison, after a federal judge said prosecutors had failed to adequately establish that he was a political terrorist, and he is scheduled for release in February 2018. The foiling of what the government worried was a credible plan for mass murder gained little national attention. For some concerned about America’s vulnerability to terrorism, the very real, mostly forgotten case of Richard Schmidt in Bowling Green, Ohio, deserves an important place in any debate about what is real and what is fake, what gets reported on by the news media and what doesn’t. Those deeply worried about domestic far-right terrorism believe United States authorities, across many administrations, have regularly underplayed the threat, and that the media has repeatedly underreported it. Perhaps we have become trapped in one view of what constitutes the terrorist threat, and as the case of Mr. Schmidt shows, that’s a problem. The notion of a “Bowling Green massacre,” of course, has been in the news recently. Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Trump, referred to it in justifying the president’s travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Ms. Conway had Bowling Green, Ky., in mind, but she eventually conceded there had been no massacre there. She meant, she said, to refer to the 2011 case of two Iraqi refugees who had moved to Kentucky and been convicted of trying to aid attacks on American military personnel in Iraq. One was sentenced to 40 years, the other to life in prison. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/when-the-government-really-did-fear-a-bowling-green-massacre.html?searchResultPosition=105
29,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — To the overnight editor at the Arab affairs website, it looked like big news: Kuwait, apparently following the lead of President Trump, had issued a visa ban on citizens from five other predominantly Muslim countries. The editor wrote an article, and the news rocketed through cyberspace. One link caught the eye of Mr. Trump himself, who shared it on his official Facebook page with a word of praise for the reported policy: “Smart!” But there was a problem: The Kuwait ban was from 2011, long before Mr. Trump announced a similar measure in the United States, said James Brownsell, the managing editor of The New Arab, the site that produced that article on Feb. 1. His writer did not notice that the news was years old. Many sites that often support Mr. Trump and also published the report, including Infowars.com and Russia’s Sputnik news agency, have since clarified that it was outdated and unrelated to Mr. Trump’s order. But by Tuesday night, his uncorrected posting had racked up more than 251,000 reactions, 68,000 shares and 15,000 comments, many by fans who see Kuwait’s supposed decision to follow Mr. Trump as a vindication of the president’s policy. “So you mean to tell me Muslims are banning Muslims from certain countries?” a user wrote under the name Christina Villar. “Then we have some Americans thinking our president is heartless.

30,"WASHINGTON — Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump’s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president’s criticism of independent judges “demoralizing” and “disheartening.” The remarks by Judge Gorsuch, chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation’s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings “disgraceful” and described the courts as “so political.” Those remarks followed Mr. Trump’s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a “so-called judge” whose “ridiculous” ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump’s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even “a bad high school student would understand.” “This is highly unusual,” said Michael W.

31,"There once was a time when the Cleveland Browns were settled at quarterback. Brian Sipe and Bernie Kosar were steady presences in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. Further back, Cleveland relied on the Hall of Famer Otto Graham for 10 seasons, and 10 championship game appearances. Those days are long gone. This week, the Browns released the 37-year-old Josh McCown, who started 11 games for them over the last two seasons. That ends yet another very brief quarterback era in Cleveland. Since the team re-formed in 1999, the Browns have started 26 quarterbacks, including two McCowns and someone named Spergon Wynn. And then there’s Johnny Manziel. Here’s a look at the team’s quarterback woes over the years. The Browns re-entered the N.F.L. hopefully, with the No. 1 overall draft pick Tim Couch as their quarterback. Couch started for four years, though he missed some time with injuries, which led to shots for Doug Pederson, now the coach of the Eagles; Ty Detmer; and, yes, Spergon Wynn. (The Browns lost the one game he started, 48-0, to the Jaguars.) Still, in 2001, Couch did start every game. No Browns quarterback has done so since. The team struggled at first, but managed a 9-7 season in 2002 and made the playoffs. They lost to the Steelers, 36-33. It turned out to be a high-water mark; they have not been back to the playoffs since.

It criticized Mr. Sessions’s record on civil rights and said that elevating him to higher office would demean the record of Mrs. King’s husband, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The letter resurfaced last month, when BuzzFeed News reported that Senator Strom Thurmond, a Republican from South Carolina who was then the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had failed to enter it into the Congressional Record. On the same day as BuzzFeed’s report, The Washington Post obtained the letter and published it online. Three decades ago, the letter was credited with helping to derail Mr. Sessions’s nomination.

He asked those present to pray with him “for our Rohingya brothers and sisters who are being chased from Myanmar and are fleeing from one place to another because no one wants them.” The pope urged Christians “to not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil, to overcome evil with good,” and added: “A Christian can never say, ‘I’ll make you pay for that.’ Never!

After a discussion between Curry and Plank, Under Armour released a statement Wednesday in an effort to clarify its chief executive’s remarks.

According to a statement from the White House on Wednesday, Ms. Niceta Lloyd, who is known as Rickie, will be immersed in overseeing all social events and gatherings, including state dinners and the White House Easter Egg Roll.

37,"Doctors and hospitals failed to tell the Food and Drug Administration about cases in which cancer was spread around inside women’s bodies by a surgical tool used to operate on the uterus, according to a report issued on Wednesday by the Government Accountability Office. Scattering cancer cells worsens the disease and decreases a patient’s chances of long-term survival. Because information was lacking, the tool, called a power morcellator, was widely used for more than 20 years before the F.D.A. acted to limit it, after being alerted to the problem in 2013 by a patient who was harmed. The device, with a spinning blade that shreds tissue, was by then being used in at least 50,000 women a year in the United States to help remove benign uterine tumors called fibroids, or to remove the entire uterus. It had become a mainstay in minimally invasive surgery, slicing up tissue so it could be removed through tiny incisions. But some women with fibroids have undiagnosed cancers, and morcellation can spray malignant cells around inside the abdomen and pelvis like seeds, “upstaging” the disease to a more advanced and deadly form. Before 2013, the F.D.A. had received no reports of uterine cancers being disseminated by morcellators. But after the 2013 case, which was widely covered by the news media, reports began to pour in, and by September 2016 there were 285. Some of the women have died. The government report points out a major flaw in the system for detecting harm from drugs and devices like morcellators: It is passive, relying on “adverse event” reports to the F.D.A. from doctors, hospitals, drug and equipment manufacturers, and consumers.

But even beyond the ban, executives and government officials expect Mr. Trump to be a disruptive influence on air travel. Some are concerned about an executive order seeking the elimination of two regulations for every new one enacted, which they say could have a negative effect on safety rules. They also await Mr. Trump’s thoughts on a proposal to privatize the air traffic control system, which has been run by the federal government since 1936. President Trump has not taken a position on a House Transportation Committee proposal to turn over more than 300 air traffic control facilities and 30,000 employees to a private nonprofit corporation run by executives nominated by aviation industry participants. Privatization would be the biggest change in the system since President Ronald Reagan fired 11,345 striking air traffic controllers in 1981, effectively killing their union. The Federal Aviation Administration had to spend three years restaffing after the striking workers were fired, and the system was hit with a personnel shortage 25 years later when those replacement workers became eligible for retirement. Overtime and six-day work weeks have been the norm since that time in busy areas, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Controllers complained that had affected safety and morale. While some airlines and the air traffic controllers association support privatization, not all F.A.A. work groups do. In size and complexity, the change would be even more difficult than in 1981, although the potential impact on safety has not been a significant part of the discussion.

Mr. Trump’s remark came during a meeting at the White House with sheriffs from around the country. At one point, the president asked the sheriffs seated at a table around him if there were any pressing law enforcement issues they wanted to talk about. A Texas sheriff, Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, spoke up. “Mr. President, on asset forfeiture,” Sheriff Eavenson said, in an exchange that was observed by reporters and filmed, “we’ve got a state senator in Texas that was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive that forfeiture money, and I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation passed.” “Can you believe that?” Mr. Trump responded, then added, “Who’s the state senator?” Sheriff Eavenson did not reply. “Do you want to give his name?” Mr. Trump said. “We’ll destroy his career.” Laughter then broke out. It remained unclear which Texas state senator Sheriff Eavenson was talking about. The sheriff, one of the top officials in a county about 25 miles east of Dallas, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

41,"WASHINGTON — Yemen’s government said on Wednesday that it had requested a “reassessment” of an American commando raid last month that killed several women and children and closer coordination on future operations, but said that it had not suspended future raids by United States Special Operations forces. Citing American officials, The New York Times had reported on Tuesday that Yemeni authorities, angry about the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first counterterrorism operation authorized by President Trump, had withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country. But on Wednesday, Yemeni officials publicly backtracked somewhat from what they had told White House officials, caught between the public outrage at home over civilian deaths and fear of losing American counterterrorism assistance. When asked about The Times report on Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, did not deny that American commando missions had been suspended. Referring to the Yemenis, Mr. Spicer said that “we’re going to continue to work with them to strengthen our diplomatic relationship, to understand our fight against terrorism.” In Cairo, however, Yemen’s foreign minister, Abdul Malik al-Mekhlafi, called for the review of the operation, in which one American commando and some 14 fighters of Al Qaeda died, adding that “Yemen continues to cooperate with the United States and continues to abide by all the agreements.” Yemen’s embassy in Washington said in a statement that it had not suspended any counterterrorism programs with the United States. But hinting that Yemeni leaders were not fully informed in advance about the mission, the embassy also said that “any counterterrorism operations carried out in Yemen should continue to be in consultation with Yemeni authorities and have precautionary measures to prevent civilian casualties.” The raid, which suffered a number of failings and faced unexpected resistance, was an early test of Mr. Trump’s national security decision-making — and his willingness to rely on the assurances of his military advisers. His aides say that even though the decision was made over a dinner, it had been fully vetted and had the required legal approvals.

42,"LONDON — Boris Johnson, Britain’s colorful and blustery foreign secretary, who is perhaps best known for his leading role in campaigning for his country’s departure from the European Union, has given up his American citizenship, a United States Treasury Department list showed Wednesday. Born in New York, Mr. Johnson, 52, held dual citizenship until last year. He had long complained about having to pay taxes in the United States even though he was 5 when he last lived there. Unlike most countries, the United States taxes nationals who live abroad on their worldwide income. According to British news reports, as recently as 2015, he settled a hefty capital gains tax bill on the sale of his north London home — after claiming that he wouldn’t pay. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2014, he described the “doctrine of global taxation” applied by the United States as “incredible.” With a disheveled shock of blond hair, sharp wit and clipped accent, Mr. Johnson sometimes seems like a caricature of the private-school-educated Briton. Although he did indeed graduate from Eton and Oxford, he has Turkish and Russian ancestors, and his early education took place in Brussels. He was appointed foreign secretary last summer after Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum. Mr. Johnson, a Conservative, has not been known for his diplomatic skills. His relations with Donald J. Trump took a blow in December 2015, when he accused Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, of being “out of his mind” and of “a quite stupefying ignorance” that made him unfit for the presidency. After Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Johnson swiftly changed course, suggesting in November that “there’s a lot to be positive about.” He added, “It’s very important not to prejudge the president-elect or his administration.” As mayor of London, Mr. Johnson cultivated the image of an endearing bumbler and came across like a comedian. But underneath that image was a quick mind with a shrewd political acumen. It was during his tenure that London hosted the 2012 Olympic Games. He has known former Prime Minister David Cameron since they were schoolboys, and many were surprised that he swung behind the so-called Brexit campaign, opposing Mr. Cameron. Mr. Johnson’s name appeared on a Treasury Department list of 5,411 people who gave up their American citizenship in 2016. As The Wall Street Journal reported, he is listed as Alexander Boris Johnson, a shortened version of his full birth name, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson.

The completion of the factory, which will complement two other Intel semiconductor plants in Chandler, Ariz., had been under consideration for several years. Standing beside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, said the company had decided to proceed now because of “the tax and regulatory policies we see the administration pushing forward.” Mr. Trump said: “The people of Arizona will be very happy. It’s a lot of jobs.” He said Intel called the White House several weeks ago to coordinate the announcement. That outreach illustrates the tightrope that Silicon Valley companies are walking as they deal with a president most of them did not want to see in office. Intel was one of nearly 130 companies that signed a legal brief challenging Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order temporarily blocking the entry of all refugees and of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Earlier, Mr. Krzanich criticized the order on Twitter, declaring, “As a company co-founded by an immigrant, we support lawful immigration.” (Intel’s third employee and longtime chief executive, Andrew S. Grove, survived the Holocaust and arrived in the United States after fleeing the Soviet invasion of his native Hungary in 1956.) Yet Intel, like Apple and other large technology companies, also supports the Trump administration’s plans to reduce corporate taxes and regulations. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Krzanich planned and then canceled a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump.

Trump’s presidency has galvanized political activism to a level of passion not seen since the civil rights movement. Far less clear is what you can do in reaction to the Trump administration’s changes. And in an era that promises instant gratification — like cars, couriers and food summoned to your driveway with the tap of a smartphone app — you might think tech is a quick and easy solution to becoming a political activist. But it turns out software and web tools can go only so far. “Sitting behind your computer is not going to be as effective as showing up for people where they really need it,” said Joshua Tauberer, the creator of GovTrack, a popular web tool for tracking legislation. “Government is people.” At best, tech is an excellent resource for staying on top of political activities. But at some point, you will have to go outside or pick up the phone and engage with people, like fellow citizens and members of Congress. That’s not to say tech is powerless. Opponents of Mr. Trump’s immigration ban, for example, used Twitter and Facebook to rally thousands of people for protests at the nation’s airports last month. Similarly, protesters used social media platforms to help coordinate the Jan. 21 women’s marches, which by one account constituted the largest day of demonstrations in American history. But what else can you do besides following news and events on Twitter and Facebook?

51,"One January morning in 2002, I met 15-year-old Sita Tamang in a prison in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Her boyfriend, who had promised marriage, made her pregnant. Afterward, he gave her a pill to make her “feel stronger.” The pill aborted her pregnancy. Ms. Tamang was still delirious with pain and shock when the police arrested her and charged her with infanticide. A court gave her a life sentence. In the late 1990s, 80 Nepali women were in prison for having undergone an abortion. It took Nepali activists three decades of advocacy to change the abortion laws. In March 2002, Nepal legalized abortion. Over the next two years, the women imprisoned for abortion were granted amnesty and released. Nepal had a very high maternal mortality rate. For every 100,000 live births, 539 women died in 1996. Unsafe abortion was seen to be one of the reasons. Most women had little or no access to any health care during pregnancy or delivery. A poor country torn by a decade of insurgency, Nepal relied on outside help to provide health care, and the United States was the largest donor. On Jan. 20, 2001, President George W. Bush assumed office. On that very first day in the White House, he imposed the “global gag rule,” which stopped United States government funding to overseas organizations that provide abortions or counseling on abortions. As soon as abortion became legal in Nepal, the Family Planning Association of Nepal, the largest organization providing contraceptives, lost part of its American funding. It was doing pioneering work in expanding awareness of reproductive health and contraceptive use in Nepal. FPAN refused to renounce counseling or referrals on abortion. It was forced to lay off 60 health workers and give up its mobile health clinics on reproductive health in rural areas, and its capacity to provide contraceptives was substantially impaired. The group didn’t use American funds for abortion or abortion counseling, but it worked with government hospitals and clinics that provided the procedure. At some clinics that received United States funding, “we had to build walls” to comply with the gag rule, recalled Shyam Thapa, a social scientist who advised the United States Agency for International Development. The walls separated the American-funded family planning section from the section providing abortion counseling.

52,"CANBERRA, Australia — The United States-Australia alliance faces a crucial test over how to deal with a powerful and increasingly assertive China. Under President Trump, it is already failing. The phone call last week between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in which the president denounced a refugee deal made between the United States and Australia under President Obama, showed Australians that they can no longer trust America. As a result of Mr. Trump’s approach, Australia will drift away from America and move closer to China. Mr. Obama’s ineffectual “pivot to Asia” undermined confidence among Australians that Washington had the resolve to resist Beijing’s ambitions, or the finesse to do so without provoking a war. Mr. Trump is making that worse. No one in Australia wants this to happen. Australia has benefited as much as any other country from the peace and stability that American leadership has brought to Asia. No country feels closer to America in its core values. But China has become extraordinarily important to Australia economically. China is by far the biggest market for Australia, the destination for more than 30 percent of its exports, and the trade balance remains strongly in Australia’s favor. Sales to China are five times that to America. As its economic clout has increased, China has become more assertive politically, seeking to displace the United States as Asia’s leading power. It has built China-centered regional economic institutions like the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, and challenged American military superiority with forays into the East and South China Seas and by bullying American allies in the region.

In a statement, the White House said Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi “discussed numerous topics, and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our One China policy.” It described the call as “extremely cordial” and said the leaders had invited each other to visit. The concession was clearly designed to put an end to an extended chill in the relationship between China and the United States. Mr. Xi, stung by Mr. Trump’s unorthodox telephone call with the president of Taiwan in December and his subsequent assertion that the United States might no longer abide by the One China policy, had not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected. Administration officials concluded that Mr. Xi would take a call only if Mr. Trump publicly committed to upholding the 44-year-old policy, under which the United States recognized a single Chinese government in Beijing and severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Given the domestic political stakes of this issue for Mr. Xi, the fact that both sides went ahead with a call – and that the White House statement afterward acknowledged Mr. Trump’s acquiescence – suggested that the agreement on “one China” had been worked out beforehand. The Chinese state news media, in its readout of the call, said Mr. Trump had “stressed that he fully understood the great importance for the U.S. government to respect the One China policy,” and that “the U.S. government adheres to the One China policy.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html?searchResultPosition=45

55,"The wind industry crossed an important threshold in the United States last year, exceeding the generating capacity of hydroelectric power for the first time, according to the main industry trade group, the American Wind Energy Association. The nation’s fleet of dams has long stood as the top renewable energy source, but there has been little market interest in building more big hydroelectric generating stations. In the meantime, wind has rapidly expanded — more than tripling in capacity since 2008 — with many more installations on the way. The comparison here is limited, measuring the maximum amount of power that generating stations are rated to produce — a threshold few, if any, ever meet. According to the Energy Information Administration, conventional hydroelectric generating capacity stood at 78,956 megawatts in 2015, while wind, the industry group says, reached 82,183 megawatts last year, about enough to run 24 million average American homes. (The hydroelectric figure does not include pumped storage, in which water pumped to an elevated reservoir can be released through a turbine to generate electricity when needed.) But hydroelectric power could still lead in terms of actual production: According to the Energy Information Administration’s most recent annual electric power report, hydroelectric edged out wind in terms of power sent to the grid by roughly 30 percent in 2015, though both forms trailed fossil fuels and nuclear power by wide margins. Any power plant’s potential output can be diminished by a number of factors, including market conditions that render its electricity uneconomical, shutdowns to fix or maintain equipment, orders to curtail unneeded production from system operators and fuel shortages. This is particularly the case for renewable energy sources, whose fuel depends on ever-shifting weather patterns to keep clouds from shading the sun, fill rivers with water and make the winds blow.

Intel, a company that manufactures a lot of goods in the United States, can also tag along with Mr. Trump’s overall message of revitalizing American manufacturing. But it is a tricky path. Workers in the tech industry overwhelmingly opposed Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and have shown outrage over his immigration ban. The danger for companies that decide to work with Mr. Trump is a revolt from within — from valuable employees who could easily jump ship to other tech firms if they don’t see their bosses being responsive to their concerns.

59,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers, venturing for the first time into the fraught world of Middle East peacemaking, are developing a strategy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would enlist Arab nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to break years of deadlock. The emerging approach mirrors the thinking of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who will visit the United States next week, and would build on his de facto alignment with Sunni Muslim countries in trying to counter the rise of Shiite-led Iran. But Arab officials have warned Mr. Trump and his advisers that if they want cooperation, the United States cannot make life harder for them with provocative pro-Israel moves. The White House seems to be taking the advice. Mr. Trump delayed his plan to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem after Arab leaders told him that doing so would cause angry protests among Palestinians, who also claim the city as the capital of a future state. And after meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan last week, Mr. Trump authorized a statement that, for the first time, cautioned Israel against building new West Bank settlements beyond existing lines. “There are some quite interesting ideas circulating on the potential for U.S.-Israeli-Arab discussions on regional security in which Israeli-Palestinian issues would play a significant role,” said Robert Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “I don’t know if this is going to ripen by next week, but this stuff is out there.” The discussions underscore the evolution of the new president’s attitude toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as he delves deeper into the issue. During the campaign and the postelection transition, Mr. Trump presented himself as an unstinting supporter of Israel who would quickly move the embassy and support new settlement construction without reservation. But he has tempered that to a degree. The notion of recruiting Arab countries to help forge an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians — known as the “outside-in” approach — is not a new one. As secretary of state under President George Bush, James A. Baker III organized the first regional conference in 1991 at which Arab leaders sat down with Israel’s prime minister. President George W. Bush invited Arab leaders to a summit meeting with Israel in Annapolis, Md., in 2007. And President Barack Obama’s first special envoy, George Mitchell, spent months in 2009 trying to enlist Arab partners in a joint effort.

It’s a kind of Marshall Plan for the 21st century, and it’s called the Silk Road initiative. This time, though, the benefactor isn’t the United States. It is China. The Chinese government is financing and subsidizing $1 trillion in spending, mostly in low-income countries around the world. The initiative includes the creation of a modern rail network for Africa, intended to “transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another,” as Andrew Jacobs of The Times reported from Djibouti this week. To see some of the joy that’s resulted from the opening of new train lines, watch the video that accompanies the story. It’s a wonderful development in many ways. It’s also a reminder of China’s rising strategic challenge to the United States. The Silk Road initiative gives China influence in, and access to, a huge continent — one with growing economies and geopolitically important spots, like Djibouti. And the United States? Our country is not exactly in the midst of a sustained campaign of reaching out to the rest of the world. Our government has just scrapped a trade deal with Asia and is trying to ban many Muslims from entering this country.

But more than one million Africans still die every year from AIDS, many because of lack of access to treatment. President Trump and some close aides have spoken favorably about Pepfar, but the administration has also raised questions about its “massive” [sic] cost. The overwhelming reason to continue Pepfar is humanitarian. Yet it has the ancillary benefit of promoting American interests on a continent where our main rival for global influence is very active. As Frist writes: “Pepfar is the greatest humanitarian effort undertaken by the United States in more than 60 years.

His message of reducing regulations and taxes appealed to this Republican stronghold, one of Mr. Trump’s strongest bases of support in the state. As for his promises about cracking down on illegal immigrants, many assumed Mr. Trump’s pledges were mostly just talk. But two weeks into his administration, Mr. Trump has signed executive orders that have upended the country’s immigration laws. Now farmers here are deeply alarmed about what the new policies could mean for their workers, most of whom are unauthorized, and the businesses that depend on them. “Everything’s coming so quickly,” Mr. Marchini said. “We’re not loading people into buses or deporting them, that’s not happening yet.” As he looked out over a crew of workers bent over as they rifled through muddy leaves to find purple heads of radicchio, he said that as a businessman, Mr. Trump would know that farmers had invested millions of dollars into produce that is growing right now, and that not being able to pick and sell those crops would represent huge losses for the state economy. “I’m confident that he can grasp the magnitude and the anxiety of what’s happening now.” Mr. Trump’s immigration policies could transform California’s Central Valley, a stretch of lowlands that extends from Redding to Bakersfield. Approximately 70 percent of all farmworkers here are living in the United States illegally, according to researchers at University of California, Davis. The impact could reverberate throughout the valley’s precarious economy, where agriculture is by far the largest industry. With 6.5 million people living in the valley, the fields in this state bring in $35 billion a year and provide more of the nation’s food than any other state. The consequences of a smaller immigrant work force would ripple not just through the orchards and dairies, but also to locally owned businesses, restaurants, schools and even seemingly unrelated industries, like the insurance market.

64,"Trapped in an airport terminal in Jordan by President Trump’s travel ban, Hanan Isweiri fretted that as a Libyan citizen she would not be able to return to her husband and three children in Colorado. She wondered if she could complete the doctorate she had worked toward for seven years. Most of all, she feared for her 1-year-old son, who was having an allergic reaction but was not permitted to leave the airport. Just about the only thing she did not have to worry about — despite staying in airport hotels in Jordan and Turkey, and repeatedly booking and rebooking intercontinental flights in those chaotic early days — was money. Friends had set up a GoFundMe web page, raising $5,366 to help defray the significant costs she incurred as a result of the ban. “Some friends do a fund-raising site for me, and I believe without this I would never make it,” said Ms. Isweiri, 41, who made it back to Colorado on Sunday, two days after a federal judge put a halt, for now, on the travel ban. After Mr. Trump’s executive order, individual lawyers volunteered their time and expertise at airports around the country. Large organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, which had seen a boom in fund-raising after Mr. Trump’s election victory, have helped mount legal challenges. But the financial dislocation for ordinary people like Ms. Isweiri, a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University who was in Libya for her father’s funeral when Mr. Trump signed off on the ban, was enormous. In dozens of cases, crowdfunding sites allowed friends, neighbors and complete strangers to fill the gap and cover the expenses that otherwise might have unwound the financial security of immigrants and residents affected by the ban. Because of the decentralized nature of the campaigns, it is hard to say exactly how many have started since the change in immigration policy. But the largest crowdfunding site, GoFundMe, and a company it recently acquired, CrowdRise, have seen more than 50 new campaigns that have raised nearly $1.5 million related to the executive order, which halted travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. An appeals court in San Francisco is reviewing the order. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/travel-ban-crowdfunding.html?searchResultPosition=49

66,"FRONT PAGE Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about legal arguments over President Trump’s targeted travel ban erroneously attributed comments from a hearing on the issue. It was Judge Richard R. Clifton — not Noah G. Purcell, Washington State’s solicitor general — who said that evidence of religious discrimination was thin and that “the concern for terrorism with those connected with radical Islamic sects is kind of hard to deny.” • An article on Wednesday about the Senate confirmation of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education described incorrectly the role of public pressure in the “no” votes cast by two Republicans. While Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she received urging her to reject the nomination, Senator Susan Collins of Maine did not in fact refer to such public comments as influencing her decision to oppose the nomination. NATIONAL An article on Jan. 29 about the anxiety toward Muslim refugees that is being stoked by the far-right media misidentified the source of a widely shared article claiming that members of Al Qaeda had entered the United States disguised as refugees. It was published by American News, not by Conservative Tribune. THE ARTS A Critic’s Notebook article on Wednesday about this year’s Oscar-nominated short films erroneously included one person as a co-director of the film “Joe’s Violin.” The film was directed solely by Kahane Cooperman, not also by Raphaela Neihausen, who was one of the film’s producers, along with Ms. Cooperman. The error was repeated in a picture caption. OBITUARIES An obituary on Jan. 16 about the singer and pianist Buddy Greco omitted a survivor. Besides the daughters, sons and grandchildren mentioned, Mr. Greco is survived by another daughter, Anastasia Greco. • Because of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about the actor Alec McCowen misstated the surname of the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company production of “King Lear” in which Mr. McCowen played the Fool. He is Peter Brook, not Brooks. • An obituary on Tuesday about Lorenzo Servitje, a founder of the multinational baking company Grupo Bimbo, included a quotation from the book “White Bread,” by Aaron Bobrow-Strain, that misspelled the name of a brand Mr. Servitje’s company owns.

67,"TEHRAN — It was supposed to be a regular weekly debate night for a group that meets to discuss movies in a middle-class Tehran neighborhood. But on this particular evening, the 20 or so housewives, intellectuals and students in the group wanted to talk about only one thing: a possibly violent conflict between Iran and the United States. Months had passed since members of the group had been so worked up, recalled one of the participants, Fariba Sameni, a 57-year-old translator. No one wanted to discuss film. Younger members were convinced that President Trump would inevitably bomb Iran. “They shouted that their futures would be destroyed,” Ms. Sameni said. The group’s leader, a professor, argued that Mr. Trump, with his background as a businessman, would ultimately make a deal with Iran. The professor’s argument was unconvincing, Ms. Sameni said. “When I went home, I felt anxious and worried,” she said, “as if something really bad is about to happen.” Gloom and dread can be felt across the Iranian capital, and some people blame not only Mr. Trump, but also their own leaders. First Mr. Trump ordered a ban on travel by most Iranians to the United States.

69,"President Obama was no fan of the dreadful 2010 Supreme Court decision ruling in favor of corporate personhood. In that case, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the court asserted that political spending, including by corporations, was a form of speech protected by the First Amendment, opening the door for corporations to spend unlimited money on ads and other tools to get candidates elected. The president was not alone. As The Washington Post reported the month after the ruling: “Americans of both parties overwhelmingly oppose a Supreme Court ruling that allows corporations and unions to spend as much as they want on political campaigns, and most favor new limits on such spending, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.” The Post continued: “Eight in 10 poll respondents say they oppose the high court’s Jan. 21 decision to allow unfettered corporate political spending, with 65 percent ‘strongly’ opposed. Nearly as many backed congressional action to curb the ruling, with 72 percent in favor of reinstating limits. The poll reveals relatively little difference of opinion on the issue among Democrats (85 percent opposed to the ruling), Republicans (76 percent) and independents (81 percent).” An overwhelming majority of America was aghast. So Obama reflected that frustration in his public statements. The president addressed the debacle in his 2010 State of the Union address, in the presence of the Supreme Court justices who decided the case. He began his comments with a phrase that had not appeared in the prepared text, “With all due deference to separation of powers.” Then he let loose: “Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign corporations — to spend without limit in our elections. I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and I’d urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.” Obama had previously criticized the ruling in one of his weekly radio addresses, stating: “I can’t think of anything more devastating to the public interest. The last thing we need to do is hand more influence to the lobbyists in Washington, or more power to the special interests to tip the outcome of elections.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/trumps-leading-rivals-wear-robes.html?searchResultPosition=60
70,"THE Trump administration recently announced that it intends to review, and presumably overturn, the Obama-era fiduciary duty rule that is scheduled to take effect in April. The administration’s case was articulated by Gary Cohn, the new director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Cohn, most recently the president of Goldman Sachs, called it “a bad rule” and likened it to “putting only healthy food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldn’t eat it because you might die younger.” Comparing healthy and unhealthy food to healthy and unhealthy investments is an interesting analogy. The now-endangered fiduciary rule is based on a simple — and seemingly unarguable — principle: that in giving advice to clients with retirement funds, stockbrokers, registered investment advisers and insurance agents must act in the best interests of their clients. Honestly, it seems counterproductive to go to war against such a fundamental principle. It simply doesn’t seem like a good business practice for Wall Street to tell its client-investors, “We put your interests second, after our firm’s, but it’s close.” The annulment of the government’s fiduciary rule would clearly be a setback for investors trying to prepare for retirement. But the fiduciary principle itself will live on, and even spread. The truth is, the existing proposal doesn’t go nearly far enough. It is limited to retirement plan accounts and ignores the other three-quarters of the assets owned by individual investors. Any effective rule must encompass all investors. It is widely agreed that the fiduciary rule would give impetus to the growing use of lower-cost, broadly diversified index funds (pioneered by Vanguard, the company I founded), such as those tracking, with remarkable precision, the S&P 500 stock index. But even without the rule, there has already been a tidal shift to index funds — actually, more like a tsunami. Since 2008, mutual fund investors have liquidated more than $800 billion of their holdings in actively managed equity mutual funds and purchased about $1.8 trillion of equity index funds. Low-cost index funds are almost certainly what Mr. Cohn means when he refers to the “healthy food on the menu.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/putting-clients-second.html?searchResultPosition=59
71,"To many Americans, February, first officially recognized by President Gerald Ford in 1976 as Black History Month, is a time to celebrate African-American achievements, ones that were gained against nearly impossible economic, social and political odds. But there is one achievement that is rarely on the list. As a people, African-Americans forced the United States of America to look deep into its own soul and to see the moral bankruptcy that lay there. That bankruptcy was exposed as African-Americans struggled to live under white supremacy, a system that rendered them “sub-persons.” And even as we fought to make America “our home” — a home that was already brutally taken from Native Americans by white colonial settlers — our black bodies were subject to unconscionable white enslavement, violence and oppression; we lived through forms of carnage, mutilation, rape, castration and injustice that will forever mark the profound ethical failure of this country. By surviving, and demonstrating that the American experiment had failed black people and minorities, we became far more American than those who withheld America’s promise. On paper, America stood for freedom. Yet that freedom was denied to black people. White America, white people, lived in a profound form of what Sartre called “bad faith” — a state of inauthenticity and self-deception. The white social critic Lillian Smith (1896-1966), who grew up in the Deep South and later wrote “Killers of the Dream,” observed, “I had learned that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that we might have segregated churches.” She also noted, “I learned it is possible to be a Christian and a white Southerner simultaneously” and “to pray at night and ride Jim Crow car the next morning and to feel comfortable in doing both.” It is this bad faith, this ethical perversity, that haunts the history of white America. And as Frederick Douglass noted, “Between the Christianity of this land and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference.” And in his speech “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July” (1852), Douglass said to white America: “The Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.” As I listened to President Trump’s Black History Month remarks on Feb. 1, it was painfully clear that he didn’t bear witness to that Douglass. It is convenient for him not to know that Douglass. In this nightmare of Trumpism, we mustn’t forget Douglass’s words, just as we mustn’t forget the dejection felt by those who suffered under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 or in the anti-Japanese internment camps during World War II. Those actions contradicted America’s alleged identity as a nation whose arms are open to the stranger, the outcast; a nation that, in theory, does not discriminate based upon race or national origin. It is this brutal and contradictory history from which America cannot, and should not, turn away. Just as Jews refuse to forget Hitler’s Germany, we black Americans refuse to forget the often unspeakable atrocities we endured. It is this resistance to forgetting that must be nurtured as we find ourselves in the midst of a dangerous form of antiglobalism, white nativism and xenophobia under Trump’s vision for making America “great again,” a vision closer to D. W. Griffith’s 1915 “The Birth of a Nation” — a film predicated upon white fear and denigration of the black other — than that of an actual nation.

72,"Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world? That could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim nations with an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood — perhaps the most influential Islamist group in the Middle East — as a terrorist organization. Such an order, now under consideration, would be seen by many Muslims as another attempt to vilify adherents of Islam. It appears to be part of a mission by the president and his closest advisers to heighten fears by promoting a dangerously exaggerated vision of an America under siege by what they call radical Islam. The struggle against extremism is complex, and solutions must be tailored both to the facts and to an understanding of the likely consequences. Since 1997, the secretary of state has had the power to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations, thus subjecting them, as well as people and businesses who deal with them, to sanctions, like freezing their assets. President Barack Obama resisted adding the Brotherhood to that list. There are good reasons that the Brotherhood, with millions of members, doesn’t merit the terrorist designation. Rather than a single organization, it is a collection of groups and movements that can vary widely from country to country. While the Brotherhood calls for a society governed by Islamic law, it renounced violence decades ago, has supported elections and has become a political and social organization. Its branches often have tenuous connections to the original movement founded in Egypt in 1928. Under State Department guidelines, the “terrorist” designation is intended to punish groups that carry out terrorist attacks. There’s no question that some such groups have grown out of the Muslim Brotherhood, like Hamas, the adversary of Israel, which the United States named a terrorist organization in 1997. Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has worked to crush the Brotherhood in his country since he overthrew his predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, a former Brotherhood leader, in 2013. But there is no evidence that senior Brotherhood leaders ordered any violence or carried out any of the recent major terrorist attacks in Egypt, according to the analysts Michele Dunne and Nathan Brown of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

73,"Among global public health advocates, there is a growing concern that President Trump may cut back, or even eliminate, programs that have played a critical role in fighting diseases worldwide. While every administration should strongly review our nation’s overseas commitments, and there are undoubtedly programs that we should cut, I hope he recognizes the success and importance of one in particular: the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. I have been treating patients in Africa and Haiti for 20 years. When I was Senate majority leader in 2003, I led the Senate’s passage of the plan, called Pepfar, on an overwhelming voice vote. It has since been reauthorized twice. President Trump, like his predecessors, will have the chance to put his own stamp on this winning program. Pepfar was created in a moment of crisis: In the late 1990s, H.I.V.-AIDS was the No. 4 killer worldwide, and No. 1 in Africa. The program aimed to bring reliable, proven measures like antiretroviral drugs, counseling and prevention services to underserved communities around the world — and it worked. Today, Pepfar reaches 11.5 million people with antiretroviral drugs, a 50 percent increase since just 2014. Two million babies with infected mothers have been born H.I.V.-free thanks to Pepfar interventions, and 6.2 million orphans and vulnerable children receive care from the program. The program has been able to expand, without a significant change in its budget, because it leverages the latest scientific innovations and reductions in drug prices. As a result, the rate of new H.I.V. infections in Malawi, for example, has dropped 76 percent in 13 years. But the work is far from over. One million people worldwide died of AIDS last year, and only about half of those afflicted with the disease are getting proper treatment. Pepfar’s success is no secret to the new administration. In his confirmation hearing as secretary of state last month, Rex Tillerson called it “a model for us to look to as we’re thinking about other ways in which to project America’s values, project our compassion” to “solve these threats.” A few days later, though, The New York Times reported that the Trump transition team was asking questions about the value of humanitarian aid in general and Pepfar in particular. For example, transition officials asked, “Is Pepfar worth the massive investment when there are so many security concerns in Africa?” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/bill-frist-the-case-for-keeping-americas-aids-relief-plan.html?searchResultPosition=56

75,"LONDON — Christie’s sold 4 billion pounds of art and collectibles in 2016, the international auction house said on Thursday, a decline of 16 percent from the previous year. In its 250th anniversary year, Christie’s described the process of wooing auction sellers as “challenging,” which may account for sales contracting 22 percent, to £3.3 billion, or about $4.1 billion. Auction sales were also down in 2016 at the rival houses Sotheby’s and Phillips. Private transactions at Christie’s, however, increased 25 percent, to £694 million. The largest of these was the joint acquisition for 160 million euros, or $170.8 million, of Rembrandt’s wedding portraits of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit by the Louvre Museum in Paris and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. “It was a solid year. We achieved four out of the year’s five top auction prices,” said Guillaume Cerutti, Christie’s chief executive. Mr. Cerutti, 50, took over from Patricia Barbizet in December, having been the auction house’s president of Europe, Middle East, Russia and India operations. “The market is strong on the buyer’s side, more challenging on the seller’s side,” he added. Christie’s 2016 auction results were notable for the absence of 20th-century masterworks, such as Picasso’s “Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’),” which sold in 2015 for $179.4 million, a record for a work of art sold at auction. Last year, with Britain’s referendum on European Union membership and the United States’ presidential election creating uncertainty, owners of the world’s most valuable postwar and contemporary art were more reluctant to sell at auction. Was that also a consequence of Christie’s and third parties becoming more reluctant to guarantee minimum prices at the highest level, as had been the case with that Picasso?

While the polarized belief systems that exploded in the battle between Trump and Clinton are driving both policymaking and an invigorated opposition, researchers continue to provide empirical evidence on the difficult issues of race, poverty and intergenerational mobility. Rucker C. Johnson, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, has followed two generations of black families and concluded that integration has been an effective tool for raising educational levels and living standards. “Equal opportunity education policies generally are motivated to try to break the cycle of poverty, to break the vicious cycle of disadvantage from one generation to the next, and create a virtuous cycle where being born poor isn’t a life sentence,” Johnson told the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association in 2016. “We have a very rare opportunity where a major intervention” — desegregation — “has been shown to be very effective on one generation’s lifetime outcomes, and then to be able to show that those beneficial effects extend into the next generation – particularly the black children whose parents went to desegregated schools.” Separate research published in 2015 by Johnson, C. Kirabo Jackson, an economist at Northwestern, and Claudia Persico, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, found that At the same time, Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at Brookings, and Dimitrios Halikias, a research assistant, tackled one of the most vexing issues in education in their February 2017 Brookings paper, “Race Gaps in SAT Scores Highlight Inequality and Hinder Upward Mobility.” “Race gaps on the SATs are especially pronounced at the tails of the distribution,” the two authors note.

Gorsuch, had called Mr. Trump’s attacks on the judiciary “demoralizing” and “disheartening.” The account was readily confirmed on the record by a White House adviser, Ron Bonjean, working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation.

80,"The newly christened “Mnuchin rule” — the assurance given by the Treasury nominee Steven T. Mnuchin that “there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class” — seems as if it was made to be broken. Mr. Mnuchin initially made the statement during an interview on CNBC in November, after President Trump chose him for the cabinet. At Mr. Mnuchin’s confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, rebranded the comment as a “rule,” transforming a throwaway line into a formal pledge. Whether it will be kept may become clearer in two or three weeks — the timing Mr. Trump mentioned Thursday for delivering a “phenomenal” tax plan. Although Mr. Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered. Redesigning the tax code with an eye fixed on lower rates has been a Republican mission for decades, and one that Mr. Trump adopted. That prospect, combined with a promised regulatory retreat, has pumped up the stock market and fueled optimism among business leaders.

81,"For the first Summer of Trump, the Public Theater is choosing a play with a message. The theater, New York’s pre-eminent nonprofit, said Thursday that it would open its annual Shakespeare in the Park season with “Julius Caesar,” and declared, “Shakespeare’s political masterpiece has never felt more contemporary.” The Public’s synopsis of the play makes clear that the outdoor production would have some parallels with contemporary American politics. “Rome’s leader, Julius Caesar, is a force unlike any the city has seen,” the description reads. “Magnetic, populist, irreverent, he seems bent on absolute power. A small band of patriots, devoted to the country’s democratic traditions, must decide how to oppose him.” The play is an unusual choice for the annual summer program: During the 55 years of free theater in Central Park, “Julius Caesar” has been done just once, in 2000. And this summer’s production will be directed by Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, who last directed a show in the park in 2008 (“Hamlet”). “Julius Caesar” will be followed by more familiar summer fare: a production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” directed by Lear deBessonet. The comedy was previously staged in the park in 1982, 1991 and 2007. “Julius Caesar” is to run from May 23 to June 18, and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” from July 11 to Aug. 13. Casting has not yet been announced. Most of the tickets to Shakespeare in the Park are distributed, for free, on the day of the performance, either in person or by a digital lottery.

82,"Though marred by spectacular corruption, Somalia’s presidential election on Wednesday managed to deliver a surprise result: Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, an American citizen who once worked for the New York State Department of Transportation and served as Somalia’s prime minister in 2010, beat the incumbent, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Mr. Mohamed now has the opportunity to form Somalia’s first functioning government in more than 25 years. With his election, there’s hope that Somalia can turn away from years of dysfunctional, corrupt leadership, and put in place a government that can tackle the country’s serious problems. Transparency International ranks Somalia the most corrupt country on earth. Some $20 million changed hands in the lead-up to Wednesday’s election, and bribe-taking, crony capitalism and the stealing of public money are deeply entrenched. Mr. Mohamed must move quickly to curb the corruption that has made it nearly impossible to provide basic services. Poverty and terrorism have made Somalia the world’s third-largest refugee-producing country after Syria and Afghanistan. More than one million Somalis have fled the country, many to neighboring Kenya. Famine, which caused the deaths of more than a quarter of a million Somalis in 2011, is again a severe threat because of continuing drought. The Al Qaeda-affiliated Shabab militant group, one of the world’s deadliest Islamist organizations, and other armed groups remain strong in Somalia, despite an intensified American clandestine war, in concert with African troops, against Islamist terrorists. On Tuesday, mortars landed near Mogadishu’s international airport, where lawmakers voted the next day. On Wednesday morning, militants attacked a hotel in Somalia’s semiautonomous region of Puntland, killing four guards. Somalia is one of seven countries on President Donald Trump’s legally contested travel ban list, causing profound anxiety for thousands of Somali refugees and for Somali families settled in the United States. There are also fears that Mr. Trump might move to cut American aid. That would be a mistake, especially now. Mr. Mohamed will need all the support he can get to put the government on a path to delivering the services and security Somalia needs.

84,"The 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday will feature perhaps the show’s most electric contest in years: Adele versus Beyoncé. Both are megaselling queens of pop whose every move reverberates throughout the culture. The fact that they will face off in each of the top three categories — album, record and song of the year — gives the Grammys a rare tension that can only be good for ratings. Yet their competition is also fraught in ways that have long dogged the awards. One concerns race, a subject the Grammys have a tangled history with — especially this year, when one of the most acclaimed young black artists, Frank Ocean, has boycotted the process altogether. Another sensitive area is the Grammys’ spotty record in recognizing the vanguards of contemporary pop. Added to the mix is a heightened political climate in which issues of race and identity are front and center, raising the question of whether the music industry will use this year’s Grammys as a soapbox. Many longtime Grammy watchers say that a sweep by Adele — and therefore a Beyoncé snub — could feed into long-simmering complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories. Ebro Darden, a disc jockey on the New York hip-hop station Hot 97 and on Apple’s Beats 1, said that a big Beyoncé win would be “the best move” for the Grammys “if they want to get the most attention and keep people interested.” Should Adele dominate, he added, some music fans “would come for them and say #OscarsSoWhite.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/arts/music/grammys-adele-beyonce-trump.html?searchResultPosition=27

86,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals panel on Thursday unanimously rejected President Trump’s bid to reinstate his ban on travel into the United States from seven largely Muslim nations, a sweeping rebuke of the administration’s claim that the courts have no role as a check on the president. The three-judge panel, suggesting that the ban did not advance national security, said the administration had shown “no evidence” that anyone from the seven nations — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — had committed terrorist acts in the United States. The ruling also rejected Mr. Trump’s claim that courts are powerless to review a president’s national security assessments. Judges have a crucial role to play in a constitutional democracy, the court said. “It is beyond question,” the decision said, “that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.” The decision was handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. It upheld a ruling last Friday by a federal district judge, James L. Robart, who blocked key parts of the travel ban, allowing thousands of foreigners to enter the country.

The organization, Al Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, is one of several groups to have their offices closed, their assets frozen or travel bans imposed on their leaders in the past year. Prominent lawyers, journalists and others considered a threat to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi have also been singled out. In justifying the sweeping measures, Egyptian officials say they need to regulate Western-funded groups that threaten the stability of the Egyptian state and aid terrorism. Critics say Mr. Sisi is seeking to consolidate his control by silencing even the mildest sources of dissent. Since coming to power in 2013, his government has locked up tens of thousands of opponents and effectively outlawed public protests. Now, many fear, President Trump’s support for Mr. Sisi could embolden the Egyptian leader to go further. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Sisi as a “fantastic guy” and invited him to the White House. Mr. Sisi was notably silent about Mr. Trump’s recent ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Al Nadeem Center, which was founded in 1993, has been fighting for survival since last February, when the government first threatened to close it, citing vague health regulations. The center has provided therapy to about 1,000 victims of police abuse, its founders say, and cataloged instances of police torture, unlawful killings and illegal abductions.

88,"There’s something fitting about interviewing the painter and sculptor Vija Celmins after sundown. And not only because she’s a night owl, known to labor over canvases long into the evening in her studio on Crosby Street in SoHo, with a cat named Raymond Carver twining around her ankles. It is also because some of Ms. Celmins’s best-known works — examples of which are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Modern, the Pompidou and other important museums — are painstakingly wrought images of night skies, so realistic that they can be mistaken for photographs, but so dark and strange that you sometimes see viewers bringing their noses right up to the surface, as if they were trying to focus on the stars through the lens of a telescope. Ms. Celmins, 78, keeps a clipping of the ascetic abstractionist Ad Reinhardt’s 12 rules for painting, one of which is to avoid form at all costs. “No figure or fore- or background,” he wrote. “No volume or mass, no cylinder, sphere or cone, or cube or boogie-woogie.” And she has been drawn obsessively for more than four decades to her most beloved subjects — the dark sky, the surfaces of the ocean and the moon and the desert, without horizon or perspective — because such seemingly formless vistas allow her to imagine, as she once said, “that I wrestle a giant image into a very tiny area and make it stay there so that it seems inevitable that it is there.” If you’re a fan, waiting out that wrestling match can be excruciating. She works with all the haste of a medieval illuminator. But after a hiatus of almost seven years since her last exhibition, she is returning with a new body of work, at Matthew Marks (522 West 22nd Street in Chelsea), her first show there, opening on Friday. In a sense, it serves as a warm-up for a far bigger one, the first full retrospective of her work in more than 20 years, organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where it will open at the end of 2018 before traveling to the Met Breuer, the show’s co-organizer, in 2019. One recent afternoon, Ms. Celmins appeared near her elevator door, wearing an apron smeared with paint. “Let me take this thing off so I don’t look like a dirty worker,” she said, winking. “Except that I am a dirty worker.” Behind her, in her studio, which shares space with the small apartment where she has lived for 28 years, two assistants were applying touches to paintings bound for the gallery’s show, an unusual situation for Ms. Celmins, who has worked resolutely alone since her student days at the University of California, Los Angeles.

His lashing out at the upscale department store seems to reflect an approach to industrial policy that often brings unintended consequences. In response to Nordstrom’s decision, President Trump took to Twitter to complain: Lest the message be unclear, his official presidential  account dutifully retweeted the complaint. And his son Donald Trump Jr. followed up with reports that supporters were planning to boycott the store. Such actions, if meant to disrupt Nordstrom’s business, could be a signal to other retailers that it’ll be costly to cut off existing business relationships with the Trump family. This kind of bullying could have unintended consequences. Put yourself in the shoes of a purchasing manager considering adding the Ivanka Trump Collection to your stores. Even if you think her products are excellent, Mr. Trump’s outburst provides an incentive not to stock them. After all, if it doesn’t work out, who wants to be in the cross-hairs of an easily angered president with 24.3 million Twitter followers and the power of the regulatory state? It might be far safer to do business with someone else. Mr. Trump’s strategy to protect his daughter’s business seems to mirror his strategy to protect American jobs. Just as he has made it more expensive for potential partners to sever business relationships with his daughter, the C.E.O.s of Carrier, General Motors and Toyota can attest that he has made it more expensive for them to sever their relationships with American workers. And when you make it more expensive to exit a relationship, you make it more expensive to enter it. That extra cost can create a greater harm. It’s a lesson that many European governments have learned the hard way. Research shows that efforts to boost employment by making it difficult or costly to fire workers have backfired. The prospect of a costly and lengthy legal battle for laid-off employees makes it less appealing to hire new workers. The result has been that higher firing costs have led to to weaker productivity, sclerotic labor markets and higher unemployment. Even France’s Socialist party saw the relationship of easier exits to increased entrances. Facing very high unemployment and a weak economy, some of its party leaders last year tried to make it easier for companies to fire people. But for months, protesters took to the streets to block any legislation. The prospect of a costly Trump tantrum could give factory bosses reason to think twice before setting up shop in the United States. In the short run, perhaps Mr. Trump’s threats can slow a painful decline. But in the longer run, defending the status quo may do more harm than good.

No viewer, however, has seen his criticism of the show scrutinized — or had the show get under his skin — quite like President Trump. Mr. Trump is the first president of the United States to take umbrage publicly at his portrayal on “S.N.L.” and fight back in real time (a phenomenon that began this past fall, when Alec Baldwin began impersonating him). That fraught dynamic is even more remarkable given that Mr. Trump has been lampooned on the program regularly for almost 30 years — he is as much of an “S.N.L.” character as Stefon, the Church Lady or Debbie Downer — and for a time he seemed to enjoy a friendly relationship with the show.

95,"More than a quarter of a million Somali refugees got a huge break on Thursday. A Kenyan judge ruled that the Kenyan government’s contentious plan to close Dadaab, the world’s largest refugee camp, was “illegal” and “discriminatory,” and that the refugees could not be forcefully relocated. For years, Kenya has threatened to shut the sprawling camp, a crowded, sweltering realm near Kenya’s border with Somalia that has been a refuge for desperate people since Somalis began fleeing to Kenya in 1991, when their country was plunged into civil war. The government has said the camp is a breeding ground for Islamist terrorists, though the evidence is mixed for how central it really is to Kenya’s terrorism problem, which has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years. The vast majority of refugees who live in Dadaab are Somalis, too scared to return home to a nation plagued by war, famine, chaos, poverty and disease. On Thursday, Judge John Mativo of Kenya’s High Court, the equivalent of an American Federal District Court, ruled that the government’s plan to close the camp “specifically targeting Somali refugees is an act of group persecution, illegal, discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional.” The judge also ordered the Kenyan government to reinstate its refugee department, which the government essentially closed last year. In May, Kenya announced it was serious about closing Dadaab, though it has since missed several self-imposed deadlines. Diplomats, United Nations agencies and human rights groups have told the Kenyans that forcing the refugees to return to Somalia would be a violation of international law. Kenya’s foreign donors, including the United States, have threatened to withhold payments if the government kicks out the refugees. That has left Kenya in a tight spot: Relocating hundreds of thousands of people would not be cheap. Few say they believe Dadaab’s future is settled. Within hours of the ruling, the Kenyan government vowed to appeal, arguing that the situation in Somalia had improved and the refugees could return. It is unclear whether the Kenyan government will follow the court order. Though Kenya’s judiciary is considered strong and independent, the president has enormous power and Kenyan security forces routinely violate the rights of Somali refugees. Still, the pressure is growing to do something about Dadaab. Aid officials, who have sharply criticized repatriation, admit that the current situation is untenable. “Kenya and the international community must work toward finding alternative solutions for refugees, including local integration options,” said Muthoni Wanyeki, an Amnesty International regional director. More than 9,000 Somali refugees were resettled in the United States last fiscal year, many coming from Dadaab. But a recent change in United States policy could threaten that trend. President Trump signed an executive order last month barring Somalis from traveling to the United States. Over the past two weeks, scores of refugees have been bused back and forth between Dadaab and Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, as the United States’ refugee policy is argued in American courts.

Rivkin Award in honor of my father, an ambassador, to encourage Foreign Service officers to tell truth to power, recognizing the best for their initiative, integrity, courage and constructive dissent. In 1971, the State Department established a formal “dissent channel” to ensure that its senior officials would consider differing views in formulating policy. So when 1,000 or so department employees explained through the established dissent channel that President Trump’s executive order suspending visas for citizens of seven Muslim countries would not make our country safer, and why it would in fact sour relations with these countries, deprive us of intelligence and other resources needed to fight terror abroad, increase anti-American sentiment, thwart humanitarian efforts and hurt our economy, one would have expected senior officials to give them a careful hearing. That is what Secretary of State John Kerry did last year after a group of midlevel Foreign Service officers wrote a dissent cable criticizing Obama administration policy in Syria. Instead, the White House press secretary warned that dissenters “should either get with the program or they can go.” One need not agree with the dissenters to recognize that thoughtful dissent is not disloyalty but a patriotic duty.

98,"There are 1.5 million low-level warrants on file in New York, demanding arrests for offenses so minor that many are not even categorized as crimes. Some stem from unpaid fines of only $25. Many are the result of old tickets for drinking beer in public, disorderly conduct, sitting in a park after dark or riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. They are part of the legacy of a quarter-century of aggressive policing tactics, known by various names — “broken windows,” “zero tolerance” or “stop and frisk” — but all involve an escalating number of tickets for minor infractions. And at 1.5 million, the warrants have created a class of New Yorkers, in large part black and Hispanic, who stand a good chance of being arrested if an officer asks to see their identification and runs their name through a police database. Now the city’s five district attorneys are considering throwing out a large number of warrants in an effort to move past the controversies over former policing practices and to spare New Yorkers from being arrested for petty infractions committed long ago. Many details are still being worked out, like whether to delete just a tenth of these warrants, or as many as half. But the city’s district attorneys have agreed in principle to ask the courts to purge at least some of them — in what will most likely be applauded by advocates of criminal justice reform and for immigrants concerned about increased deportations under the Trump administration. A warrant can hang over someone’s head for years, even decades, threatening to escalate any interaction with the police into a night in jail, or worse. For undocumented immigrants, a low-level warrant could conceivably lead to deportation proceedings, civil rights lawyers say, particularly given the executive order President Trump signed on Jan. 25 that expands the definition of who is to be targeted for deportation. An arrest on a warrant “throws people right in the cross hairs of ICE and that is particularly scary now,” said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

99,"It is a clear violation of federal ethics rules for White House staff members, or any other federal employees, to use their official positions for private gain. But what President Trump did on Wednesday in his Twitter attack on the Nordstrom department store chain, castigating it for dropping Ms. Trump’s line, was far worse. In sum, Nordstrom made a business decision not to do business with the president’s daughter because her  clothing line was not selling well, and the president used his official position to attack the company for this decision. The president’s tweet — posted on his personal account and then re-sent from his White House account — is an act of intimidation. Nordstrom interacts with many executive branch agencies: the Department of Labor, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and others. Each one of these agencies will be headed by Trump appointees. Most will be staffed with other political appointees as well. The president is telling all of these people that he is very angry with Nordstrom. The message is clear, and it won’t take much for a political appointee in some agency to conceive of an ingenious way of ingratiating himself with the White House by making life difficult for the store chain. Most important, regardless of whether such retaliation actually happens, Nordstrom and the handful of other companies that announced they, too, would drop the line have to live in fear of it for the rest of the Trump administration. And now every other department store knows that it had better not make a similar “business decision” that displeases the president. In other words, do business with the Trump family and help the Trump family promote its products, or else.

The policy change, confirmed by the I.R.S. on Wednesday after elements were reported by the libertarian magazine Reason, does not do away with the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that all Americans who can afford it obtain health insurance or pay a fine. But it might make it a little harder for the I.R.S. to figure out who is breaking the rules. The I.R.S. recently notified tax preparers that it will not reject tax returns that omit information about whether a filer had health insurance during the previous year. That’s actually a continuation of an informal Obama administration policy, but because of the way the decision was announced, it is likely to have broader effects on how many people report their insurance status to the government and how many people end up paying penalties for staying uninsured. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on the day of his inauguration asking agencies to reduce burdens related to compliance with the health law. In its statement, the I.R.S. indicated that this policy was related to that instruction. Tax returns include a line that asks people to indicate whether they had insurance for the entirety of the previous year. If they did, they can check a box. If not, they are asked to provide more detail: about how much coverage they had; whether they had been granted an exemption; or, if they owe penalties, how much.

Does no one remember the Reagan years? These kind of multimillion bashes seemed to be almost a monthly occurrence during the mid-and late-1980s (except for a brief blip following the Black Monday crash of 1987), with one mogul after another raising the party stakes for their Champagne-swilling, caviar-supping, Lacroix-wearing guests. Perhaps the most visible couple during the latter stages of the Reagan era was Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg, with the second Mrs. Steinberg often referred to in the news media as “the queen of nouvelle society.” In 1988, the Steinbergs were said to have spent $3 million (or roughly $6.1 million in today’s dollars) on the wedding of Saul’s daughter Laura to the real-estate heir Jonathan Tisch — a candlelight ceremony at the Central Synagogue on Lexington Avenue, with the bride and her 10 attendants dressed in gowns by Arnold Scaasi, followed by a sit-down dinner for 500 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that featured centerpieces of gilded magnolia leaves and spring branches. It was covered by the Metro Section of The New York Times, which stated simply, “It was a power wedding.” A year later, in August, 1989, Gayfryd spent $1 million on Saul’s 50th birthday party, held at their estate in Quogue, on Long Island, in a tent decorated as a Flemish drinking hall with 10 tableaux vivants of Saul’s favorite old masters and about 250 of their best friends in attendance, including the commerce secretary Robert A.

103,"White House misconduct. Sensational leaks. Battling broadsheets. The swirling story around President Trump’s dealings with Russia is being compared in journalism circles to past blockbusters like Watergate and the Monica Lewinsky scandal — with a 21st-century twist. News organizations like The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN are jousting for scoops, but instead of sending clerks to grab the early editions from newsstands, editors watch the news unfold on Twitter in real time. Anonymous sources are driving bombshell stories, but leaks are springing from encrypted iPhone messaging apps rather than from meetings in underground parking garages. The news cycle begins at sunrise, as groggy reporters hear the ping of a presidential tweet, and ends sometime in the overnight hours, as newspaper editors tear up front pages scrambled by the latest revelation from Washington. In consequence and velocity, the political developments of the past four weeks — has it been only four weeks? — are jogging memories of momentous journalistic times. “There is this sense of urgency and energy that I feel now that reminds me of being 29 and in a very different situation: in the middle of a revolutionary situation in Russia,” said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, who was a correspondent for The Washington Post in Moscow during the collapse of the Soviet Union. “I’m not saying it’s a revolution now. But there is this uncertainty about what is happening minute to minute, day to day.” “There is this sense that every day is going to bring something startling, if not calamitous,” he added. For journalists anxious about the state of their profession, there is a renewed sense of mission. Newspapers are seeing a sharp rise in subscriptions. Television news, once dismissed as a dinosaur in the internet age, is thriving. Rachel Maddow’s audience on MSNBC is up 79 percent from a year ago, with her show pulling more than two million viewers a night for the past two weeks.

Trump embraced the hackers who had leaked Hillary Clinton’s emails to the press, declaring at a rally in Pennsylvania, “I love WikiLeaks!” To the cheering throngs that night, Mr. Trump marveled that “nothing is secret today when you talk about the internet.” The leakers, he said, had performed a public service by revealing what he called a scandal with no rival in United States history. Now, after less than four weeks in the Oval Office, President Trump has changed his mind. At a news conference on Wednesday and in a series of Twitter postings earlier in the day, Mr. Trump angrily accused intelligence agencies of illegally leaking information about Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, who resigned after reports that he had lied about conversations with the Russian ambassador. “It’s a criminal action, criminal act,” Mr. Trump fumed at the White House. In a Twitter message, he asserted that “the real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” But this is Washington, where leaks are common currency — and, depending what side you’re on, either sinister or patriotic. Democrats these days see the proliferation of leaks about the Trump administration as the acts of public servants revealing the misdeeds of a presidency. Republicans see them as the reckless actions of disgruntled bureaucrats eager to advance their own agendas and sabotage Mr. Trump. Either way, Mr. Trump’s presidential flip-flop follows a landmark month for Washington leaks. Drafts of his executive orders floated around the city for days before he signed them.

105,"President Trump came forward with a nonsensical statement on Wednesday as he dangerously backed away from the two-state solution, which has been central to America’s Mideast policy for more than 20 years and remains the only just answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “So, I’m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like,” Mr. Trump, who has no experience in Middle East peacemaking, said at a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, adding, “ I can live with either one.” There is no conceivable one-state solution that both parties will like. Smiling by Mr. Trump’s side, Mr. Netanyahu, who has steadily undermined the prospect of a Palestinian state, clearly believed his vision was the one the new American president had in mind. The two leaders seemed almost giddy in their first official meeting, which was intended to show how Mr. Trump can be a better friend to Israel than President Barack Obama was, even though Mr. Obama completed a new 10-year, $38 billion defense agreement with Israel. Mr. Trump voiced optimism about getting a “great peace deal” between Israel and its neighbors. While Mr. Trump did urge Mr. Netanyahu to “hold back” on settlements in the West Bank and said Israel must make compromises, he offered no details on any peace initiative, and the vagueness of his remarks suggests he has no inkling of how to move forward. His willingness, however, to lend credence to those who would deny a separate state to the Palestinians will certainly make peace harder to achieve. Palestinians have long sought their own state and are sure to reject the idea of having their lands annexed by Israel, even if offered some kind of limited autonomy. The two-state solution began to take shape after the 1993 Oslo accords and was endorsed by President Bill Clinton in 2001. As recently as December, the United Nations Security Council reaffirmed its “vision of a region where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/opinion/inching-toward-a-one-state-solution.html?searchResultPosition=90

SoftBank, the Japanese technology and telecommunications conglomerate, scooped up a New York-listed private equity firm this week. HNA Group, the Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate, took a piece of a New York hedge fund company last month, a week after buying a New Zealand investment company. And HNA has tossed its hat into the ring to acquire a British insurer and its asset management unit. Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder of SoftBank, wants to create a “Berkshire Hathaway of the tech industry.” In January, he met with President Trump, then the president-elect, pledging to invest $50 billion in the United States and to create jobs there as part of a new $100 billion investment fund called SoftBank Vision Fund. For the lower-profile HNA Group, which has interests in cloud computing companies, airlines and hotels, the acquisition of the SkyBridge Capital hedge fund of funds firm last month was part of what it described as a strategy to “build a global asset management business.” The small spurt of deals is occurring as Asian companies look for expertise on where to invest their stockpiles of money and hone their ambitions to become financial conglomerates. Several of these multibillion-dollar firms have hired New York banks to help them find investments that include private equity and insurance.

107,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies, according to administration officials, an effort that members of the intelligence community fear could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview. The possible role for Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, has met fierce resistance among intelligence officials already on edge because of the criticism the intelligence community has received from Mr. Trump during the campaign and since he became president. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump blamed leaks from the intelligence community for the departure of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, whose resignation he requested. There has been no announcement of Mr. Feinberg’s job, which would be based in the White House, but he recently told his company’s shareholders that he is in discussions to join the Trump administration. He is a member of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council. Mr. Feinberg, who has close ties to Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, declined to comment on his possible position. The White House, which is still working out the details of the intelligence review, also would not comment. Bringing Mr. Feinberg into the administration to conduct the review is seen as a way of injecting a Trump loyalist into a world the White House views with suspicion.

108,"In history, this is where Congress steps in. During the Vietnam War, Watergate and the Iran-contra scandal, when a president’s actions or policies crossed the line, Congress investigated and held the White House to account. The time has come for it to do so again. In the last week alone, Americans have witnessed the firing of President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and learned with shock and incredulity that members of Mr. Trump’s campaign and inner circle were in repeated contact with Russian intelligence officials. Coming on top of credible information from America’s intelligence agencies that Russia tried to destabilize and influence the 2016 presidential campaign, these latest revelations are more than sufficient reason for Congress to investigate what Moscow has been up to and whether people at the highest levels of the United States government have aided and abetted the interests of a nation that has tried to thwart American foreign policy since the Cold War. Given that context, one might expect Mr. Trump to be clamoring for details that would eliminate any suspicion that his administration is in league with an enemy. Instead he has waged an unhinged attack on the intelligence agencies themselves, praising President Vladimir Putin of Russia at every turn and pointing fingers everywhere but at himself, while refusing to take a single step to resolve questions about his administration’s ties to Russia. Hence the urgent need for high-level congressional intervention. The ideal vehicle would be an investigative committee of senior senators from both parties as well as members of the House. Some Senate Republicans are beginning to step up. Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has already said his committee will investigate the election hacking. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Dianne Feinstein, the panel’s top-ranking Democrat, are asking for a briefing and transcripts of Mr. Flynn’s calls to the Russian ambassador.

But if his supporters on the right were beginning to doubt him, there was no sign of it on conservative talk radio, where Mr. Trump’s contention that he was a victim of leaks and entrenched Washington insiders lit up phone lines around the country. “There is no evidence for the primary assertion that is driving this entire attack on Trump,” Rush Limbaugh, the prominent conservative radio host, said on Wednesday afternoon. “This attack is coming from the shadows of the deep state, where former Obama employees remain in the intelligence community.” In another accusation, he said, “They are lying about things, hoping to make it easier for them and the Obama shadow government to eventually get rid of Trump and everybody in his administration.” How much of conservative America agreed with that particular defense was unclear. But the underlying thrust of the allegations — that Mr. Trump has liberal enemies who want to see him fail, and that they include the news media — appeared to strike a chord with talk radio listeners on Wednesday. “The media is road blocking Trump and his administration in every which way possible,” said a woman who called in on Mr. Limbaugh’s show on Wednesday. “And not that anything is illegal or illegitimate; it’s just they’re digging and digging.” Americans are bitterly divided and often see events through their partisan lenses.

Activists and groups in cities across the country have picked up the call, reposting fliers found online, and in some cases organizing demonstrations to coincide with the event. Several activists said that they did not know how the campaign began or how many people would heed it, and that as far as they knew, there was no national organization behind it.

It may not be as dramatic as the torrent of political news out of Washington; an improving economy, after all, announces itself through a series of data releases that are just a little bit better than people were expecting. But that’s exactly what has happened. In consumer spending, the job market and manufacturing, the economy seems to be enjoying consistent, broad-based growth to start the year. There could always be a setback, of course, but the momentum is almost uniformly positive as the Trump era gets underway. Some of the factors at work may turn out to be temporary. Energy prices were near recent lows a year ago, and their recovery since has meant oil exploration and related fields are recovering. Similarly, the effects of a steep run-up in the value of the dollar from 2014 to early 2015 have now worked their way through the economy and aren’t holding back manufacturing the way they once were. An unusually warm winter is probably a factor in some of the good numbers, as people who in a normal year would have hunkered down amid snowstorms instead went shopping.

Last week, Russian warplanes flew at an usually low altitude over an American guided missile destroyer in the Black Sea, according to a spokesman for the United States European Command. It was a pattern of harassment that Western officials say has been increasingly common as NATO works to strengthen its defenses against a resurgent Russian military. Relations also have been strained by the Russian deployment of a ground-launched cruise missile in what American officials say is a violation of the 1987 treaty banning intermediate-range American and Russian missiles based on land. The Russians have denied the complaint. The meeting between the military chiefs took many months to arrange, and its utility is a matter of debate among military experts.

Organizers with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers failed to persuade a majority of about 3,000 union-eligible Boeing workers in the state to vote for the union amid enormous pressure from management. Boeing said 74 percent of the more than 2,800 workers voting rejected the union. Many analysts say that Boeing decided to put its second Dreamliner aircraft assembly line in the state to reduce the leverage of the machinists’ union, which represents Boeing’s work force in the Puget Sound region of Washington State and has used work stoppages to exact concessions from the company in the past. South Carolina is one of the least unionized states in the country. Hoyt N. Wheeler, an emeritus professor of business at the University of South Carolina who taught labor relations and employment law, said in an interview before the vote that a victory would be “highly significant” because “one of Boeing’s motivations for coming to South Carolina was to escape the union.” The election took on added significance because of the emphasis President Trump has placed on domestic manufacturing, and on Boeing in particular. The president has called out the company over the cost of the new Air Force One program it is developing, and he recently sought to pit Boeing against Lockheed Martin to hold down the cost of the F-35 fighter jet.

Still, that investors have chosen to ignore the chaos in Washington highlights just how deep is the belief (others might consider it wishful thinking) that Mr. Trump, at his root, is a president who will deliver market-friendly policies. “I fully get the euphoria — there has probably never been a more business-friendly president,” said Adrian Helfert, the head of global fixed income at Amundi Smith Breeden. “Lower taxes and less regulations are good for corporations and equity holders.” Since Election Day, the S.&P. 500 index is up over 9 percent, and with money continuing to pour into stocks from bond and money market funds, the bull market is showing few signs of letting up.

Every day there is a new round of questions and a new set of concerns that raise anxieties and lower trust. Every day it becomes ever more clear that it is right and just to doubt the legitimacy of this regime and all that flows from it. The latest round involves the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, who this week was forced to resign following disclosures about his communications with the Russian ambassador on the same day that then-President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for its interference in our election to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton. The official reason given for requesting Flynn’s resignation was, according to the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer: “The president was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others.” Spicer continued later, “The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for General Flynn’s resignation.” Spicer further stated, “The White House counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue, but rather a trust issue.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/opinion/drip-drip-drip.html?searchResultPosition=101
121,"The number of extremist groups active in the United States rose for the second year in a row last year, propelled in part by the mainstreaming of far-right rhetoric by the Trump campaign, particularly on topics like immigration and Islam, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the United States. The number of anti-Muslim groups grew the most, almost tripling to 101 in 2016 from 34 in 2015, in part because of President Trump’s 2015 proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla. There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the center said in its annual report. The number of organized anti-government groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 percent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015. That decline was a consequence of the increasingly mainstream presence of policy ideas and conspiracy theories about Islam and immigrants that originated on the political fringe, researchers said. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, said Mr. Trump’s election had been “absolutely electrifying to the radical right.” “Trump has co-opted many of the issues of the radical right, and that has prevented or at least slowed the growth of these groups,” Mr. Potok said. He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed right-wing hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember.” Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign with a series of divisive claims, including a June 2015 speech that referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” That December, he proposed fighting terrorism with a Muslim ban, a sharp departure from past presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who said jihadist groups did not represent all Muslims. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/hate-groups-increase-usa.html?searchResultPosition=102

This is not about Mike Flynn. It is about the president who appointed him, who earlier considered Flynn for vice president. The latest revelation of frequent contacts between the Trump team and Russian intelligence should be a wake-up call to Republicans as well as Democrats. When Vice President Mike Pence was asked by Chris Wallace of Fox News on Jan. 15 if there had been any contacts between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, he answered: “Of course not. Why would there be any contacts?” Great question, Mr. Vice President. Look, there’s a great deal we don’t know, but Russian interference in our election is potentially a bigger scandal than Watergate ever was. Watergate didn’t change an election’s result — President Richard Nixon would have won anyway in 1972 — while the 2016 election was close enough that Russian interference might have tipped the balance. We don’t know whether the Russians had domestic help in their effort to steal the U.S. election, but here are a few dots that are begging to be connected: First, the American intelligence community agrees that the Kremlin interfered during the campaign in an attempt to help Donald Trump. This isn’t a single agency’s conclusion, but reportedly a “strong consensus” among the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the director of national intelligence.

Haley, said in answer to a question after a United Nations Security Council meeting devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “But we are thinking out of the box as well, which is — what does it take to bring these two sides to the table, what do we need to have them agree on?” she said. She said nothing about what that approach would be, nor did she go any further in revealing a coherent picture of United States policy on the conflict, one of the most intractable in the world. The day before, Mr. Trump hinted at a new regional effort aimed at bringing the two sides together, but he said he would not insist on the creation of a Palestinian state. “I’m looking at two-state and one-state,” he said. “I like the one that both parties like.” Both Ms. Haley’s and Mr. Trump’s remarks were in sharp contrast with warnings from other diplomats, including the United Nations envoy entrusted to help the two sides find a path out of their long, bitter conflict.

Growing up in Mississippi in the 1960s, Prof. Valerie Grim was only too familiar with racism. So when she discovered flyers from a white nationalist group posted outside her office at Indiana University Bloomington, she wasn’t intimidated. Instead, she was curious about what had led someone to post flyers depicting Michelangelo’s David along with the phrase “Let’s become great again” and the name of Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group, outside offices in the university’s department of African-American and African diaspora studies. The group’s name, symbol and Twitter handle were also written on the whiteboard on Prof. Grim’s door. “This is someone who really got a wrong view of history,” says Professor Grim, who teaches African-American history. She wishes she could invite those responsible for the flyers into her office for a conversation: “Don’t hide behind a flyer. Come in, let’s talk.” Identity Evropa is one of several groups that appeared last year, seemingly in response to President Trump’s candidacy, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The number of hate groups operating in the United States rose from 892 in 2015 to 917 in 2016, the center reported on Wednesday. Identity Evropa has ties to other white nationalist groups in the United States and abroad. The founder of the group, Nathan Damigo, attended the summit of the National Policy Institute, the white nationalist group run by Richard Spencer, in Washington in November. Identity Evropa has ideological similarities to anti-Muslim “identitarian” movements in Europe, and links to identitarian literature on its website.

Now, less than a month into President Trump’s administration, it’s become something to be ducked, at least for some. As the Dallas Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram: “It’s a tough situation for C.E.O.s. You want to make nice with the president because you’re a public company and you have shareholders, and it’s hard to balance doing the right financial thing versus doing what they think is the right thing, whatever your political beliefs are.” Mr. Cuban, the billionaire investor and star of the reality TV show “Shark Tank,” has been engaged in a running Twitter feud with Mr. Trump. In the latest volley, the president tweeted that Mr. Cuban “backed me big-time but I wasn’t interested in taking all of his calls,” and “He’s not smart enough to run for president!” A Trump invitation “has become a double-edged sword because the population is so divided,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who organizes meetings of chief executives there. Things seemed different as recently as December, when the Blackstone Group’s chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, announced the formation of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, whose members would “meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge,” as Mr. Schwarzman put it at the time. Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump’s candidacy.

Mr. Trump himself referred to the ship at a marathon news conference on Thursday, saying that his critics probably think “the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country’s going to say, ‘Oh, it’s so great.’ That’s not great. That’s not great.” A Coast Guard official on Thursday said the presence of the intelligence ship, called the Viktor Leonov, so close to American shores is not unprecedented, and is not a cause for alarm. The vessel has been traveling along the Eastern Seaboard and was spotted near the states of Connecticut, Virginia and Delaware. Capt. Andrew Tucci, who oversees Long Island Sound and coastal Connecticut, said the Coast Guard knew the Russian ship had been traveling from the Caribbean “for some time.” “This vessel was transiting all up the Eastern Seaboard, and the Coast Guard and other military and federal government agencies are aware,” Captain Tucci said.

128,"Science and technology have powered America’s economic engine for more than 70 years. But federal support has been getting leaner. The nation is spending about 60 percent of what it did 30 years ago on federal research and development as measured against the total economy. In other words, this spending is becoming a smaller percentage of the gross domestic product. That’s a big problem, because many of our global competitors in Europe and Asia have been ramping up their research spending with a goal of knocking us off our scientific and economic pedestal. Now President Trump is in the position to do something about it. During his campaign, he hammered away at the historically slow growth of the American economy during the Obama years. He repeatedly pledged to speed up the pace of that trajectory. Increasing investments in long-term scientific research, long a federal responsibility, can help him deliver on his pledge. The nonpartisan Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscored the importance of such investments when it noted that it ranked the United States only 10th on its global innovation index largely because of flagging support for long-term research. The funding pinch is causing us to become more risk averse and forgo wagers on transformational technologies — such as high-capacity multi-electron batteries — that could pay off in a big way if they succeed. It is also allowing our vaunted science and technology infrastructure to decay. The greatly oversubscribed Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for example, has been waiting almost a decade for a desperately needed second “target station” to meet the needs of materials research so critical to industry. But before President Trump takes the science plunge, he needs to get the best and most honest advice he can. He should start by appointing his own science adviser, someone he trusts who has the professional stature, respect and breadth of knowledge commensurate with the complexities of the job and holds sensible views on climate change. He also needs to fully staff the Office of Science and Technology Policy, as every president has since Gerald Ford. And he should maintain the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology that has reported directly to every president since George H. W. Bush. Not only do those two offices ensure that a president receives quality analysis and timely professional advice, but they also insulate him from lobbyists.

We are conscious, however, that a central tenet of the declaration has all but been forgotten over the intervening decades: respect for the status of (Arab) Palestinians. The increasing inability of Israel to address this condition, coupled with the expansion into Arab territory of the Jewish settlements, are major factors in growing anti-Semitism around the world. If this situation is to have a chance of being neutralized, Israel must respect the United Nations resolutions (the same United Nations that gave Israel legitimacy 70 years ago) and look to allow the Palestinians their own state. Of course, this will mean disruption and Israeli political upheaval, and it’s disappointing that this week President Trump looked more like Janus on the issue. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu owes this to the millions of Jews around the world who suffer essentially because of the results of internal Israeli politics, as well as to the unenfranchised Palestinians. Thus, we don’t believe that the declaration centenary can be properly celebrated this year unless progress is made, and soon.

133,"When Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin of Our Teeth” had its Broadway premiere in 1942, directed by Elia Kazan and starring a dream cast led by Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March, the critic Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it “one of the wisest and friskiest comedies written in a long time.” When it returned in 1955, with Helen Hayes and Mary Martin, Mr. Atkinson deemed it simply “perfect.” After that, though, the play’s fortunes fell. On its third and most recent Broadway outing, José Quintero’s 1975 revival starring Elizabeth Ashley, the Times critic Mel Gussow dismissed it as “simplistic.” Boundary-breaking in its day, it has long been scarce on professional stages. So Arin Arbus’s new Off Broadway production for Theater for a New Audience, in previews at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn, is a rare chance for re-evaluation. With a cast of 35 (!) and original music by César Alvarez (“Futurity”), it follows the members of the Antrobus family of suburban New Jersey through the ice age in Act I (their pets are a mammoth and a dinosaur; freezing refugees clamor at the door) and into a great flood in Act II. The third act opens amid the ruins of a war. With each calamity, the Antrobuses have to figure out whether and how to survive. Jeffrey Horowitz, the founding artistic director of Theater for a New Audience, said he didn’t choose the play with topicality in mind. But Wilder had his own suspicions about when it resounds most powerfully. As he explained in the 1950s, in a preface to his collection “Three Plays”: “It was written on the eve of our entrance into the war and under strong emotion, and I think it mostly comes alive under conditions of crisis.” Several admirers of the play spoke recently about why “The Skin of Our Teeth” endures, what makes it problematic and why this could be a ripe time for its resurgence.

135,"President Trump said Thursday that he had personally directed the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation and determine who was responsible for what he said were illegal leaks that have unfairly damaged his fledgling administration. “I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks,” Mr. Trump said during a contentious, 75-minute news conference at the White House. “Those are criminal leaks.” No law forbids a president from making a criminal referral to the Justice Department, but it is unusual for a president to direct the agency to open a criminal investigation into his perceived opponents or to talk publicly about having done so. The White House, under presidents of both parties, has generally restricted direct contact with the Justice Department about prospective investigations to avoid the appearance of politicizing law enforcement. Typically, if an agency believes that classified material from its own records was improperly disclosed, it will make a referral to the Justice Department, which decides whether to open an investigation.

Mostly, everyone complied. They used their own eyes to see the silent, unsmiling girls do the walk of, not shame, exactly, but kind of, in thigh-high dresses that ranged from ribbed knits to beads, sequins and lace, all under granddad jackets in plaid or cord. Sometimes they had shearling collars; sometimes, fur arms. They were largely in shades of brown and rust.

All together it was a look. Taken apart and in the shop, it will add up to a lot of product, a lot of it good. But any excitement generated was crushed under the general Weltanschauung. Sound familiar? Afterward everyone shuffled silently out the door, where it turned out the models were all perched on a Park Avenue sidewalk, special matching cellphones trained on the exiting invitees, as what would have been the show soundtrack blared from some speakers.

Shermichael Singleton, who was one of the few black conservatives in the Trump administration, had been working at the Department of Housing and Urban Development since Jan. 23 as a senior adviser. He was preparing a cross-country tour for Mr. Carson, who is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this month. But according to the two people briefed, Mr. Singleton’s background check had not been completed. As it was being finished this week, Mr. Trump’s advisers turned up public writings by Mr. Singleton that appeared during the later stages of the campaign in which he was deeply critical of the candidate. “My party in particular has allowed itself to be taken over by someone who claims to be a Republican but doesn’t represent any of our values, principles or traditions,” he wrote in The Hill in October 2016. The firing was reminiscent of the decision by the White House to block a senior Republican foreign policy adviser, Elliott Abrams, from becoming deputy secretary of state. The move came after Mr. Abrams’s anti-Trump writings came to the president’s attention. Mr. Abrams had been the choice of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. A person close to Mr. Singleton said an initial vetting of the 26-year-old by HUD and White House personnel had come up with his criticism. He answered a number of questions regarding the article and expressed remorse for the piece and support for Mr. Trump. But a second look may have done him in. On Wednesday, Mr. Singleton was presented again with the piece and told it was the reason for his termination. Reached by phone, he would say only, “I can’t talk about that.” A spokesman for HUD confirmed Mr. Singleton’s position and said only that, “As of Feb. 15, 2017, he is no longer with the department.” Mr. Singleton plans to return to a previous job he held as a vice president with Howard Stirk Holdings, a media company run by Armstrong Williams, a conservative media personality and close friend of Mr. Carson’s.

142,"The question put to President Trump at a White House news conference on Wednesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was pretty straightforward. An Israeli reporter wanted to know about the rise of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States and concerns that the new administration was encouraging xenophobia and racism. For a normal American politician, the moment offered a perfect opportunity for a home run. Condemn the behavior and make a sincere pledge to do everything possible to stop it. There is no question that hate crimes and malicious speech have accelerated since the presidential campaign, with Jews among the prime targets. The Anti-Defamation League says anti-Semitic talk in the United States has reached levels unseen since the 1930s. And there have been bomb threats against Jewish centers across the country. Mr. Trump, alas, is not that politician. He lacks the principles and moral understanding that most Americans want to see in their presidents. In fact, his answer summed up just how far we have traveled from normal. As is so often the case, he began with a focus on himself and skirted the issue. “Well, I just want to say that we are, you know, very honored by the victory that we had — 316 Electoral College votes,” Mr. Trump said. “We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270. And there’s tremendous enthusiasm out there.” It was as if his brain had short-circuited or someone had hit some internal replay button in his brain.

143,"Republicans in Congress have been saying for months that they are working on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in the Trump era. Now we have the outline of that plan, and it looks as if it would redirect federal support away from poorer Americans and toward people who are wealthier. A white paper drafted by House leadership and the staff of the House and Senate committees that oversee health policy details a structure that could replace large sections of the Affordable Care Act. Crucially, the proposal largely contains provisions that could be passed through a special budget process that requires only 50 Senate votes, and fulfills President Trump’s promise that the repeal and replacement of the law would take place “simultaneously.” The plan would make major changes in how health care is financed for Americans who don’t get coverage from work. It would greatly expand the number of Americans who could benefit from federal help in buying health insurance, but it would change who benefits most from that support. Obamacare, as the A.C.A. is known, extended health coverage to 20 million Americans through two main mechanisms. It expanded Medicaid coverage to Americans below or just above the poverty line in states that participated, and it offered income-based tax credits for middle-income people to buy their own insurance. Obamacare was a redistributive law, transferring money from rich to poor. The Republican plan would alter both of those programs, changing the winners and losers. It would substantially cut funding for states in providing free insurance to low-income adults through Medicaid. And it would change how tax credits are distributed by giving all Americans not covered through work a flat credit by age, regardless of income.

The provocative — many said racist — campaign was kicked off last month by retired Israeli generals and senior officers to shake Israelis out of apathy. President Trump accomplished something similar over the course of just a few seconds on Wednesday, when, standing beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, he declared that he was “looking at two-state and one-state” formulas for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “I like the one that both parties like,” he added, seemingly overturning decades of American policy centered on the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Purposefully or not, Mr. Trump had suddenly implied that the long-proposed solution of two states did not really matter. By Thursday, Israelis and Palestinians were feverishly debating what might come next, still confused about American policy after Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R.

Speaker Paul D. Ryan and two House committee chairmen stood with the new secretary of health and human services, former Representative Tom Price of Georgia, preparing Republican lawmakers for a weeklong Presidents’ Day recess that promises to be dominated by angry or anxious questions about the fate of the health law. But the talking points they provided did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs. It also included no estimates of the number of people who would gain or lose insurance under the plan, nor did it include comparisons with the Affordable Care Act, which has extended coverage to 20 million people. With the House proposal’s rollback of Medicaid payments to the states, it appears likely that the number covered would be smaller.

147,"UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest health insurers, is accused in a scheme that allowed its subsidiaries and other insurers to improperly overcharge Medicare by “hundreds of millions — and likely billions — of dollars,” according to a lawsuit made public on Thursday at the Justice Department’s request. The accusations center on Medicare Advantage, a program through which people 65 or older agree to join private health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.s, whose costs the government reimburses. The program was created in 2003 after UnitedHealth and other insurers said that managed care could help contain the overall cost of Medicare, which has strained the federal budget by rising faster than the rate of inflation. Instead of slowing Medicare costs, UnitedHealth may have improperly added excess costs in the billions of dollars over more than a decade, according to the lawsuit, which was unsealed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles. A spokesman for UnitedHealth disputed that assertion, saying it was based on faulty interpretations of Medicare rules. “We reject these more than five-year-old claims and will contest them vigorously,” said the spokesman, Matthew A. Burns. He said the company served millions of Medicare Advantage members and was “proud of the access to quality health care we provided, and confident we complied with the program rules.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/business/dealbook/unitedhealthcare-improperly-took-money-from-medicare-suit-says.html?searchResultPosition=22
148,"WASHINGTON — President Trump took aim at reporters on Thursday for more than an hour at an impromptu White House news conference. “The press has become so dishonest,” he said, and not talking about it would be “doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.” He added that the “level of dishonesty is out of control.” In accusing the news media, though, Mr. Trump uttered several falsehoods of his own. Here is a list of some of the most important. Mr. Trump won 306 Electoral College votes (and ended up with 304 officially), well above the threshold needed to secure the presidency but well behind several of his most recent predecessors. President Barack Obama won 332 Electoral College votes in 2012 and 365 four years earlier. President Bill Clinton received 370 Electoral College votes in 1992 and 379 in 1996. And President George Bush won 426 Electoral College votes in 1988. When a reporter pressed Mr. Trump on the claim, he laid the blame elsewhere. “I was given that information,” he said.

149,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department told a federal appeals court on Thursday that it would not seek a rehearing of a decision that shut down President Trump’s targeted travel ban. Instead, the administration will start from scratch, issuing a new executive order, the department said. Last Thursday, a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked the key parts of the original executive order, which suspended the nation’s refugee program as well as travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The panel said the original ban was unlikely to survive constitutional scrutiny. The Justice Department said that the panel’s decision was riddled with errors but that the flaws it noted would be addressed in the new executive order. “Rather than continuing this litigation,” the Justice Department’s brief said, “the president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.” “In so doing,” the brief said, “the president will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation.” In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the new executive order would be issued next week. In its brief, the Justice Department urged the appeals court to await the new order and then vacate last Thursday’s decision.

150,"When Donald J. Trump was campaigning for president, he said that he wanted “to put H&R Block out of business” by simplifying the income tax laws. But tax simplification isn’t a simple task, and while Mr. Trump singled out the company again on Wednesday, saying it would not be happy with what he had in mind, changing the tax code isn’t something he can do by himself. The tax law, which has thousands of sections and subsections, is just that: law. A new law, or a change to an existing one, must be passed by both houses of Congress before it is signed by the president. There is not much doubt that some changes are coming to the tax code, though the all-important details aren’t clear. The House Republican leadership released a tax plan outline last year, while Mr. Trump has said that he will work with Congress to pass what he calls the Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act, provisions of which he proposed in September. On Thursday, he said that “tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly” but that dealing with the Affordable Care Act had to come first. He said that would happen next month. The two plans differ — for instance, on whether to limit deductions for real estate taxes and mortgage interest. The changes that may actually result are still a mystery.

151,"For anyone who thinks that Republican control of the presidency, the Senate and the House of Representatives means that an overhaul of the tax code will zip through at bobsled speed, there is an important phrase to remember: “Blah, blah, blah, blah.” That was the reaction of the Republican speaker of the House, John A. Boehner of Ohio, in 2014 to a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code proposed by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee — and a member of his own party. Republicans remain united in their desire to cut taxes, simplify the system and recover some of the $2 trillion in untaxed profits that American companies have stashed overseas, out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. And the possibility of a once-in-a-generation makeover of the rules governing both business and personal taxes provides powerful motivation. Still, despite their grip on power, they are far from united in how to accomplish those goals. “Just because there’s an ‘R’ in the White House, an ‘R’ in the House and an ‘R’ in the Senate doesn’t mean they’re from the same alphabet,” said Douglas Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae. This time around, the speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Ways and Means chairman, Kevin Brady of Texas, have both taken ownership of a House blueprint for transforming the tax code, currently a masterpiece of complexity, inefficiencies and inequities. But several Republicans have misgivings about specific provisions, not to mention the cost. As for the White House, the most predictable response is unpredictability. The president said his administration would release a “phenomenal” tax plan in a couple of weeks. Mr. Brady has indicated that he wants to introduce comprehensive legislation by March and pass a bill before the August recess — perhaps suggesting the existence of an alternate congressional universe with no gridlock.

He pledged that he would push Facebook, which has more than 1.8 billion users worldwide, in a direction that would help convince individuals and governments that “progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.” The letter comes close to a political statement by a chief executive who, as the leader of a global company, is essentially arguing against a tide of isolationism that is rising across the world. Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, chose to make the statement as an update to his original founder’s letter, which was published in 2012 when Facebook went public.

For a president who has already lost a court battle, fired an acting attorney general and a national security adviser, and lost a cabinet nomination fight, Mr. Trump was eager to demonstrate that he was still in command. He attacked judges for blocking his original travel order and Democrats for obstructing his nominations. He denied being anti-Semitic even when no one accused him of it. With the latest Pew Research Center poll showing that just 39 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing, Mr. Trump at one point plaintively pleaded for understanding. “The tone is such hatred,” he said, referring to the commentary about him on cable television. “I’m really not a bad person.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/trump-news-conference.html?searchResultPosition=30

For nearly an hour, viewers saw a gay man in shadows describing the tragedy of his life, psychiatrists who depicted homosexuality as a debilitating mental illness and a harrowing clip of a distraught 19-year-old soldier being driven to jail after his arrest on a charge of soliciting sex in a public restroom. “The average homosexual — if there be such — is promiscuous,” Mr. Wallace told his audience. “He is not interested in, nor capable of, a lasting relationship like that of a heterosexual marriage.” A more contemporary examination of gay life in America comes to network television later this month, in an eight-hour avalanche of prime time spread across four nights, and with a decidedly different take on the subject. Written by a prominent gay filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, “When We Rise” is a 50-year history of the gay rights movement beginning on Feb. 27, told through four characters who suffer — and often triumph over — family rejection, landlord discrimination, gay-bashing, police harassment, legislative defeats and AIDS. But the world is a different place than it was when ABC first commissioned the project four years ago. Barack Obama was in the White House, and gay leaders were celebrating a series of court and statehouse victories, which would soon include the Supreme Court’s recognizing a constitutional right to marry by same-sex couples. After President Trump’s election, questions that seemed largely settled about gays in American society — same-sex marriage, equal treatment in the workplace and in housing — suddenly seem in doubt. Mr. Trump is hardly a champion of gay rights, and Mike Pence, his vice president, has a record of explicit opposition to gay rights measures.

For everyone alarmed by Donald Trump’s rise, James Comey and Senator John McCain — two Republicans who hate being seen as partisans — were deeply disappointing figures in 2016. The details of both stories are familiar by now. Comey is the F.B.I. director who made the dubious decision to focus national attention on Hillary Clinton’s email server just 11 days before the election. McCain is the once-maverick senator who, despite being personally maligned by Trump, rallied to his side in the campaign. And both Comey and McCain have emerged as central players in the emerging Russia scandal. In an Op-Ed, the journalist Tim Weiner calls them the two people who have “the power and the will” to compel testimony from Michael Flynn, Trump’s deposed adviser, over his Russian contacts and Trump’s. Comey is in this role because an F.B.I. investigation of Flynn helped cause his downfall and the investigation has reason to continue. McCain is in the role because he is “a Cold Warrior who dislikes the idea of cozying up to the Kremlin and is preparing for hearings on Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election,” Weiner writes. Comey and McCain obviously aren’t the only people with the power to investigate the extent of the collaboration between Russia and Team Trump. Other Republicans, including Senate leaders and committee chairmen, have that power, as well. Like Comey and McCain, they now face another character test. A foreign country, and not a friendly one, appears to have accumulated undue influence at the highest levels of American government. Because Republicans control both houses of Congress, only they really have the power to address the situation, which is as alarming as any political situation in a long time. Will they be willing to do so? For more, Charles Blow, Nick Kristof and the Editorial Board all write about Russia today.

In a statement Wednesday night from Jared Kushner’s brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer, the family made clear that it would not proceed with the deal. “Our family has been friends with Jeff Loria for over 30 years, been in business together and even owned an AAA baseball team together,” Mr. Meyer said. “Although the Kushners have made substantial progress in discussions for us to purchase the Marlins, recent reports suggest that Mr. Loria will soon be nominated by the president to be ambassador to France,” he said. “If that is true, we do not want this unrelated transaction to complicate that process and will not pursue it,” he said. “The Kushners remain interested in purchasing a team and would love to buy the Marlins at another time.” Aides to Mr. Trump declined to respond to an email seeking comment. The overlap of official government work and private businesses of Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump has been one of concern for ethics watchdogs.

162,"JERUSALEM — The Benjamin Netanyahu on the White House podium Wednesday was the Netanyahu of old. Though politically weakened at home, the Israeli prime minister seemed uncharacteristically relaxed and self-confident. The smiles, the handshakes, the joking reference to President Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal” and the prime minister’s grandfatherly banter with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, this was the Netanyahu whom Israelis have not seen in years. By opening the news conference with a reference to the Jewish people’s painful history, President Trump afforded the prime minister an opportunity to do what he does best, what he did when he first took the world stage as Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in 1984. The president gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a chance to make the case for the legitimacy of the Jewish people’s return to their ancestral homeland. That was more than a rhetorical opportunity. For Mr. Netanyahu and many Israelis, Palestinian denial of that legitimacy is the real reason for the failure of the peace process. From the White House and in the presence of a sympathetic president, the prime minister was finally able to assert that the Palestinian commitment to a two-state solution has long been a hoax, that the Palestinians have employed two narratives, one for international consumption and another for Palestinians at home. Despite his international protestations, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority (like Yasir Arafat before him), has consistently denied that the Jews have a historic connection to the Temple Mount. Far more than arcane arguments over historical minutiae, the Arafat-Abbas tradition of denying a longstanding Jewish link to Jerusalem is the Palestinian’s inimitable way of saying that the Jews are simply the latest wave of Crusaders, that Israel is nothing but a colonialist presence in the Middle East. Just as the crusaders and colonialists of the past ultimately departed, the argument goes, so too will the Jews. The belief that President Abbas sees the two-state solution as a steppingstone to a one – Arab – state solution leaves many Israelis cynical about the peace process and tiring of the rhetoric about two states. Mr. Trump may have shifted that momentum. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/opinion/netanyahu-feels-at-home-at-the-white-house.html?searchResultPosition=62
163,"BONN, Germany — By the time Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson decided that he wanted to join his counterparts at an important global gathering in Bonn — his first trip overseas as America’s top diplomat — all the good hotel rooms in this small German city had been taken. So Mr. Tillerson and his entourage of temporary State Department helpers took rooms at a rambling health clinic and spa next to a public bathhouse in the picturesque town of Bad Neuenahr, more than 20 miles outside the city — a bit like holing up in Beltsville, Md., for a conference in Washington. The remoteness of the location fit with the growing distance between the Trump administration and its European counterparts on such issues as immigration, refugees, defense and trade. Indeed, so much uncertainty has crept into what had been close relations that Mr. Tillerson largely dispensed with the usual gushing and grinning news conferences with his counterparts on Thursday at the gathering of foreign ministers from countries in the Group of 20. The meeting was called to lay the groundwork for the summit meeting of leaders of G-20 countries in Hamburg in July. With the Russians, though, Mr. Tillerson repeated what has become an increasingly hard line in the administration against the kind of warming ties that President Trump presaged in his campaign. In brief remarks after meeting the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, Mr. Tillerson said that Russia needed to honor its commitments to “de-escalate the violence in Ukraine.” In a separate statement with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea, Mr. Tillerson also denounced North Korea’s latest ballistic missile test and promised that the United States would defend its allies with the “full range of its nuclear and conventional defense capabilities.” In his own remarks, Mr. Lavrov emphasized that Russia and the United States could cooperate in some areas, and said that while the issue of sanctions was not discussed, those pushing sanctions should weigh “how much the artificial desire to politicize this subject meets the interests of the countries concerned.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/world/europe/rex-tillerson-russia.html?searchResultPosition=61

After the presentation by Ms. Downey, a nanny in Philadelphia, Ms. Mathurin took the microphone. “I want you to stand up and close your eyes,” Ms. Mathurin said in her singsong Caribbean accent. “I want you to picture yourself exactly how you see yourself, and I want to tell you some things about yourself. “I want you to know that you are beautiful. I want you to know that you are enough.” Some of the nannies called out in agreement. “I want you to know that you are all woman. And while you are doing this, I want you to exhale.” Ms. Mathurin, 43, is the founder of My Nanny Circle, a grass-roots group that focuses on the training and empowerment of caregivers. The organization is not political, but on this particular Saturday, it was impossible to ignore the events that had unfolded in Washington the day before.

165,"SINALOA, Mexico — Not long ago I met a small-time rancher here in the birthplace of Mexican drug trafficking. I asked him if he ever made it to the United States. He said he had been deported several years ago and couldn’t return. He was caught smuggling black-tar heroin in his shoes at the Tijuana-San Diego border crossing, he said. Wasn’t much — not quite a kilo. He did this to raise the money to buy a couple of cows, or a tractor. In Sinaloa, he said, cobblers do a thriving side business cutting compartments in the soles and heels of shoes and filling them with heroin. There’s a market for this work because so many farmers and ranchers — conservative folks, respectful of tradition — subsidize their small-time agriculture with drug money. Almost every other farmer for miles around did the same, he said. He had smuggled drugs 50 times before he was caught. He spent two years in federal prison and then was deported. As he spoke, I thought about the wall Donald J. Trump wants to build at the Mexican border. Today we struggle with a national epidemic of opioid and opiate addiction, first to narcotic painkillers overprescribed by doctors and now to heroin. As I’ve toured America talking about our opiate scourge, I’ve encountered many people who believe a wall will stop heroin from coming north. Walls, in fact, have been shown to stop people.

167,"It first spread on social media, rippling through immigrant communities like the opposite of fear and rumor: a call to boycott. In the New York region and around the country, many cooks, carpenters, plumbers and grocery store owners decided to answer it and not work on Thursday as part of a national “day without immigrants” in protest of the Trump administration’s policies toward them. The protest called for immigrants, whether naturalized citizens or undocumented, to stay home from work or school, close their businesses and abstain from shopping. People planned for it in restaurant staff meetings, on construction sites and on commuter buses, but the movement spread mostly on Facebook and via WhatsApp, the messaging service. No national group organized the action. “It’s like the Arab Spring,” said Manuel Castro, the executive director of NICE, short for New Immigrant Community Empowerment, which works primarily with Hispanic immigrant day laborers in Jackson Heights, Queens. “Our members were coming to us, asking what the plan was. Frankly, it kind of came out of nowhere.” But what began as a grass-roots movement quickly reached the highest levels of federal government. In Washington, the Pentagon warned its employees that a number of its food concessions, including Sbarro’s, Starbucks and Taco Bell, were closed because immigrant employees had stayed home and that they could expect longer lines at restaurants that were open. Restaurants, from San Francisco to Phoenix to Washington, D.C., were some of the most visible spots affected, with well-known chefs closing some of their eateries for the day in support. Rick Bayless, the Chicago chef and owner of the Frontera Grill, closed several of his restaurants and said he would give a portion of the revenue from the ones that remained open to an immigrant and refugee rights group. “What really makes our country great is the diversity we experience here,” Mr. Bayless said in an interview. “I can’t say enough about the lack of respect and the fear-mongering and hate-mongering that I’m sensing around us these days.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/nyregion/day-without-immigrants-boycott-trump-policy.html?searchResultPosition=57
168,"If Mayor Bill de Blasio’s State of the City speech on Monday night was the opening act of his re-election campaign, one thing seemed clear to some critics: New York schools won’t get much attention. In a speech that ran to over 8,000 words, a mere 214 of them were devoted to education. Mr. de Blasio promoted the city’s high school graduation rate, which reached a record high of 69.6 percent last year. He boasted about his successful expansion of prekindergarten and cited progress toward his goal of bringing Advanced Placement courses to all high schools. And he alluded to his effort to build new schools in overcrowded neighborhoods. He did not mention that black and Hispanic students still graduate from high school at far lower rates than their white and Asian counterparts — 64.6 percent and 63.5 percent, compared with 80 percent and 83.3 percent. Or that only half of the students who do graduate are prepared for college-level work, according to the standards of the City University of New York. Nor did he argue for the importance of renewing mayoral control of schools, which is set to lapse on July 1 if Albany does not extend it, or of the state providing the city the additional $1.6 billion in annual school funding that it is owed under a 2006 court ruling. There was not a word about his $760 million school turnaround program, known as Renewal. Aaron Pallas, a professor of sociology and education at Columbia University Teachers College, said he interpreted the decision to focus the speech narrowly on affordable housing and jobs as an effort to target the economic concerns that appear to be foremost in the minds of voters in the city and nationally. But he said it could also reflect that the mayor doesn’t have a distinct vision for the schools heading into a possible second term. In Mr. de Blasio’s first term, the prekindergarten expansion, which he first proposed as a mayoral candidate, was “clearly the major policy to be implemented, and I think that has been successful,” Professor Pallas said. “But in other respects I don’t think there’s been a very clear agenda with regard to the direction of the school system.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/nyregion/de-blasios-state-of-the-city-has-critics-asking-what-about-schools.html?searchResultPosition=42
169,"Since Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, a flurry of executive orders, court rulings, presidential nominations and confirmation hearings have brought questions about the roles of the three branches of government to the center of national discourse. Even teenagers think “civics is cool” again, according to this Times article: In this lesson, students use current events to analyze how our constitutional system of checks and balances works, and they investigate executive orders to see how these particular presidential actions fit within that system. How are you teaching this topic? Let us know. _________ Before moving forward with this lesson, students need to understand some basic concepts about the U.S. government. To gauge how much background you will need to teach, you might first ask your students to do a K/W/L chart listing what they know, or think they know, about this topic already. In short: The principle of separation of powers is the underlying reason the federal government is divided into three branches (executive, legislative and judicial), with each branch wielding different powers established in the Constitution. This division of powers among the three branches operates as a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power. For example, the president can negotiate a treaty with a foreign government, but the Senate has to approve it for the treaty to become binding. And, if a president commits treason or bribery, Congress can impeach him or her. The Government Publishing Office provides a primer on the three branches and the system of checks and balances. This diagram offers a helpful illustration, and the Crash Course video above can provide more depth. You can find many more resources online, such as this lesson from the National Archives and this one from EDSITEment, that include activities like studying the grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence (to understand the colonists’ desire to prevent another kingship), watching Schoolhouse Rock’s “Three-Ring Circus,” and analyzing past events to see how checks and balances have operated in history (such as during school desegregation in the 1950s and the declaration of war after the attack on Pearl Harbor). Once students have an understanding of checks and balances, they are ready to do the activities described below.

170,"WASHINGTON — President Trump escalated his attacks on the intelligence community on Thursday, promising to catch the “low-life leakers” who have supplied the “fake news media” with information on his administration’s ties to Russia, information that he dismissed as a political excuse for Democratic losses. In a Twitter rant that extended into work hours, Mr. Trump at once dismissed the entire Russia story as “fake” and made up, and pledged to hunt down the officials in the government who have supplied the details. He demanded an apology from the “failing” New York Times and accused the news media of making up stories and sources, even as he said he wanted those sources apprehended. The posts, which started around 7 a.m. and stretched past 9 a.m., appear calculated to antagonize intelligence agencies and keep supporters trained on the news media. The president is planning a campaign rally in Florida on Saturday. Republican leaders may be growing weary. In an interview with the conservative Weekly Standard, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Mr. Trump’s approval ratings — abysmal for a new president at around 40 percent — would be “10 to 15 points higher if he allowed himself to stay on message.” Mr. McConnell singled out the president’s Twitter comments. “What he’s saying makes everything harder,” the majority leader said.

Appearing before senators for his confirmation hearing, Mr. Friedman — a former campaign adviser who has aligned himself with the Israeli far right and questioned the need for a two-state solution — spoke broadly of regretting his language and promised to be “respectful and measured” if confirmed. “The inflammatory rhetoric that accompanied the presidential campaign is entirely over,” he said. Mr. Friedman came under fire last year for an op-ed he wrote for the website of Arutz Sheva, an Israeli news organization, in which he said supporters of the liberal Jewish lobbying organization J Street were “far worse than kapos,” the Jews who cooperated with the Nazis. As prolific as he is provocative, Mr. Friedman has also drawn condemnation for lobbing accusations of anti-Semitism against President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and others.

176,"WASHINGTON — The Senate hearing on Judge Neil M. Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court will begin on March 20, the Judiciary Committee said on Thursday, setting the stage for one of the most contested judicial confirmations in a generation. Democrats, still angry that Republicans refused to allow President Barack Obama to fill the seat over the last 11 months of his presidency, have vowed tough questioning of Judge Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump on Jan. 31. Despite the judge’s strong legal credentials, some Democrats are likely to oppose him, with many people on the left demanding that they push back against Mr. Trump in any way they can. Democrats have also argued that the court seat was effectively stolen by Senate Republicans, who refused to hold hearings or a vote on Mr. Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Republicans hold a 52-seat majority in the Senate, but they would need some Democratic votes to reach 60 and break a possible filibuster. That raises the prospect that Republicans could change Senate rules to prohibit, for the first time in two centuries, the use of the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. Mr. Trump has encouraged Republicans to employ this so-called nuclear option. The vacancy that Judge Gorsuch would fill, left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, is on track to be the longest opening on the court since the 1860s. Justice Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016, and the March 20 date means that the hearing would begin 401 days later. Questioning of Judge Gorsuch will begin on March 21, and the hearing will last three or four days. A confirmation vote by the full Senate would not be held any earlier than April. The longest Supreme Court vacancy in the past century and a half was 391 days, after the resignation of Justice Abe Fortas in 1969. If not for the blocking of Judge Garland, Judge Gorsuch, 49, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, might not be considered a contentious choice. Democrats who have met with him say he has failed to sufficiently answer some basic questions they believe are critical to making a proper assessment of him, including whether he would serve as a check on what they view as Mr. Trump’s overreach. “The judge was clearly very smart, articulate and polite, with superb judicial demeanor,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, wrote in an Op-Ed in The New York Times. “But over the course of an hour, he refused to answer even the most rudimentary questions.” In the last 25 years, the closest Supreme Court confirmation vote was 58 to 42, for Justice Samuel A.

182,"IOWA CITY — This article has been updated to reflect news developments. Since the election of Donald Trump, the Republican Party has embarked on a concerted attack on organized labor and public education. Republican senators have introduced a “right to work” bill that would extend the anti-union provisions common in Southern states to the rest of the country. Betsy DeVos, the newly confirmed secretary of Education, is a strong advocate of privatizing public schools. At the same time, Republican statehouses are redoubling their efforts to gut public universities. Take Iowa, where we live, and where Republicans control both branches of the state legislature. On Thursday, lawmakers passed a bill that, if signed into law by Gov. Terry Branstad, would drastically reduce the collective bargaining rights of most of the state’s public employees. The proposed law would allow government agencies to unilaterally reduce or eliminate the health insurance and other employment benefits of more than 180,000 public servants, including nurses, schoolteachers and college instructors. The bill is similar to an anti-union push by Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, which by some accounts reduced public-sector workers’ take-home pay by about 10 percent. At the University of Iowa, where we are graduate students and unionized public employees, this assault on organized labor threatens not only our compensation, but also the quality of our education and that of our students. The Iowa Writers’ Workshop and the nonfiction writing program, where we are students, have put our state on the global literary stage. Together, the programs have produced numerous Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award and Man Booker Award winners. This remarkable record is possible in part because Iowa, unlike many universities, offers M.F.A. students a living wage, excellent health care and a full scholarship. This funding package allows the university to recruit some of the world’s most promising writers and ensures that Iowa remains accessible to students from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds.

183,"STRASBOURG, France — Declaring that “the whole world benefits from a strong E.U.,” Justin Trudeau on Thursday became the first sitting prime minister of Canada to address the European Parliament, underscoring their close ties even as Britain prepares to leave the European Union and as President Trump celebrates the fracturing of the 28-nation bloc. Mr. Trudeau, who talked about the “important bedrock of common values” of peace and justice shared by Canadians and Europeans, did not once mention Britain, the Commonwealth (of which Canada is a member) or the United States in the prepared text of his 1,500-word speech. It was a subtle indication, perhaps, of the reshaping of the trans-Atlantic order, and the world itself, by the political events of 2016. Mr. Trudeau’s speech here in Strasbourg, a potent symbol of the French-German alliance that is at the core of the European Union, came a day after the European Parliament ratified a landmark trade deal that many economists and other observers see as a counterweight to the protectionist policies supported by Mr. Trump. Seven years in the making, the deal slashes tariffs on industrial and agricultural products and opens up the services sector in areas like cargo shipping, telecommunications and financial services. And yet it nearly fell through: In October, Mr. Trudeau had to postpone a trip to Brussels until concessions were made by the Belgian government, including promises to protect farmers that put the deal back on track. Mr. Trudeau indirectly alluded on Thursday to the anxieties that have propelled populist movements, especially immigration, which is a major worry for the British voters who decided to leave the European Union and for the American voters who put Mr. Trump, a political outsider, into the White House.

184,"WASHINGTON — Moving quickly after his first choice for labor secretary withdrew his nomination amid controversy, President Trump made a seemingly safe selection on Thursday in R. Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general. In Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump has chosen a nominee with deep experience in labor relations, law and education. The pick answers concerns about the lack of diversity in the Trump administration, in that Mr. Acosta would be the first Hispanic in the president’s cabinet. And his chances of being confirmed appear relatively high, since Mr. Acosta, currently the dean of Florida International University’s law school, has made it through the Senate process three times for different roles. “Alex is going to be a key part of achieving our goal of revitalizing the American economy, manufacturing and labor force,” Mr. Trump said as he called on the Senate to confirm Mr. Acosta swiftly. A Miami native, Mr. Acosta’s most relevant experience to the job of labor secretary is his time at the National Labor Relations Board, where he was a member from 2002 to 2003, under President George W. Bush. Mr. Bush later tapped Mr. Acosta to be assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil rights division, one of the highest positions at the agency. He went on to become the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where his office prosecuted the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the terrorism suspect Jose Padilla and founders of the Cali cartel. He achieved the conviction of Charles Taylor Jr., the son of Liberia’s former leader, for torture. His official biography said his office also prosecuted several bank-related cases and targeted health care fraud. Mr. Acosta’s record and writings will undergo close scrutiny in the weeks before his confirmation hearing. But some of the most outspoken skeptics of the previous labor nominee, the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder, have already expressed optimism and open-mindedness about Mr. Acosta.

187,"Whom do federal immigration agents despise more: former President Barack Obama, or the immigrants whose lives are in their hands? That uncomfortable question came to mind as I read articles over the past week of the growing numbers of raids, roundups, the knocks on the door, the flooding of “target-rich environments,” a phrase an anonymous immigration official used in speaking to The Washington Post. What’s a target-rich environment? “Big cities,” the official explained, “tend to have a lot of illegal immigrants.” Clearly, with President Trump’s executive orders having expanded the category of immigrants deemed worth pursuing and deporting, the gloves are off. There’s been plenty of news coverage of this development, but few reminders of the context in which the pursuers have been freed from previous restraints. So it’s worth noting that the union representing some 5,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents actually endorsed Mr. Trump in September, the first time the union endorsed a candidate for president. In an inflammatory statement posted on the Trump campaign’s website, Chris Crane, president of the union, the National ICE Council, complained that under President Obama, “our officers are prevented from enforcing the most basic immigration laws.” The statement went on to say that while Mr. Trump had pledged in a meeting to “support ICE officers, our nation’s laws and our members,” Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan was “total amnesty plus open borders.” That everything in that statement except for the reference to Mr. Trump was untrue is not the point. (Far from failing to enforce the law, the Obama administration deported more than 400,000 unauthorized immigrants a year, and Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival endorsed neither total amnesty nor open borders.) Rather, the statement is evidence of how openly these law enforcement officers have been chafing at the bit to do their jobs as they please.

188,"Why is immigration such a problem for the Democratic Party? The issue splits traditional Democratic constituencies. It pits groups with competing material interests against each other, but it also brings those with vested psychological interests into conflict as Hispanics, African-Americans, labor and liberal advocacy groups clash over their conception of territoriality, political ownership and cultural identity. In the fall of 2015, as the presidential campaign began to heat up, Hillary Clinton broke with the Obama administration over its ongoing deportation of undocumented immigrants. During an appearance on Telemundo on Oct. 5, Clinton told María Celeste Arrarás that Obama’s policies were too punitive: Clearly, Clinton’s attack on Obama’s relatively stringent deportation policy was devised to maximize Hispanic turnout in the 2016 election. Did the strategy work? The evidence is mixed. A comparison of national exit polls from 2008, 2012 and 2016 shows that Hispanic turnout grew slightly, from 9 percent of the total vote in 2008 to 10 percent in 2012 to 11 percent in 2016. But any gain that might have accrued to Clinton from the increase was eliminated by the fact that her margin of victory among Latinos, 66 percent, was 5 points below Obama’s haul in 2012. In any analysis of the 2016 vote, it is difficult to separate the issues of immigration and free trade. In an October 2016 report, Pew found that Trump voters were decisively more hostile to both free trade agreements and immigration than the general public, and much more hostile than Clinton supporters. A detailed analysis of exit polls in four key states that helped deliver the election to Donald Trump — Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — produced interesting findings not only about Hispanics, but also African-Americans — who are less supportive of liberal immigration policies than other core Democratic constituencies — and whites. In each of these states, opposition to immigration was higher than the national average. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/opinion/the-democrats-immigration-problem.html?searchResultPosition=81

Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump said he could “live with” a one-state option for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, backing away from decades of American policy in the Middle East. The remarks, delivered at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, caused anger and bafflement among Palestinians. “This is going to give Israel a free hand to do what it wants,” an academic in Gaza said. _____ • In Brussels, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called on European allies to spend more on their militaries. “Americans cannot care more for your children’s future security than you do,” Mr. Mattis said in his first speech to NATO partners. Germany’s defense minister reacted by saying that European allies would meet their obligations “in the coming years.” And U.S. troops were deployed in Bulgaria yesterday as part of the largest U.S. military reinforcement of Europe in decades.

But not at a 120-year-old, six-story apartment building with low- and moderate-income tenants on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The basement boiler and electrical switchgear were flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and as winter approached that year, the building’s 30 apartments were without power, heat and hot water for weeks. “Everyone sheltered in place,” said Richard Ramirez, a senior property manager at the Lower East Side People’s Mutual Housing Association, the nonprofit that owns and manages the building at 334 East Eighth Street, near Tompkins Square Park. “Where else were they going to go?” The association, which runs 37 buildings in the area, did not want a repeat. So it installed a new gas-fired boiler, this time putting it in an enclosure on the roof. The boiler began supplying heat and hot water last month. Across the country, cellar-dwelling utilities are being moved farther and farther upstairs. In new buildings going up in identified flood plains, mechanical systems are being constructed at least several feet above expected flood levels. Even in existing buildings, plenty of retrofitting is underway. “These buildings are so precious,” said Laurie J.

192,"WASHINGTON — In an extraordinarily swift return to politicking after a tumultuous first month in office, the White House on Wednesday said President Trump will hold the first campaign rally of his four-week-old administration on Saturday. The rally, to be held in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla., is an indication that Mr. Trump, who has sometimes felt isolated in the White House, is eager to get outside of Washington and relive the rapturous reception that greeted him during the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump exulted in large crowds assembled at cavernous venues throughout his 2016 bid, and spent the first days of his presidency quibbling over how many Americans attended his inauguration. On Wednesday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump answered a question about whether his administration was flirting with xenophobia and racism in part by noting the support he received in the election. “I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had — 306 Electoral College votes,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s tremendous enthusiasm out there.” Not long after, in a posting on Twitter, Mr. Trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the Saturday evening event, which will take place just up the coast from his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach where he plans to spend the weekend.

193,"When “The Good Wife” had its premiere, there was a clear line from Hillary Clinton to Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies), the ambitious lawyer who came into her own after her politician husband’s sex scandal. But the show had another Clinton figure all along: Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), who hired, befriended and ultimately fell out with Alicia. A leonine liberal not allergic to money or a highball of fine Scotch, she rose in a boy’s club through alliances, compromise and knowing how much of herself to conceal. Diane begins “The Good Fight” ready for a change. Like certain other people of her political persuasion recently, she meets a less happy kind of change than she was expecting. But for her — and for this improbable but promising spinoff — it ends up being an invigorating new start. The series opens a year after the end of “The Good Wife,” in which Diane hauled off and smacked Alicia for revealing, in order to win a court case, that Diane’s husband, Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), had had an affair. Now, Diane is leaving her Chicago law firm and shopping — alone — for a retirement vineyard in Provence. That sounds like the premise of a typical TV spinoff (Frasier moving to Seattle, Rhoda to New York). But “The Good Fight” does not find Diane struggling to grow a decent carignan or getting to know her quirky Provençal neighbors.

194,"No serious fan of the sketch comedy show “Key & Peele” will be surprised that Jordan Peele (the shorter half of its starring duo) is making his directorial debut with a horror film. Their acclaimed Comedy Central series may have been best known for President Obama’s “anger translator,” but it often lampooned scary movies with a specificity that could come only from a connoisseur of things that go bump in the night. (No one has made a funnier parody of “The Shining.”) In his new movie, “Get Out,” he plays the scares straight, writing and directing the rare horror movie that tackles racial politics head on. In a scenario that has been described as “The Stepford Wives” meets “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), an African-American photographer, is about to meet his white girlfriend’s parents for the first time when he’s rattled to learn that she has not told them he is black. His anxiety increases when her father goes out of his way to tell him that he would have voted for Mr. Obama for a third term and when the forced smiles of the parents’ exclusively black servants start seeming a little uncanny. Racial micro-aggressions and ominous signs (bad dreams, dead animals) mount, as this fish-out-of-water story takes a foreboding turn. “Get Out” is not the first horror film to confront race. In 1968, right after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “Night of the Living Dead” resonated with audiences and some critics by presenting a black man’s torment by a mob of white zombies before he is killed by law enforcement. Other horror movies like “Candyman” and “Ganja & Hess” have explored miscegenation and assimilation, but Mr. Peele said he set out to make a movie that exposed “the lie” of a post-racial America, one that grew after the election of Mr. Obama. In an interview at a hotel bar near Columbus Circle, Mr. Peele, who turns 38 this month, recalled the time his white girlfriend took him to meet her parents, discussed why he wanted to make a horror movie for black audiences and explained why the movie takes aim at, in his words, the “liberal elite.” Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What do horror and comedy have in common? The best comedy and horror feel like they take place in reality. You have a rule or two you are bending or heightening, but the world around it is real.

After moving to start rolling back the Affordable Care Act just days after President Trump was sworn in last month, Republican lawmakers and Mr. Trump have yet to deliver on any of the sweeping legislation they promised. Efforts to come up with a replacement for the health care law have been stymied by disagreements among Republicans about how to proceed. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said his administration was running like a “fine-tuned machine” and he promised health care legislation would be offered in March, followed by a tax code overhaul. The large infrastructure bill that both Democrats and Mr. Trump were eager to pursue has barely been mentioned, other than a very general hearing to discuss well-documented needs for infrastructure improvements. Even a simple emergency spending bill that the Trump administration promised weeks ago — which was expected to include a proposal for his wall on the Mexican border — has not materialized, leaving appropriators idle and checking Twitter. At this point in Barack Obama’s presidency, when Democrats controlled Washington, Congress had passed a stimulus bill totaling nearly $1 trillion to address the financial crisis, approved a measure preventing pay discrimination, expanded a children’s health insurance program, and begun laying the groundwork for major health care and financial regulation bills. President George W. Bush came into office with a congressional blueprint for his signature education act, No Child Left Behind. But in the 115th Congress, the Senate has done little more than struggle to confirm Mr. Trump’s nominees, and Republicans ultimately helped force his choice for labor secretary, Andrew F.

196,"THE HAGUE — Harry van Bommel, a left-wing member of the Dutch Parliament, had persuasive allies in convincing voters that they should reject a trade pact with Ukraine — his special “Ukrainian team,” a gleefully contrarian group of émigrés whose sympathies lay with Russia. They attended public meetings, appeared on television and used social media to denounce Ukraine’s pro-Western government as a bloodthirsty kleptocracy, unworthy of Dutch support. As Mr. Van Bommel recalled, it “was very handy to show that not all Ukrainians were in favor.” Handy but also misleading: The most active members of the Ukrainian team were actually from Russia, or from breakaway Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine, and parroted the Kremlin line. The Dutch referendum, held last April, became a battering ram aimed at the European Union. With turnout low, Dutch voters rejected the trade agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, delighting Moscow, emboldening pro-Russia populists around Europe and leaving political elites aghast. It is unclear whether the Ukrainian team was directed by Russia or if it was acting out of shared sympathies, and Mr. Van Bommel said he never checked their identities. But Europe’s political establishment, already rattled by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the election of President Trump in the United States, is worried that the Netherlands referendum could foreshadow what is to come.

197,"ROCKY BOY’S RESERVATION, Mont. — For the herd of bighorn sheep, the rocky cliffs were a safe place, with 360-degree views and plenty of nooks to blend into the gray rocks. The ground was sprinkled with scat, and the air carried a scent like a barnyard. Thousands of feet below, the landscape unfurled into a smooth checkerboard of ranch land that stretched to the horizon. The only threat up here would be to newborn lambs, susceptible to being plucked away by eagles. Crouched behind a stand of rocks last spring, Brendan Burns, a 38-year-old with a growing reputation as sheep hunter and guide, peered over the edge, careful not to be seen or heard. Wild sheep have acute senses, and when they spook, they bolt as one, like a flock of birds. But the sheep were not home. Amid the panorama below, Burns spotted a constellation of tiny dots in a faraway meadow. The horns gave them away. “There aren’t a lot of circles in the wild,” Burns whispered. “When you see something curved — and they kind of shine, they have this kind of glow to them — you learn to pick them up. You just train your eye to it.” He pulled a high-powered Swarovski scope from his pack and aimed it downhill. Eight years before, there were no sheep here. Then 21 ewes and five juvenile rams were transplanted to the Rocky Boy’s Reservation of the Chippewa Cree, which straddles part of the Bears Paw Mountains, an islandlike rise on the plains. The herd quickly grew to 100, and 40 were relocated to South Dakota. It has again grown over 100, and another 40 are likely to be transplanted this spring, part of broad attempts to replant sheep populations that are a fraction of what they once were in the West. “There’s obviously no coyotes around, for them to be that low and feel comfortable,” Burns whispered. “This is a nice day to be a sheep.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/sports/bighorn-sheep-hunting.html?searchResultPosition=72
198,"Late last year I started reading a biography of Chester A. Arthur. Quickly, I began to feel as if I’d wandered into the plot of a Philip K. Dick novel, or succumbed to an especially unnerving fever dream. The book, by Zachary Karabell, tells the story of a deeply unpopular and untrustworthy New Yorker who, against all odds, achieves the presidency. Arthur, a mutton-chopped emblem of the political-patronage culture of the day, was never even elected to the highest office. His ascent was made possible by Charles J. Guiteau, the man who gunned down President James Garfield in a railroad station, thus promoting Arthur from the vice presidency. To contemporaries, the situation seemed dire. Arthur’s administration surely would be defined by unprecedented greed and corruption, full of woefully underqualified appointees lacking any experience in government. Even the most optimistic American could hardly have imagined that Arthur’s presidency would be a success. But as I continued reading, I was astonished to discover that Arthur redeemed himself. He championed civil-service reform, hobbling the “spoils system” with which he had been so closely associated. He restored faith in the presidency, and faith in what the presidency can restore in its occupants. “No man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur,” wrote the Gilded Age journalist Alexander K. McClure, “and no one ever retired ... more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe.” I finished the biography in late 2016, but found myself still carrying it with me as Donald J. Trump prepared to take office. I wasn’t rereading it, not exactly. Sometimes, when my dog lingered by a particularly intriguing tree, I’d open it up to a passage I’d marked. Other times, it served as a base for my phone, as if it were in conversation with the disquieting tweets I scrolled through. And during those notably edgy moments in late January, I’d hold onto it tight, like a security blanket, or just want it nearby, so that I could occasionally tap on it like a talisman. As an American historian, I’ve long relied on presidential biographies for edification and pleasure. If I’m using biographies to write a book or an essay, I have them propped up on a stand, next to my highlighters, pencils, Post-it Notes and paper clips. But now my work doubles as an antidepressant; these books are rife with the kind of horrors that led half of the country to believe, at any given time, that they were living out the end of the American experiment.

199,"KERN COUNTY, Calif. — A soft light was just beginning to outline the Tejon Hills as Bret Adee counted rows of wizened almond trees under his breath. He placed a small white flag at the end of every 16th row to show his employees where they should place his beehives. Every so often, he fingered the buds on the trees. “It won’t be long,” he said. Mr. Adee (pronounced Ay-Dee) is America’s largest beekeeper, and this is his busy season. Some 92,000 hives had to be deployed before those buds burst into blossom so that his bees could get to the crucial work of pollination. But it is notable that he has a business at all. For the last decade, a mysterious plague has killed billions of bees every year. “Every year at this time of year, we wonder are there going to be enough bees,” said Bob Curtis, director of agricultural affairs at the Almond Board, a trade group for almond growers. Pollination services, as the bees’ work is known in the industry, has risen this year to between $180 to $200 a hive from an average of $154 a hive in 2006, Mr. Curtis said.

200,"BRENTWOOD, N.Y. — After five teenagers were found dead in this Long Island town last year, murdered by the members of a transnational gang with ties to El Salvador, a local problem turned into a national flash point, a referendum on illegal immigration. Now, in the wake of President Trump’s broad executive orders on deporting undocumented immigrants, Suffolk County police officials are wrestling with a conundrum facing police departments across the country: how to shut down a violent gang when the immigrants they will need as witnesses and tipsters may be afraid to come forward. “The last thing I want is a fearful community,” the Suffolk County police commissioner, Timothy Sini, said in a recent interview. “Whether it’s fear of criminals or fear of law enforcement. We solve crimes based on people coming to us. It’s that simple. If people think they’re going to get deported every time they speak to a police officer, it’s not helpful.” Part of the issue is that Mr. Trump wants local police officers to act as immigration agents, threatening to withhold federal funding from those departments that do not cooperate. So Mr. Sini is far from alone in trying to balance public safety with the threat of losing millions of dollars in funding. Last month, the International Association of Chiefs of Police issued a statement saying that it would “strongly oppose any initiative that would mandate that state and local law enforcement agencies play a role in the enforcement of federal immigration law.” The chiefs urged “clear guidance” on how, or even whether, to make local policy changes. Sanctuary cities, which limit their agencies and local law enforcement officials from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, are facing a similar question.

But when she showed up this month at David Geffen Hall to see the Budapest Festival Orchestra, she was barred from attending when she refused to remove an 8-by-11-inch sign affixed to the back of her jacket. It read: “NO! In the name of humanity we refuse to accept a fascist America.” Ms. Heinz, 72, said she had been wearing the sign since she attended a protest outside Trump Tower in November. Though she had been looking forward to seeing the orchestra, partly because one of its cellists was almost stopped from entering the United States by President Trump’s travel ban, she said that, given a choice between the performance and the sign, she chose the sign. “At what point does one draw the line?” she said recently by phone. “We’re talking about freedom of expression.” Officials at Lincoln Center refunded Ms. Heinz’s ticket, but this week they declined to discuss why she had been blocked from the performance. Ms. Heinz, though, said in an interview that during a later meeting she had with center officials — arranged by the civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel — the institution’s vice president for concert halls and operations, Peter Flamm, told her that signs were not allowed inside the performance halls or on the plaza outside. The dispute seems to illustrate the conflict between those who view cultural institutions as bastions of free thought that should embrace activism and those who think that, to protect the primacy of the performance, political statements should be limited to those made by the artists and the art.

202,"PHILADELPHIA — My mother, Fran, is not a great one for selfies. But a few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and saw a new shot of my mom, grim of face and wet of hair, wrapped in a silvery warming blanket, in front of a row full of gym lockers. “Had to take refuge outside from pool during call-in threat that caused J.C.C. evacuation,” she’d written. “Pool and nursery school evacuated.” I went to my Facebook page to share Fran’s post and asked if anyone had more information. People did, but not just from Connecticut, where my mom was swimming at the Jewish community center in West Hartford. “Second time in two weeks down here at the J.C.C. in Delaware. My kids go to the preschool and have been evacuated both times,” one friend wrote. Another said: “I just got an alert that the J.C.C. in Marin, Calif., was evacuated due to a threat. The hate seems to be spreading like wildfire.” And another: “At 11:45 they evacuated our J.C.C. in West Bloomfield, Mich. I live directly across the street, and all seems quiet there.” On the day my mom was forced to get out of the pool, Jan. 18, 26 J.C.C.s in 17 states were the targets of bomb threats. Even if my mom hadn’t posted her wet-faced selfie, it would have felt personal. I’ve probably spent an entire year of my life in the J.C.C. in West Hartford. When I was 3 years old, I went to preschool there. When I was 15, I spent six weeks in Israel on a trip run by the J. When my first book was published, one of the first places to invite me to speak was my Jewish community center. I’ve now spoken in J.C.C.s from San Diego and San Francisco to St. Louis to Atlanta.

204,"MOSCOW — Russia’s Foreign Ministry got into the fake news business in a splashy way on Wednesday. No, not by creating it. That dark art seems to emanate from other, even more opaque branches of the Russian government. Rather, Maria V. Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, unveiled a new section on its website meant to highlight articles that it considers to be fake news, including one by The New York Times. Just in case anybody missed the point, each article on the Foreign Ministry website carried a big red label reading “FAKE” in English and a line saying that the information in the article “does not correspond to reality.” Russia actually announced something of a fake news double whammy, since the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told Parliament on Wednesday that the military had created a special task force assigned to wage information warfare, although he did not provide any details. That was no surprise to officials in the United States and Europe, who have been grappling with the Kremlin’s information warfare for at least the last two years. The Foreign Ministry’s new venture in singling out fake news seemed to fit a pattern identified by many analysts of creating alternative realities meant to sow confusion in people’s minds, in that way discrediting all news sources. It was hard for some critics to take the ministry’s fake news detector seriously, and some suggested that inclusion there was something of a badge of honor, an indication that the article had hit close to home.

Now, to satisfy a presidential campaign promise playing to America’s worst fears, we are terrorizing these contributors to our economy and breaking up families. Given that employers must certify worker eligibility under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, I suspect that only collusion or tacit government approval explains how we accumulated so many illegal foreign workers in the first place. Deporting dangerous criminals is one thing, but let’s not kid ourselves about the role that most of the people being demonized fill in our society. Given that President Trump’s own businesses have needed to import help, why can’t our representatives address this issue honestly and intelligently to achieve win-win outcomes for both employers and people simply seeking a better life? KATHLEEN CLARK Doylestown, Pa. To the Editor: I am a member of the National Guard and a lawyer practicing immigration law in Minnesota. In 2013, President Obama, at the express request of the Defense Department, created a program for military families to prevent the deportation of military spouses, parents and children. This program alleviated a major source of anxiety and fear for service members and their families. I have personally experienced the hardship of deployments to combat zones, and know the incredible importance of family stability during that trying time. This week, this administration rescinded the Parole in Place program, harming thousands of military families across the country. This is another example of the careless excess of the administration’s immigration policy. It is unconscionable to reverse a policy that strengthens our military and our veterans. That the program was not even named in the memo demonstrates either a lack of awareness, or worse, a casual disregard of the effect that this will have on those most vulnerable members of our military.

If you are divorced and both you and your ex are willing to be interviewed for this series, please fill out our submission form.  For Christine Langlois, 64, and Terry Langlois, 69, a midlife marriage hit roadblocks as optimism was crushed beneath old behaviors. For him, it was a fifth marriage, for her, a second. Still, as each recovered, they continued to mine their behavior for clues about future relationships while valuing a deep friendship, which endures. Where did they grow up? Terry grew up in Michigan, part of a blended family that he says didn’t blend. He worked in factories to put himself through college. Christine also grew up in Michigan, in a wealthy suburb; her father was a neurosurgeon and the family was well off, but her parents’ marriage wasn’t a happy one. They divorced after she left home. “But compared to Terry,” she said, “my upbringing was a walk in the park.” How did they meet? It was 2004, and they lived on the same street in Grand Rapids. One day while cycling she saw him with a friend on his porch. She stopped to say hello and a friendship blossomed, then a romance. He was dating someone else at the time, but soon stopped to have a relationship with her. They had a two-year courtship during which they broke up several times. What did they like about the other? “Terry is really smart, extremely funny, very giving, and the sweetest man you could ever meet,” she said. She also said “everyone in his presence feels better for being around him.” They laughed a lot, and were very attracted to each other. “Christine is classy, very intelligent and a life learner,” he said, noting that he admired her curiosity especially.

211,"The so-called Trump Bump, the stock market rally that has unexpectedly ignited the Dow Jones industrial average to soar close to 21,000 since President Trump’s election, has swept up in its powerful force lots of stocks, especially those of Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which are at, or near, record highs. Then there is Valeant Pharmaceuticals. It is trading near its record low, at around $16 per share, and at levels not seen in seven years. That has meant big financial trouble for one of its largest shareholders, Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund company managed by the billionaire William A. Ackman, whose efforts to salvage Valeant — and his reputation as a savvy investor — are looking increasingly desperate. While Mr. Ackman hailed Mr. Trump’s victory in a November interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times, he cannot be pleased that Valeant has been left behind in the latest round of market euphoria. Valeant has had a very rough 18 months or so: several management changes at the top; scandals involving Philidor, its specialty pharmacy subsidiary (two executives were indicted in November); and the scrutiny of a congressional panel on its practice, not unique in the industry, of driving up the prices of lifesaving drugs. What was once a market darling, favored by the best and brightest hedge fund managers, has fallen on some hard times. In August 2015, the stock reached over $260. Just a few months before hitting that milestone, Mr. Ackman’s Pershing Square, worth roughly $11 billion, had poured some $3.2 billion into Valeant’s stock, at an average price of around $190 per share. Pershing Square still owns around 18.1 million shares, a 5.3 percent stake, currently worth about $301 million. At its peak, Mr. Ackman’s stake in Valeant was worth around $4 billion. Valeant’s collapse has put a serious dent in the publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings’ 2016 performance, which was down 13.5 percent, net of fees. During the same 12 months, the Dow was up 13.4 percent, and the broader market index, Standard & Poor’s 500, was up nearly 12 percent. In 2015, Pershing Square Holdings’s returns plummeted 20.5 percent. Needless to say, this is not the kind of performance investors pay top dollar to receive. (Known for his flamboyant, and frequent, television appearances, as well as lengthy public presentations about his latest investments, Mr. Ackman seems to be taking a different approach so far this year. Without disclosing their names, he has made two large investments recently, equal to 13 percent of his capital, or around $1.4 billion. The first one, he informed investors, is already up 22 percent through Jan. 24.) At first, Mr. Ackman’s involvement with Valeant made him look like a genius.

Tillerson arrived in Mexico on Wednesday, twin threats hung over the frayed relationship between the two nations: President Trump’s new orders to round up and deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally, and a separate effort to take a hard look at all American aid to Mexico, possibly using it to pay for a border wall instead. By Friday, American officials are required to finish calculating all the money and grants that the United States provides to Mexico, a task that Mr. Trump first demanded in the executive order he signed last month directing the construction of a border wall. The Trump administration, which set the Friday deadline in an internal State Department memo this month, has not explicitly said why it ordered the review. But its inclusion in the executive order mandating that a wall be built suggests that Mr. Trump has linked the two issues — and may be looking for more leverage in negotiations with Mexico. The timing adds to the deep tensions between the two countries. Mr. Tillerson, the top American official to visit Mexico since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, arrived with John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, only a day after the Trump administration released documents ordering a crackdown on immigration in the United States.

Two lobbying groups representing auto manufacturers have written letters urging the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, to reverse a decision last month by the Obama administration to move forward with tougher fuel-economy standards that carmakers are supposed to meet by 2025. Automakers contend the gas-mileage targets will be difficult and expensive to hit and will force them to produce more high-mileage cars at a time when most Americans are buying sport utility vehicles, trucks and other roomy models that are less fuel-efficient and more profitable. The Obama administration’s fuel-economy targets “threaten to depress an industry that can ill afford spiraling regulatory costs,” Mitch Bainwol, the chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, wrote in a letter on Tuesday. The group represents 12 manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. A second letter was sent by the Association of Global Automakers, which represents 12 foreign car companies with significant operations or sales in the United States. Environmentalists said the lobbying groups overstated the difficulty and cost of reaching the 2025 targets, which require an average fuel-economy rating of 54.5 miles per gallon across a company’s entire fleet sold in the United States.

219,"MISSION, Tex. — The visitor splashed by boat along the Rio Grande, straddling the rippling borderline, unseen in a procession of patrol vessels. To the right of him, on the Texas side, sat a row of moldering barbecue equipment and a feral cat. To the left, the tall brush of Mexico swayed in a too-faint breeze. Unlike most political trips to the border, including President Trump’s as a candidate, there was no phalanx of cameras trailing Speaker Paul D. Ryan on his first visit here. Reporters had not been allowed on the tour, and until Tuesday evening, Mr. Ryan’s office would not even confirm he was coming. But by 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, there he was: the congressional steward of Mr. Trump’s promised wall, wading through a narrow passage of the natural border, mostly undocumented. The furtive visit came as the Trump administration set off this week to reshape the nation’s immigration policy, authorizing the expulsion of undocumented immigrants who have committed even minor offenses and making it easier to deport people immediately. Yet the centerpiece of the president’s plans, the border wall that helped define his campaign, will rise or fall in places like this — a waterway where many experts believe a physical barrier is unwise — and with people like Mr. Ryan, who control the purse strings on Capitol Hill and have not always echoed Mr. Trump’s hard line.

No driving, period — not when a broken taillight could deliver the driver to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It is happening on Staten Island, where fewer day laborers haunt street corners in search of work; in West Phoenix’s Isaac School District, where 13 Latino students have dropped out in the past two weeks; and in the horse country of northern New Jersey, where one of the many undocumented grooms who muck out the stables is thinking of moving back to Honduras. If deportation has always been a threat on paper for the 11 million people living in the country illegally, it rarely imperiled those who did not commit serious crimes. But with the Trump administration intent on curbing illegal immigration — two memos outlining the federal government’s plans to accelerate deportations were released Tuesday, another step toward making good on one of President Trump’s signature campaign pledges — that threat, for many people, has now begun to distort every movement. It has driven one family from the local park where they used to play baseball in the evenings, and young men from a soccer field in Brooklyn where pickup games were once common. It has kept Meli, 37, who arrived in Los Angeles from El Salvador more than 12 years ago, in a state of self-imposed house arrest, refusing to drive, fearing to leave her home, wondering how she will take her younger son, who is autistic, to doctor’s appointments. “I don’t want to go to the store, to church — they are looking everywhere, and they know where to find us,” said Meli, who asked that her last name not be used out of fear of getting caught. “They could be waiting for us anywhere.

222,"It will cost the New York Police Department significantly less to provide presidential protection and to guard Trump Tower than the city had initially estimated, according to the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill. In a letter to members of the New York delegation to Congress seeking reimbursement for the Police Department’s expenses, Commissioner O’Neill noted that it had cost the police about $24 million to provide security to President Trump and his family in New York as well as to guard Trump Tower during the two and a half months between Election Day and Inauguration Day — a figure well below the $35 million that the police had initially estimated. The letter, dated Tuesday, includes detailed estimates about the Police Department’s expenses associated with presidential security. On days when Mr. Trump is not in the city, the department estimates that it costs $127,000 to $146,000 a day “to protect the first lady and her son while they reside in Trump Tower.” On days when Mr. Trump is in New York City — he has not yet returned since his inauguration — the Police Department anticipates “an average daily rate of $308,000.” That would come out to about $50 million a year if Mr. Trump avoided returning to Manhattan, or just over $60 million if he began returning on weekends. Mr. O’Neill’s letter did not provide an itemization of the costs associated with providing presidential security, but a good chunk of it appears to be payroll costs associated with maintaining a police presence around Trump Tower, which is on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th streets. Mr. O’Neill’s letter notes that “Trump Tower itself now presents a target to those who wish to commit acts of terror against our country, further straining our limited counterterrorism resources.” So far, the federal government has reimbursed the city for about $7 million.

223,"WASHINGTON — Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, President Trump’s new national security adviser, is considering a reorganization of the White House foreign policy team that would give him control of Homeland Security and guarantee full access to the military and intelligence agencies. Just days after arriving at the White House, Mr. McMaster is weighing changes to an organization chart that generated consternation when it was issued last month. One proposal under discussion would restore the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to full membership in a cabinet-level committee, according to two officials who discussed internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity. Another likely change would reincorporate the Homeland Security Council under the National Security Council, the way it was during the administration of President Barack Obama, the officials said. The decision to separate the Homeland Security staff, they said, was primarily a way to diminish the power of Mr. McMaster’s predecessor, Michael T. Flynn, who resigned last week. Now that Mr. Flynn is out and Mr. McMaster is in, both councils may report to him. Left uncertain is what, if anything, will happen regarding Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, who has played a major role in shaping foreign policy. Under the original organization plan last month, Mr. Bannon was invited to attend any National Security Council meeting led by the president and was made a regular member of the so-called principals committee of cabinet secretaries. One senior official supportive of Mr. Bannon’s position said it would not change under any reorganization. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said this week that Mr. McMaster would have full authority to organize his staff, but that any change in Mr. Bannon’s status would have to be approved by the president.

But you’re going to want to use a spoon to get every drop of the crazy.” He played a clip in which Mr. Trump declared, “I inherited a mess.” Mr. Colbert answered: “No, you inherited a fortune. We elected a mess.” Mr. Fallon began NBC’s “The Tonight Show” in bronzeface as Mr. Trump, squinting and head-bobbing, hitting many of the same highlights, but much less pointedly. “We inherited a mess,” he said. “It is such a mess. Not even a giant Roomba could clean it up.” Drinking from a water glass held in a tiny prop hand, he added: “I’ve just made my new secretary of labor Beyoncé.

Duncan Jones, the late musician’s son, accepted the trophy and dedicated it to “all the kooks and all the people who make the kooks.” Mr. Bowie, he said, had “always been there supporting people who think they’re a little bit weird.” Adele’s most recent album, “25,” which swept the Grammys this month, won the same Brit last year, while Beyoncé, the most nominated artist at this year’s Grammys, was only up for best international female artist on this night. (She won, but did not attend the ceremony or provide a video message accepting the honor like her international male counterpart, Drake.) The absence of such pop titans allowed the Brits, Britain’s top pop music prize, to focus more on smaller, more localized acts, such as the pop group Little Mix (who won best British single for “Shout Out to My Ex,” which they also performed) and the singer Rag’n’Bone Man (who took home the British breakthrough act award). The Scottish singer Emeli Sandé won best British female solo artist and the electro-pop stars the 1975 won best British group, beating Radiohead, who have oddly never won a Brit Award. “People in pop are told to stay in their lane when it comes to social issues,” said Matt Healy, the 1975’s singer, in his acceptance speech. “But if you have a platform, don’t do that.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/arts/music/brit-awards-winners-performances.html?searchResultPosition=78
226,"WASHINGTON — The American economy appears to be avoiding the kind of winter swoon that has become an annual event in recent years, a turn for the better that could encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising its benchmark interest rate sooner. At the Fed’s most recent meeting, on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, “many participants” wanted to increase the benchmark rate “fairly soon” if the economy continued to grow, according to minutes published Wednesday. But the minutes stopped short of suggesting a rate increase was likely at the Fed’s next meeting, in mid-March. They said that a core group of Fed officials remained cautious about the economic outlook, seeing balanced risks of faster and slower economic growth. “The committee has been quite patient, and I believe that has served us well,” Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, said in separate remarks on Wednesday. But now, the risks seem more in balance, he said, and “I see it as appropriate to gradually tighten policy as long as the economy continues to behave roughly as expected.” The minutes of the Fed meeting, published after a standard three-week delay, portrayed an economy that appears to be gaining strength, although it is still far from booming. The unemployment rate was little changed in the last year, standing at 4.8 percent in January, even as the economy added an average of 190,000 jobs a month in the second half of 2016, indicating that more people were returning to work. The minutes also cited “a high level of optimism” among business executives, which was attributed to “the expectation that firms would benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policy.” For the most part, however, companies were still waiting for Washington. Although a few companies had reported increased capital spending, the minutes said that most, “while optimistic, intended to wait for more clarity about federal policy initiatives before adjusting their capital spending and hiring.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/business/economy/federal-reserve-minutes.html?searchResultPosition=92

Had he been on American soil, there’s no question constitutional principles could be invoked in seeking justice for his death. Should those principles not apply because he was standing on the other side of the border? That was the question the Supreme Court considered on Tuesday, during oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by Sergio’s parents, who believe they should have a right to get justice for his killing. The court’s decision in this case could have implications for President Trump’s travel ban, which targets noncitizens who are outside the country. On the day he was killed, Sergio, a Mexican citizen, was playing with friends in the culvert separating El Paso, Tex., and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The agent who shot him, Jesus Mesa Jr., claimed it was self-defense, but cellphone videos of the shooting refuted that account, showing that Sergio was 60 feet away, and unarmed, when Mr. Mesa shot him in the head. American prosecutors declined to charge Mr. Mesa because his bullet hit Sergio in Mexico. Mexican prosecutors charged Mr. Mesa with murder, but the Obama administration refused to extradite him. Sergio’s family filed a civil suit against Mr. Mesa for violating Sergio’s rights under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits the unreasonable use of lethal force, and the Fifth Amendment, which bars the taking of life without due process.

It’s hard to think of a place that was less relevant to Mr. Trump’s fortunes in 2016. Mrs. Clinton’s success in Orange County, and in well-educated and Hispanic areas elsewhere in the Sun Belt, helped her win the popular vote — though there was no payoff in the Electoral College. But it’s districts like these that will decide whether the Democrats can make a serious run at control of the House. There is no guarantee that the Democrats can put the House in play, even if Mr. Trump’s approval ratings remain as low as they are now or slip further. The Republicans have so many safe seats that they could even survive a so-called wave election like the ones that swept Democrats to power in 2006 and out of power in 2010.

Which, we’d also like to note, isn’t very official. The proclamation was never written into law, so our city technically remains anthem-less. Today the song is often paired with last call at a tavern, or the final strikeout of a Yankees game, and when it was belted out by Sinatra in 1978 at Radio City Music Hall, it instantly resonated with audiences, said James Kaplan, author of “Sinatra: The Chairman.” “Sinatra alchemized the bombast, the recalcitrant, yes, even boastful, up-all-night spirit of the city itself,” Mr. Kaplan said. While Ol’ Blue Eyes made it an anthem, it wasn’t always Frank’s tune.

The Latino Victory Fund, a political action committee that works to elect progressive Hispanic leaders, will meet on Tuesday, as Mr. Trump speaks to Congress, to begin recruiting candidates at the federal, state and local levels who can push back against the president’s policies, including in cities and municipalities where they are having immediate impact. Those include in so-called sanctuary cities, which are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal authorities seeking to detain unauthorized immigrants. “As the president is outlining his plans to break up families, roll back civil rights protections and gut the environment, we are going to be finalizing our strategy to defeat him,” said Cristóbal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Project, a civic group affiliated with the Latino Victory Fund. Mr. Trump, he added, “literally started his campaign on Day 1 by attacking us, and his policies have reflected that, so we need to build up our power and fight back.” Attendees will include Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general; Thomas E. Perez, secretary of labor to President Barack Obama; and Julián Castro, Mr. Obama’s secretary of housing and urban development, as well as Latino elected officials from around the country, the organizers said. Mr. Alex said that of the 13 million to 14 million Latinos who voted in the 2016 election, 79 percent of them opposed Mr. Trump, and the proportion was even higher among women, at 86 percent. They helped elect a record number of Hispanics to Congress, including the first Latina in the Senate, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. “This is the silver lining on Trump’s victory, and we need to continue to build on it,” Mr. Alex said. The Trump administration’s new policies reject the sometimes more restrained efforts by Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush and their predecessors, who sought to balance protecting the nation’s borders with limits on the exercise of laws passed by Congress. But the new policies are likely to be welcomed by some law enforcement officials who have called for a tougher crackdown on illegal immigration, and by some Republicans in Congress who have said that lax enforcement encourages illegal immigration.

239,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary and placing his administration firmly in the middle of the culture wars that many Republicans have tried to leave behind. In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. That directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, “without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.” The question of how to address the “bathroom debate,” as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation. But Ms. DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Mr. Trump that she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions.

240,"WASHINGTON — As Oklahoma’s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, now the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, closely coordinated with major oil and gas producers, electric utilities and political groups with ties to the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch to roll back environmental regulations, according to over 6,000 pages of emails made public on Wednesday. The publication of the correspondence comes just days after Mr. Pruitt was sworn in to run the E.P.A., which is charged with reining in pollution and regulating public health. Senate Democrats tried last week to postpone a final vote until the emails could be made public, but Republicans beat back the delay and approved his confirmation on Friday largely along party lines. The impolitic tone of many of the emails cast light on why Republicans were so eager to beat the release. And although the contents of the emails were broadly revealed in The New York Times in 2014, the totality of the correspondences captures just how much at war Mr. Pruitt was with the E.P.A. and how cozy he was with the industries that he is now charged with policing. “Thank you to your respective bosses and all they are doing to push back against President Obama’s E.P.A. and its axis with liberal environmental groups to increase energy costs for Oklahomans and American families across the states,” said one email sent to the offices of Mr. Pruitt and an Oklahoma congressman in August 2013 by Matt Ball, an executive at Americans for Prosperity. That nonprofit group is funded in part by the Kochs, the Kansas-born business executives who spent much of the past decade combating federal regulations, particularly in the energy sector. “You both work for true champions of freedom and liberty!” the note said. Environmental groups rushed to condemn the correspondence. “This extensive trail of emails reads like a yearslong chain of love letters between soul mates,” said Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group. Mr. Pruitt has been among the most contentious of President Trump’s cabinet nominees. Environmental groups, Democrats in Congress and even current E.P.A. employees have protested his ties to energy companies, his efforts to block and weaken major environmental rules, and his skepticism of the central mission of the agency he now leads. As soon as this week, Mr. Trump is expected to announce at least two executive orders directing Mr. Pruitt to begin rolling back and weakening a set of Obama-era E.P.A. regulations aimed at limiting emissions that cause global warming, and at pollution in the nation’s rivers, streams and wetlands.

She owns Finch Knitting and Sewing Studio in Leesburg, Va., and the note threatened her beloved store with a potential boycott. An angry supporter of President Trump was compiling a list of businesses openly hostile to customers who voted for him. The question: Was Finch Knitting “an anti-election establishment?” Ms. Morgenthau searched her brain. Her four-year-old store, which is bright and cozy, had never endorsed a political candidate. She had, however, listed the store on the Pussyhat Project site, offering knitting supplies like pink yarn and knitting needles along with instructions on how to knit the cat-ear caps that were popular at the Women’s March in Washington. Still, she had not publicized the march itself in her store or on the shop’s Facebook page. “The business is my baby,” Ms. Morgenthau said. “I was immediately worried about it being threatened.” Big retailers including L. L. Bean, New Balance and Nordstrom have recently been caught in the cross hairs of polarizing politics that have affected sales.

242,"When it comes to facts, some leaders, like many a florid narcissist, will build a palace and gardens around their anxieties and swear allegiance to the flag flying above them. They supplant what is true with what they wish to be true and simply deny the evidence. This is a crude modern business and has very little to do with great propaganda, which relies on something much more systematic and more artful in the organization of human wishes. The good news, however, is that propaganda is back. I don’t mean the unfragrant mob of internet miscreants — hacking is to propaganda what stalking is to romance. I mean the impulse to choose a side and press its case with wily elegance. Those of us who grew up in the Cold War have rather missed it — the persistent, well-designed, all-encompassing salesmanship of Life’s Correct Path, backed up with textbooks, posters and unspeakable stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Last November, in the weeks après le deluge, in downtown Manhattan, the Russian chess grandmaster Sergey Karjakin went head-to-head with Norway’s Magnus Carlsen. The event was as 1970s as Farrah Fawcett; as 1970s as encyclopedias and Tupperware. If I had the requisite amount of hair, I would have feathered it for the occasion. Karjakin is Kremlin-backed, as we spy-watchers like to say, and in fact Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, could be seen hanging around at the Fulton Market Building. This game was important to Putin because he believes in selling the Russian way of life, the Russian character and Russian power, a need that has outlasted both Communism and the Soviet Union. If you, dear reader, happen to be under 40, you might find it bizarre that a foreign leader would care so much about a chess match, but for the rest of us it provides a warm, fuzzy feeling. What is “a way of life”? For example, the American way of life. What is it? Is it a series of values, traits and skills that others might do well to emulate, or a set of selfish boasts and vices that make the world a darker place? You decide. Or, rather: You don’t decide, but an imaginative use of propaganda will decide for you. Manipulating human belief might sound like an alarming project for governments and designers to undertake, but it’s one of the oldest professions in the book, and corporations, religions, entertainers and doctors, to say little of politicians, are dedicated to the art of making you think what you ought to think. Populism is based on the notion that people can think for themselves, but most people can’t and don’t want to; they need team colors and a direction of play that is worked out by other people. It’s almost heretical to say so, but when “the people” have spoken they often don’t know what they’ve said. For good or for ill, the art of propaganda must set out to persuade them of what they think. At the time of World War II, this wasn’t so much resented as it might be today, and was considered by most of the Allies to be something of a gentle and spirited approach to the survival of the species. Everybody was at it, from sign writers and shopkeepers to gardeners and movie-makers.

The news media has added plenty to the overwhelming coverage, but President Trump may be the first major public figure to arise in the age of social media saturation. Even President Barack Obama entered the White House before Facebook was a household name. As a result, Mr. Trump has been the subject (or target) of an amplification of news that very likely no one has experienced before.

245,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. One of the hoariest clichés in politics is “move to the center.” Journalists who think of themselves as nonideological often urge both parties to move to the center, as if the center of the political spectrum were devoid of ideology. So I enjoyed the Op-Ed yesterday, “Move Left, Democrats,” by Steve Phillips, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. But I’m not sure I agreed with it. Phillips argued that Democrats lost more Obama voters to third parties — and to staying home from the polls — than they did to Donald Trump. When the Democratic National Committee chooses its new leader this weekend, it should pick one who avoids the temptations of the political center, Phillips wrote. I’m skeptical for two main reasons. The first is that the presidency isn’t the only political office that matters. As Barack Obama noted in his last interview as president, with Pod Save America, Democrats have to win back the Senate and the House if they want to address climate change, inequality and civil rights. Winning back the House and Senate requires doing better in heavily white, nonmetropolitan America, which tends to be conservative. One of the reader commenters on the piece, Matt in Washington, made a version of this point: “This is a prescription for a party that can win the White House but which cannot win control at the state level.” The second reason is that we still don’t yet know exactly who turned out and who didn’t in 2016. Phillips uses exit-poll data. But exit polls offer imprecise, and frequently misleading, estimates, especially when they’re sliced to look at demographic groups. A better portrait will emerge in coming months, as analysts get access to data from the voter-registration files and the census. There is precedent here too: In 2012, misleading exit-poll data helped fool Democrats into thinking they could win the presidency while losing the white vote badly, as Nate Cohn documented in a prophetic June 2016 Upshot analysis. Everyone knows how those delusions of demographic destiny turned out. Phillips is right that the Democrats would be crazy to alienate the growing voting groups, such as millennials, Latinos andAsian-Americans, that now support the party so strongly. The answer for the party is almost surely more complex than simply moving to the right. Instead, it likely revolves around an economic message that appeals to both center and left. But if Democrats want to return to power — not just in the White House, but in Congress and at the state level too — they need a strategy that appeals to more white voters.

Mr. Woolery’s second act (or third, if you count his short-lived singing career, in which he tried psychedelic pop and covered “Delta Dawn”), sure shocked me when I recently stumbled across his “Blunt Force Truth” podcast. The new Mr. Woolery, who some may remember as the original host of “Wheel of Fortune,” is a firebrand who takes particular delight in fricasseeing liberal celebrities. Forget about buying a vowel. As Mr. Woolery said recently about movie stars who have protested President Trump: “You couldn’t find a group outside of an insane asylum more detached from reality than actors. Why would people want to take advice from a group of people who pretend to be other people for a living?” The 75-year-old Mr. Woolery may have slipped from some of our minds since his days gently guiding “Scrabble” players through that odd tile-dropping process.

When researchers from the blog A Journey Through N.Y.C. Religions set out to count every mosque in the five boroughs in 2015, they found 285, up from 175 just five years earlier. Muslims, in all their diversity, are a longstanding and hardy part of New York life. That diversity runs through a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York called “Muslim in New York: Highlights From the Photography Collection,” which gathers the work of four photographers taken from the 1940s to the present. Like many developments in these early days of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, the exhibition came together in a hurry, said Whitney Donhauser, the museum’s director (two weeks, to be exact). “We believe in looking at history or art to understand what’s happening in current times,” Ms. Donhauser said. “And we wanted to show the importance of this community within the overall fabric of New York City. It shows that there are people in the city who have everyday lives and contribute to the vibrancy of New York City.” The images avoid the exoticism that sometimes colors photographs of cultural practices, and are striking less for their shared traits than for their differences: the Pakistani boys improvising a cricket field in a Brooklyn park and the highly formal mother of a Palestinian groom sternly guarding the wedding cakes while her daughter-in-law lights up the room, her head jeweled and uncovered; the young women honing their karate skills; men bowing in prayer before the annual Muslim Day parade, which livens up Madison Avenue every September.

In this podcast, the opinion columnist Andrew Rosenthal talks about the news — the good, the bad and the most maddening. What is Times columnist Andrew Rosenthal mad about this week? President Trumps’ response to the increase in anti-semitic attacks since he was elected. Mr. Rosenthal says the President stumbled, three or four times, before he could say something decent and caring about the rise in anti-Semitic acts since he was elected; and, when the President finally managed to say something about the problem, he offered what the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect rightly called “crumbs of condescension”: He said the anti-Semitic threats and attacks were, to quote the president, “a reminder of ‘the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.’” “No, Mr. President,” says Mr. Rosenthal, “they are a reminder of all the work you and your team did to encourage hate and prejudice and evil.” The worse recent news, Mr. Rosenthal says, is the announcement that Mr. Trump will be following through on some of his promises to send what he calls his “deportation forces” against undocumented immigrants. Mr. Rosenthal says that deporting many millions of people — including those who pay taxes, educate their children and pose no threat — “will inevitably create injustice, make the lives of legal immigrants harder, because they will be constantly under suspicion, break up families and drive undocumented people even further underground.” Mr. Rosenthal adds that mass deportation will not create new jobs for Americans — unless, that is “they want to be deportation agents or work in the for-profit prison industry.” Last, the good news. Mr. Rosenthal says that not everyone is buying into the Trump agenda of intolerance and rage. Citing angry constituents who showed up at town hall meetings around the country and allies around the world who are “wondering whether America has taken leave of its senses,” Mr. Rosenthal gives special recognition to Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump and his policies.

252,"The confirmation of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education was a signal moment for the school choice movement. For the first time, the nation’s highest education official is someone fully committed to making school vouchers and other market-oriented policies the centerpiece of education reform. But even as school choice is poised to go national, a wave of new research has emerged suggesting that private school vouchers may harm students who receive them. The results are startling — the worst in the history of the field, researchers say. While many policy ideas have murky origins, vouchers emerged fully formed from a single, brilliant essay published in 1955 by Milton Friedman, the free-market godfather later to be awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics. Because “a stable and democratic society is impossible without widespread acceptance of some common set of values and without a minimum degree of literacy and knowledge on the part of most citizens,” Mr. Friedman wrote, the government should pay for all children to go to school. But, he argued, that doesn’t mean the government should run all the schools. Instead, it could give parents vouchers to pay for “approved educational services” provided by private schools, with the government’s role limited to “ensuring that the schools met certain minimum standards.” The voucher idea sat dormant for years before taking root in a few places, most notably Milwaukee. Yet even as many of Mr. Friedman’s other ideas became Republican Party orthodoxy, most national G.O.P. leaders committed themselves to a different theory of educational improvement: standards, testing and accountability. That movement reached an apex when the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 brought a new focus on tests and standards to nearly every public school nationwide. The law left voucher supporters with crumbs: a small demonstration project in Washington, D.C. But broad political support for No Child Left Behind proved short-lived. Teachers unions opposed the reforms from the left, while libertarians and states-rights conservatives denounced them from the right. When Republicans took control of more governor’s mansions and state legislatures in the 2000s, they expanded vouchers to an unprecedented degree. Three of the largest programs sprang up in Indiana, Louisiana and Ohio, which collectively enroll more than a third of the 178,000 voucher students nationwide.

253,"On Wednesday evening, the Departments of Education and Justice, at the direction of President Trump, withdrew important guidance that required schools to treat transgender boys and girls like other boys and girls under Title IX, the 1972 federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. In a one-and-a-half-page letter, the government unceremoniously retreated from a position — that transgender students may not be excluded from restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity — that the Department of Education had held for at least four years. Despite those years of experience, the government claims that it needs to “further and more completely consider the legal issues involved.” But there is nothing new about the idea that sex discrimination includes discrimination against transgender people. To the contrary, courts have repeatedly reached that conclusion over the past 15 years in decisions that involve prisons, banks, the workplace and, yes, schools. That’s because it’s impossible to take into account someone’s transgender status or gender identity — their internal sense of being male, female or something else — without taking into account their sex. Indeed, transgender people are defined by the fact that their gender identity does not match the sex given to them at birth. By insisting that more study is warranted to decide whether transgender students should be treated fairly, the government has sent a deeply disturbing message to transgender students that they are less than other students and unworthy of protection. That would be a damaging thing for the Department of Education to do to anyone. But it is especially troubling here, given that transgender students already are subject to more violence and harassment — both by other children and by adults — than their peers. These obstacles help explain why many transgender students drop out of school, why nearly half of transgender children have considered suicide and why at least a quarter of them have attempted it. What’s more, discrimination in schools has far-reaching and lifelong consequences for transgender people — psychologically and financially. Although the letter notes that the law protects transgender students, like all students, from discrimination, bullying and harassment, requiring transgender students to use separate facilities from those used by other students is itself a form of discrimination. It’s humiliating and degrading to be told that your very presence in a restroom is unacceptable.

My late father and I had a friendly running debate about anti-Semitism. He had experienced some nasty anti-Semitic teasing as a child in the 1950s. And when a high-profile incident happened in the United States during his adult life, he’d often express a concern that it signaled the start of a resurgence. I’ve experienced no meaningful anti-Semitism in my life, save the occasional hateful reader email. When he expressed alarm, I would reply with optimism: Wide-scale American anti-Semitism was a thing of the past, I’d say. I was wrong, and he was right. Social media was filled with anti-Semitism last year: Journalists who said they had never been subject to bigotry before came to expect it, usually from Trump supporters. The neo-Nazi symbol Pepe the frog was gleefully spread by Donald Trump Jr. Schools and synagogues have been defiled with anti-Semitism. More recently, Jewish community centers have received bomb threats, and a Jewish cemetery was desecrated last week. In an Op-Ed today, Jennifer Weiner talks of the role that Jewish community centers have played in her life and many other lives. She also calls out President Trump’s reluctant denunciation of anti-Semitism. “The president’s silence, and his day-late and dollar-short declaration, made their own statement,” Weiner writes. “They said that American Jews did not deserve his reassurance, that the threats against places where we lift weights and send our kids to finger-paint weren’t important enough to require his swift condemnation, like Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor ratings, or that time the cast of “Hamilton” addressed Mike Pence during a curtain call.” She’s right (and I encourage you to read the full piece). Given how quick Trump is to denounce many things, and how much of the new American anti-Semitism comes from his supporters, his one denunciation doesn’t count as permanent. If the anti-Semitism continues, so must the president’s rejection of it. He, more than anyone else, has the responsibility to make everyday religious bigotry again feel like a part of the country’s past.

257,"Updated, 11:30 a.m. Good morning on this clammy Thursday. It’s called “The Greatest Show on Earth” — until it folds its tent for good. The goodbye tour of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus rolls through Barclays Center in Brooklyn tonight through March 3. Its final show is set for May 21 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. Dwindling ticket sales, which dropped even more after the use of elephants was phased out last year, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus “an unsustainable business for the company,” Kenneth Feld, the chief executive of Feld Entertainment, the producer of Ringling, wrote in a statement. In true fashion, readers of The New York Times responded to our coverage of Ringling with their own memories and thoughts. Here’s a selection: A Joy for Children “One of the highlights of my childhood was looking forward to going to the circus at the original Madison Square Garden and for many years afterward. The three rings of acts were magical. I loved watching three trapeze shows simultaneously. The excitement of the audience during the triple somersault was palpable. Clowning was also an art. I will always cherish these memories.” — Melanie Sloan, 65, Los Angeles “As a child, I enjoyed the wire walkers, trapeze artists, acrobats and clowns, as well as the overall spectacle — the colors, lights, costumes. I am 100 percent behind removing animal acts from circuses, but there is really something wonderful about a circus, even without animal acts, especially for children.” — Jennifer Zogott Levy, 58, Brooklyn ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/nyregion/new-york-today-a-goodbye-to-ringling-bros.html?searchResultPosition=41

What’s the difficulty? There are a few factors: • Start-ups have not managed to displace banks, even as financial services change rapidly. • Banks are absorbing new ideas from the world of technology. • The venture capitalists who invested billions of dollars in new financial technology are still waiting for a breakout star. Their window of opportunity is shrinking, though, because the Trump administration wants to roll back financial regulations in a move that would give big banks more free rein. Post-crisis regulations had forced lenders to reduce their risks, providing an opening for companies willing to fill the gap. Bad behavior at Uber had, until this week, only been whispered about in Silicon Valley.

260,"CHEHALIS, Wash. — At this small factory south of Seattle, employees make one of the most specialized products in the aerospace industry: the rubber mats that Boeing workers stand on while assembling jets. As long as there are jets and Boeing, business would seem to be steady. But even here workers are bracing for bumps and economic uncertainty over the gritty details of where aviation parts get made and who makes them. President Trump has talked about border tariffs and new trade deals that many people in aerospace fear could raise the cost of American airplanes bought by foreign airlines or governments. And if Boeing’s sales or profits suffer, its nerve-system supply chain — more than 13,000 companies across the United States, and more than 1.5 million jobs — would most likely feel the pain, too. At SmartCells, 50 full-time employees and a few dozen temporary workers stamp out cushion pads on heavy machines. Executives work in a red building everyone calls the barn, and first names are the rule. Washington feels far away, but it is on just about everybody’s radar. “Let’s hit it with a two-by-four and see how it reacts, then get a plan,” said Bob Bishop, the chief operations officer at SmartCells, describing Mr. Trump’s hard-charging style. “That doesn’t always work.” The anxiety, said Mr. Bishop, 46, a former deputy county sheriff who voted for Mr. Trump, centers not so much on politics as economics, specifically the intense competition with the French airplane maker Airbus, which competes toe to toe with Boeing for jet orders in countries around the world in a delicate game of narrow cost differences and giant contracts. Mr. Trump has said he would seek a 45 percent tariff on imports from China, for example, to protect American jobs, and a 20 percent tariff on goods from Mexico. If business costs for Boeing go up as a result, the company — the nation’s single largest exporter by dollar volume — probably would not be able to raise prices on its airplanes to make up the difference, because then it would lose customers to Airbus.

261,"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump broke with Republican Party orthodoxy by vowing to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans from violence and oppression. Soon after taking office, President Trump announced that he intended to continue enforcing an executive order his predecessor issued to protect L.G.B.T. people from workplace discrimination. “President Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the L.G.B.T.Q. community,” the White House said in a statement on Jan. 31. Then along came Attorney General Jeff Sessions. During his first week in office, Mr. Sessions halted the Justice Department’s efforts to defend in court the legality of the Obama administration’s guidance to school districts on how to provide a safe and inclusive environment for transgender students. A key part of that guidance advised school officials to allow transgender students to use restrooms based on their gender identity. This week, Mr. Sessions and the Department of Education rescinded the guidance entirely. His baffling rationale was that it added to the confusion around an issue that has prompted spirited debates and legal fights around the country. In fact, it did the opposite. Next month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who has been fighting his Virginia school district for the right to use the boys’ restroom on campus. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice took the position that existing federal law already confers that right. Mr. Sessions has reversed the government’s course.

But a federal jury in Manhattan disagreed. It took jurors three hours on Wednesday to determine that there was not enough evidence to support a civil forfeiture lawsuit filed by federal prosecutors. The jury, in ruling in favor of the Efans Trading Corporation, ordered the government to return the luxury cars and $3 million in cash that was also seized from a company bank account. “We are grateful that the jury saw this case for the government overreach that it was,” said Benjamin J. Razi, a partner with the law firm Covington & Burling, which represented Efans. “Even with the victory they deserved, this case took a tremendous toll on our client.” Efans, based in Memphis, is owned by Yifan Kong and Erxin Zhou, a husband and wife who are Chinese immigrants. The government action effectively forced the couple to shut their car export business, although they still operate a tire importing company. It was a rare courtroom defeat for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. It represents something of a conclusion to an aggressive crackdown by federal law enforcement on a cottage industry of auto export companies that used middlemen and “straw buyers” to buy luxury cars from dealerships in the United States and quickly resell them for big profits in China.

264,"New deportation rules proposed by the Trump administration risk creating an American underclass with parallels to others around the world: slum residents in India, guest workers in oil-rich Persian Gulf states and internal migrant workers in China. Those groups provide a cautionary tale for what could happen if the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, as well as their family members, are forced deep into the shadows. Stuck in a gray zone outside the legal system, they are vulnerable to exploitation, including wage theft and sex trafficking. Because they are denied formal protections or services, informal alternatives take their place — creating an ideal space for corruption, gangs and other forms of criminality. The result is often the precise opposite of what the administration is seeking: not a cohesive society but a fragmented one, not less crime but more, and, rather than ending undocumented immigration, deepening the secrecy that makes it difficult to manage. In the United States, undocumented immigrants have always lived in limbo, officially illegal but often tolerated. But President Trump’s new rules, aimed at reconciling that contradiction, risk deepening it. As a result, they could increase the burdens on undocumented migrants and, more broadly, on society. This kind of underclass begins with a gap between law and reality. India’s slums, for instance, are often portrayed as emblems of the country’s struggle with poverty. But they also signal India’s failure to keep up with its rapidly growing urban populations. People who migrate to cities, unable to find sufficient affordable housing, improvise sprawling settlements that become more permanent.

266,"BERLIN — Just hours after the German cabinet approved tapping cellphones and attaching electronic bracelets to illegal migrants who might be deemed a threat, a group of Afghan men were put on a plane at a Munich airport Wednesday night and deported. The deportation was only the third such mass expulsion to Afghanistan since last fall, and in combination with new antiterrorism measures, it was a clear sign of the stiffening political headwinds that have made Europe, like America, a less welcoming place for migrants. Across the Continent, Europeans find themselves increasingly caught up in a debate over the treatment of migrants as rising hostility to newcomers clashes with long-held values of tolerance and openness. Many governments are restricting their welcome to strangers. Sweden tightened immigration rules last year. Britain is leaving the European Union in large part to stem the flow of foreigners. Italy has embarked on a plan to train Libyans to scoop up migrant boats off their shore. Hungary sees the shift against migration as affirming the “correctness” of its decision to build its own wall to seal its border. Then there are some states, like Germany, that are taking more assertive steps to ensure that those who have been denied asylum actually leave, like the 18 Afghans deported Wednesday. That has not always been the case. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, itself facing a tough election challenge this year, is taking steps to speed up deportations after some terrorism suspects were found to be immigrants who had been designated to be sent home.

Mr. Grimm looked a little flustered. “Absolutely humbled,” he pronounced himself, as his admirers thanked him for being brave. With Mr. Trump’s decision this week to rescind protections for transgender students that allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, the next stop is the Supreme Court, where Mr. Grimm — an engaging yet slightly awkward young man — is the lead plaintiff in a case that could settle the contentious “bathroom debate.” Amid a thicket of conflicting state laws and local school policies on bathroom use, the suit, which pits Mr. Grimm against his school board in Gloucester County, Va., could greatly expand transgender rights — or roll them back. Mr. Trump has portrayed the issue as one of states’ rights, and already the country’s transgender students face differing realities depending on their school. Some are restricted to the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. Others are not. Then there are the students like Mr. Grimm, who have had separate facilities set aside for them. At issue in Mr. Grimm’s case is whether Title IX, a provision in a 1972 law that bans discrimination “on the basis of sex” in schools that receive federal money, also bans discrimination based on gender identity. President Barack Obama concluded that it did. Despite Mr. Trump’s action, lawyers for both Mr. Grimm and the school board said Thursday that they expected the case to go forward, with oral arguments set for March 28 and school officials across the country awaiting the result.

Sweden is already celebrated for its generous welfare state, including 480 days of paid parental leave, universal health care and a common ritual of coffee and pastry, known as fika, which is considered sacrosanct. Per-Erik Muskos, a 42-year-old councilman from the northern town of Overtornea, wants to add to those benefits, by offering the municipality’s 550 employees the right to subsidized sex. In introducing his proposal this week, he told fellow members of the town council that it would give a nudge to the dwindling local population, add spice to aging marriages and improve employee morale. The idea quickly got attention all over Sweden, where for at least some, it was a welcome distraction from President Trump’s vague reference to problems the country was having with immigration, which were strongly denied by baffled Swedes. Noting that “sex is also a great form of exercise and has documented positive effects on well-being,” Mr. Muskos suggested that local municipal employees could use an hour of the workweek already allotted for fitness activities to go home and have sex with their spouses or partners instead. The motion, which is expected to be voted on in the spring, needs a simple majority to be passed by the 31-member council. As of now, opinion on the council is divided. “We should encourage procreation. I believe that sex is often in short supply.

Tillerson. “At least half of you try to get that right, because it continues to come up in your reporting.” Mr. Trump has a penchant for dropping unwelcome surprises during visits between the United States and Mexico. Last month, on the first day of a trip to Washington by Mexico’s foreign minister, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to build a wall between the two countries.

The mayor is again seeking needed permission from Albany to impose the tax on luxury developments. This highly progressive, 2.5 percent marginal tax proposal is on home sales over $2 million.

The funds generated — an estimated $336 million in the coming fiscal year — will help the low-income elderly stay in the neighborhoods they love. The tax was first proposed by the mayor in 2015, and “locked” revenue to support affordable housing. It deserves to pass now, not only because of President Trump’s threats to cut federal funding to New York City, but also because it’s good policy.

It was our version of Central Perk on “Friends.” I felt like any other student, just one of the girls, until one morning when a vice principal, who had always looked at me curiously, blocked me as I followed my friends into the girls’ restroom. The administrator told me to come with her. We walked to the nurse’s office, a five-minute trip from my homeroom, where she pointed to a single-stall restroom. “This is where you go,” she said to me. I walked into the restroom in silence. The vice principal and the nurse looked on. I was only 15, and I obediently used that restroom for the rest of the year. I didn’t know then that I had agency and could defend myself from authority figures. I was also used to making compromises so that the adults around me felt comfortable. That was 1998. Nearly two decades later, President Trump’s administration has rescinded guidelines put in place by the Obama administration that directed schools to allow transgender students to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity.

275,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, who has repeatedly promised to bring jobs back to the United States, turned to manufacturing executives on Thursday to help him develop measures to do just that, giving powerful business leaders a potentially influential hand in shaping his still-evolving economic policies. “My administration’s policies and regulatory reform, tax reform, trade policies will return significant manufacturing jobs to our country,” Mr. Trump said at the White House, sitting around a large table with members of his cabinet and two dozen manufacturing executives. “Everything’s going to be based on bringing our jobs back — the good jobs, the real jobs. They’ve left and they’re coming back. They have to come back.” Mr. Trump has yet to outline specific proposals for overhauling the tax and regulatory systems, rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure or reshaping the work force, all of which would be essential to accomplishing his ambitious employment goals. He told the group that his campaign pledge to create jobs had played a major role in his winning the White House, and on Thursday he dispatched his cabinet and senior staff members to gather input from the executives on what those packages should look like. The meetings unfolded less than a month before Mr. Trump plans to submit a budget blueprint that is expected to include a health care package to replace the Affordable Care Act, and to unveil a sweeping plan to cut taxes.

276,"Steven Mnuchin’s stock-market brag could turn out to be a double-edged sword. The new Treasury secretary says the postelection rally in the equities market reflects faith in President Trump and his promises for tax changes and fiscal stimulus. Both plans need approval from Congress, and may be accompanied by higher inflation. Anti-immigrant and trade policies could also mute market gains. Secretary Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday that he hoped to have a tax-overhaul bill passed by Congress by August. That is an ambitious timetable, even with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House. There are major differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate, which will most likely come up with a separate proposal. One senator said current House tax proposals would be lucky to draw 10 votes out of 100. The administration will use its own rosy growth forecasts rather than the Congressional Budget Office estimates on which lawmakers rely. Congress already has a full agenda. Its first priority is repealing and replacing Obamacare, but lawmakers have yet to present a plan as disagreements continue. The Senate is also considering Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who needs 60 votes to beat a filibuster. Republicans are eight votes shy of that number. Lawmakers are already considering pushing President Trump’s plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure to next year, and Secretary Mnuchin did not highlight it on Thursday. Yet investors betting on a fiscal stimulus and tax overhaul have pushed the S.&P. 500-stock index up by more than 10 percent since the November election. Secretary Mnuchin said the performance reflected confidence in President Trump’s policies. “This is a mark-to-market business, and you see what the market thinks,” he said. Carrying out President Trump’s campaign pledges could spur inflation, which is already creeping up. Consumer spending has been healthy, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported last week that inflation expectations hit 1.92 percent. That is still shy of the central bank’s 2 percent target but higher than the 1.6 percent reported at the end of December. Rising inflation could put the Fed on a quicker path for raising interest rates. While action on taxes and infrastructure remains iffy, President Trump’s concrete moves to crack down on immigration and pull out of trade deals will hit the economy.

277,"WASHINGTON — Reduced to their weakest state in a generation, Democratic Party leaders will gather in two cities this weekend to plot strategy and select a new national chairman with the daunting task of rebuilding the party’s depleted organization. But senior Democratic officials concede that the blueprint has already been chosen for them — by an incensed army of liberals demanding no less than total war against President Trump. Immediately after the November election, Democrats were divided over how to handle Mr. Trump, with one camp favoring all-out confrontation and another backing a seemingly less risky approach of coaxing him to the center with offers of compromise. Now, spurred by explosive protests and a torrent of angry phone calls and emails from constituents — and outraged themselves by Mr. Trump’s swift moves to enact a hard-line agenda — Democrats have all but cast aside any notion of conciliation with the White House. Instead, they are mimicking the Republican approach of the last eight years — the “party of no” — and wagering that brash obstruction will pay similar dividends. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said there had been a “tornado of support” for wall-to-wall resistance to Mr. Trump. Mr. Inslee, who backed a lawsuit against the president’s executive order banning refugee admissions and travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, said Democrats intended to send a stern message to Mr. Trump during a conference of governors in the nation’s capital. “My belief is, we have to resist every way and everywhere, every time we can,” when Mr. Trump offends core American values, Mr. Inslee said. By undermining Mr. Trump across the board, he said, Democrats hope to split Republicans away from a president of their own party. “Ultimately, we’d like to have a few Republicans stand up to rein him in,” Mr. Inslee said. “The more air goes out of his balloon, the earlier and likelier that is to happen.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/democrats-dnc-chairman-trump-keith-ellison-tom-perez.html?searchResultPosition=25
278,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Rescinds Obama Directive on Bathroom Use” (front page, Feb. 23): With the influence of his right-wing cabinet, President Trump reversed protections for transgender students that were put into place by the Obama administration. This is not only meanspirited and misguided, but it is also dangerous. Transgender young people already experience bullying and harassment at alarming rates, along with increased rates of depression and suicide. Removing these protections further stigmatizes these students. As a psychiatrist, I have witnessed firsthand the negative effects of such discrimination. Next month, the Supreme Court will also bear witness to them as Gavin Grimm, a transgender student from Virginia, brings his case to the court. Transgender young people deserve our protection and respect. Instead, President Trump has decided that political capital is worth more than the lives of transgender students. JEREMY D. KIDD  New York The writer is chief resident in psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. To the Editor: One consistent theme with President Trump is that when in doubt you can count on him to go after the vulnerable. Whether they are immigrants, refugees, Muslims or transgender people, he relies on bullying to promote himself. In fact, his entire “America first” theme amounts to America bullying the world.

279,"To the Editor: Re “Fight Trump, Not His Voters” (column, Feb. 23): It’s hard to disagree with Nicholas Kristof: Stereotyping is indefensible; demonizing the opposition feeds the dysfunction; and name-calling will win no votes. But it’s also entirely possible that Mr. Kristof has it backward: President Trump is not the true enemy; his voters are. Donald Trump is an unabashed bigot, a baldfaced liar and someone who bragged about groping women. But as nightmarish as it seems to have those qualities in the White House, sooner or later his presidency will come to an end. And when it does, we will be faced with the true American nightmare: that almost 63 million of us, knowing full well who Donald Trump was, voted for him anyway. They will not be smarter than they were in 2016 — they will have spent the interim being lied to constantly — and they will not be less angry, because the Trump presidency will certainly have failed them. As all reasonable people know, trashing trade deals won’t bring industrial jobs back; building walls won’t make us safer; and market forces won’t deliver health care or educate our children. So while Donald Trump is certainly the enemy of both reason and compassion, I’m much more frightened of the 63 million people who either didn’t know they were voting against everything this country stands for, or didn’t care. DAVID BERMAN New York To the Editor: I don’t understand why Nicholas Kristof encourages us to be magnanimous to Trump voters. Yes, they are clearly not all bigots. Still, they elected to the highest office in the land, and arguably the world, a man who ginned up his campaign crowds by encouraging racism, sexism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, vilification of the press and violence. Many of them purposefully set their consciences to sleep and pulled the lever for a man I suspect that they know is morally bankrupt. If Donald Trump continues to be the president he has been thus far — one who makes up facts, hires his cronies from Wall Street, refuses to vet his cabinet nominees even as much as immigrants are now vetted, rails against the press and shoots from the hip on some of the most delicate of the world’s problems — will they take responsibility for their votes? LINDA CARLSON Gaylordsville, Conn. To the Editor: Assuming that one were inclined to give economically stressed Trump voters a pass, I wonder what justification Nicholas Kristof would attribute to those who voted for Donald Trump who were middle class, wealthy or super-wealthy other than bigotry and greed.

282,"Vaccine opponents, often the subject of ridicule, have found fresh energy in the election of a president who has repeated discredited claims linking childhood immunizations to autism and who has apparently decided to pursue them. With President Trump’s support, this fringe movement could win official recognition, threatening lives and making it urgent that health officials, educators and others respond with a science-based defense of vaccines. Vaccines have saved lives by protecting children and adults from diseases like measles, polio, smallpox, cervical cancer and whooping cough. And there is no evidence whatsoever that vaccines or a preservative used in flu shots cause autism. Scientists have also shown that parents who refuse to immunize their children are threatening to undo decades of public health gains. Yet, activists like Robert Kennedy Jr. continue to push pseudoscience about immunizations. The terrifying thing is that they appear to have Mr. Trump's ear. After a meeting with the president last month, Mr. Kennedy said that the president would name him to head a new committee on vaccine safety; the government already has an advisory group that is meeting this week. And last week, during a news conference with Robert De Niro, Mr. Kennedy offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who could prove that vaccines are safe for children and pregnant women. Of course, countless studies show that vaccines are safe and effective — more than 350 health groups compiled a list for Mr. Trump — but they haven’t penetrated the reality distortion field created by Mr. Kennedy and his fellow travelers. The biggest danger is that their movement will sow enough doubt that more parents will refuse to let their children be immunized. In some states like Texas the number of children who do not receive vaccines has risen sharply over the last decade and is now in the tens of thousands. Not only does this increase the risk of infections to the youths who don’t get shots, but it also threatens infants who are too young and children who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. This phenomenon has already led to outbreaks of measles and mumps. Some parents are understandably anxious about autism. But scientists say there are several possible explanations for why more children have been found to have autism spectrum disorders in recent years, and none of them are linked to vaccines. Doctors have gotten better at identifying those conditions. Genetic factors could be at play, as well as fetal brain defects that develop during pregnancy because of exposure to chemicals and infections.

283,"Folks, we have been here before. After Ronald Reagan, a celebrity-turned-politician, carried 49 states in his devastating defeat of Walter Mondale in 1984, Democrats were whining and moaning, shuffling their feet and scratching their heads. Reagan had done particularly well with those who would come to be known as Reagan Democrats — white, working-class voters, particularly in the Rust Belt, whom a New York Times contributor would later describe as “blue-collar, ethnic voters,” who were drawn to Reagan’s messages of economic growth and nationalistic pride. But just like Donald Trump’s path to victory, Reagan’s was strewn with racial hostilities and prejudicial lies. While Trump’s tropes involved Mexicans and Muslims and that tired euphemism of disastrous inner cities, Reagan used the “welfare queen” scare, as far back as his unsuccessful bid for president in 1976. As I have written before, Reagan explained at nearly every stop that there was a woman in Chicago who “used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans’ benefits for four nonexistent, deceased veteran husbands, as well as welfare. Her tax-free cash income alone has been running $150,000 a year.” But it was not as it seemed. As my colleague Paul Krugman wrote in 2007: “Reagan repeatedly told the bogus story of the Cadillac-driving welfare queen — a gross exaggeration of a minor case of welfare fraud.

Intentionally. I won’t coddle those who refuse to recognize my humanity.” “What a great idea!” another offered. “Let’s recruit a whole bunch of bigoted unthinking lizard brains because we could possibly ‘WIN!’” And so the comments went, registering legitimate anxieties about President Trump — but also the troubling condescension that worried me in the first place.

285,"And now, things that are Really Happening in the world of Donald Trump. We bring you this list as a public service. It’s easy to be distracted by all the strange/contradictory/awful things the president says. For instance, a lot of people were stunned when he responded to a question about anti-Semitic attacks in the United States by citing his winning numbers in the Electoral College. Then, when the question came up again and he yelled at the reporter who asked it. Much, much later, Trump did read a statement denouncing racism and anti-Semitism. But even that seemed … worrisome. It’s not just that an elected official should know how to answer that question without a lot of prep work. Everybody should know how to answer that question. Your 3-year-old nephew. Your Uber driver. Uncle Fred who gets drunk at Thanksgiving. Nobody gets to ask for a script. Maybe he keeps talking crazy to divert attention from the fact that he doesn’t have anything else to report. In Washington, outside of the ongoing disaster that is immigration policy, actual changes have been sparse. A lot of the departments don’t have new staffs yet — and some never will if Trump keeps insisting on only hiring people who never said anything negative about him during the campaign. However, some little gremlins have been busy on the government websites, clearing out unpleasant information on issues like climate change. The Department of Agriculture has taken down its list of violators of the Animal Welfare Act, including “puppy mills” rife with dangerous and unsanitary conditions. The justification for that one seemed to involve concern that the list violated the privacy of people who are terrible to little dogs. It’s hard to say for sure, since no one is picking up the phone at the headless Department of Agriculture. But if you’ve got a Republican member of Congress, be sure to go to the next town meeting and yell, “What about the puppies?” Trump, who likes to be thought of as a decider, showed his stuff this week, resolving a dispute between two of his top appointees. It was a surprising development — who knew there were enough cabinet members in place for a fight? The battle featured Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in an argument over transgender rights.

286,"President Trump brandished executive pen and fresh hyperbole last week in blessing the coal industry’s decades-old practice of freely dumping tons of debris into the streams and mountain hollows of America’s mining communities. “Another terrible job-killing rule,” Mr. Trump declared at a signing ceremony that struck down the Obama administration’s attempt to regulate surface mining wastes. He insisted he was saving “many thousands of American jobs” in sparing coal companies the expense of cleaning up their environmental messes. The signing ceremony was not just an insult to the benighted coal hamlets of Appalachia, where the industry’s dumping of debris down the mountainsides has created a wasteland. It also ignored two truths. One is that by official estimates the rules, while helping the environment, would in fact cost very few jobs — 260 on average a year offset by almost the same number of jobs for people hired to comply with the rules. What’s been costing jobs in the industry for years — and this is the second and larger truth — is a shifting global market in which power plants have turned to cleaner natural gas. In cynically promising the resurgence of King Coal, Mr. Trump might as well have been signing a decree that the whaling industry was being restored to Nantucket. Americans can expect more such delusional signing ceremonies in the days ahead as Congress avails itself of a little-used statute known as the Congressional Review Act to strike down environmental rules that are vulnerable to reversal because they were enacted in the waning months of the Obama administration. Any such rule labeled “job killing” or “executive overreach” seems doomed, especially if seen as a threat to campaign donors in the fossil fuel industry. It matters little that the rule may be widely supported by the public. A case in point is a rule that seeks to reduce wasteful emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, at thousands of oil and gas wells across the West. Though the industry cries bankruptcy, the Interior Department calculates the cost of the rule at less than 1 percent of revenues. Another target is an Interior Department rule that would invite greater public input in designing resource management plans across the West to achieve a fair balance between conservation and commercial development. Representatives Rob Bishop of Utah and Liz Cheney of Wyoming — two reliable industry supporters — have managed to persuade their colleagues that this would undercut state authority, which is nonsense.

287,"HAMBURG, Germany — One of the few things uniting America and Europe these days is the deepening rift within their societies. Two crucial elections are coming up, in France this May and in Germany this September, and it’s high time we assess this dangerous cleavage. It’s not “us versus them.” It’s “us versus us”: an intra-Western clash of ideologies. That clash pops up in different ways, but it is fundamentally about what world the citizens of the West would rather live in. Call it a “Lennon world” versus a “Bannon world.” Neither is sustainable. The Lennon world is that of the liberal cosmopolitans, summed up in the John Lennon song “Imagine”: “Imagine there’s no countries,” he sings, “a brotherhood of man.” The Bannon world is the opposite: a place of walls and rules, run by uncompromising strongmen. To the extent that in American cities and large parts of Europe, at least, Lennon world is already a reality, advocates of a Bannon world are the revolutionaries. As its eponym, President Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, explained, “I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.” Nowhere is this split playing out as clearly as in Germany, where a rising Bannonist right has positioned itself against both the center-left Social Democrats and the center-right Christian Democrats, both of which tend toward a version of the Lennonist worldview. Unlike in France, here the center left is robust; unlike in the United States, here the center right has no interest in co-opting, or being taken over by, the far right. Of course, Germans have also learned from the American and British experiences in 2016, a crucial lesson being that it’s a mistake, politically and morally, to discount the entire far-right voting base as “deplorable.” A compromise must be found, not only to win in September but also to govern afterward.

289,"The robots were Joe McGillivray’s idea. The first one arrived at Dynamic Group in Ramsey, Minn., by pickup truck in two cardboard boxes. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, McGillivray watched as a vendor unpacked two silver tubes, assorted blue-and-gray joints and a touch screen and put them all together. When he was finished 10 minutes later, McGillivray beheld an arm that, had its segments not all been able to swivel 360 degrees, might have belonged to a very large N.B.A. player or a fairly small giant. Its “shoulder” was mounted to a waist-high pedestal on wheels. If it were to hail someone across the room, its “elbow” would reach eye level. Below its “wrist,” which was triple-jointed for extra dexterity, there were sockets for various attachments. McGillivray, not sure yet if he wanted to keep the contraption, stuck a piece of clear tape to the wrist and drew a happy face on it, which made the arm look a bit as if it were putting on a puppet show. He hoped that this would help it look nonthreatening. McGillivray is the 38-year-old chief executive of Dynamic, a maker of molds for the mass production of small plastic and metal parts, from 3M Scotch-tape dispensers to bullets. The company was founded 40 years ago by his father, Peter, and Peter’s friend Dave Kalina, both tool and die makers, in Kalina’s basement. Machining like theirs is labor-intensive. Even as the business expanded to more than 100 employees in two warehouses in Ramsey — a manufacturing town founded by French traders and settled in the 1850s on the banks of the Mississippi River — many of its customers switched to competitors overseas, induced by improvements in the technologies of developing nations coupled with falling trade barriers. But McGillivray and Kalina found a lucrative niche making molds for the most intricate medical products. Orthodontic braces, for example, use brackets that have unique shapes based on the angles of the teeth to which they will be affixed; the bracket molds, which are injected with powdered steel, must be cut to a degree of precision 40 times thinner than a hair. Thanks largely to the skill of Dynamic’s machinists, the company did more than survive; it prospered. Then came the Great Recession. For the first time, McGillivray and Kalina, once able to offer bonuses, struggled to make payroll. To keep going, they needed to produce more molds or cut costs, or both. Last month, on a damp, gray day, Joe McGillivray took me on a tour of one of Dynamic’s facilities, a former steel factory adjacent to a railroad track. The walls were painted cream with green trim, and the thick hum of motors made the cavernous space feel almost cozy. He led me to an injection press the size of a bakery oven. Inside, a nozzle moved up and down, shooting molten plastic into a mold, where it cooled around the end of a catheter tube. The resulting piece, when the tube was placed in a patient, would be used as a connector by a surgeon threading tools like scopes or stents into his or her body. A young man in a hairnet, gloves and goggles sat at a table facing the press. The robot was beside him. Before the robot arrived, McGillivray told me, four people worked the press. One inserted the catheter tubes into a frame that held them still; one set the frame on a mold, ran it through the press and took it out; one removed the finished tubes from the frame and trimmed away excess plastic; and one inspected the final products. The process was unforgiving: If an operator hit the stop button an instant too late, the plastic burned, ruining the part. Inevitably, even the nimblest foursomes produced lots of scrap. Now, as we watched, the operator inserted two tubes into a frame and put it on a rack. The robot, which had a sensor and a magnetic pad attached to its end, tapped the frame with its pad to pick it up, pivoted and gently placed the frame on a mold inside the press. Then it cocked its wrist and nudged a button with one of the pad’s corners. A wheel inside the press spun like a lazy susan, 180 degrees, positioning the mold beneath the nozzle and bringing around a second mold with a frame of cooled catheters. Next the robot lifted this frame and moved it to a trimmer that ejected the catheters. Finally, it stacked the empty frame beside the operator. The cycle took 35 seconds. All the while, the operator examined finished catheters and inserted tubes into frames at a steady but unhurried pace. It wasn’t the robot’s speed that was revolutionary, McGillivray said; other automated machines could do the same things faster. The innovation was its “collaborative” ability: This robot is safe to work with. If it bumps into someone, it stops. (McGillivray, a father of three young daughters whose standards of personal responsibility are marked even by Minnesotan standards, tested this feature on himself first: “Let’s just say it hit a fleshy part of my body, and I didn’t like it. But it didn’t leave a bruise.”) This meant that he didn’t have to build an expensive, semi-permanent safety cage around it. And because the robot is easy to move and reprogram, it can quickly be reassigned to whatever unique processes are required to fill the one-off orders Dynamic typically receives.

Through it all, she has depended on her brains, her enthusiasm and her skill as a social connector to power her through the tough times.

291,"The working class, or at least the white part, has emerged as our great national mystery. Traditionally Democratic, they helped elect a flamboyantly ostentatious billionaire to the presidency. “What’s wrong with them?” the liberal pundits keep asking. Why do they believe Trump’s promises? Are they stupid or just deplorably racist? Why did the working class align itself against its own interests? I was born into this elusive class and remain firmly connected to it through friendships and family. In the 1980s, for example, I personally anchored a working-class cultural hub in my own home on Long Island. The attraction was not me but my husband (then) and longtime friend Gary Stevenson, a former warehouse worker who had become an organizer for the Teamsters union. You may think of the Long Island suburbs as a bedroom community for Manhattan commuters or a portal to the Hamptons, but they were then also an industrial center, with more than 20,000 workers employed at Grumman alone. When my sister moved into our basement from Colorado, she quickly found a job in a factory within a mile of our house, as did thousands of other people, some of them bused in from the Bronx. Mostly we hosted local residents who passed through our house for evening meetings or weekend gatherings — truck drivers, factory workers, janitors and eventually nurses. My job was to make chili and keep room in the fridge for the baked ziti others would invariably bring. I once tried to explain the concept of “democratic socialism” to some machine-shop workers and went off on a brief peroration against the Soviet Union. They stared at me glumly across the kitchen counter until one growled, “At least they have health care over there.” By the time my little crew was gathering in the ranch house, working-class aspirations were everywhere being trampled underfoot. In 1981, President Reagan busted the air traffic controllers’ union by firing more than 11,000 striking workers — a clear signal of what was to come. A few years later, we hosted a picnic for Jim Guyette, the leader of a militant meatpacking local in Minnesota that had undertaken a wildcat strike against Hormel (and of course no Hormel products were served at our picnic). But labor had entered into an age of givebacks and concessions. Grovel was the message, or go without a job. Even the “mighty mighty” unions of the old labor chant, the ones that our little group had struggled both to build and to democratize, were threatened with extinction. Within a year, the wildcat local was crushed by its own parent union, the United Food and Commercial Workers. Steel mills went quiet, the mines where my father and grandfather had worked shut down, factories fled south of the border. Much more was lost in the process than just the jobs; an entire way of life, central to the American mythos, was coming to an end. The available jobs, in fields like retail sales and health care, were ill paid, making it harder for a man without a college education to support a family on his own. I could see this in my own extended family, where the grandsons of miners and railroad workers were taking jobs as delivery-truck drivers and fast-food restaurant managers or even competing with their wives to become retail workers or practical nurses. As Susan Faludi observed in her 1999 book “Stiffed,” the deindustrialization of America led to a profound masculinity crisis: What did it mean to be a man when a man could no longer support a family? It wasn’t just a way of life that was dying but also many of those who had lived it. Research in 2015 by Angus Deaton, a Nobel laureate in economics, with his wife, Anne Case, showed that the mortality gap between college-educated whites and non-college-educated whites had been widening rapidly since 1999. A couple of months later, economists at the Brookings Institution found that for men born in 1920, there was a six-year difference in life expectancy between the top 10 percent of earners and the bottom 10 percent. For men born in 1950, that difference more than doubled, to 14 years. Smoking, which is now mostly a working-class habit, could account for only a third of the excess deaths. The rest were apparently attributable to alcoholism, drug overdoses and suicide, usually by gunshot — what are often called “diseases of despair.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/magazine/american-working-class-future.html?searchResultPosition=53
292,"When Nathan Kecy graduated from Plymouth State University in New Hampshire a decade ago with a bachelor’s degree in communications, he found himself with about $10,000 in debt and few clear career options. He first found work as a door-to-door salesman (“a pyramid scheme,” he recalls) and then in telemarketing. Finally he landed a job as an infrastructure specialist for Datamatic, a Texas-based water-meter-technology company. He was traveling across the country installing meters, making a decent salary. But he lost his job after the company restructured in 2012, he said, and soon he found that his skills weren’t easily transferable to a new field; Datamatic’s technology was proprietary, and his expertise in the company’s installation program wasn’t appealing to employers outside that particular industry. He tried going into business with a friend, but the relationship soured. By then he had a baby and a fiancée, and he felt stuck. Now 32, Kecy is a few months away from finishing a six-month certificate program in advanced composites manufacturing at Great Bay Community College in Rochester, N.H. The program operates out of a satellite campus that opened in 2013, with aid from a Labor Department grant meant to help community colleges reach “trade displaced” workers who need help training for new careers. The unemployment rate in southern New Hampshire is low, less than 3 percent. At one state job fair last summer, just 350 people showed up for 1,200 available jobs. In Strafford County, where Rochester is located, the largest employers include the University of New Hampshire and Liberty Mutual, but also manufacturers like Turbocam and Contitech. Kecy’s classmates include veterans, recent high-school graduates and older workers whose careers had reached dead ends. All of them are looking for hope and a decent paycheck by acquiring a new set of skills. “Within six months, I’m going to go from regular guy to working in the aerospace community,” says Tommy Florentino, a disabled veteran with a background in construction and automotive manufacturing. He has friends who went to Boston College or Suffolk University, “and they’re waiters and waitresses.” The college’s 27,000-square-foot Advanced Technology and Academic Center is at the edge of a nondescript shopping center. The complex also houses a Dollar Tree, a J.C. Penney and a Kmart, where a banner out front reads, “Now hiring.” Cashiers there earn close to minimum wage. But Kecy expects to earn at least $16 an hour when he graduates and to move up quickly from there. Composites is a broad field in manufacturing, with applications including automotive parts, sporting goods and prosthetics, as well as in the locally prominent aerospace industry. The state’s department of economic development bills its seacoast region as “the emerging composites region,” and it points to Great Bay’s program as a reason for more aerospace and defense businesses in particular to relocate there. “I’ve got some options, which is something I’ve never really experienced before,” Kecy says. There’s a strange disconnect between two of the big narratives about the American blue-collar work force right now. In one story, there is a population of unemployed and underemployed working-class adults for whom well-paying work seems increasingly out of reach; their jobs have gone overseas or become automated, and they find themselves working retail, or not working at all. But an apparently conflicting story comes from American employers, which have been insisting for years that they have a hard time finding workers to fill many skilled blue-collar jobs. A 2015 report from the Manufacturing Institute, for example, found that seven in 10 manufacturing executives said they faced shortages of workers with adequate tech skills. A high proportion of existing skilled workers is also nearing retirement, which means a bigger gap is looming soon. By 2025, the report warned, two million jobs will be going unfilled. (Health care, also a big focus of retraining programs, is another rapidly expanding field.) The tantalizing promise of government-funded job training is that it can bridge the gap between those narratives in a way that benefits individual workers, employers and the country as a whole. Hard-working Americans get good jobs, employers get skilled labor and the economy benefits from their mutual good fortune. The image of that virtuous cycle has made the promotion of training programs appealing for politicians on the left and the right. Hillary Clinton proposed retraining former coal-industry workers in new careers as part of a $30 billion package meant “to ensure that coal miners and their families get the benefits they’ve earned and respect they deserve.” Even as Republicans have voted to cut funding for training in recent years, they have paid it lip service as a way to put Americans back to work.

As the PGA Tour moves this week to PGA National Resort and Spa, a six-mile drive from Trump National, it was natural to wonder: How many of Els’s peers on the tour, if extended the same invitation, would say yes? At Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles last week, I asked more than one-third of the Genesis Open field that question, granting the respondents anonymity so they wouldn’t risk the wrath of their Twitter followers or, in the case of at least one pro, the fury of his wife. The players range in age from the early 20s to late 40s. They represent nine countries and make their homes in 14 American states, including four that voted overwhelmingly Democratic in last year’s presidential election. Of the 56 players polled, 50 — or 89.3 percent — said they would play golf with Trump if asked. Only three said they would not. The remaining three declined to answer. The results were hardly surprising. The clubhouses at PGA Tour stops have long trended Republican, and the sport’s target demographic — rich, mostly white men — is far different from the women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims who have at times been the most offended by the president’s statements and positions.

295,"WASHINGTON — Two days before Election Day, Donald J. Trump traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, and proclaimed that he was the protector of federal programs aimed at helping elderly and low-income Americans. It was Hillary Clinton, he said, who was an untrustworthy steward of the working class and who would slash vital benefits. “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,” Mr. Trump said. “You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago.” The pledge followed earlier promises to enact a new paid-maternity-leave benefit and not to make cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. When President Trump addresses Congress this Tuesday and follows the speech with a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, his White House will finally address in concrete numbers one of his central contradictions: He campaigned as the populist protector of programs for the working class, yet he has pledged to control the budget deficit, cut spending and cut taxes. Moreover, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with traditional small-government conservatives bent on cutting back or eliminating many of the programs he has championed. Many of his aides and cabinet members have expressed views that are fundamentally opposed to those he campaigned on. Former Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, for example, the new White House budget director, has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and helped engineer a government shutdown to cut spending. As House Budget Committee chairman, Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services, supported converting Medicaid to strictly capped block grants to the states and turning Medicare into a voucherlike program for future recipients. Ben Carson, the president’s nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has repeatedly said government programs to help the poor lead to dependency. The disparity between Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the government’s largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor.

296,"Democracy in the United States is strong, but showing some cracks. That is the conclusion of a new survey of 1,571 political scientists. Almost all said that the United States performed well on some of the most important measures of democracy: free and fair elections, freedom of speech and judicial limits on executive power. But fewer than two-thirds said other important standards of democracy were being met: no interference with the press and respect for judicial independence by elected branches of government. And a minority said the United States was succeeding at equal rights or basic behavioral norms of civil discourse. The survey was the first to be conducted by Bright Line Watch, a new project formed by four researchers — two from Dartmouth and one each from Yale and the University of Rochester — to study democratic performance in the United States after the 2016 election of Donald J. Trump, and to compare it with other countries. The researchers said the survey was devised to try to avoid political bias, although before the election three of them wrote an open letter saying Mr. Trump threatened democracy.

297,"Faced with chaos, confusion and a blow from the courts, the White House has been aggressively defending President Trump’s immigration executive order as a constitutional way to keep the country safe while simultaneously working on a revised version that it hopes will clear the legal hurdle. The Jan. 27 executive order barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days, banned refugees for 120 days and put an indefinite pause on Syrian refugee admissions. The revised order will retain fundamental elements and will be released “very soon,” Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, said in an interview on Fox News. For example, Mr. Miller indicated that immigration restrictions would apply to the same seven countries, which he characterized as appropriately targeted. “We’ve had dozens and dozens of terrorism cases from these seven countries, case after case after case,” Mr. Miller said. Some White House assertions about the travel ban — nonexistent terrorist attacks in Kentucky and Sweden, for example — had brief, albeit prominent, shelf lives. Others, like Mr. Miller’s assertion about the seven countries, are already being repeated. Here are some of the more misleading claims Mr. Trump and his administration have made about the first iteration of the travel ban.

298,"Forget the images of men in hard hats standing before factory gates, of men with coal-blackened faces, of men perched high above New York City on steel beams. The emerging face of the American working class is a Hispanic woman who has never set foot on a factory floor. That’s not the kind of work much of the working class does anymore. Instead of making things, they are more often paid to serve people: to care for someone else’s children or someone else’s parents; to clean another family’s home. The decline of the old working class has meant both an economic triumph for the nation and a personal tribulation for many of the workers. Technological progress has made American farms and factories more productive than ever, creating great wealth and cutting the cost of food and most other products. But the work no longer requires large numbers of workers. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the work force. By 1950, a half-century later, those two sectors employed 36 percent. In 2014, they employed less than 10 percent. For more than a century, since the trend was first documented, people have been prophesying a dire future in which the working class would no longer work. In 1964, a group of prominent liberals wrote President Johnson to warn of a “cybernation revolution” inexorably creating “a permanent impoverished and jobless class established in the midst of potential abundance.” Machines have taken the jobs of millions of Americans, and there is every indication that the trend will continue. In October, Budweiser successfully tested a self-driving truck by delivering beer more than 120 miles to a warehouse in Colorado. In December, Amazon opened a small convenience store near its Seattle headquarters that has no cashiers. Customers — for now, Amazon employees only — are billed automatically as they leave the store. In January, Bank of America opened branches in Denver and Minneapolis that are staffed by a lone employee, A.T.M.s and video terminals. And Americans are making a growing share of purchases online: about 8.4 percent of retail sales in 2016. These changes are driven by consumer preferences, not just by corporate cost-cutting imperatives. People like shopping in bed in the middle of the night. People like that computers make fewer mistakes. And people grow accustomed to computers. A few years ago, I watched a woman walk up to a bank teller and ask where she could find an A.T.M. The teller asked if she could help. No, the woman said, she just needed to withdraw some money. But the forecasters were wrong in the most important respect. Workers continue to find work, but now the jobs are in service. Taking care of aging baby boomers, in particular, has become by far the largest driver of job growth in the American economy. Among the occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to grow most rapidly over the next decade: physical-therapy assistants, home health aides, occupational-therapy assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, occupational-therapy aides, physician assistants. ... You get the idea. Nine of the 12 fastest-growing fields are different ways of saying “nurse.” In 1950, service work made up about 40 percent of working-class labor in the United States. By 2005, that share had climbed to 56 percent, according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M.I.T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich. The available evidence, Autor said, suggests that this trend has continued “very rapidly” over the last decade, increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries.

299,"WASHINGTON — Ever since Republicans got down to the business of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the Senate has been singled out as the likely problem. Any plan that could zoom through the House would hit roadblocks among Senate Republicans, many of whom have resisted a wholesale repeal of the health law without a robust replacement plan. But after weeks of loud protests, boisterous town hall meetings and scores of quieter meetings between members of Congress and health care professionals, patients, caregivers and hospital managers in their districts, it is becoming increasingly likely that a consensus in the House will be just as hard to reach. The most conservative House members are pushing for a fast repeal of the health law with only a bare-bones replacement to follow: possibly just bigger incentives for people to open health savings accounts to fund their own health needs. Other Republicans are more interested in taking their time to come up with a replacement plan that, as of now, they have failed to cobble together beyond a menu of options. Among the increasingly concerned lawmakers are those who represent the 24 Republican congressional districts that Hillary Clinton won in the presidential election — roughly the edge Republicans hold over Democrats in the House — and another dozen in districts that President Barack Obama took in 2012 but President Trump won in November. If 25 conservative hard-liners oppose any robust replacement plan, and 30 swing-district House members demand a more generous plan, passage of a compromise bill will be in jeopardy. “For the first time, Republicans need to demonstrate what they are for and not just being against Obamacare,” said Doug Heye, who served as the deputy chief of staff to former Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia when he was majority leader. Mr. Cantor and House Republican chairmen labored in 2014 to bring a replacement bill for Republicans to get behind, Mr. Heye said, and got nowhere, even with no stakes.

300,"Blue lives matter. That is, in essence, what Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been saying since he took office, promising to protect the lives of police officers, stop undermining them as (he implied) the Obama administration had, and let them get back to enforcing law and order. For some in law enforcement, the message has done what it intended to do: mollify, soothe, inspire. With vilification on the street, who needed vilification from the top? But to others, it is as shrill and jarring as a traffic whistle, threatening to undo years of work toward dismantling policies that led to mass incarceration and the erosion of trust in the police. We asked two experts to weigh in. In the first camp is Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County, outside Detroit, who explains the perspective of street-level officers facing hostility and scrutiny by cellphone cameras as they perform a dangerous job. On the other side is Ronal W. Serpas, former chief in Nashville and New Orleans, who counters that not just civilians, but officers themselves, are safer when policing is done more fairly — sometimes at the insistence of the federal government. Sheriff Bouchard answered questions by phone, and Dr. Serpas by email. Their responses were edited for clarity and length. Michael Bouchard: I think that police agencies are expecting and capable of handling scrutiny. But I think that the tone and the rhetoric did in fact diminish it.

301,"BUDAPEST — Emboldened by encouraging signals from the Trump administration, populist leaders across Central and Eastern Europe are mounting simultaneous crackdowns on nongovernmental organizations, once protected by Washington, that promote open government, aid refugees and often serve as checks on authoritarian governments. In Hungary, where the movement has reached a fever pitch, supporters of Prime Minister Viktor Orban are vilifying “foreign-funded” N.G.O.s — especially those succored by George Soros, the liberal American billionaire — and accusing the groups of wanting to flood Europe with Muslim refugees and transform “Christian” nations into multicultural stews of left-wing globalism. Earlier this week, Zoltan Kovacs, Mr. Orban’s chief international spokesman, described the organizations as “foreign agents financed by foreign money.” Macedonia’s former autocratic prime minister, Nikola Gruevski, has called for a “de-Sorosization” of society, labeling opponents “Soros-oids” and inspiring a “Stop Operation Soros” movement in January. Poland’s governing party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, says Soros-funded groups want “societies without identity,” and backs fresh efforts to regulate them. In Romania, where hundreds of thousands of anticorruption protesters took to the streets in recent weeks, the leader of the governing party charged that Mr. Soros “financed evil” and has vowed to defeat him. Similar efforts have begun or accelerated in Serbia, Slovakia and Bulgaria since Mr. Trump’s victory. “These organizations must be pushed back with all available tools,” Szilard Nemeth, vice chairman of Hungary’s governing Fidesz party, told journalists. “I think they must be swept out, and now I believe the international conditions are right for this with the election of a new president.” For more than a half-century, as Europe first struggled from the ashes of World War II and then shrugged off its Soviet shackles, American-backed nongovernmental organizations have been active across Europe, often called upon to explain the West’s style of democratic capitalism to people who have known neither. Their presence often annoyed the Continent’s more authoritarian-minded leaders, who regard many of the groups to be irritants at best, and threats at worst. Traditionally, United States administrations of both parties have promoted the spread of democracy and stubbornly defended these advocacy groups. But Mr. Trump has said he will not press America’s political system on other countries and has embraced some of Europe’s far-right leaders. He also has criticized the European Union and made disparaging remarks about some democratic principles — including his frequent criticism of the news media.

Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos. Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter’s lows; financial markets are shrugging off — or even rallying at the possibility of — imminent Fed rate increases; and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump’s presidency. An economy that seemed locked in some form of “secular stagnation” or “new normal” is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an “old normal.” The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn’t looking quite as scary and may even be ending. There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations.

308,"ISTANBUL — Aydin Dogan, the founder of a sprawling business empire that includes several leading Turkish newspapers, was summoned to court on Wednesday in the latest round of a long-running dispute between Mr. Dogan and the Turkish state. Mr. Dogan, who also owns a pair of towers bearing the Trump name and is one of the Trump family’s main business partners in Turkey, was told to attend a court hearing for a case in which he stands accused of running a fuel-smuggling ring. The charge was leveled almost a year ago, but this is the first time Mr. Dogan has been ordered to attend court. There was no immediate suggestion that the dispute was connected to Mr. Dogan’s relationship with President Trump. The order came just a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Mr. Dogan’s flagship newspaper, Hurriyet, of “impudence” for publishing a headline that suggested that there was a disagreement between Mr. Erdogan and the Turkish Army. “Everyone should know their place,” Mr. Erdogan said in response to the article on Tuesday, leading analysts to wonder if he might seek to punish the newspaper. Mr. Erdogan added, “Whoever tries to play us against ourselves will pay a heavy price.” “And so they are,” said Amberin Zaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington think tank, in an online analysis written shortly after Mr. Dogan’s summons. A spokesman for Mr. Dogan’s company did not respond to an email requesting comment. He has denied any wrongdoing. Since the election of Mr. Trump, the Erdogan government has been uncharacteristically mild in its reactions to his perceived Islamophobia. Mr. Erdogan has expressed his hope that the Trump administration will abandon President Barack Obama’s plan to arm Syrian Kurdish militias, which Turkey considers to be an arm of a Turkish terrorist group. Mr. Dogan’s summons is the latest in a series of disagreements with Mr. Erdogan. Though Mr. Dogan’s newspapers have recently made management changes that were seen as olive branches to Mr. Erdogan, their editorial positions have historically been unfavorable to his government. In 2009, Mr. Dogan’s media company was fined billions of dollars for tax infractions, which some perceived as retribution for reports published by his newspapers and broadcast by his television channels. This week’s disagreement stems from the publication of an article that suggested that the army’s leadership was “uncomfortable” with the government, in particular over the recent decision to lift a longstanding policy that prevented women in the military from  wearing  head scarves. The subject of military intervention is a particularly sensitive one in Turkey, where the government narrowly defeated an attempted coup last July.

309,"WASHINGTON — In the Obama administration’s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election — and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump and Russians — across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn’t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators. American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials — and others close to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin — and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence. Separately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates. The disclosures about the contacts came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s ties to the Russians. According to a former senior American official, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, twice in the past year. The details of the meetings were not clear, but the contact appeared to contradict testimony Mr. Sessions provided Congress during his confirmation hearing in January when he said he “did not have communications with the Russians.” Mr. Sessions said in a statement late Wednesday that he “never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/obama-trump-russia-election-hacking.html?searchResultPosition=80
310,"So the Trump administration is putting the welcome mat back out for private prisons, just as candidate Donald Trump said he would do, reversing the Obama administration’s policy of phasing them out for federal prisoners. It’s no wonder that shares in some of the nation’s biggest for-profit prison companies soared by double digits the day after the presidential election, making them among the biggest winners in the immediate postelection rally. A decision on Feb. 21 by the federal appeals court in Chicago came just in time to remind us that privatization is a really bad idea. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed a federal district judge’s dismissal and sent back for trial a case with the most appalling facts, brought by a dead prisoner’s mother against the company to which the Indiana Department of Corrections had outsourced its inmates’ medical care. The opening paragraph of the opinion by Chief Judge Diane P. Wood tells the story: “Nicholas Glisson entered the custody of the Indiana Department of Corrections on September 3, 2010, upon being sentenced for dealing in a controlled substance (selling one prescription pill to a friend who turned out to be a confidential informant). Thirty-seven days later, he was dead from starvation, acute renal failure, and associated conditions.” Starvation in a state prison? Mr. Glisson was not on a hunger strike. Rather, before his imprisonment, he had suffered from serious medical problems, including cancer of the larynx. Radical surgery and radiation made it difficult for him to swallow, speak or even hold his head up without a neck brace, a device that somehow never made it to his cell. Despite these obvious problems, and despite a letter submitted at sentencing from his doctor warning that he was unlikely to survive in prison, Mr. Glisson, 50, received no medical review or care plan during his first 24 days in custody. After that, although employees of Corizon, the company Indiana entrusted with inmate medical care, noted his alarming symptoms and his increasing emaciation, his care remained disjointed until he was found dead in his bed less than two weeks later. The Indiana prison system has policies in place to require coordination of care in the treatment of inmates with chronic medical conditions. Corizon, which has contracts in 27 states and is the country’s biggest provider of outsourced prison medical care, didn’t follow those policies. Exactly what went wrong will presumably now come out at trial, unless Corizon settles this case, Glisson v. Indiana Department of Corrections, as it did a case in California two years ago. The $8.3 million  paid in the California case to a dead inmate’s family by Corizon and Alameda County was the biggest civil rights wrongful-death settlement in the state’s history.

All presidents lunch with major news anchors. But this week’s White House gathering was different. The president kept his guests 30 minutes beyond the allotted hour, was gracious and spoke so much that he left his peekytoe crab salad untouched — a recognition, those close to him say, that he must sell himself to the Washington news media because he believes the people who work for him cannot. Mr. Trump, after all, had conceded only the day before on national television that “in terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C-plus.” In the same interview, on “Fox & Friends,” the president described his press secretary, Sean Spicer, as “a fine human being.” The language struck close Trump associates as a dismissive turn from a man who relishes hyperbole. Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Mr. Trump who visited him in the Oval Office on Wednesday, said that the president was experiencing “a lot of angst” about his negative coverage. But Mr. Trump, he said, was feeling energized after his speech to Congress on Tuesday. “He said to me, ‘People tell me that it was the best speech I ever gave,’” Mr. Ruddy said. “He seemed really pleased.” A master media manipulator and storyteller, Mr. Trump went without a traditional press secretary during the presidential campaign, preferring to field queries on his own. Now he is increasingly taking command of his administration’s message making, and privately expressing frustration with a White House press office under siege amid leaks and infighting. John Catsimatidis, the Manhattan businessman and a Trump friend of three decades, said he would counsel Mr. Trump to give better directions to the press office. He should “sit down with them and tell them, ‘You have to explain things to people in a way where it’s completely understandable to everybody.’” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/trump-news-media.html?searchResultPosition=77
312,"WASHINGTON — Eight years after he was sent to China by a Democratic president, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor and Republican presidential candidate, is under consideration to be President Trump’s ambassador to Russia, people briefed on the deliberations said. And like eight years ago, there is a political dimension to the choice: Sending Mr. Huntsman to Moscow would remove him as a primary challenger to Utah’s 82-year-old Republican senator, Orrin Hatch — just as when former President Barack Obama chose him for Beijing in 2009, it was seen as a way to keep him off the field during the 2012 presidential campaign. Mr. Huntsman ended up running for the Republican nomination to challenge Mr. Obama anyway, failing to emerge from the pack in a primary that produced Mitt Romney. There is no telling whether he will emerge as Mr. Trump’s choice, given the sensitivity of the Russia post and the president’s propensity for auditioning people for jobs. The White House declined to comment, as did Mr. Huntsman. Mr. Huntsman’s name had already circulated for secretary of state and, more recently, for deputy secretary. But a person briefed on the talks, which were first reported by CNN, said the Moscow ambassador’s post was a more genuine prospect. Mr. Huntsman spoke with Mr. Trump last week and met on Monday with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The Moscow job is a less obvious fit for Mr. Huntsman than Beijing was. A Mormon missionary in Taiwan as a young man, Mr. Huntsman speaks Mandarin; he and his wife, Mary Kaye, adopted a girl from China. He was ambassador to Singapore under former President George H.W. Bush. While Mr. Huntsman’s family company owns manufacturing operations in Russia, and he was involved in the company’s early business dealings there, people who know him say that he has never claimed any particular expertise on the country. In the past, when Mr. Huntsman has taken a federal job, he has divested himself of family business holdings to avoid a conflict of interest.

313,"WASHINGTON — Computers and cellphones seized during a deadly Special Operations raid in Yemen in January offer clues about attacks Al Qaeda could carry out in the future, including insights into new types of hidden explosives the group is making and new training tactics for militants, according to American officials. But it is still unclear how much the information advances the military’s knowledge of the plans and future operations of Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, although it may give a glimpse of its evolving tactics, the officials said. The Trump administration has been eager to defend itself against assertions that the raid of a Qaeda safe house, in which a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 was killed, was a failure because little meaningful intelligence material was seized. A military investigation was also ordered to determine whether women and children died in the raid. In his address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump called the raid “highly successful” and said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had assured him that it had yielded “large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.” The raid is a delicate issue in the Trump administration because the president authorized it five days into office, over dinner at the White House with Mr. Mattis and several other senior officials. But in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday, Mr. Trump seemed to distance himself from the operation, saying that responsibility for the decision to go forward rested with his generals. “This was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do,” he said. The information contained in the cellphones, laptop computers and other materials scooped up in the raid is still being analyzed, but it has not yet revealed any specific plots, and it has not led to any strikes against Qaeda militants in Yemen or elsewhere, officials said.

314,"President Trump’s first address to Congress checked nearly all the domestic policy boxes that dominated his public statements during the campaign and his few short weeks in the White House — jobs, immigration, taxes, medical care. But there was one gaping omission: foreign policy. Here was his moment to assert understanding of the foreign policy threats and opportunities facing the country, and his vision of his role as commander in chief with a wider understanding of America’s role in the world. He failed to grasp it. He boasted about plans to throw billions more dollars at the Pentagon, without a word about how this will advance national security. He spoke at length about his plans to bar and expel immigrants he regards as dangerous, but far less about the very real threats from the Islamic State and other extremist groups. There was no coherent idea about major continuing challenges in Afghanistan and Syria. In fact, the words Afghanistan and Syria — as well as North Korea (with its growing nuclear arsenal) — never crossed his lips. China and Iran got passing mention; climate change — a major global challenge — zero. So how did he deploy his energies and display his concern? Chiefly by recognizing the widow of Senior Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a member of the Navy SEALs who was killed in January in a botched raid in Yemen, which Mr. Trump blamed on “the generals.” Thus ensued several agonizing minutes as Carryn Owens struggled gamely to keep her composure while the audience gave her a standing ovation to which Mr. Trump added a grotesque coda, announcing that Chief Owens would be “very happy because I think he just broke a record” by drawing sustained applause. None of this could erase the fact that Chief Owens’s father had earlier demanded an investigation into what he called a “stupid mission” and refused to meet Mr. Trump. Or that Mr. Trump, asked about Mr. Owens’s criticism on “Fox & Friends,” refused to accept responsibility, as most commanders in chief would do, and instead blamed the military commanders for the operation.

315,"Lyft, the second-largest ride hailing company in the United States, is trying to raise more money just as Uber, its bigger rival, grapples with questions about its culture and leadership. Lyft is talking with investors about new fund-raising that would put the company’s value around $6 billion, according to three people briefed on the financing who asked to remain anonymous because the proceedings are confidential. One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion. The company was valued at $5.5 billion early last year after investors, including General Motors, poured about $1 billion into it. It is unclear how far along Lyft is with the new fund-raising and whether the round will be completed. Lyft, which is based in San Francisco, declined to comment. The funding effort was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. The fund-raising may bolster Lyft competitively, given that Uber has been caught up in an escalating series of internal problems. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, has been under scrutiny this year for his participation in an economic advisory council for President Trump amid a social media campaign for people to delete their Uber app. Mr. Kalanick eventually stepped down from the council. Uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks, after a former employee published an account of her year at the company, which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. In addition, Uber was caught misleading journalists about an accident caused by one of its self-driving cars. And Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, sued Uber last week, claiming it had used technology stolen by one of its employees. This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced. Lyft has long been the underdog to Uber. Lyft operates only in the United States while Uber is a global company. The two have previously engaged in pricing wars and have bad-mouthed each other. In August, Lyft held discussions with General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing about selling itself. The company could not agree with potential buyers on a price. Yet Lyft’s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive. As Uber struggled with its ties to President Trump’s administration in January, Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lyft’s app subsequently soared to the top of the Apple app store’s download list. Neither Lyft nor Uber has emerged as a financially sound business. Their battle has led them to lower prices and offer deals to lure new customers and maintain their market share. It has been hard for either company to raise prices enough to cover costs. Both Lyft and Uber are still unprofitable and depend on private investment capital to fund their operations.

316,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday night buoyed House Republican leaders who were hopeful that his leadership would unite fractious lawmakers around a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. But fundamental disagreements still divide Republicans on one of the central promises of their 2016 campaigns: repealing the health law. While Mr. Trump appeared to back a health plan being drawn up by Republican leaders, it became clear Wednesday that lawmakers were continuing to argue over its details. Republican senators emerged from a closed-door meeting on health care tight-lipped. Some have balked at a proposal to require workers to pay taxes on particularly generous employer-provided health benefits. Some are worried about the future of Medicaid. But the central dividing line appears to be over how the federal government would help people purchase health insurance. House Republican leaders would offer to help people buy insurance on the free market with a tax credit that, for some low-income households, could exceed the amount they owe in federal income taxes. Some of the most conservative Republicans say the tax credit should not be more than the amount of taxes consumers owe. If the government makes payments to people with little or no tax liability, they say, that would amount to a new entitlement program, replacing one kind of government largess from President Barack Obama with another from Mr. Trump.

317,"WASHINGTON — President Trump loves the song “My Way,” bristles at the slightest alterations in his daily routine, and lashes out when the world won’t accept him on his own terms. Then, when that doesn’t work, he tries something completely different. Mr. Trump’s well-received address to Congress on Tuesday night, a conciliatory speech in which the word “we” outnumbered the word “I” by three to one, represented precisely that kind of shift. Just last week, Mr. Trump shouted himself hoarse branding the news media “enemies of the American people” at a time when he was working on an address that invoked the better angels of his own nature, national unity and an “end to trivial fights.” This does not represent a pivot, it is not a fundamental change of approach, and it does not mean that Mr. Trump plans to abandon his tweet-first-and-ask-questions-later style. But it is a recognition by the White House, from Mr. Trump on down, that what it had been doing was not quite working and that a softer sales tactic was needed to sell the same hard-edge populist agenda he campaigned on, people close to Mr. Trump said. “It was not a reset speech,” the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump’s team basked in its best news cycle since he took office 41 days ago. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a Trump ally and adviser, said, “The thing people don’t get about Trump is how quickly he learns — he moves fast — so he’s going to be using different approaches.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/trump-speech-congress-conciliatory.html?searchResultPosition=71

The change in venues prompted the predictable laments stateside. But to wax rhapsodic about the good old days when golfers decamped to Florida for the month of March to gear up for the Masters is to turn a blind eye to the game’s evolution. Since 1999, when the inaugural World Golf Championships event was held outside San Diego, the game has gone global. At that first match-play event, 39 of the 64 participants, or 61 percent of the field, were from the United States, and five of the top 10 golfers in the world rankings were Americans. This week, 29 of the 70 participants, or 41 percent of the stroke-play field, are from the United States, and four of the top 10 are Americans. “Everything kind of evolves and moves on in the world, and I think golf’s so stuck in tradition and things,” said Adam Scott of Australia, who won the Doral event last year. “I think we’re a bit sentimental with some things and we have to move on and let it go and take it for what it was.” Four years before he became the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump bought the Doral resort, a regular tour stop since the early 1960s, and spent $250 million on renovations to the grounds, only to lose the tournament when Cadillac’s sponsorship contract ran out last year.

321,"Recently, the actor Mark Ruffalo sent “a prayer out into the universe” for a kind of experience he wanted in 2017. “All I wanted to do was get on a stage with a group of people I trust and love and do a great play,” Mr. Ruffalo, 49, said over breakfast in Manhattan recently. “No bells and whistles. No giant concepts. No reinventions.” The universe did as it was bade to do. The very next day, Mr. Ruffalo was offered the leading part in Arthur Miller’s “The Price,” after John Turturro dropped out. That his wish was answered by Arthur Miller seems particularly heaven-sent: In the almost 11 years since he last appeared on Broadway, in a revival of Clifford Odets’s “Awake and Sing!,” Mr. Ruffalo has crammed an enormous amount of social activism into his busy career, which has garnered him three Oscar nominations (most recently for “Spotlight,” from 2015) and his family life (he and his wife, Sunrise, have three children, aged 15, 11 and 9). So the playwright’s examinations of economic and class struggles resonate beyond the script for Mr. Ruffalo. “Art is activism. My [acting] teacher used to say: ‘We should pay to go to church, and the theater should be free. That’s where we learn about ourselves,’” Mr. Ruffalo said. In 2011, he stepped to the front of the movement against drilling for natural gas in upstate New York; recently, he helped deliver solar panels to the people of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation who were protesting the pipeline; and he helped organize and address a rally in New York City the night before the inauguration of President Trump (“We got 27,000 people within four hours!”). “A lot of the anti-fracking movement was giving a platform to people who were living with the horror of fracking in their communities. Why aren’t we hearing from the people? When you start to know your neighbor at a human level, it’s hard to want to hurt them, even if you don’t agree with them. It’s hard to say, ‘That person’s water should be contaminated because I need to heat my house.’” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/theater/mark-ruffalo-broadway-the-price-arthur-miller.html?searchResultPosition=101

That generation has now helped power one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited stock market debuts in recent memory, making billionaires of the founders of the disappearing-message service Snapchat. Investors, attracted by Snapchat’s hold on its millennial users — who check the app on average more than 18 times a day — flocked to the initial public offering, pushing the parent company, Snap Inc., to a valuation of nearly $24 billion. The stock sale sets Snap up as the most valuable American technology company to go public since Facebook nearly five years ago.

Later, as an Eagle Scout, he traced how railroad oil spilled into the Whitefish River and watched as a single spark set that waterway on fire. “The project,” he wrote in his 2016 book, “promoted a lifetime of conservation values.” President Trump has tapped Mr. Zinke, 55, a House member and fifth-generation Montanan who grew up in this timber-and-tourism community, to be secretary of the interior.

He added that he had come up with the idea before the travel ban was announced, as part of his efforts to establish an international ensemble to cooperate with the United Nations in giving concerts around the world. But when asked whether he hoped that “A Concert for Unity” would send a particular message in the Trump era, Mr. Gilbert said that was very much on his mind. “Absolutely, I’m not going to shy away from that question,” he said. “I do think that this sense of division, and creating an ‘us and them’ mentality, is absurd. I think the world is a smaller place, and we should embrace that, and not sow division and build walls. The old cliché that music is the international language: It couldn’t be more true.” Mr. Gilbert, whose parents both played in the Philharmonic, is stepping down as music director after eight seasons; he will be succeeded in 2018 by Jaap van Zweden.

And throughout the three-concert run he plans to bring in prominent guest artists, including the cellist Yo-Yo Ma on June 8 and the trumpet player Wynton Marsalis on June 9. “More than anything, I hope it is a positive, feel-good moment,” he said, “when musicians from different backgrounds and countries and cultures can share the stage and point to a positive future.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/arts/music/alan-gilbert-philharmonic-finale-global-unity-concert.html?searchResultPosition=105
329,"FOSHAN, China — At first glance, given the way that China controls its currency, the Guangdong Chigo Air Conditioning Company might seem like a winner. For the past three years, China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to weaken in value compared with the American dollar. On paper, that should bolster Chigo’s profits. Half of its $1.2 billion in annual sales come from abroad, mostly in dollars, and a weaker renminbi gives Chinese companies an advantage when they sell their products in other countries. Yet the renminbi’s slide has provided only a marginal benefit, said Li Xinghao, the company’s founder and chairman. Big Western department store chains have learned to pit manufacturers against one another — and China is full of air-conditioner manufacturers. When the renminbi weakens, the chains simply tell factory bosses to cut their prices or lose the business to another Chinese factory. “It only brings benefits for the first month,” Mr. Li said. “For the next month, clients are recalculating what they’ll pay. The supply is much greater than demand, so profits can’t go up.” The renminbi is likely to be a major topic behind closed doors as Chinese lawmakers gather beginning on Sunday for the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, the top lawmaking body in the country. President Trump had heavily criticized China during the campaign, saying that Beijing for many years used an artificially weak currency to unfairly help its businesses and steal American jobs. Mr. Trump has not acted on a campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator, and Steven Mnuchin, the new Treasury secretary, has said the administration is conducting a standard review of China’s currency policy. Still, Mr. Trump has kept up his rhetoric. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/business/china-dollar-yuan-renminbi.html?searchResultPosition=104

Todd Harrison, the director for defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, posted this chart on Twitter, showing at least 10 higher increases since the 1977 fiscal year and four since 2002. And this calculus does not take into account Overseas Contingency Operations, a separate bucket of money used to fund wars. Factoring in war spending, Mr. Trump’s claim is even less credible.

332,"WASHINGTON — President Trump spent his first weeks in office vowing to crack down on illegal immigration with deportations and other get-tough proposals. But when he went before Congress on Tuesday to lay out his agenda, he offered a far broader plan that echoes an approach long favored by mainstream Republicans for reshaping the nation’s immigration laws. Mr. Trump’s call for a “merit-based” immigration system — one that puts a priority on skills and employability over family ties — revived a central element of the broad immigration compromise sought in 2007 by President George W. Bush, which paired stricter border enforcement with an eventual grant of legal status for many of the estimated 11 million immigrants illegally living in the United States. In a conversation with television news anchors at the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said  he would be open to such a deal, although he did not mention that in his speech to Congress. Mr. Trump’s remarks in the speech focused instead on the merit-based system. “It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially, yet in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon,” Mr. Trump said. “Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.” But such a system is viewed with skepticism by some Republicans who fear it would harm the economy by shutting out less-educated immigrants who fill vital jobs, such as farm and kitchen workers. “It sounds great just to bring the total brainiac, most skilled people here, but when you look at the economy, it’s not that simple — you need the brainiacs, but you need the low-skilled people as well,” said Tamar Jacoby, the president of ImmigrationWorks USA, who advises Republicans on immigration issues. Democrats and those on the left have an even more sinister view of the idea, arguing that Mr. Trump’s emphasis on choosing the most skilled immigrants is a backdoor way to re-engineer American laws to filter out certain ethnicities and nationalities.

Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the American-led task force that is fighting the militants in Iraq and Syria, said the strike by Russian and Syrian government planes led to casualties among the Syrian fighters, but he declined to say how many were hurt or if any were killed. He added that the Russian attack appeared to have been a mistake: The Russian military thought it was bombing villages held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, when in fact they were recently occupied by Syrian Arab fighters. “We had some Russian aircraft and regime aircraft bomb some villages that I believe they thought were held by ISIS,” General Townsend said in a video news conference with reporters at the Pentagon. “Actually on the ground were some of our Syrian Arab coalition forces.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/middleeast/russia-syria-airstrike-americans-advisers.html?searchResultPosition=100

But last night, the president revealed that this obsession goes even deeper than his constant tweets about poll numbers would suggest. During his address to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump paid tribute to Senior Chief Petty Officer William (Ryan) Owens, a Navy SEAL who was killed during a raid in Yemen in January. “Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom,” he said. “We will never forget him.” When the audience gave Carryn Owens, Chief Owens’s widow, a standing ovation, Mr. Trump added, “Ryan is looking down right now, you know that, and he’s very happy, because I think he just broke a record.” He was referring, presumably, to the length of the applause. Mr. Trump has been praised in some quarters for Tuesday’s address, during which he took a more conciliatory tone than he has in recent public appearances. But his comment about Chief Owens showed that even if his language changes slightly, his fundamental outlook stays the same. In fact, the comment offered a useful peek into the president’s psyche: When he imagines a deceased veteran gazing down from heaven at his widow, the president and the assembled Congress, he sees that veteran measuring the length of his own ovation, and patting himself on the back for breaking a record. In other words, when asked to take the perspective of someone who has “laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom,” Mr. Trump assumes that what would gratify such a person is the same thing that gratifies him: adulation.

Cuomo will make a quick trip to Israel this weekend, at a moment when the handling of Jewish issues is percolating through the national political debate. The announcement of the trip, made on Wednesday during a speech to Orthodox Jewish students in Albany, came on the heels of several events in which Mr. Cuomo has sought to present himself as a proactive fighter of anti-Semitism. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo went to a Jewish community center in Albany to denounce such behavior, citing a series of threats and acts of racist vandalism across the state, calling them “repugnant to everything we believe as New Yorkers.” Word of the Israel trip leaked shortly after. In his remarks to students, the governor said the short trip would be focused on economic development. But its timing also seems ripe politically. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has been rumored to have higher political goals, and he has increasingly spoken out on national issues like middle-class economic relief. Last week, he traveled to Washington and rubbed elbows with fellow Democrats at the National Governors Association winter meeting.

337,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave Virginia Democrats a fresh chance to challenge parts of the legislative map for the state’s House of Delegates. The decision tried to bring some clarity to the tangled question of what role race can play in drawing voting districts. But the Supreme Court decided very little, leaving it to the trial court to apply a slightly refined definition of racial gerrymandering. “The upshot of all of this is that not much has changed with these cases,” Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in a blog post. “The fight will be over the details and application to particular cases.” Marc E. Elias, a lawyer for the challengers in the case, disagreed, calling the decision a “major victory” that will help Democrats. The case, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, No. 15-680, concerned a dozen voting districts drawn after the 2010 census, each with at least a 55 percent population of black residents of voting age. The Supreme Court has said race cannot be the predominant reason in creating legislative districts. In 2015, a divided three-judge panel of Federal District Court in Richmond, Va., upheld 11 of the challenged districts because, it said, race had not been the primary factor in drawing them. Since the districts could be justified under traditional redistricting criteria like compactness, contiguity, incumbency protection and political considerations, the court said, race could not have been the predominant reason for drawing them.

338,"First as a candidate, and now as president, Donald Trump has drawn fire for promising the moon and stars without giving the slightest hint of how he intended to obtain them. In fact, as Tuesday night’s speech to Congress demonstrated so clearly, the president is actually a master of the art of diminished expectations. On Tuesday night, we are told, he looked sober and presidential, when all he actually did was read a speech from a Teleprompter without veering off into one of his incoherent rants. It’s hard to believe that even the ill-disciplined and narcissistic Trump would have stood in the well of the House of Representatives and tried to lead a chant of “lock her up” or slapped journalists with the “enemy of the people” label that has been a favorite of dictators for more than a century. Americans are supposed to be delighted, or at least relieved, that Trump began his speech by denouncing anti-Semitic threats and attacks, which have proliferated since he took office. But it took the president long weeks to make that simple statement, and just a few hours before his speech in the Capitol, he was suggesting to a group of state attorneys general that anti-Semitic attacks might actually have been carried out by people who want “to make others look bad” (in other words, his political opponents). At one point, Republican lawmakers in the chamber leapt to their feet, cheering in sycophantic approval, when Trump announced that he was going to put an end to the “uncontrolled entry” into the United States of people “from places where proper vetting cannot occur.” This is a classic Trumpian stunt, inventing a problem and then promising to fix it. There is no free access for refugees to this country — it takes about two years to clear the vetting process — and none of the fatal terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 have been committed by people from the seven countries Trump targeted with his anti-Muslim visa ban. If Trump did nothing about immigration, he could cross “uncontrolled entry” off his list because it’s not happening and it never has. Under Trump’s leadership, there won’t be any flying pigs, either, and Bigfoot will finally be prevented from tracking his muddy footprints through the Capitol Rotunda.

He outlined a five-point plan for health reform that was largely aspirational, and probably consistent with the goals of nearly every Republican listening. But the issue of tax credits is actually an important dividing line in the Republican caucus. And it represents a break from Mr. Trump’s own position during the campaign. Mr. Trump did not go into detail on this subject, saying merely that “we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits.” Yet those words were a signal to Republicans fighting over two options about how the government should pay for health insurance. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and the leaders of the House committees overseeing health care, want to fund health insurance with something called an advanceable, refundable tax credit. That functions sort of like a gift card; people can use it to buy health insurance regardless of their income. Another group, led by the conservative Republican Study Committee and the House Freedom Caucus, believes that insurance benefits should be funded through the more common tax deductions, which allow you to subtract an amount from your income before paying taxes. Tax deductions are most valuable for people in the highest tax brackets. They’re less like a gift card, and more like a coupon.

340,"LONDON — You could call it bling diplomacy. As part of a monthlong tour in Asia to promote economic ties, King Salman of Saudi Arabia arrived in Indonesia on Wednesday to great fanfare, accompanied, the news media said, by a retinue with a net worth in the billions of dollars, including about 1,500 people, among them 25 high-ranking princes, 10 ministers and more than 100 security personnel. Over the last two weeks, they arrived in six Boeing passenger jets and one Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a military transport aircraft, carrying 506 tons of cargo, including two Mercedes-Benz S600 limousines and two electric elevators for the king’s personal use. An Indonesian freight company told the Antara news agency that it employed 572 workers just to deal with the delegation’s luggage. The king, 81, used a golden-hued escalator to descend from a jet painted with the words “God Bless You.” Pageantry is hardly unusual for any royal family, even less so for the Saudis, who are famously extravagant spenders even as their citizens are struggling under a government austerity program. Details about his entourage made headlines around the world, and appeared to overshadow the purpose of his trip. But the size and pomp of the king’s entourage may indicate efforts to strengthen trade ties with Asia at a time of falling oil prices, experts said: A demonstration of wealth can be a show of power. It involves “stroking egos and putting on a show: The Saudis are in town,” said Peter Salisbury, a research fellow at Chatham House in London. “When that number of people show up, it creates a stir. It’s symbolism.” There’s also an economic benefit to a visit by a delegation that is bigger and more opulent than average, Mr. Salisbury said, as the visitors are likely to splurge on dinners, shopping, luxury villas in Bali and other extravagances.

At rallies last year across the country, Mr. Trump said over and over again that he would use the nation’s schools to fix what he described as failing inner cities and a virtual education crisis that most hurts black and Hispanic children. In North Carolina, he called school choice “the great civil rights issue of our time.” In Florida, he declared that “every disadvantaged child in this country” should have access to school choice. And, at a Washington gathering of conservatives, he said that under his administration, “money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family.” In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump reiterated those pledges, and in doing so backed his controversial education secretary, Betsy DeVos, who has built her career on promoting voucher programs. “I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children,” Mr. Trump said during the joint session of Congress, to applause from many Republican lawmakers. “These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.” In a statement, Ms. DeVos praised the president and said he “delivered on his promise to support school choice and offer students access to quality options.” A Department of Education official said on Wednesday afternoon that Mr. Trump and Ms. DeVos were considering a number of ways to create a federal school choice program that would offer tax credit scholarships. That would allow individuals and corporations to make tax deductible donations to nonprofit networks of private schools, which then provide tuition scholarships to students.

Caterpillar has been dogged by accusations that it slashed its domestic tax bill by shifting corporate profits from the United States to a subsidiary in Switzerland. A 2014 congressional investigation concluded that a scheme to move cash between the company’s American and foreign subsidiaries cut its tax bill in the United States by $2.4 billion over 13 years.

343,"TORONTO — Canada’s merit-based immigration system received a loving mention by President Trump this week in his speech to Congress. Mr. Trump, who has railed against illegal immigration and talked tough about tightening borders, said adopting that kind of system would cost American taxpayers less and help increase wages for poor workers. But in Canada, immigration is not just about selecting newcomers based on their skills. It is part of a system that promotes both the economy and the country’s multicultural society, which has arguably become as much a part of Canadian identity as hockey. And it is largely seen as a way to increase immigration, not reduce it. “Canadians are more likely than citizens of any other industrial country to think immigration is essential to the economy and the future of the country,” said Jeffrey Reitz, a professor of ethnic and immigration studies at the University of Toronto. Canada, a country of 35 million, aims to take in 300,000 immigrants this year — 0.85 percent of its population, compared with the United States’ 0.3 percent — and polls show Canadians are happy with this. In fact, the finance minister’s advisory council on economic growth wants 150,000 more. Part of that enthusiasm is the country’s recognition that, with an aging population, immigration is essential to economic growth. Add to that Canada’s geography — a long border with the prosperous United States to the south and the Arctic to the north — and illegal immigration is less of an issue. And finally, Canadians have a wholehearted belief in the merit-based immigration system, which creates a positive feedback loop.

346,"OTTAWA — Many people thought it was no coincidence in November when the website of Canada’s immigration department crashed just as the election returns in the United States were beginning to show that Donald J. Trump was winning the presidency. Government officials said the problem was because of a flood of requests to the site, and news organizations around the world swiftly reported social media speculation that the crush of traffic had come from unhappy Americans who would rather emigrate than live under a Trump administration. But it turns out that the computer crash may really have been just a coincidence after all. According to internal government documents obtained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, widespread problems with government computer systems generally and an impending deadline for non-American visitors were probably to blame for the website’s crash. Indeed, the problems that eventually crippled the digital public face of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada began to cause temporary crashes around 2 p.m. Eastern time — hours before the polls would begin to close in the United States. The department had been bracing for a surge in web traffic on that day, but not because of the American election. There were only two days to go before a program took effect requiring foreign travelers to Canada, other than Americans, to go online and buy an electronic travel authorization ahead of their visit. When the slowdowns and crashes started on Nov. 8, one public servant, whose name has been removed from the documents, wrote in an email that “it looks like the eTA is starting to experience significant volumes a few days earlier than planned.” The abbreviation refers to the electronic travel authorization program. That afternoon, as matters grew worse on the website, the department contacted Shared Services Canada, the government’s centralized computer services agency, but apparently got little satisfaction. “S.S.C. has indicated that ticket is pending and there’s nothing that can be done,” an immigration official wrote in the afternoon; that official’s name also was removed. By 11 p.m., the website had buckled under the mounting problems.

In January, the Boy Scouts of America reversed a century-old stance, opening the door to transgender members. Last week, President Trump rescinded rules put in place less than a year earlier allowing transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Mr. Grimm’s case could settle the bathroom issue once and for all. The signatories of the Human Rights Campaign brief include a number of tech companies, like Airbnb, eBay, Intel, LinkedIn, PayPal, Salesforce, Twitter, Yahoo and Yelp. But businesses from several other industries have signed on, too. They include Gap, MAC Cosmetics, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Warby Parker and Williams-Sonoma. It is not the first time that big businesses have lent their support to the fight for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights. Last year, for example, the chief executives of dozens of major corporations wrote a letter to Pat McCrory, the North Carolina governor at the time, urging the state to repeal House Bill 2, which curbed legal protections for the gay community. A bipartisan effort has begun to repeal that bill. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/transgender-boy-gavin-grimm-corporations-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=68
351,"Steve Yarbrough is one of the most powerful men in Arizona. As president of the State Senate, he has promoted a range of conservative policies, including a tuition tax credit system that provides over $100 million per year to finance vouchers for private schools. In his speech to Congress this week, President Trump singled out a young woman who attended private school using a tax credit-financed voucher. The president urged Congress to pass legislation that would provide similar benefits to millions of students. But Mr. Yarbrough is not just a champion of tax credit vouchers. He also profits from them personally. The story of how that happened raises questions about President Trump’s campaign promise to spend $20 billion to increase school choice. There’s a strong chance that he’ll do that through tax credit vouchers — a mechanism that Betsy DeVos actively campaigned for before she became Mr. Trump’s education secretary. State tax credit voucher programs have grown rapidly in recent years. The number of students receiving them increased to 256,000 this year, from about 50,000 in 2005. Arizona has one of the oldest and largest programs. It allows taxpayers who donate money to nonprofit voucher-granting organizations to claim a 100 percent, dollar-for-dollar credit against their state taxes (up to a certain limit). In other words, if a married couple donates $1,000 to a voucher-granting nonprofit, their tax bill is reduced by $1,000. The nonprofit then gives the money to families who use it to pay tuition at private schools. The Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization (Acsto) is one of the state’s largest voucher-granting groups. From 2010 to 2014 (the latest year recorded in federal tax filings), the group received $72.9 million in donations, all of which were ultimately financed by the state. Arizona law allows the group to keep 10 percent of those donations to pay for overhead. In 2014, the group used that money to pay its executive director $125,000. His name? Steve Yarbrough. Forms filed by the organization with the I.R.S. declare that he worked an average of 40 hours per week on the job — in addition, presumably, to the hours he worked as president of the State Senate.

352,"WASHINGTON — One of the few senior Obama administration appointees still at the State Department delivered a ringing endorsement on Thursday of Mexico’s efforts to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States, just as the Trump administration is examining whether to slash money supporting those efforts. William R. Brownfield, assistant secretary for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, said in a conference call with reporters that the United Nations and decades of patient diplomacy had put the United States in a much better position to police the international flow of narcotics than at any point in the last three decades. “We’ve still got major challenges ahead to address the opioid crisis here in the United States of America,” Mr. Brownfield said. Referring to an annual report on international narcotics released on Thursday, he added, “but in my humble opinion, this report suggests that we’re in a far better place to address those challenges now than we would have been 20, 30 or 40 years ago.” President Trump has criticized Mexico as a source of dangerous illegal immigrants and drugs, and his pledge to build a wall along the southern border of the United States has infuriated Mexican officials. Mr. Trump also referred to the United Nations on Twitter as “just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.” The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic that is now killing more people than traffic accidents, and at least 90 percent of the heroin consumed in this country comes from Mexico. Mr. Brownfield said the opioid crisis had been caused by, among other factors, doctors’ prescribing habits and soaring patient demand in the United States and by Mexican drug traffickers’ increased efforts to meet that demand. “The United States and Mexico have shared responsibility for this problem, and that requires shared solutions,” he said, adding that cooperation between the two governments to attack the problem was at “historically high levels.” Mr. Brownfield said that Mexico and the United Nations were vital allies in the fight against international drug trafficking. The Merida Initiative, a bilateral partnership with Mexico begun in 2007 that is focused on fighting organized criminal groups, “makes us more able to interdict drug trafficking than ever before,” he said. “In a sense,” he added, “we have developed a law enforcement cooperative wall.” The Trump administration is compiling a list of continuing American aid to Mexico, possibly in hopes of identifying money that could be diverted to help pay for a border wall. The Merida Initiative is the review’s biggest target. Asked if he planned to resign, as many Obama appointees have, Mr. Brownfield said, “I am in the job for which I was confirmed by the United States Senate in the year 2011 and will remain here until I am no longer in this job.” The Trump administration continues to rely on Obama appointees like Mr. Brownfield because of a slow appointments process.

353,"WASHINGTON — The White House is fiercely divided over President Trump’s campaign promise to “cancel” the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, is pressing the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord, according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate. But, they say, he is clashing with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who fear the move could have broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications. Mr. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to tear up President Barack Obama’s global warming policies, and on the home front he is moving aggressively to meet those pledges with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a new E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is a skeptic of climate science. Next week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama’s E.P.A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from coal-fired power plants. Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration’s program to meet the nation’s obligations to reduce climate emissions under the Paris agreement. While the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a 194-nation accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the four-year process to withdraw the world’s largest economy and second-largest climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming. Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic, throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and, diplomats say, the credibility of the United States. But it would also demonstrate to his supporters that Mr. Trump is a man of his word, putting American coal interests ahead of a global deal forged by Mr. Obama.

354,"A 22-year-old woman who came to the United States from Argentina as a 7-year-old child and was allowed to remain in the country under an Obama-era program was detained by immigration authorities after speaking at a news conference in Mississippi about her fears of being deported, her lawyer said on Thursday. The woman, Daniela Vargas, was picked up on Wednesday when the car she was riding in was pulled over by officers shortly after leaving the news conference at City Hall in Jackson, Miss., the lawyer, Abigail Peterson, said in a telephone interview. The event was organized by lawyers, church leaders and the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance to raise awareness about the impact deportation and President Trump’s immigration policies have on families. An officer placed Ms. Vargas in handcuffs after telling her, “You know what we are here for,” Ms. Peterson said. Ms Vargas was taken into custody and transferred to a detention center in Louisiana, where she was being held on Thursday without bond. Ms. Peterson said the authorities informed her on Thursday that Ms. Vargas would be processed as a “visa waiver overstay,” which means she would not be given a hearing and would be flown to Argentina. “That could be in a few weeks,” said Ms. Peterson. Ms. Vargas’s story is one of many that have circulated of families affected by immigration policies since Mr. Trump took office. Under the visa waiver program, Ms. Vargas and her family were allowed to stay for only 90 days. By staying longer, they became ineligible for an immigration hearing, L. Patricia Ice, the M.I.R.A. legal project director, said. But then, in 2012, Ms. Vargas was allowed to stay in the United States under a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program, started by former President Obama, allows immigrant children who had mostly grown up in the United States to become eligible for work permits and grants permission to stay temporarily.

355,"Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, deserved the hammering she received for her widely reviled comments characterizing historically black colleges and universities (H.B.C.U.s) as early examples of “school choice.” But when it comes to the fate of H.B.C.U.s under the Trump administration, her apparent misunderstanding of their history is a distraction. The fate of these institutions in the coming years will hinge not on her words, but on her decisions about their funding. In February, after only a few days on the job, Ms. DeVos made headlines for visiting Howard University, a historically black college founded in 1867. Then, after a meeting with H.B.C.U. leaders Monday, she released a statement calling H.B.C.U.s the “real pioneers when it comes to school choice.” That description was widely criticized as a dishonest attempt to distance these institutions from the segregated past that necessitated them and to awkwardly reposition them as talking points for the school choice movement. But her misguided remarks have diverted attention away from something more urgent: She now oversees the federal agency that is responsible for roughly three-fourths of the annual federal revenue to H.B.C.U.s. In ways that are much more consequential than any statement she could make, this power will allow her to determine how the schools fare under the Trump administration. Tuesday, President Trump issued an executive order moving the White House Initiative on HBCUs (WHI-HBCUs) from the Department of Education to the Office of the White House. Some H.B.C.U. advocates supported this move because of their impression that it would strengthen the administrative authority of the initiative and elevate the stature of its executive director. However, moving the WHI-HBCUs from the Department of Education to the White House distances the initiative from the source of essential funding for H.B.C.U.s. That’s because the Education Department is responsible for the distribution of approximately $700 million annually in grants, contracts and appropriations to those schools. But when it comes to annual revenue to H.B.C.U.s, the Office of the President is directly responsible for zero dollars.

It’s now a cocktail bar downstairs from a cookie shop. “We could get a cookie,” Ms. Osborne said, shrugging. She had started her Dylan tour at Cafe Wha?, where Mr. Dylan performed as a New York neophyte in 1961. Reading from an online guide, she circled down to a townhouse at 94 Macdougal, where Mr. Dylan once lived, that is, until he got into a fistfight with a neighbor who had been going through his trash. “If you’re trying to be incognito, this is the last place you would buy a house,” she said. “So I don’t know what that was all about.” Ms. Osborne, best known for her 1995 single “One of Us,” has had Mr. Dylan on the brain. Through March 11, she is performing an all-Dylan cabaret set at Café Carlyle, which has lately hosted such eclectic talents as Debbie Harry and Isaac Mizrahi. The show is a reprise of her Carlyle debut last year, which also had a Dylan theme. The Carlyle had invited her to perform after she saw her friend Buster Poindexter play there. “It’s kind of like being an actor doing Shakespeare,” she said of her Dylan dive. “There’s a deep well.” Not that she’s the world’s biggest Dylan obsessive. Growing up in small-town Kentucky, she was turned off by his “more vicious songs” such as “Like a Rolling Stone,” she said. “It seemed like it was about some girl who had dumped him, and it was just unnecessarily nasty.” She was more into the Spinners and Led Zeppelin. Around 1983, when she was 20, she moved to New York for film school (she idolized François Truffaut and Bob Fosse) but dropped out when she ran out of tuition money.

Instead, one of the four, Jairo Saenz, a leader of the local clique of a transnational gang with Salvadoran roots, grinned, swiveled in his chair and hardly looked at the crying relatives from El Salvador in the back of the courtroom. Mr. Saenz, 19, was one of five people arrested Thursday morning in Suffolk County on Long Island as part of a federal sweep that targeted 13 adult members of the gang, MS-13. An additional three people were charged as juveniles, and their records were sealed. As of Thursday evening, 14 people were in custody, with two yet to be arrested. In a midday news conference at the federal courthouse here, Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, announced the indictments and the arrests made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Long Island gang task force. “For far too long on Long Island, MS-13 has been meting out its own version of the death penalty,” Mr. Capers said. In the back of the courtroom — on the opposite side from the gang members’ families — sat Evelyn Rodriguez, the mother of Kayla Cuevas, 16, who, along with Kayla’s friend Nisa Mickens, 15, the government said was killed by the men.

358,"ELLISVILLE, Mo. — They called it consciousness-raising. Nearly 50 years ago, Ruth Rosen and her friends sat in a Berkeley, Calif., living room and tried to imagine how their lives would have been different if they had been born as men. The stories spilled forth: a father who would not pay for college because girls didn’t need a degree; a nurse who told how the doctor treated her like a little girl; a woman who mused about an 11th Amendment to the Bill of Rights sparing women from cleaning toilets. “We’d go around the room,” Ms. Rosen recalled. “For a year, we discussed one injustice after the other. Then we began to see the commonality, wherever you were there was some difference because you were a woman. People began to realize, ‘I’ve never thought about it that way before.’ ” It’s a long way from that Berkeley living room to a bar in this conservative suburb of St. Louis, where a small band of women (and a handful of men) gathered to plot the way forward in the age of President Trump. But as women emerge among the most active standard-bearers of the resistance to this presidency, they are drawing on tactics honed in the 1960s-era consciousness raising groups that awakened women to their thwarted aspirations and power. One by one, the women in Ellisville recounted their own awakenings, how the election had jolted them out of mostly comfortable suburban lives. Many had tried keeping their opinions to themselves, outnumbered as they were in a red state and bound by the ethos of “Midwestern nice.” They spoke of their children and their fears about the future they would face. Some felt shame for failing to act earlier in causes like Black Lives Matter, with the city of Ferguson so close at hand. “I just can’t be complacent any more,” said Megan McCarthy, who organized the Ellisville meeting, one of the nearly 5,000 “huddles” convened last month that the organizers of the Women’s March on Washington hope can channel the protesters’ fervor into sustained political action. The latest effort will be “a day without a woman,” a general strike called for Wednesday. Many of the women who marched — and many who attended the Ellisville meeting — are new to activism; about a third told march organizers they had never attended a protest before. So as leaders try to translate this enthusiasm into tangible political change, they are updating consciousness-raising for a new age.

Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and now a senior adviser, also participated in the meeting at Trump Tower with Mr. Flynn and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. But among Mr. Trump’s inner circle, it is Mr. Flynn who appears to have been the main interlocutor with the Russian envoy — the two were in contact during the campaign and the transition, Mr. Kislyak and current and former American officials have said. But the extent and frequency of their contacts remains unclear, and the disclosure of the meeting at Trump Tower adds to the emerging picture of how the relationship between Mr. Trump’s incoming team and Moscow was evolving to include some of the president-elect’s most trusted advisers. The White House has repeatedly sought to play down any connections with Mr. Kislyak.

360,"Through June 18. Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. Global modernism is gradually finding a place in the permanent collection galleries of the Museum of Modern Art, notably with the recent installation of work by artists from Iran, Iraq and Sudan in response to President Trump’s executive order regarding immigrants. Yet certain international artists may lie too far outside the MoMA-approved notion of modernist style to be candidates for inclusion. Among them is a group of South Asian painters who created lyrical, smooth-lined paintings that merge European academicism with Indian content. Y. G. Srimati (1926-2007) was one of these artists, as seen in the beautiful and important small show, “An Artist of Her Time: Y. G. Srimati and the Indian Style,” at the Met. Born in Mysore and raised in Madras (now Chennai), Ms. Srimati studied several classical South Asian art forms, becoming an expert instrumentalist, vocalist, dancer and painter. Deeply involved in the Gandhi-led anti-colonialist movement, she repurposed the illustrational naturalism taught in British-founded art schools by filtering it through older indigenous styles like those found in the sixth-century Buddhist murals at Ajanta and in Rajput miniatures. All these ingredients merge in the handful of watercolors brought together, from the Met’s collection and loans, by John Guy, the museum’s curator for the arts of South and Southeast Asia. The earliest pictures are impressive formal accomplishments in a difficult medium. And in work spanning 40 years, Ms. Srimati’s choreographic take on naturalism makes everyday subjects — a woman dressing, a family riding to market — look heroic, and images of deities and saints look approachably human. In the end, she’s a devotional artist, in the religious or spiritual sense: Her 1947-48 painting of the Hindu goddess Saraswati was originally displayed on her family’s home altar. And this is yet another factor likely to keep her from mainstream modernist acceptance. Religious art is still something that MoMA, and other Western-centric modern museums, have no idea what to do with, though the time may come when they will. HOLLAND COTTER Through April 8.

But works by Kawara, Opalka and two-dozen other Conceptual relatives do make an enlightening if somewhat grandiose background to the perennially renewable photographs of August Sander. For Sander, formal repetition wasn’t an end in itself but a conveniently stable framework for the slippery individuality of his subjects. Thirty-six original prints from his encyclopedic typology “People of the 20th Century,” chosen by Sherrie Levine and thoughtfully arranged by Sander’s grandson Gerd, include a priest, a member of Parliament, circus performers, and a fatuously solemn Nazi storm trooper.

361,"The Israeli settlement movement is always in the news. It was central to the diplomatic dance surrounding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent visit with President Trump. Now the issues of Israeli sovereignty are revisited in two new films. Shimon Dotan’s documentary “The Settlers” gives the headlines a firm grounding in context. While any explanation of this fraught phenomenon feels like an oversimplification, Mr. Dotan sorts out the forces and personalities that shaped the movement, going back to the 1967 Six-Day War that provided the territorial gains that enabled some Israelis, with a range of ideologies, to stake out newly occupied lands. The film takes viewers into the living rooms (and, in one case, the yurt) of Jews who have moved onto Palestinian land. Packed with maps and facts, the documentary pointedly notes that the approximately 400,000 settlers stand in the way of peace by ensuring that the land will not revert to Palestinian control. Some of today’s settlements of spacious homes with swimming pools have tunnels that allow residents to zip to Israel proper. Keeping settlers safe, the film notes, is costly. Then there are the outpost dwellers, who strike out to build towns in as yet untouched occupied areas. Most settlers interviewed are united in their outspoken love of the land. Some talk about hating and hurting Palestinians. Mr. Dotan talks to Palestinians whose olive groves have been disturbed by settlers or who have seen their land gobbled up by the illegal construction of outposts by renegades. Their frustrated accounts illuminate some subtexts for the rock-throwing boys of the Palestinian uprisings. When the settlement movement began, David Ben-Gurion, one of the Zionist founding fathers and Israel’s first prime minister, was just leaving politics. “Ben-Gurion: Epilogue” is a refreshing and effectively edited documentary that has at its core a six-hour black-and-white interview conducted in 1968. Lost for decades, it was trimmed and shaped by the writer and director Yariv Mozer, and interleaved with news footage and other clips that contain everything from historic moments of oratory to charming shots of the elder statesman doing a headstand on the beach or sharing a piano bench with Ray Charles. Ben-Gurion’s message, in the sessions conducted five years before his death, is, at this point, largely a peaceful, nonexpansionist one that contrasts sharply with many of the Israeli voices in the settlement film. It conveys a satisfying, informative portrait of a well-read man who looks back at his life, good decisions and bad, with wisdom and intelligence.

363,"TO THE EDITOR: Re “The Immigration Debate We Need,” by George Borjas (Op-Ed, Feb. 27): I have seen this issue from both sides. I served as an Immigration and Naturalization Service prosecutor during the 1980s and have specialized in immigration law for the past 30 years. There are many ways that our legal immigration system could be improved. First, since legal immigration to the United States is approximately one-third of 1 percent of our population and the baby boom is long over, there is no need to reduce immigration. If anything, it should be increased. Second, most immigrants today are chosen by whether they have close family members in the United States. This system is good for families, but it does not necessarily serve the interests of our country. Let’s get rid of the brother-sister category. Let’s also press “delete” on the program that allows 50,000 people to immigrate to the United States annually based on a lottery! Third, let’s get rid of “per-country quotas” for talented immigrants, which makes it take way longer for highly educated people to immigrate to the United States from countries like India, China and the Philippines than for people from other countries. Let’s give the green cards that are now reserved for the visa lottery and the sibling category to highly skilled immigrants who are doctors, nurses, cancer researchers and entrepreneurs. That would be in our best interest. CARL SHUSTERMAN, LOS ANGELES TO THE EDITOR: George Borjas contributes to a thoughtful debate on immigration, but he ignores, it seems, some major trends. The historical link between rising productivity and increasing wages has been severed. That more than anything may be the cause of wage stagnation for less skilled, non-college-degreed workers. Immigration did not cause or exacerbate that trend. Restricting immigration will not fix it. Because of the baby boomers, the nonimmigrant work force is aging and shrinking. Immigration ameliorates that. Without robust immigration, there may not be enough wage earners in a decade or so to support retirement benefits for those who have retired. Despite the so-called “ethnic enclaves,” most second-generation immigrants and first-generation immigrants who arrived as children (the “Dreamers”) are fully assimilated, well educated and integrated into the economic life of the nation. That helps avoid the retirement crunch down the road and decline in economic activity that results from a shrinking work force. Immigration, even of undocumented immigrants, is not what ails the American economy, and constricting it may do more long-term harm than short-term good. Pointing to immigration as a significant economic harm diverts attention from the real source of economic distress for working Americans, which is income inequality. The causes and fixes for that have little if anything to do with immigration, legal or otherwise.

Now he wants to significantly cut the tax agency’s funding at a time when it has already been bleeding staff and struggling to keep up with a flood of returns ahead of Tax Day. The plans, revealed this week in documents associated with the White House budget outline, put Mr. Trump at odds with his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who has argued that the I.R.S. needs more money and a larger staff.

Ventry Jr., a member of the I.R.S. advisory council and a law professor at the University of California, Davis. “I don’t know how it’s going to sustain itself.” The White House budget office has proposed a 14.1 percent cut to the I.R.S. for the fiscal year that begins in October, reducing the agency’s budget to $9.65 billion; six years ago, it stood at $12.1 billion ($13.6 billion when adjusted for inflation). If approved, the cuts would happen when the number of audits is down and customer service complaints are up as a result of the drop in funding.

Some of the same dynamics found on the Democratic side have been present for Republicans: Only two candidates have officially begun active campaigns, with other potential rivals to Mr. de Blasio waiting in the wings amid the looming uncertainty of a federal investigation of the mayor’s fund-raising activities that has now appeared to enter its final stage. Republican Party officials have been vocal in their desire for the party to coalesce around a single candidate and prevent the sort of bruising and expensive primary battle that occurred in 2013 and left the victor, Joseph J. Lhota, severely hobbled in his race against Mr. de Blasio. “Everything I raised for the general, I ended up spending it in the primary,” said Mr. Lhota, adding that it left him effectively starting from scratch against Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who already enjoyed a lopsided voter registration advantage. In New York City, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans more than six to one. In recent weeks, the campaign of Paul J.

368,"The fight against President Trump’s executive orders to turn away refugees, deport undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the Mexican border is about to escalate in many American churches. A broad network of 37 Protestant and Orthodox Christian denominations will announce on Friday a campaign to mobilize its congregants — some 30 million Americans in all — to lobby the president and members of Congress to rescind the executive orders. In a declaration hammered out over the last month, church leaders call the orders “unjust and immoral” and say they run counter to “the values we as people of faith hold dear: to welcome the stranger and assist those most in need.” “It is imperative that we speak out against the notion that refugees are a threat to our safety,” the declaration adds. “They are not.” The president’s Jan. 27 executive order, which he called necessary for national security, barred people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the country for 90 days, stopped refugee admissions for 120 days and banned refugees from Syria indefinitely. The White House is expected to issue a revised order very soon. American Christians have been divided over Mr. Trump’s order, according to a poll released last month by the Pew Research Center. White evangelical Protestants supported the order by more than three to one, the poll showed, while white mainline Protestants supported it by a slim margin (50 to 47 percent), and three in five Catholics opposed it. The new campaign is being organized by the Orthodox and mainline Protestant churches affiliated with the National Council of Churches and Church World Service, a charity that resettles refugees. It calls on congregants and pastors to appeal to their elected officials, sign poster-size copies of the declaration displayed in their houses of worship, dedicate one Sunday in the next three months to honor refugees and immigrants, and raise $1 million to support them. Hundreds of churches and synagogues across the country have already offered to provide sanctuary or other support to undocumented immigrants in fear of deportation. And other faith-based resettlement agencies have spoken out against the refugee and travel ban, including World Relief, an evangelical agency; HIAS, a Jewish group; and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The president’s executive order gave preference to refugees who are Christians and other religious minorities, but the declaration opposes that move, saying it “actually places them at greater risk in some countries.” “This is so counterproductive,” said Erol Kekic, executive director of the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service. “It makes Christians and minorities in those countries an even bigger target, because the perception is already that they receive preferential treatment. And singling them out even more would probably not help.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/churches-welcome-refugees-trump.html?searchResultPosition=14

Earlier this week, he was in Washington, and over last weekend, Atlanta. That makes five cities in eight days, as Politico pointed out. A little bit of his traveling is typical mayoral business — the United States Conference of Mayors met in Washington on Wednesday, for instance — but a lot of it is rattling the cup for his re-election campaign, with fund-raisers scheduled in California, Florida and Illinois. On the one hand, it might seem strange for a New York City politician to be asking people across the country for money, particularly because he is facing no major opposition and has raised nearly more money than his nine opponents combined. After all, the Democratic Party is in tatters at every level; wouldn’t a well-heeled Democrat be better off spending money on uncelebrated legislative races in Idaho or Iowa or Ohio? Still, it is hard to imagine that an ambitious Democrat like Mr. de Blasio could resist the chance to jump into the bull market for political and liberal fund-raising set off by the election of President Trump. Moreover, while Mr. de Blasio may not have won the hearts and minds of New Yorkers, he can plausibly tell a story across the country of some liberal successes — universal prekindergarten — and the continued decline in serious crime at the same time that his administration finished dismantling the widely loathed stop-and-frisk program.

370,"Maggi Hambling is an artist who has long been preoccupied by death — but her South London studio couldn’t feel more alive. The lobby, for starters, is painted an exuberant shade of ocher — and filled with small clusters of paintings, sketches and a large Rococo-style papier-mâché mirror. A wooden chair, carved in the shape of an elephant, guards the open-plan kitchen and living quarters — which are also home to toy parrots, Mexican masks, cowhide rugs and a contorted Euphorbia plant called Esmeralda. The two-story duplex is spirited, engaging and fiercely unusual — much like its owner. “So, you’ve spotted I’m not a minimalist,” roars Hambling, expelling a puff of smoke from a Marlborough Menthol cigarette. “I still occasionally think of throwing everything out, but can’t quite get around to doing it.” This is the first time the Suffolk-born painter and sculptor, 71, has opened the doors to her Clapham Old Town abode, which she purchased at the start of 1984 in search of “more space and light.” Even back then, the area was gentrified and filled with well-to-do individuals who surfed the nearby high street for ceramic knickknacks and artisanal bread on the weekends. “I always preferred to say I lived in Battersea because it had far more street cred,” Hambling confesses with a wry smile. “But in the end I just had to accept it.” Hambling shares the Victorian property with Tory Lawrence, her partner of 33 years, who is also an artist. Recently, it has become something of a city bolt-hole for the pair, who now spend most of the week at their 17th-century house in Saxmunham, a rural town in East Suffolk. “In London, everything seems to be concertinaed into one short bit of time,” Hambling says. “In Suffolk you get the sense of a whole day. Also, the light is better.” Invariably, the county’s bucolic landscape and dramatic coastlines have inspired much of her six-decade-strong oeuvre — from her large public sculpture “Scallop,” which was erected on Aldeburgh beach in 2003 as a tribute to the iconic composer Benjamin Britten, to her distinctive oil-on-canvas depictions of breaking waves and perturbed seas. Evocative portraits are perhaps her most popular — and controversial — works. She drew her former lover, Henrietta Moraes — a captivating beauty and notorious alcoholic, known as the Queen of Soho — shortly after her passing, once in the hospital morgue and then again in her coffin. Her dear friend George Melly was also the subject of a series of works that documented the British jazz singer on the precipice of death and after it. She speaks of these pieces in a lower, more serious register. “My art is a response to what happens in life. George Melly said I would go down in history as Maggi ‘coffin’ Hambling because of my habit of drawing dead people,” she says. “The truth is, I’ve found it rather therapeutic to go on painting them after death. It’s like grieving in a positive way, rather than just being negative.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/t-magazine/art/maggi-hambling-artist-home.html?searchResultPosition=38

Unidentified men carrying clubs attack a group of men who seem to have commandeered the freight train, and a fight ensues with sticks, hurled stones and a buzzing chain saw. The defenders of the train are getting the worst of it until an armed man arrives on the scene and fires a warning shot into the air, scattering the attackers. Tensions are rising along the border between Ukraine and the breakaway “republics” in the eastern part of the country as Ukrainian nationalists from the western part seek to choke off all railroad traffic in what they are calling a blockade. The war in eastern Ukraine, now entering its third year, has been the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. Despite the continuing clashes, however, the lucrative cross-border coal trade has been peculiarly unaffected. The blockaders, as they call themselves, are a relatively new movement but are already becoming relevant to the delicate politics of peace in Ukraine, seemingly a focus of the Trump administration as it seeks to establish warmer ties with Russia. Their primary goal is to cut off the trains carrying coal from the east that powers industry in the west but also is a major source of income for the Russian-backed eastern republics. The idea, which has animated Ukrainian nationalist circles, is to force the financing of the breakaway regions and their three million or so inhabitants onto Russia’s already weak economy by breaking ties with Ukraine’s industrial base.

372,"PANTIN, France — At least since Benjamin Franklin arrived here in 1776, Paris has represented for Americans a cherished ideal, a place where the pleasures of food, wine, sex, art, thought and conversation can be pursued as they cannot in the United States. A host of American writers, from Henry James and Edith Wharton, to Henry Miller and Ernest Hemingway, bloomed in Paris. African-American writers Richard Wright and James Baldwin felt far freer of the weight of racism in Paris than they did at home. President Trump’s disparaging remark last Friday, that Paris was not what it used to be, would be something of a jolt to many American expatriates, who are more concerned about what was happening back home than in their beloved adopted city. Mr. Trump was speaking at a conservative conference when he referred to “Jim,” who he said was a “a very, very substantial guy” who stopped visiting Paris four or five years ago because “Paris was no longer Paris.” He let the audience imagine why with the story’s punch line: “We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.” Among those who have learned what Trump means by stopping terrorists was the distinguished French historian Henry Rousso. Hardly a “radical Islamic terrorist” — in fact, he’s a Jew born in Egypt — Mr. Rousso said that he was detained for more than 10 hours and threatened with deportation by American border agents when he arrived at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport last Wednesday to attend a conference at Texas A&M University. Mr. Rousso — who has visited the United States without incident for 30 years, and who has been invited to such institutions as Harvard University, Dartmouth College and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum — was cleared to enter the United States only after the university enlisted legal assistance. “What I know, loving this country for a long time,” Mr. Rousso wrote on Sunday, in the French edition of The Huffington Post, “is that the United States is no longer quite the United States.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/theyll-always-have-paris-despite-what-trump-says.html?searchResultPosition=37
373,"In his address to Congress Tuesday evening, President Trump leaned on some of his standard crowd pleasers: immigration, jobs, terrorism. But he also revived one of his more surprising proposals, first introduced on the campaign trail last year: “My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable,” he said. That rhetoric makes Mr. Trump sound more like Hillary Clinton than Ronald Reagan. And a potential debate over child-care policy could offer the rare opportunity for the president and Democrats to cooperate — or at least have a dialogue — over the coming year. Mr. Trump is not the first Republican president to demonstrate an interest in child-care policy. During his 1968 campaign, Richard Nixon promised to expand access to government-funded day care. But three years later, influenced by the rise of the Christian right, Mr. Nixon vetoed the only universal child-care bill to pass Congress. Although a few of today’s mainstream Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, have promoted child-care proposals, the official G.O.P. platform does not mention the issue. Conservatives tend to view government-funded child care as an expensive and unwanted intrusion into family life. The position of House Speaker Paul Ryan — whose support Mr. Trump would presumably need to enact a child-care plan — is a case in point. In his 2014 report on poverty, Mr. Ryan fretted over the results of research on Quebec’s public child-care program, which is known for its lax educational standards. Such subsidized care “encourages married women to enter the labor force,” the Ryan report said, leading to “a number of negative behavioral and health outcomes for the children.” (What Mr. Ryan didn’t mention: a competing body of research showing that high-quality day care helps children thrive academically.) Arguments about the wisdom of working motherhood tend to ignore the fact that working motherhood is the norm. More than half of American mothers work in the year after giving birth, as do 64 percent of women with children under the age of 6, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Working parents require child care, and the typical American family spends 29 percent of its after-tax income on child-care costs, compared with 10 percent or less in many other Western democracies, where child care is provided for or heavily subsidized by the state. Average annual tuition at an American day care center is nearly $10,000, and as much as $30,000 for a high-quality program in cities like New York and Los Angeles.

374,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions, facing a storm of criticism over newly disclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, recused himself on Thursday from any investigation into charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. His announcement, delivered at a terse news conference, came after a day of rapid-fire developments in a murky affair that has shadowed President Trump, jeopardized his closest aides and intensified pressure for a full inquiry into Moscow’s attempts to influence the election as well as the policies of the new administration. Many top Democrats demanded Mr. Sessions’s resignation, and a growing number of Republicans declared that he should not take part in any investigation into the case, given his own still largely unexplained role in it. But Mr. Trump stoutly defended Mr. Sessions, one of his few early champions on Capitol Hill. “He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional,” he said in a statement, which accused Democrats of engaging in “a total witch hunt.” Mr. Sessions insisted there was nothing nefarious about his two meetings with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, even though he did not disclose them to the Senate during his confirmation hearing and they occurred during the heat of the race between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Sessions was advising on national security.

Alas, President Trump took him literally, but not seriously. The administration plans a $54 billion increase in military spending, financed in part by a 37 percent cut in the budgets of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. That reflects a misunderstanding about the world — that security is assured only when we’re blowing things up. It’s sometimes true that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, as Chairman Mao said, but it also emerges from diplomacy, foreign aid and carefully cultivated good will. Military power is especially limited when threats come from new directions.

As the flight attendant read the choices aloud, a young man across the aisle said, “I don’t watch chick flicks!” I knew what he meant, and so did the woman sitting next to me. A “chick flick” is one that has more dialogue than car chases, more relationships than special effects, and whose suspense comes more from how people live than from how they get killed. I wasn’t challenging his preference, but I did question the logic of his term. After all, much of what we read as great literature in school may well have been called “chick lit,” especially if it had been written by women. Think about it: If “Anna Karenina"" had been by Leah Tolstoy, or “The Scarlet Letter” by Nancy Hawthorne or “A Doll’s House” by Henrietta Ibsen — if “The Invisible Man” had been “The Invisible Woman” — would they have been hailed as classics? Suppose Shakespeare had really been the Dark Lady who some people still think he/she was. I bet most of her plays and all of her sonnets would have been dismissed as ye olde Elizabethan chick lit and buried until they were resurrected by stubborn feminist scholars of today. Indeed, as long as men are taken seriously when they write about the female half of the world — and women are not taken seriously when writing about ourselves, much less about men and public affairs — the list of Great Authors will be more about power than talent, more about opinion than experience. Still, this was not the problem of the guy on the plane. He was just trying to find a movie he wanted to watch. His “chick flick” label might help him avoid certain movies, but shouldn’t he have a label to guide him toward movies he actually liked?

378,"WASHINGTON — Whatever confusion people might have about President Trump’s agenda, his position on trade and manufacturing is crystal clear. “I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade,” he said in his address to Congress Tuesday night. He called for corporate tax reform and export incentives, and he lashed out at Nafta and China for draining America’s manufacturing base. Mr. Trump’s stance on trade is one of his most popular positions, but many economists and policy makers are skeptical: They say that rapid automation will negate any gains made in bringing manufacturing jobs back, while the tariffs and other policies he has suggested using will ignite disastrous trade wars. The doubters are wrong on both points. American manufacturing’s most advanced sectors remain big employers, and much of their payroll shrinkage stems from predatory competition from high- and low-wage countries, as well as offshoring by American multinationals. And the trade-war alarmists overlook the matchless, yet overwhelmingly neglected, leverage America holds over the global economy. Although cheap, labor-intensive goods often come to mind when Americans think of job-displacing imports, the more capital- and technology-intensive segments of manufacturing have hardly been immune. Sectors like motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, nonelectrical machinery (like machine tools, farm machinery and power-generating turbines) and industrial chemicals add up to nearly half of manufacturing’s enormous, chronic annual trade deficits nowadays. Such sectors still employ millions of Americans. For example, more than 947,900 jobs are currently found in automotive production (including 145,700 in the highest-value segments, like engines and powertrains and their parts), nearly 360,000 in semiconductor and related manufacturing, more than one million in machinery and more than 200,000 in pharmaceuticals. And a recent Commerce Department report indicates that in 2014 their trade shortfalls alone — leaving aside any impact from labor-saving technologies — cost more than 200,000 jobs, both in the industries themselves and throughout their American supply and logistics chains.

380,"Sweden has accepted more refugees on a per-capita basis than other Western nations in recent years. President Trump and his supporters say that this has led to increased crime and other problems in that country and argue that this is a reason the United States should accept fewer immigrants, especially those coming from the Middle East. Official data show that Sweden has not seen a spike in crime, though the influx has heightened anti-immigrant sentiment there. To better understand that country’s experience, I spoke to Henrik Emilsson, an international immigration researcher at Malmö University. The interview has been edited and condensed. What has been happening in Sweden in recent years with regard to immigration? Sweden has always had more humanitarian migrants than the rest of Europe. For the last 10 years it has been seven or eight times the average in Europe. Since 2006, it has been a very high number of asylum seekers — first the Iraqis, then Somalis and Afghanis, and now, the latest wave from Syria. Is there any evidence that recent immigrants are having an impact on crime in Sweden? Not the recent ones. There is a huge debate in Sweden about immigration and crime. And we know from earlier statistics that the foreign-born commit three times as many crimes on average as native-borns. But these riots and crimes in the suburbs, they are related mostly to drugs and gangs. Those people are born and raised in Sweden. It has nothing to do with the recent immigration. It’s the children of migrants and maybe people that came when they were young. There has been this issue of sexual harassment. And there is some evidence that the new refugees are somewhat involved in this. But there are no official statistics on it. What about terrorism? Not particularly, because the people for example who have gone and fought for ISIS, they are also quite established — they are Swedes that have grown up here. Why would people who have been in Sweden for a while, or their children, become radicalized? Does it have anything to do with the circumstances in which they grew up?

They have disrupted and destroyed institutional constraints on what can be said, when and where it can be said and who can say it. Even though in one sense President Trump’s victory in 2016 fulfilled conventional expectations — because it prevented a third straight Democratic term in the White House — it also revealed that the internet and its offspring have overridden the traditional American political system of alternating left-right advantage. They are contributing — perhaps irreversibly — to the decay of traditional moral and ethical constraints in American politics.

Mr. Xi, 63, who has shaken up many political norms, does not want to be shackled by an informal rule created by his predecessors, people close to senior officials have said.

Doug Burgum signed into law four bills aimed at making it easier to control such protests. With a few strokes of a pen, he placed the state in the vanguard of an emerging backlash by conservative forces against political and social advocates who see demonstrations — however unruly — as free speech protected by the Constitution. In a season rife with demonstrations over immigration, pipelines, abortion, women’s rights and more, Republican legislators in at least 16 states have filed bills intended to make protests more orderly or to toughen penalties against ones that go awry. Republicans in two other states, Massachusetts and North Carolina, have said they will file protest-related bills. Those numbers include only bills whose sponsors have specifically linked them to protests, said Jonathan Griffin, a policy analyst who tracks the measures at the National Conference of State Legislatures. How many will be enacted is unclear; a few already have been pronounced dead in committee. Some sociologists and legal experts say the bills are in line with a general trend toward tougher treatment of protesters after especially disruptive demonstrations like the Occupy Wall Street movement in Manhattan and the 2014 violence in Ferguson, Mo. But interviews and news reports suggest that some of the measures are either backed by supporters of President Trump or are responses to demonstrations against him and his policies.

Alec Baldwin made a confession on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Wednesday. Or was it a humble brag? The first time the producers at “Saturday Night Live” asked him to impersonate Donald J. Trump, he said, he was completely unprepared. After more than a year, Mr. Baldwin thinks he has gotten deeper into the president’s head. Conan O’Brien went to Mexico on Wednesday (actually, he aired an episode that he taped there last month). Inevitably, talk turned to Mr. Trump rather quickly. Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president, made an appearance, and he had some unprintable words for Mr. Trump — emblazoned on a pair of cowboy boots. The late-show hosts took their shots at Mr. Trump’s speech Tuesday to a joint session of Congress. Most argued that despite the news media’s focus on its relatively measured tone, the speech did not depart from most of Mr. Trump’s controversial stances on the issues. “You could tell it was divisive,” Seth Meyers said, “not just from the policies, but the faces on Democrats.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/arts/television/alec-baldwin-trump-character-jimmy-kimmel.html?searchResultPosition=56
385,"This article has been updated to reflect news developments. In the wake of Wednesday’s revelation that Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with Russia’s ambassador to the United States while working with the Trump campaign, despite denying those contacts during his confirmation hearings, Mr. Sessions recused himself from overseeing any Justice Department investigation into contacts between the campaign and the Russian government. Some members of Congress are saying that’s not enough; they want him to resign. It’s a bombshell of a story. And it’s one with a clear and disturbing precedent. In 1972 Richard G. Kleindienst, the acting attorney general, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing on his nomination by President Richard Nixon to be attorney general. He was to replace Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who had resigned to run Nixon’s re-election campaign (and who would later be sent to prison in the Watergate scandal). Several Democratic senators were concerned about rumors of White House interference in a Justice Department antitrust suit against International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, a campaign contributor to the Republican National Committee. They asked Kleindienst several times if he had ever spoken with anyone at the White House about the I.T.T. case. He said he had not. That wasn’t true. Later, after Kleindienst was confirmed as attorney general, the special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, and his team uncovered an Oval Office tape recording of a phone call in which Nixon told Kleindiesnt to drop the I.T.T. case. Kleindienst claimed that he thought the senators’ questions were limited to a particular period, not the entire time during which the case was pending. Jaworski didn’t buy it. He filed criminal charges against Kleindienst, who had earlier resigned as attorney general. Eventually Kleindienst pleaded guilty to failure to provide accurate information to Congress, a misdemeanor, for conduct that many observers believed amounted to perjury. He was also reprimanded by the Arizona State Bar. Last month, during Mr. Sessions’s confirmation hearing for attorney general, Senator Al Franken, Democrat from Minnesota, asked Mr. Sessions what he would do if he learned of evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign.

In the Obama administration’s last days, officials raced to preserve intelligence about Russian efforts to interfere in the American presidential election — and about possible contacts between associates of Donald J. Trump and Russians — fearing that it could be covered up or destroyed after power changed hands. And new questions are being raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is said to have met with the Russian ambassador twice in the past year. That would appear to contradict testimony he gave to Congress during his confirmation hearings. Democrats demanded late Wednesday that the attorney general recuse himself from an inquiry into contacts between the Trump team and Russia. Mr. Sessions denied having met with “any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.” • G.O.P. unity on health care is elusive. Republican lawmakers remain divided over plans to replace the Affordable Care Act, including how the federal government would help people buy health insurance.

387,"The author, most recently, of “This Long Pursuit” has strong memories and deep feelings of discovering “On the Road” in 1960, “the book that made me fall in love with America aged 15.” What books are currently on your night stand? In my case it’s less of a night stand, and more of a night fall. Books tend to lie on the floor all round my side of the bed, frequently under it, and sometimes even in it (leading to mild complaints or occasional kidnappings). I like to have several on the go at once, according to mood. Currently it’s Andrea Wulf’s superb popular science biography “The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt’s New World,” which ranges across Europe and South America and the beginnings of environmentalism in the 19th century. Then, at a time when “fake news” is much under debate, the compelling memoirs by the veteran BBC foreign correspondent John Simpson, “We Chose to Speak of War and Strife,” which includes a history of this heroic, truth-telling eyewitness form, starting with the Battle of Waterloo. To balance all that local drama, I am studying the big picture as thrillingly projected in “Mapping the Heavens,” a strikingly lucid account of the expansion, not just of the universe, but the way we have tried to understand it, from the Babylonians to black holes and dark matter, all coolly narrated by the glamorous professor of astronomy at Yale, Priyamvada Natarajan. And finally, buried deep somewhere or other, my battered, priceless O.U.P. paperback of “Coleridge’s Notebooks: A Selection.” What’s the best classic novel you recently read for the first time? For a month last summer I sat on a garden bench under a cherry tree in France, and very slowly read Leo Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina.” All I can say is that it was an utterly transporting experience. I fell in love with Anna, and she joined my private pantheon of tragic 19th-century heroines: Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, Theodor Fontane’s Effi Briest and Henry James’s Isabel Archer (in “The Portrait of a Lady”). As a biographer, these books simply remind me of the matchless power of great fiction to create a permanent world and a unique life, that nonfiction can never really quite reach (though Elizabeth Gaskell’s biography of Charlotte Brontë comes close). It’s a humbling, but also uplifting, experience. I can still taste the cherries. What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of? “On the Road,” by Jack Kerouac. Yes, I know, I know. But very few readers nowadays can have heard of it as I did, in 1960, the book that made me fall in love with America aged 15. What makes for a good biography? Call it the imaginative handshake. The power to transport the reader to another time, another place, and another identity with absolute conviction; and then make them come away with the sensation “I really met that person — and I know how they felt about the world — and it was worth it.” The first writer to show me how this could be done was Michael Holroyd, with his “Lytton Strachey” (1968) set in England mostly before and after the First World War, and recreating the whole lost world and sensibility of Bloomsbury. For me it has been done many times since, and in many different ways: by the big epic of Robert Caro’s Lyndon Johnson; or the vivid celebration of Hilary Spurling’s Matisse; or the exquisite intellectual portrait of Hermione Lee’s Virginia Woolf; or the weird street encounter of Alexander Masters’s “Stuart: A Life Backwards”; or the airborne glamour of Stacy Schiff’s “Saint-Exupéry: A Biography”; or the zingy, sexy bohemian portrait of Edmund Gordon’s “The Invention of Angela Carter”; or the haunted journey into the labyrinthine inner world of an English opium eater recounted by Frances Wilson in “Guilty Thing: A Life of Thomas De Quincey.” The possibilities of good biography are so rich!

389,"LONDON — An exuberant Gustav Klimt garden scene sold at Sotheby’s on Wednesday night for about $59 million with fees, the third-highest price for any artwork sold at auction in Europe. Selling for 48 million pounds after a valuation of at least £35 million, the painting was fought over by four telephone bidders, reflecting newly energized demand for works by the great names of 20th-century art. “This was a momentous night for the art market,” the auctioneer, Helena Newman, chairwoman of Sotheby’s Europe, said after her evening sale of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art, which brought a total of £194.8 million. It was the highest total for any auction staged in London, not accounting for inflation. This result, together with other strong prices achieved at the Impressionist and modern sale at Christie’s the previous evening, seemed to signal a strengthening of the international art market. High-end auctions of contemporary art will be tested in London next week. At least for the moment, “there’s a general sense of investor confidence” said James Roundell, a director at Dickinson, the London dealers. “Maybe it’s the Trump effect.” Before the auction, Sotheby’s bought Klimt’s flowery painting, “Bauerngarten (Blumengarten),” from its owner, David Graham, a Canadian collector who lives in London.

391,"MOSCOW — When Bill O’Reilly interviewed President Trump last month and called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a killer, Mr. Trump did not object. He just responded that there are plenty of killers in America, too. At this point, we can only speculate about the true nature of relations between the American and Russian presidents. No matter what, Mr. Trump came up with the perfect answer — the one most likely to appeal to Mr. Putin. (The Kremlin demanded an apology only from Mr. O’Reilly; if Mr. Trump had said that Mr. Putin was not a killer, the Kremlin might have requested an apology from the White House, too.) In Russia during the Putin era, a remarkable phenomenon has emerged: Accusations have become decoupled from crimes. In an ordinary society, if a man is called a killer, he will either deny it or admit his guilt. Twenty-first-century Russia has chosen a third path: to take pride in one’s crimes while at the same time claiming to have no involvement in them. It’s a tactic of intelligence agents and spies, people who work in the shadows. In 2005, Vladimir Kvachkov, a retired colonel in the military intelligence who had become an outspoken nationalist, was arrested in the attempted murder of Anatoly B. Chubais, who at the time headed the Russian electricity monopoly and who in the 1990s had been a leading reformer in the government. Attackers tried to blow up Mr. Chubais’s car and sprayed it with automatic weapons. While many raised questions about the prosecution, evidence pointed at Mr. Kvachkov: A car used by the would-be assassins reportedly belonged to Mr. Kvachkov’s wife. A jury, though, acquitted him, citing insufficient evidence. (Mr. Kvachkov was later sent to prison on very separate charges: He was accused of being part of a right-wing coup plot.) It wasn’t Mr. Kvachkov’s acquittal that was remarkable about the case. It was his line of defense. On one hand, he denied a role in the crime; on the other, he argued that Mr. Chubais was an enemy of the Russian people and deserved to be killed. It’s unclear which argument proved more persuasive to the jury, but probably the second. Popular opinion in Russia holds Mr. Chubais responsible for the poverty that set in as a result of the neoliberal economic reforms, and at various times both the left and the nationalist opposition have condemned him. Mr. Kvachkov’s right-wing nationalist supporters deployed two mutually contradictory arguments: “He did not shoot; he’s not guilty” and “if he had shot, he would have been right to do so.” If the first argument saved the man from a prison term for attempted murder, the second made him one of the leaders of the radical nationalist movement.

392,"BUCHAREST, Romania — A month ago, images of hundreds of thousands of Romanians protesting in front of the government building in Bucharest and in other Romanian cities started to spread around the world. It may have seemed just another popular turn toward right-wing demagogy in a time of receding faith in democracy. But that is not the case. This protest movement is, in fact, a signal to the world that in this corner of Europe, democracy and its ideals are alive and well — that the civic fabric destroyed during decades of Communist oppression has healed, and the people want to perfect their democracy, not to weaken it. The protests are aimed at an emergency ordinance from the government that would have reversed a national campaign against corruption, in which Romania has achieved significant but incomplete victories in recent years. Graft and nepotism still exist, and are blamed for high levels of poverty, polarization, social and economic injustice; those, in turn, have sent millions of young Romanians fleeing to other parts of the European Union, the United States or Canada. Still, enough young Romanians remained to take over the streets in freezing cold, and ultimately they forced the government to abandon the infamous ordinance. These are not the first spontaneous protests here in the name of popular power. Those began three years ago with the end of the discredited presidency of Traian Basescu. They continued in opposition to attempts by foreign corporations to extract gold from Roman-era historic sites in the mountains of Transylvania. And they resumed against the government of the prime minister at the time, Victor Ponta, after a terrible fire in a Bucharest nightclub. What Romania has been experiencing is an anti-elite political outpouring with a fury that resembles what we see in Europe and America, but whose origins and goals are 180 degrees opposite. These Romanian “indignados,” as the protesters are called, are not the blue-collar, rural, anti-globalization disgruntled who voted for Brexit or helped Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House. They are mainly young, urban, college-educated people with well-paid jobs at multinational corporations and banks, the main employers of local talent. So they are not protesting against globalization or the European Union. The solution they seek would be more globalization, a more solid Europe, more American and NATO involvement in our region. They are instinctively against any walls — physical or invisible — that may be erected in a vain effort to stop the free movement of people, ideas, capital or technology. Here, the tide of angry opinion rushes not toward fear of outsiders and tolerance for kleptocratic strongmen. It seeks instead to continue cleansing a political establishment still tied at many points to economic barons who divert public funding from desperately needed investments in health care, education and infrastructure. Such graft and cronyism are the very essence of their grievances. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/opinion/in-romania-faith-in-globalization-survives.html?searchResultPosition=48
393,"WASHINGTON — The White House is considering giving the Pentagon more independent authority to conduct counterterrorism raids as part of an effort to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State and other militant organizations, administration officials said on Thursday. Such a step would allow military commanders to move more swiftly against terrorism suspects, streamlining a decision-making process that often dragged on under the Obama administration, frustrating Pentagon officials. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, called the proposal “a philosophy more than a change in policy.” He said that “the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off,” but added that Mr. Trump believed “these are the experts in the field.” Critics say that giving the military more authority could lead to more problematic outcomes like the Special Operations raid in January in Yemen, which left a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 dead, as well as about two dozen civilians. It could also leave the Pentagon to take the blame when things go wrong. But one Defense Department official pointed to comments by President Trump about the Yemen raid as a sign that military commanders would be held responsible for botched operations whether the president signed off on them or not.

It’s the summer of 2016, and President Obama is delivering a surprise address from the stately East Room, the same place where he announced the death of Osama bin Laden, among other events. “I’m speaking to you tonight to inform you that the United States is under attack,” the president says. “The Russian government at the highest levels is trying to influence our most precious asset, our democracy.” Russia had hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee, and was releasing the contents of its cyber-theft, in an attempt to influence the election, Obama explained. He was careful to present the behavior of the Trump campaign itself in the best light and to say that it deserved every benefit of the doubt. But the president wanted the American people to sit up and take notice of the attack. He wanted them to understand why the drip-drip-drip of WikiLeaks was happening. He wanted to call out the media for breathlessly reporting on WikiLeaks as if it were the product of great investigative reporting, rather than theft by a hostile foreign country. He wanted to put Russia on very public notice. None of this happened, of course. It’s a piece of alternate history, dreamed up by a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and described briefly in an excellent New Yorker article this week. The article tells the story of Russia’s campaign against the United States —under the all-star triple byline of Evan Osnos, David Remnick and Joshua Yaffa — and I recommend you set aside the time to read it. Lamenting the Obama administration’s low-key passive response to Russia’s attack obviously depends on 20/20 hindsight. Obama had reason to play it safe: As a Democratic president, he was rightly worried about politicizing national security and using his power to hurt the Republican nominee. But it seems likely that the administration would have nonetheless chosen a different route if it had realized that Donald Trump was a serious threat to win the election. There is also one lesson that remains very relevant today: The country is still not taking Russia’s actions nearly seriously enough. As Tom Friedman has written, Nov. 8, 2016, deserves to join Sept. 11, 2001, and Dec. 7, 1941, as infamous dates of attacks on America. We still need to learn the full story, through investigations by the F.B.I., Congress, the Trump administration and, especially now, an independent prosecutor.

Shares of Snap, the parent of Snapchat, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, and the company and its bankers will be hoping for a strong start. Will it dash to glory when the broader investment world gets its chance to buy up shares, like Alibaba? Or will it stumble out of the gate, like Facebook? Big investors have already weighed in. On Wednesday, Snap priced at $17 a share — a dollar more than the top of its expected range. The lofty valuation of nearly $24 billion suggests that investors see opportunity in Snapchat’s millennial user base. But that healthy pricing may also be the result of a successful strategy by its bankers, the Deal Professor writes. The bankers underestimated the price range, the argument goes, which built upward momentum. They also limited the number of shares available. There are still warnings signs flashing over the company: It lost more than $500 million last year. Its user growth appears to have slowed. And investors who buy the shares won’t get voting rights. On that last point, a Securities and Exchange Commission advisory committee will look at how much Snap will have to disclose to investors, according to Reuters. As Snap priced its offering, the stock market surged to another high, helped by expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. The optimism on Wall Street has also been helped by sunnier economic data. But there are some things to keep in mind about the rally and the so-called Trump bump, Neil Irwin notes.

397,"MANILA — Human Rights Watch said on Thursday that President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines may have committed crimes against humanity by inciting killings during his bloody antidrug campaign. Thousands of people have been killed by the police or by vigilantes since Mr. Duterte became president in June, and rights groups say the police may have ordered the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and users, a charge that officials have denied. In a report released on Thursday, Human Rights Watch examined 32 deaths from October to January, all involving the Philippine National Police. Police reports asserted that officers had committed the killings in self-defense, but witnesses characterized them as “coldblooded murders of unarmed drug suspects in custody,” the rights group’s study said. “We think there’s a very strong case to be made in front of the I.C.C. that crimes against humanity have been committed,” Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said by telephone, referring to the International Criminal Court. She said the first step should be parallel investigations into Mr. Duterte’s antidrug campaign by the United Nations and by the Philippine Justice Department. In a statement on Thursday, Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for Mr. Duterte, said the report’s allegations were baseless. “A war on criminality is not a war on humanity,” he said. “On the contrary, it is a war precisely to protect humanity from a modern-day evil. To say otherwise is to undermine society’s legitimate desire to be free from fear and to pander to the interests of the criminals.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-human-rights-watch-philippines.html?searchResultPosition=44

399,"WASHINGTON — Ben Carson, an acclaimed neurosurgeon-turned-politician, can now add a new title to his résumé: secretary of housing and urban development. The Senate voted 58-41 Thursday morning to confirm Mr. Carson after a rare show of bipartisanship. Unlike many other cabinet members chosen by President Trump, Mr. Carson, who has no experience running a large federal bureaucracy, did not face much pushback from Democrats during his confirmation process. The Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs unanimously voted his nomination out of committee in January, though several Democrats did question him about his belief that government assistance programs often lead to dependency. Mr. Carson will now head an agency with a $47 billion budget and a charge to assist millions of low-income renters, fight urban blight and help struggling homeowners stave off foreclosures. Mr. Carson, whose mother at times received food stamps to provide for her family, grew up surrounded by some of the housing assistance programs he will now oversee. Yet, rather than embrace the programs that once sustained his family and the families around him, he has adopted standard Republican beliefs that too much government help — both in desegregating neighborhoods and in lifting people from poverty — can discourage people from working hard. Mr. Carson was awarded a scholarship to Yale University, and at 33, he was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. He later became an author and a philanthropist supporting scholarships for young, often impoverished students. After his medical career, Mr. Carson turned to politics and competed with Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Carson’s views worry many of his critics, who believe the federal government should be doing more, not less, for the nation’s cities, where glittering downtowns and increasingly gentrified neighborhoods are often surrounded by areas of poverty and violence, with predominantly minorities. It is unclear how much Mr. Carson will seek to change housing policy. During his confirmation hearing, he would not commit definitively to avoid directing tax dollars to Trump businesses. He did agree to work with Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, to construct a system to identify properties tied both to the Trump family and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Carson also committed to telling senators about the department’s dealings with any businesses owned by Mr. Trump or his relatives.

400,"After the 1976 election, the Democratic Party seemed to enjoy a commanding position in American politics, with Jimmy Carter ensconced in the White House, a Senate supermajority and an advantage of nearly 150 seats in the House of Representatives. Yet over the next four years the Democrats achieved little of consequence, Carter passed into history as a failure, and Ronald Reagan ushered in a lasting rightward realignment. I have compared Donald Trump to Carter before, but with the release of the House Republican “replacement” (I use that term loosely) for Obamacare, it’s worth returning to the analogy. It rests, in part, on the work of the political scientist Stephen Skowronek, who argues that certain presidencies are “disjunctive” — straddling a political order passing into history and another one struggling to be born. And “disjunctive” generally means ineffective, because the parties such presidents are leading are likewise trapped between past and future and unable to unify and act. Carter is Skowronek’s prime disjunctive example, and a variety of writers, including Corey Robin and Dylan Matthews on the left and Reihan Salam on the right, have recently argued that Trump fits the role as well. Just as Carter sensed that the New Deal-Great Society coalition was no longer viable and campaigned against certain liberal orthodoxies in ’76, so in 2016 Trump offered a vision of the G.O.P. as a nationalist “workers party” in which certain Reaganite pieties would no longer set the terms of conservative debate. But just as Carter’s mix of proto-New Democrat centrism and old-school liberalism never translated into a workable congressional agenda, Trump’s bridge to a new conservatism will crumble if his party can’t agree on policies that fit his vision. The health care debate makes this danger particularly clear. In the long Reagan era, the Republican Party was, in effect, the party of the health care status quo — bending to accept certain expansions of the welfare state (S-CHIP, a prescription drug benefit in Medicare) in order to forestall a larger government takeover of health insurance.

The United States strike will focus on “broadening the definition of violence against women,” says Sarah Leonard, spokesperson for the strike. In addition to protesting domestic, sexual and physical violence against women, Tithi Bhattacharya, a member of the strike’s organizing committee, says the strike on Wednesday focuses on rejecting the “systemic violence of an economic system that is rapidly leaving women behind.” “This is the day to emphasize the unity between work done in the so-called formal economy and the domestic sphere, the public sphere and the private sphere, and how most working women have to straddle both,” says Ms. Bhattacharya. “Labor is understood to be work only at the point of production, but as women we know that both society and policy makers invisibilize the work that women do.” The strike calls for women to withhold labor, paid or unpaid, from the United States economy to show how important their contributions are. The platform of the strike seeks to elevate the demands of the majority of women, not simply the demands of the loudest or most privileged women. “The language of feminism in recent years has been used to talk about ‘Lean In’ feminism,” says Ms. Bhattacharya. “We do not want a world where women become C.E.O.s, we want a world where there are no C.E.O.s, and wealth is redistributed equally.” This, she explains, is why they decided to convey their “new international feminist movement” around the socialist philosophy of “Feminism for the 99 Percent.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/why-women-are-on-strike.html?searchResultPosition=106

That, at least, is the view of Esmeralda Mosso. So on a soggy morning last week, she joined the scores of people who have been descending on the offices of the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Lower Manhattan to get the paperwork needed to ensure that whatever happens, she and her children will not be separated. Ms. Mosso is an undocumented immigrant who moved here 12 years ago from Guerrero State in Mexico. Two of her children, however, are American citizens. She was waiting in line to get official copies of their birth certificates, which she needed for passports and so they could apply for dual citizenship with Mexico. “I’m prepared to go, but with my children,” she said. “Without them, I’m not going. Even if they use a crane, I’m not going without them.” Her situation is hardly unique. Of the roughly 11 million people in the country illegally, some 33 percent — 3.3 million people — live with at least one child who is an American citizen, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group.

403,"WASHINGTON — With the Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Neil M. Gorsuch less than two weeks away, liberal activists are alarmed not only at the prospect of his lifetime appointment to the court, but at what they see as muted opposition from Senate Democrats. “We are not hearing from them the intensity that we are hearing from the grass roots,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, the organizer of a recent letter from 11 progressive groups urging Democrats to step it up. “The grass roots really understands this is a do-or-die nomination.” The tough criticism from the left underscores the Democrats’ difficult position. They need to keep their agitated and highly motivated base satisfied while not appearing to dismiss Judge Gorsuch, who has impressed members of both parties during private meetings, strictly out of political spite for the way Republicans stonewalled President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick B. Garland. In the past few days, Democrats have sought to show more organized resistance in advance of the coming confirmation showdown on March 20. They say the Gorsuch nomination, a topic that would capture attention in Washington just days before a hearing, is being overshadowed by the political upheaval accompanying President Trump’s occupancy of the White House. “I think there is a lot going on that makes it very hard to look at anything that they’re doing,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 3-ranking Senate Democrat, who said the Trump White House was following a “hide the ball” strategy. “And this is a serious nomination that should take serious consideration because this nominee would end up on this court for a very long time.” She joined two fellow Democratic senators and advocates for labor, disabled people and the education community on Tuesday to try to highlight what they viewed as anti-worker opinions by Mr. Gorsuch that they said should disqualify him from the court. On Monday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called on conservative groups that helped compile a list of Supreme Court candidates for consideration by Mr. Trump to release any communications they had with Judge Gorsuch or the Trump team about his consideration and selection.

We spent a week in line hearing their stories. Most didn’t give their last names, and some didn’t give their names at all, for fear of deportation. An Ecuadorean mother was in line to get a copy of her 3-year-old daughter’s birth certificate, and she said that many of her friends had done the same. To meet the demand, New York City’s Bureau of Vital Statistics had added extra hours during the week. So why the surge in requests?

He proved so once again last Saturday when he claimed he had been wiretapped by President Barack Obama, and called him a “sick guy” who had conducted a Watergate-style operation. There is no evidence that what Trump said is true, and a line of prominent officials, most notably the former director of national intelligence James Clapper, have stepped forward to cast doubt on the claim. Both Democrats and Republicans have spoken up to express their displeasure. This has been the main story line over the past few days: Feckless president makes baseless claim; establishment Washington revolts; media piles on. What’s missing is that Trump’s assertions, however overinflated, nonetheless echo certain aspects of The New York Times’s reporting from recent weeks. That, in turn, has allowed his administration to assert that the basis for his claims rests, in part, on reporting by The Times. On the surface, there are similarities. Both The Times and Trump have referred to wiretaps. Both have referenced White House knowledge of the investigations. And both have described efforts by officials from the Obama administration to involve itself in the continuing investigations of Trump and Russia.

I’d have access to the whole wondrous trove. Drill, baby, drill. I need the access. As things stand now, I lose 45 minutes every week to the retrieval of forgotten passwords, and I recently got three-quarters of the way through a mystery before realizing that I knew whodunit, how he dun it and why he dun it. I’d already read the book. Carson, our brand-new housing secretary, made an introductory, supposedly inspirational speech to federal employees this week, and while this kind of thing normally doesn’t wind up in the news, there’s nothing normal about Carson. During the speech, he went on the tangent about the brain that I just described, and while, granted, he’s a renowned neurosurgeon and I’m an expert on little more than semicolons, I do question his assertion that with proper cerebral stimulation, someone can “recite back to you verbatim a book they read 60 years ago.” Maybe “Green Eggs and Ham.” But “The Mill on the Floss”? Several of Carson’s fellow brain experts scoffed at this claim, though there was much louder scoffing at a subsequent stretch of his remarks that described America as a magnet for dreamers who arrived with “all of their earthly belongings in their two hands, not knowing what this country held for them.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/ben-carsons-gray-matter.html?searchResultPosition=108
407,"The world has been wondering where President Trump will face his first national security crisis. This week it has looked as if North Korea might be the first hot spot. A series of ballistic missile tests and other provocative actions by North Korea, a nuclear-capable country, have heightened regional anxieties and stirred speculation about America’s reaction. The most recent tests involved the simultaneous launch on Monday of four missiles, which landed off Japan’s coast. The North Koreans have described the tests as drills for striking American bases in Japan, but the ultimate goal is assumed to be a strike on the United States. Some experts expect Pyongyang to have that capability within four years. This use of multiple missiles raised concerns that the North was trying out a new attack strategy that could overwhelm Japan’s limited defenses, analysts said. The tests almost certainly were a reaction to annual United States-South Korea military exercises, which began last week and which the North considers a threat. It is just three weeks since the North crossed another milestone by launching a solid-rocket missile, which is more efficient than the liquid-fueled missiles it had previously relied on; there were also tests in August and September. North Korea now possesses the fissile material for perhaps 21 nuclear weapons and is steadily improving its ability to deliver them with missiles. The country also has chemical weapons, which may have been used when the half brother of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, was assassinated in Malaysia last month. Malaysia has accused several North Korean citizens of using VX nerve agent to kill him, which seems plausible and underscores the lengths to which Mr. Kim is willing to go to eliminate perceived rivals. Adding to the tension is a decision to install an American-made antimissile system in South Korea. Although the system has been under discussion for some time, the two countries have expedited its deployment, which began on Monday and is expected to take two months.

Equally uncertain are the fates of at least seven people in Iran, five of them American citizens. Four were imprisoned after the nuclear accord took effect and relaxed sanctions against Iran in exchange for its verifiable guarantees of peaceful nuclear work. Relatives of the imprisoned and their advocates have been speaking out, frustrated and wondering how Mr. Trump will deal with the problem. As a candidate, he promised to resolve the prisoner issue but since the inauguration has said little about it. “I’m trying to reach out to everyone I can to help,” said Babak Namazi, whose father, Baquer Namazi, 80, a former Unicef official, and brother, Siamak, 45, a businessman and advocate of stronger Iranian ties with the United States, are among the Americans languishing in prison. “Every day that goes by, my concern for my father and Siamak increases,” Mr. Namazi said this week in a telephone interview from Dubai, where he lives. He expressed particular anxiety about his father, who has a heart ailment, saying that an Iranian prison cell was “no place for an aging old man.” Last month, on the anniversary of the elder Mr. Namazi’s imprisonment, Unicef exhorted the Iranian authorities to release him. “After a lifetime of humanitarian service, he has earned a peaceful retirement,” a Unicef statement said.

409,"The Trump administration has invoked executive powers in a bid to block the testimony of several top C.I.A. officials in a federal lawsuit against two psychologists who helped run the agency’s harsh interrogation program, along with portions of 172 internal agency documents. Hoping to prevent the officials, including Gina Haspel, the agency’s new deputy director, from being forced to testify, the administration is using the state secrets privilege, which means the executive branch is asking the judge in the case to keep information out of court by asserting that its disclosure would damage national security. The government rarely tries to use the extraordinary power, and this is among the first assertions of it by the Trump administration. At an earlier phase of the case in Federal District Court in Spokane, Wash., the Obama administration did not invoke the privilege — although in court filings last year, it did leave the door open to doing so at a later stage. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by two former detainees at C.I.A. secret prisons overseas and the representative of a third man who died in custody. If they prevail in the suit against the former military psychologists, James E. Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who helped devise and run the interrogation program, it would be the first time an American civilian court has held anyone accountable for a role in developing counterterrorism policies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The two former prisoners say they suffered lasting harm from their treatment at C.I.A. “black sites,” secret interrogation and detention centers that it operated overseas. Suleiman Abdullah Salim, a Tanzanian who may have been a victim of mistaken identity, was held in a darkened C.I.A. prison in Afghanistan and subjected to beatings, hanging in chains, sleep deprivation, and water dousing, which involves pouring ice water over detainees to create a sensation of drowning, according to a Senate report and interviews with him. Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, a Libyan also held in Afghanistan, who was likewise mentioned in the Senate report, described being slammed against a wall, shackled to the ceiling, locked in wooden boxes and also subjected to the ice water treatment. The third man, an Afghan named Gul Rahman, died in 2002 in a secret C.I.A. prison in Afghanistan after being left nearly naked and shackled to a wall in the cold.

410,"Clayton Yeutter, a lawyer who oversaw negotiations with Canada under President Ronald Reagan that became the basis for the North American Free Trade Agreement, died on Saturday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 86. His wife, Cristena Bach Yeutter, said the cause was metastatic colon cancer. A farmer from birth, Mr. Yeutter, who was secretary of agriculture under President George Bush and, earlier, the United States trade representative under Reagan, negotiated complex economic deals with a bluntness more common in pastures than in politics. Before he was confirmed as agriculture secretary in 1989, a profile in The New York Times called him “a burly, back-thumping, 58-year-old official with the voice of a hog caller.” Mr. Yeutter often employed that voice to argue for reduced restrictions on trade. Reagan appointed him trade representative in 1985, to succeed William E. Brock, who became secretary of labor. Over the next four years Mr. Yeutter — his last name rhymes with “fighter” — helped guide a 1988 trade bill through a Democratic Congress onto Reagan’s desk for approval. (The president had vetoed an earlier version.) He helped begin the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1986, which ultimately resulted in the creation of the World Trade Organization. And he persuaded the Japanese government to relax restrictions on American exports like citrus, semiconductors and beef in a series of aggressive negotiations. Perhaps his greatest legacy as trade representative was the negotiation of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, which was signed in 1988.

411,"WASHINGTON — A senior American general told Congress on Wednesday that Russia has deployed a prohibited cruise missile, the first public confirmation by the United States that the Kremlin had fielded the weapon in violation of a landmark arms control agreement. The missile is believed to have been moved in December from a test site in southern Russia to an undisclosed operational base. “We believe that the Russians have deployed a land-based cruise missile that violates the spirit and intent of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty,” Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee. “The system itself presents a risk to most of our facilities in Europe,” he added. “And we believe that the Russians have deliberately deployed it in order to pose a threat to NATO and to facilities within the NATO area of responsibility.” The New York Times reported last month that Russia had deployed a battalion of the prohibited missiles. A typical battalion has four launchers, each of which is equipped with six missiles. While senior Trump administration officials have not said where the new unit is based, there has been speculation in media reports that a missile system with similar characteristics is deployed in central Russia. The Times also noted that a second battalion was staged at a missile test range at Kapustin Yar, in southern Russia near Volgograd. Russia’s foreign ministry criticized the article as an example of “fake news.” The treaty Russia is accused of violating bans the testing, production and possession of American and Russian intermediate-range missiles based on land. Commonly called the I.N.F. treaty, it was signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, and is regarded as one of the cornerstones of arms control.

412,"“I have never had a problem speaking truth to power,” said John Kelly, the retired general, in January. “I firmly believe that those in power deserve full candor and my honest assessment and recommendations.” Well, then. If Mr. Kelly was speaking honestly — under oath, at the hearing on his nomination to be homeland security secretary — what has he been waiting for? Why is he not out there reminding all who will listen, but particularly his boss, President Trump, of the sensible things he told senators barely two months ago, explaining what a reasonable border and immigration policy might look like? Instead, Mr. Kelly is giving every indication that he and his vast department are fully on board with executing Mr. Trump’s fixation on protecting the nation from an imaginary siege at the southern border, while waging an all-out deportation campaign against millions of unauthorized immigrant workers and families who pose no threat to the nation. It’s a misguided, self-destructive direction to take the country. Mr. Kelly should be stepping on the brakes, not the gas. The latest evidence, first reported by Politico, is a draft Department of Homeland Security budget that would bulk up border spending at the expense of the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Coast Guard would be cut 14 percent, from $9.1 billion to $7.8 billion. Cuts to the T.S.A. and FEMA would be about 11 percent, to $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. The senselessness of such cuts is obvious if you understand some basic concepts. Like, the Coast Guard guards our coasts. It plays a major role in interdicting drugs at sea. The T.S.A. keeps bombs off our planes. FEMA helps people after disasters. If your goal at Homeland Security is security for the homeland, you recognize that the job is more complicated than contracting out one 2,000-mile wall. Mr. Kelly showed he understood this when he spoke to the Senate. On the wall: “As a military person that understands defense and defenses, a physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/opinion/secretary-kelly-is-missing-in-action-on-immigration.html?searchResultPosition=63
413,"The number of undocumented immigrants caught along the southwest United States border fell significantly last month, which the Trump administration said Wednesday was a sign that its hard line on illegal immigration might already be discouraging border crossers. Roughly 840 people a day were caught or stopped from entering the United States from Mexico in February, according to Customs and Border Protection, a drop of about 36 percent from the previous February. Just as significant, the number was down about 39 percent from January, a reversal of a yearslong trend of apprehensions increasing in February as the temperature begins to rise and more people try to cross the border. The data is likely to please supporters of President Trump and could let him take credit for quickly making good on his promise to clamp down on illegal immigration. “The early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact,” John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement. The flow of people across the United States’ southern border has long depended on many factors, including the economy and violence in their home countries, and even the weather. But chief among them is America’s own immigration policy, and experts said they were not surprised to see a slowdown even before Mr. Trump’s executive orders on immigration have taken full effect or his signature wall has been built. “Deterrence through perception is central to these executive orders,” said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “Even floating the possibility of expanding detention at the border makes somebody less likely to come.” Since taking office, Mr. Trump has made clear that undocumented immigrants will have a tougher time getting into and staying in the United States. Beyond planning to build a border wall, a rallying cry during his campaign, he has expanded the authority of immigration enforcement officers and pledged to hire more of them; raised the threshold for entry to the United States based on claims of persecution back home; and called for more detentions and quicker deportations of those already in the country illegally. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors more limits on immigration, said all signs pointed to a decline in migration similar to that seen after the Reagan administration’s sweeping immigration reform law of 1986. It gave amnesty to many immigrants who had entered the United States before 1982, while promising tighter security at the Mexican border and tough penalties for companies hiring undocumented workers. “The talk of tougher enforcement can, in fact, lead to reductions in the flow, but only for a short period of time if the words aren’t backed up with action,” Mr. Krikorian said. During the Reagan years, he said, “the promises of tougher enforcement didn’t exactly pan out.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/trump-immigration-border.html?searchResultPosition=62

Until Wednesday, Mr. Spicer had steadfastly declined to discuss Mr. Trump’s assertion that former President Barack Obama ordered wiretap surveillance of Trump Tower — an act that Mr. Trump condemned as a scandal comparable in scale to McCarthyism or Watergate.

Investigators say that the leak was the work not of a hostile foreign power like Russia but of a disaffected insider, as WikiLeaks suggested when it released the documents Tuesday. The F.B.I. was preparing to interview anyone who had access to the information, a group likely to include at least a few hundred people, and possibly more than a thousand.

But in a special election, energy is everything,” said Mr. Ossoff, who, if he makes the runoff after the vote next month, will most likely face off against the leading Republican in the race to fill the congressional seat vacated by Tom Price, President Trump’s new secretary of health and human services. If Democrats have any hopes of recapturing the 24 seats needed to take back the House, they will depend on a lot of anti-Trump energy and underdogs like Mr. Ossoff. The race in Georgia, in a district Republicans have held for a generation, will be an early test of Democrats’ ability to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s polarizing presence — he barely won the district last year — and the ability of both parties to choose candidates within their divided ideological factions who can win a general election. Fueled by the conviction that affluent, educated suburban areas are at least trending toward competitive in the strange and shifting battlefields of Mr. Trump’s America, Democrats believe this is the kind of district where they have a shot. Republicans are confident that Democrats will be inclined to nominate candidates from the most progressive wing of the party, who may energize their base but prove a poor fit for general elections in even the most anti-Trump Republican districts. At the same time, Republicans are going to have to decide whether candidates who distance themselves from Mr. Trump or those who run as his mini-me are their strongest candidates. The outcome of the election here may provide clues to how Mr. Trump’s presidency might, or might not, be deployed in local races.

Weakening these standards would be a mistake for consumers, the environment and the auto industry itself.

But people have become cynical about their government.” But Mr. Perdue, a Republican who is awaiting confirmation to serve as President Trump’s agriculture secretary, became a target of frequent criticism that he was failing to honor his own ethics pledge during his eight years as governor. The criticism centers on the fact that, as Mr. Trump has, he continued to own or help run his family business ventures — four farming-related companies — while serving as governor. Mr. Perdue is one of the last cabinet members awaiting Senate confirmation. No date has been set for his confirmation hearing; a holdup in the release of paperwork accompanying his nomination by the federal Office of Government Ethics has been blamed for the delay. The office must examine Mr. Perdue’s proposal to avoid conflicts of interest while running the U.S.D.A., as the department is known, which may include selling off some of his farming assets. Before his tenure as governor ended in 2011, 13 complaints had been filed against Mr. Perdue with the State Ethics Commission, which on two occasions ruled that the governor had violated state ethics laws. The commission took the unusual step of fining Mr. Perdue while he was governor.

And, its London bureau chief, Nikolay A. Bogachikhin, jokes, “We overlook MI5 and we’re near MI6,” Britain’s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Bogachikhin was poking fun at the charge from Western governments, American and European, that RT is an agent of Kremlin policy and a tool directly used by President Vladimir V. Putin to undermine Western democracies — meddling in the recent American presidential election and, European security officials say, trying to do the same in the Netherlands, France and Germany, all of which vote later this year. But the West is not laughing. Even as Russia insists that RT is just another global network like the BBC or France 24, albeit one offering “alternative views” to the Western-dominated news media, many Western countries regard RT as the slickly produced heart of a broad, often covert disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about democratic institutions and destabilize the West. Western attention focused on RT when the Obama administration and United States intelligence agencies judged with “high confidence” in January that Mr. Putin had ordered a campaign to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,” discredit Hillary Clinton through the hacking of Democratic Party internal emails and provide support for Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate said he wanted to improve relations with Russia. The agencies issued a report saying the attack was carried out through the targeted use of real information, some open and some hacked, and the creation of false reports, or “fake news,” broadcast on state-funded news media like RT and its sibling, the internet news agency Sputnik. These reports were then amplified on social media, sometimes by computer “bots” that send out thousands of Facebook and Twitter messages. To many Americans, the impression that RT is an instrument of Russian meddling was reinforced when its programming suddenly interrupted C-Span’s online coverage of the House of Representatives in January. (C-Span later called it a technical error, not a hacking.) ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/europe/russias-rt-network-is-it-more-bbc-or-kgb.html?searchResultPosition=68

So why are Republicans now revolting against the Republican plan to replace it? We take a close look at the bill to understand. On today’s episode: • We begin in 1948, when the United States started to debate whether to create a nationwide health care system. While national health care programs spread in Europe, the United States never enacted such sweeping legislation. In 2010, that changed. Margot Sanger-Katz has been reporting on our health care system for years and joins us to discuss. • After hearing details of the new health care legislation, I call up Newt Gingrich and ask him what he thinks. Background reading: • Ms. Sanger-Katz on why even some Republicans are rejecting President Trump’s replacement health care bill. • A graphic that explains the parts of Obamacare that Republicans will keep, change or discard.

Maybe it’s no surprise that the Santa Cruz region was the highest-ranked metropolitan area in California in the latest Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. For the ranking, researchers conducted more than 350,000 phone interviews nationally in 2015 and 2016. People were asked about their cities, jobs, health and social lives. California was well represented, with seven metropolitan areas among the top 25 of nearly 190 surveyed.

As people began to digest the Republican health care plan on Tuesday, a few things became clear: 1. “This isn’t an Obamacare repeal, it’s a Medicaid repeal,” as the political writer Jonathan Allen put it. Many Republicans have long viewed Medicaid — a health insurance program for the poor, the disabled and some elderly — with skepticism. This plan would make very large cuts to the program. The details are somewhat technical, and Edwin Park of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explains them. But the real-world effects will be concrete: Many people will lose coverage, and some kinds of care, if the bill becomes law. 2. Conservative policy experts hate the bill, and the criticisms come from both the far right and the center right. Peter Suderman of Reason had an excellent frame for understanding the right’s civil war over health care: Conservatives don’t even agree on what their goals are. Making health care less expensive? Reducing the government’s role? Ensuring that the poor receive fewer subsidies? Lacking this agreement, many Republicans have pretended that a magical health plan exists, one that would cover everyone, provide good insurance and cost less money. Wouldn’t that be nice! The most entertaining episode in the civil war happened after Charles C. W. Cooke tweeted, “I’ve yet to read a single positive analysis of the House’s Obamacare bill.” A conservative replied: “try going 2 a conservative source? Open up your reading habits 2 include those w/ whom u would naturally dismiss.” To which Cooke replied, accurately, “I’m the editor of National Review Online.” 3. To overcome the tensions, Republican leaders want to rush the bill through, before the Congressional Budget Office can release its independent estimates of the bill’s effects. “What a farce,” wrote Philip Klein, managing editor of the conservative Washington Examiner. For more on health care, see Paul Krugman’s blog post, Ross Douthat’s column, the Editorial Board’s take and an Op-Ed on the return of rationing.

423,"MADRID — Teresa Rodríguez, the leader of the far-left Podemos Party in the southern region of Andalusia, was visiting an exhibition in the Chamber of Commerce of Seville when she ran into a member of the group she had never met before. In no time, the man, Manuel Muñoz Medina, pushed up against her and simulated kissing her on the mouth — before handing her his business card. Ms. Rodríguez, 35, said she was too upset and shocked to react at the time, just before Christmas. But she then took to social media and started legal action this year. Mr. Muñoz Medina, 72, later apologized for his behavior, saying he had been drunk, and resigned from the chamber’s board. Spanish women have made tremendous advances in recent years as the revolt against mainstream parties helped break down some old-boy networks. But that upheaval, the women say, has also laid bare the deeply entrenched sexism and machismo in Spain’s political establishment, which has at the very least been slow to adapt to changing times, intensifying a clash of both generations and genders. It has been less than a year since voters elected a Parliament with a record number of women for Spain: 139 out of 350 lawmakers. Within Podemos, which has become Spain’s third-largest party, women make up almost half of lawmakers. In Spain’s regions, far-left women now serve as mayors in both Madrid and Barcelona, Spain’s two largest cities. But women say they still face big obstacles as they try to make their way in Spanish politics, still predominantly a man’s world. Sexual harassment aside — and it is common — among the problems most commonly cited by women is that men expect their female colleagues to share their views, not have opinions of their own.

424,"President Trump’s immigration policies faced a pair of new challenges in court on Wednesday, as the attorney general of Hawaii alleged that Mr. Trump had violated the Constitution with his redrawn executive order banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries. And in California, the city attorney of San Francisco asked a federal judge to issue an injunction blocking another executive order, which threatens to withdraw funding for so-called sanctuary cities that do not extensively cooperate with federal immigration enforcement officials. Both actions show how emboldened Mr. Trump’s opponents are to attack his policies through litigation, after a series of lawsuits brought by state attorneys general and nonprofit groups derailed his first travel ban last month. In the Hawaii case, the state attorney general, Doug Chin, a Democrat, claimed in a legal filing that Mr. Trump’s new order would damage the state’s educational institutions and private businesses, including its lucrative tourism industry, and discriminate against families with relatives overseas. Mr. Chin said in an interview that despite changes Mr. Trump made to his first executive order, the new one amounted to the same policy “dressed up differently.” He said Mr. Trump’s travel ban had stirred strong opposition in Hawaii, where people still recall federal policies that targeted Asian-Americans for discrimination, from the Chinese Exclusion Act to the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II. “This order brings back memories for a lot of people here,” Mr. Chin said. “Any time you have an executive order or some government decision that’s calling out people by their nation of origin or by religion, we’ve got to be a check against that.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/trump-travel-ban-hawaii.html?searchResultPosition=91
425,"Once again in the young presidency of Donald J. Trump, women rallied against his administration on Wednesday, this time by skipping work, wearing red and refusing to spend money. But the protests were far smaller than the masses who turned the women’s marches on Jan. 21 into a phenomenon, keeping the question open of whether protesters’ fervor can be channeled into a sustained movement with demonstrable political results. In New York City, hundreds of people jammed into a Midtown block, and the Women’s March on Washington said 10 of its organizers were arrested there for blocking traffic. The municipal court in Providence, R.I., shut down because seven of the clerks and a deputy court administrator stayed home from work. Schools in Alexandria, Va.; Chapel Hill-Carrboro, N.C.; and Prince George’s County, Md., closed for the day because so many teachers stayed home. The strike was held on International Women’s Day, and President Trump weighed in early with a restrained statement, writing a message of respect on Twitter for women and the role they play in the economy. Later, in Washington, women rallied near the White House to protest the “global gag rule” banning federal funding for any organization overseas that discusses abortion as a family planning option. But Rebecca Wood, 37, who brought her 4-year-old daughter, said her complaints were broader. “I used to list so many things on a sign,” she said. “Now I have so many concerns, I just have a sign that says ‘RESIST.’” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/a-day-without-a-woman.html?searchResultPosition=90

The Egyptian authorities said they would allow female prisoners an extra family visit this month. The events were all centered on International Women’s Day on Wednesday, and people and governments across the globe observed it in an outpouring of support for women’s equality and empowerment. But amid the celebrations, protests were brewing. Demonstrations were scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in dozens of cities across France. In Paris, protesters planned to march from the Place de la République to the Opéra Garnier. Unions, student organizations and feminist associations were calling for women to start striking at 3:40 p.m. — symbolically the time of day when Frenchwomen stop being paid, they argue, because of an average 26 percent pay gap with men.

427,"The American Medical Association, a powerful lobbying group representing the nation’s doctors, announced on Wednesday that it opposed the House Republicans’ proposed legislation to replace the federal health care law, saying it was concerned the bill “would result in millions of Americans losing coverage and benefits.” The group, which provided crucial support for the Obama administration’s contentious health care legislation before it was enacted in 2010, also sent a letter to the two House committees responsible for drafting the Republicans’ bill, called the American Health Care Act. The group’s concerns echoed some others raised this week among industry organizations like hospital groups worried about the possible losses of coverage that could result from the proposed legislation that was released on Monday. All of the major hospital groups, including the American Hospital Association, also came out against the bill. “We are very concerned that the draft legislative proposal being considered by the House committees could lead to tremendous instability for those seeking affordable coverage,” the hospitals said in a letter to Congress. The hospitals also raised concerns about Republicans’ plans to significantly alter Medicaid, which they said could result in a loss of coverage and cuts to health care services. The doctors’ main concern focused on the Republicans’ replacement of the subsidies now available to millions of low-income Americans with a flat tax credit for low- and middle-income people that is adjusted by a person’s age. The A.M.A. emphasized the need for the credits to “be sufficient to enable one to afford quality coverage,” but it also emphasized that the credits should be closely tied to an individual’s income as a way of covering more people and being a better use of taxpayer money. The doctors also voiced their opposition to the proposed rollback of Medicaid. Even as the Republicans seemingly rush to pass a bill that would undo much of the current law, the doctors and hospitals urged them to be careful about whatever changes they made. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet weighed in with estimates of how many people the new legislation will cover and what the cost of the plan might be. “As you consider this legislation over the coming days and weeks, we hope that you will keep upmost in your mind the potentially life altering impact your decisions will have on millions of Americans who may see their public, individual or even employer-provided health care coverage changed or eliminated,” wrote Dr. James L. Madara, the association’s chief executive. The A.M.A. had earlier endorsed Dr. Tom Price as President Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, provoking a split with rank-and-file doctors and nurses who opposed his nomination.

428,"Documents released by WikiLeaks that indicate the extensive collection of cyberweapons by the C.I.A. are a reminder that this sort of thing is a growing international business. On Tuesday, WikiLeaks released a huge cache of documents that detail how the C.I.A. has collected various types of cyberweapons, including so-called zero-day vulnerabilities that would expose iPhones, Android phones, Windows and Linux computers, internet-connected televisions and maybe even high-tech cars to hackers. The argument for the C.I.A. gathering these hacking tools would be that they are needed to counter the increasing technological sophistication of its targets. What’s more, by targeting the underlying software of a smartphone, the agency would be able to capture communications before they were encrypted by popular communications programs like Signal. It’s not yet clear how the C.I.A. obtained the malware, and at least some of it may be out of date. (Hint: Upgrade your phone’s software.) Some may have been discovered by government researchers. And many others may have been acquired in the growing online market for this troublesome code. Over the last year, The New York Times’s Nicole Perlroth has written extensively about cyberarms dealers. Whether it is through online brokerages, physical conferences or contracts obtained by companies based in Israel, Italy and other places, governments around the world have been spending big to obtain these hacking tools. As Ms. Perlroth reported late last year: “Zerodium, a zero-day-exploit broker that sells to governments, said it paid hackers $1 million for an Apple exploit in October. In mid-November, the brokerage firm said it would pay hackers $50,000 for an attack that could take over a victim’s machine through a Safari or Internet Explorer browser, and $80,000 for a similar attack through Google’s Chrome browser.” More tech news: Snap makes a bet on the supremacy of the camera: Our rising dependence on cameras is changing our language, and the company behind Snapchat is counting on the eventual dominance of visual culture.

429,"WASHINGTON — For a while now, Senator Mark R. Warner has taken to thinking like a Russian. The Virginia Democrat is losing himself in a book about the Romanovs, eager to absorb the country’s theories of war, teasing staff members for insufficient knowledge of Tolstoy and Nabokov. He has been sending messages over the encrypted app Signal, just to be safe. Then there was the ruckus outside Mr. Warner’s window late one recent afternoon, a curious thud against the building beside a giant American flag. “That may just be the F.S.B.,” Mr. Warner said flatly, referring to Russia’s primary intelligence and security agency. He appeared to be kidding. Probably. Such is the head space of Capitol Hill’s top Democrat investigating ties between President Trump’s orbit and Russian intelligence — a former rising star in the party, frozen in the ascent for years now. As Republicans resist calls for a select committee or special prosecutor to oversee the matter, the Democrats’ best hope for acquiring answers most likely remains an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Mr. Warner is vice chairman. The result, at the height of anti-Trump fervor and Wall Street-bashing progressivism in the Democratic Party’s base, is a spotlight trained brightly on a southern-state centrist with a nine-figure net worth, a decade-old itch to be president and, until recently, according to friends and former aides, a healthy disdain for the institution he serves.

430,"For much of the last century it seemed that the slice of the total economic pie going to workers was — like the speed of light — constant. No matter what the economy’s makeup, labor could collectively depend on taking home roughly two-thirds of the country’s total output as compensation for its efforts. Workers’ unchanging share, the economist John Maynard Keynes declared in 1939, was “one of the most surprising, yet best-established, facts in the whole range of economic statistics.” But in recent decades, that steady share — which includes everything from the chief executive’s bonuses and stock options to the parking-lot attendant’s minimum wage and tips — started to flutter. In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor’s portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession. The decline has coincided with a slowdown in overall growth as well as a stark leap in inequality. “Labor is getting a shrinking slice of a pie that’s not growing very much,” David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., said. It is a development that is upending political establishments and economic policies in the United States and abroad. Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters. Alternate culprits include tax policies that treat investment income more favorably than wages; flagging skills and education that have rendered workers less productive or unsuited to an information- and service-based economy; or a weakening of labor unions that has chipped away at workers’ bargaining power and protections.

Now, just six months later, SoftBank is in final-stage talks to sell a 25 percent stake in ARM, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The roughly $8 billion sale will be to a new $100 billion investment fund that Mr. Son has created with Saudi Arabia and other investors, raising questions about how politicians in Britain, the United States and elsewhere will respond to such investments in their national technology industries. Chips made by ARM power iPhones and millions of other mobile devices worldwide. Mr. Son met with President Trump before his inauguration in January about using the $100 billion fund to buy stakes in American tech companies, with the aim of creating thousands of new jobs. While British lawmakers remain sanguine about the proposed sale of ARM to Mr. Son’s investment vehicle, known as Vision Fund, it remains unclear whether American politicians will be as willing for the fund to scoop up stakes in American tech companies. Representatives for ARM and SoftBank declined to comment. The proposed sale of the ARM stake, which has yet to be completed, was reported earlier by The Financial Times. The move by SoftBank, which also owns Sprint in the United States, comes as it tries to secure further investment to reach the financial goal for Vision Fund. The investment vehicle will be based in London and run by Rajeev Misra, SoftBank’s head of strategic finance. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has pledged to invest $45 billion in the fund, while SoftBank has contributed $25 billion. Apple, the iPhone maker, and Lawrence Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle, also have made minority investments in Vision Fund. Mubadala Development, a state-owned investment company in Abu Dhabi, and the Qatari government are in talks to join the fund. The goal of Vision Fund, according to Mr. Son, is to invest in high-growth tech start-ups, though the fund also will spend on larger tech investments in the public and private markets. While the Vision Fund tries to reach its financial goals, SoftBank has already moved to spend its own cash on potentially lucrative deals.

Don’t wait for permission.” His audience was surprised. Conventional political wisdom advocated a robust and elaborate campaign hierarchy. But Mr. Bannon demanded the opposite.

433,"BEIJING — The story dripped with intrigue. A frantic President Trump, holding court in a bathrobe, ordered his aides to wrap the White House telephones in tinfoil, several Chinese publications reported this week, citing The New Yorker. There was only one problem: The New Yorker article, by the comedian Andy Borowitz, was satire. That did not stop the story, purporting to describe the depths of Mr. Trump’s worry that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, was eavesdropping on him, from ricocheting across the Chinese internet. “Trump turns White House upside down looking for signs of Obama: ‘I know he’s still here!’ ” read headlines in respected publications like Caijing, a business magazine, and Sina, a news portal. Internet readers were puzzled. The state-run news media — and China’s army of censors — are not known for making jokes. Was this for real? “This is illness,” one user wrote about Mr. Trump on Weibo, a microblogging site. Others were more discerning. “This was made up and meant to be funny,” another user said. “Surprising it was treated as news. Editor, could you be more professional?” It was not the first time that American humorists have unintentionally duped the Chinese news media. In 2012, People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party, reported that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, had been named “Sexiest Man Alive for 2012.” The newspaper based its report on a satirical article in The Onion. And in 2013, Xinhua, the official news agency, mistook as fact a satirical report in The New Yorker about the purchase of The Washington Post by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief executive. (The New Yorker article said that Mr. Bezos had bought the newspaper by clicking on it by mistake. That piece was also written by Mr. Borowitz as part of his regular column, “The Borowitz Report.”) The satirical article about Mr. Trump was published on Saturday, and first picked up in China online and in print on Tuesday by Reference News, a newspaper that translates foreign news and is published by Xinhua. The newspaper removed the story from its website on Wednesday after the Chinese news media reported that it was false. Fake news articles, conspiracy theories and rumors are rampant on the Chinese internet, and media analysts say it is not surprising that Chinese outlets fall victim to jokes. “Fake news is undoubtedly a serious problem in China, as it is elsewhere in the world,” David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in an email.

As a businessman, Mr. Trump has amassed a vast portfolio of trademarks around the world, as he seeks to protect his brands and his products.

The timing of the new trademarks could create a perception problem for Mr. Trump, coming so soon after he took office. In February, the Chinese government announced that it was granting Mr. Trump the right to protect his name brand for construction projects, after a decade-long legal battle.

Now, Dubai is about to gain another landmark. The Dubai Frame, set to open this year, is literally and figuratively a frame imposed on the overwhelming view — two parallel towers linked by an observation deck. It is a marker of how far the city has traveled, drawing the eye from the drab buildings of the old settlement along Dubai Creek to the riotous profusion of neon-draped skyscrapers stretching south to the Persian Gulf. It is a totem of Dubai’s ambitions. It may also be counterfeit. The Mexican-born architect whose initial design inspired the structure, Fernando Donis, has accused the Dubai municipality of breaching his copyright in a lawsuit filed in December in United States federal court. Nine years ago, Mr. Donis won an international competition to design the building, besting more than 900 other entrants. Yet he was not included in the project’s execution and was not compensated for his intellectual property, his lawsuit claims. “It’s shocking,” Mr. Donis said. “The Frame is mine, and they don’t want to grant that it is mine. The infringement doesn’t just victimize me. They have taken something from all architects — the protection of our ideas.” Raised as a monument to Dubai’s aspirations as a center of international commerce, the Frame is now a physical manifestation of the crude system that erected it.

It really does have a great look — all the laws of mass and motion aside, you feel pretty confident the bull is going to wind up backing down. And it reminds you that while marching is important, sometimes you can make a difference by standing still. The Wall Street girl celebrates all the people who resisted by staying in place. A little bit to the north one of my all-time favorite heroines, Elizabeth Jennings Graham, won a place in history by refusing to move an inch. An African-American schoolteacher, Graham was on her way to play the organ at a church service in 1854, when her streetcar’s conductor demanded she get off and wait for a car for colored people. Unlike the little bronze girl on Wall Street, she did not stand up and put her hands on her hips, since that would have facilitated her removal. She stayed sitting, hugging the window, until she was dragged away kicking. She found a lawyer, filed a lawsuit, won the suit, and gave New York City integrated mass transportation a century before Rosa Parks held her ground. Marches are a great demonstration of solidarity: How many people will be telling their grandchildren they were at the women’s march after the Trump inauguration? But the little girl is a nice reminder that even if a crowd isn’t available, you have to do what you can. Even if it means standing down a bull, or refusing to get off a trolley.

Iger, face to face with a smattering of people who demanded that he resign from President Trump’s business policy forum. “The question is about endorsement,” said Mehrdad Azemun, from Chicago, echoing two others who had spoken. None of the three who broached the topic with Mr. Iger were actual shareholders, but were instead acting as proxies for groups of shareholders. “By staying on the economic council it looks like you are tacitly endorsing Trump’s policies,” added Mr. Azemun, who identified himself as Iranian-American. Mr. Azemun complained about “anti-women and anti-immigrant” policies and decisions by Mr. Trump. Mr. Iger objected strongly, saying that he had no plans to step down and that his involvement was “not an endorsement at all of the policies of the new administration.” The shareholder meeting was in Denver and was streamed live on the internet. On the topic of the Trump administration’s immigration plans, Mr. Iger said that he believed in “an open and a fair and a just immigration policy.” He added, “A policy that is open to the world is vital to the future success of the Walt Disney Company and to this country.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/media/disney-chief-my-role-on-a-trump-panel-is-not-an-endorsement.html?searchResultPosition=75

But one evening late last month, the Harvard Club in Midtown was as good a place as any to go looking for the intellectual future of conservatism. The occasion was the unveiling of American Affairs, a tweedy quarterly journal dedicated to giving intellectual heft and coherence to the amorphous ideology known, for lack of a better term, as Trumpism. Not that the words “Donald Trump” came up during the presentation, though Julius Krein, the journal’s 31-year-old founder and editor, did pay the man sideways tribute with a quotation from the French critic Roland Barthes’s classic 1957 essay “The World of Wrestling.” “Our politics, like Barthes’s wrestling, has become a spectacle of excess, which has no sense of time, and no logic of the future,” Mr. Krein said, drawing a chuckle from the crowd of more than 100. He then turned to a dead-serious matter: rethinking the entire post-Cold War policy consensus. “We in America no longer have any idea what the future should be, much less how to build it together,” he said. That’s big talk for a quarterly with an initial print run of 300 copies and whose first issue mixes articles on economics and international affairs with more abstract offerings like a disquisition on Hegel and work. But the history of modern conservatism is paved with journals whose influence belied their small circulations, including The Public Interest, which became the chief organ of neoconservatism in the 1970s and ’80s, and National Affairs, founded in 2009 to promote “reform conservatism.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/american-affairs-journal-donald-trump.html?searchResultPosition=74

Mr. Clayton, a longtime partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell who is President Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, has represented big banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays as well as prominent hedge funds and corporate executives, according to a financial disclosure form made public on Wednesday by the Office of Government Ethics. Some of the clients were listed on Sullivan & Cromwell’s website — and Mr. Clayton kept nine others confidential — but the filing reveals a number of previously unadvertised assignments, including work he has done for companies facing intense government scrutiny: Deutsche Bank, UBS and Volkswagen. Other well-known clients represented by Mr. Clayton, whose given name is Walter, include the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the film studio the Weinstein Company, Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn, and William C. Erbey, former head of the mortgage firm Ocwen. In the hedge fund sector, Mr. Clayton, 50, has represented William A. Ackman’s Pershing Square as well as Paul Tudor Jones. He has also represented Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a company in which Mr. Ackman is a major investor and which is being investigated by the S.E.C. over potential accounting irregularities. Mr. Clayton, who says he will recuse himself from certain cases involving former clients, has also personally invested in a number of hedge funds and private equity firms through special Sullivan & Cromwell investment vehicles, according to the filing. He earned $7.6 million from Sullivan & Cromwell over the past year or so and has investments in portfolios managed by Apollo Global Management, Bain Capital, J.C. Flowers and Perry Partners. His wife, Gretchen, who works at Goldman Sachs, has a number of investments in Goldman-managed funds as well as a small amount, described in his filing as being less than $1,001, with a retirement account once managed by Omega Advisors, a hedge fund now fighting S.E.C. charges. Mr. Clayton’s disclosures offer a rare glimpse into his client list and family wealth — a sum of at least $50 million, his filing shows — and may reinforce a view among consumer groups and Democratic lawmakers that he could have conflicting interests as a Wall Street regulator. Although he is expected to broadly support the agency’s enforcement efforts, he has made statements suggesting that he will probably move to ease at least some of the Obama-era regulations weighing on Wall Street clients.

443,"Everything had to be reinvented for the 2017 Whitney Biennial — the first to take place in the new riverside home of the Whitney Museum. But then, this leading showcase of contemporary American art feels refreshed in other ways, too. In a generational shift, the Whitney has chosen two young curators for this always anticipated exhibition: Christopher Y. Lew, 36, and Mia Locks, 34. It’s also the first time that the biennial’s curators are both people of color. After months on the road, they have boiled down the art of the last few years into a survey that, for all its energy, doesn’t overwhelm the museum. The biennial will always be a show people like to fight about. But before the arguments and debates begin, let me tell you about a walk I took with the pair through the in-progress installation. What follows is a user’s guide to the 78th Whitney Biennial, which opens to the public on March 17. (My colleague Roberta Smith will publish her review on that date.) The show is ambitious, but it’s tight. There are 63 participants, which puts it back on the scale of the 2010 and 2012 biennials after the hundred-artist-plus blowout of 2014. Though it occupies only two floors of the new building, and much of the lobby, the exhibition enjoys more square footage than in its previous, Marcel Breuer-designed home. The curators have also capitalized on the Whitney’s enviable cityside balconies, which will feature art both massive (a suite of red laminated glass boxes by the West Coast veteran Larry Bell) and invisible (a sound work by the young artist Zarouhie Abdalian). Even the floor-to-ceiling windows of the building’s fifth floor have been overtaken by a riotously colorful composition from the artist Raúl de Nieves, which will be visible from the street after nightfall.

The departure of some of the group’s leadership does not mean that the battle to take Raqqa will be easy, the official said. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 fighters remain in the city. To provide more firepower for the looming battle, a United States Marine artillery unit is being deployed in Syria, mimicking the approach the United States has taken to support Iraqi troops fighting to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But the flight of some Islamic State leaders indicates that their loss of Raqqa would not signal the end of their struggle to preserve their pseudo-state. The group’s fighters are expected to fight on in Deir al-Zour, a Syrian province south of Raqqa, and in Iraqi towns along the Euphrates River, as well as to try to administer their self-proclaimed caliphate from those places. A detailed assessment of Islamic State fighting capabilities was provided by the American defense official, who could not be identified under the ground rules for the Pentagon briefing.

The three other websites in the Gothamist network — in Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles — will include DNAinfo stories when relevant and may be used as launchpads for future DNAinfo sites, according to a statement from Gothamist. “By joining forces with Gothamist, DNAinfo will be able to do an even better job of fulfilling its longstanding mission, which is to bring people the most relevant and interesting news and information about their neighborhoods,” Mr. Ricketts said in a statement. The move represents a significant consolidation of two of the more visible players in the local news business in New York City: Gothamist, which helped shape the mold for local news aggregation and coverage on the internet when it was founded in 2003, and DNAinfo, a start-up that, after its founding in 2009, moved aggressively to fill a void as the city’s newspapers cut back on local news coverage.

447,"To the Editor: Soon after the election, one of us raised concerns about Donald Trump’s fitness for office, based on the alarming symptoms of mental instability he had shown during his campaign. Since then, this concern has grown. Even within the space of a few weeks, the demands of the presidency have magnified his erratic patterns of behavior. In particular, we are struck by his repeated failure to distinguish between reality and fantasy, and his outbursts of rage when his fantasies are contradicted. Without any demonstrable evidence, he repeatedly resorts to paranoid claims of conspiracy. Most recently, in response to suggestions of contact between his campaign and agents of the Russian government, he has issued tirades against the press as an “enemy of the people” and accusations without proof that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, engaged in partisan surveillance against him. We are in no way offering a psychiatric diagnosis, which would be unwise to attempt from a distance. Nevertheless, as psychiatrists we feel obliged to express our alarm. We fear that when faced with a crisis, President Trump will lack the judgment to respond rationally. The military powers entrusted to him endanger us all. We urge our elected representatives to take the necessary steps to protect us from this dangerous president. JUDITH L. HERMAN

In a segment that she calls “Meet the Commenters,” Ms. Silverberg highlights the unconversant readers who troll the site’s social channels, asking where they can find the (nonexistent) print edition, questioning the objectivity of its “reporting” and more. “We have certain articles that sort of eclipse our normal readership, and that’s when we’ll start to get a flooding in of people who a) don’t understand what it is that we do and are not aware that it’s satire, or b) are very hateful of whatever idea we’re trying to communicate,” Ms. Silverberg, 26, said after the show, which she hosts.

His remarks on Thursday, which were more categorical than similar testimony before the Senate, may also put him in conflict with laws and regulations that the E.P.A. is charged with enforcing. His statements appear to signal that the Trump administration intends not only to roll back President Barack Obama’s climate change policies, but also to wage a vigorous attack on their underlying legal and scientific basis.

The goal is to shift about $5 billion toward hiring scores of additional agents for Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as toward infrastructure to support a crackdown on illegal immigration at the border. A significant portion of the money would go toward erecting a wall along the border with Mexico, one of President Trump’s signature campaign promises. To fund those efforts, though, the plan would seek significant reductions in other areas, including a 14 percent cut to the Coast Guard’s $9.1 billion budget and 11 percent cuts to both the T.S.A. and FEMA. The three agencies have played high-profile roles in the Department of Homeland Security’s post-Sept. 11 security architecture.

Many disabled people, hepatitis patients and opioid addicts, among others, would no longer receive treatments that they do now. Care to guess where the billions of dollars in savings from these cuts would go instead? They would go largely to the richest 1 percent of households, those earning at least $700,000 a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. A disproportionate amount of the savings would go to the richest of the rich — those earning in the millions. The Republican health care bill is, in no small measure, a tax cut for the wealthy.

The Salton Sea, straddling the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, is the latest incarnation of a body of water that has been drying and refilling over eons with water from the Colorado River. Native Americans once fished and camped on Lake Cahuilla, a prehistoric and larger version. The Salton Sea was born in the early 1900s after a canal burst sent water from the Colorado flooding into the valley over a period of two years. Beginning in the 1950s, entrepreneurs transformed it into a tourist mecca, building marinas and resorts. There were beauty pageants and boat races. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra visited. But in time, runoff pollution, drought and blistering heat conspired to end the fun. As the saline lake evaporated, its salt concentration soared, killing fish en masse. The blooming and decomposition of algae had a powerful stench. Today, the Salton Sea is surrounded by abandoned buildings. For people fighting to revitalize it, there are two big concerns, said Michael Cohen, a researcher with the Pacific Institute, a water-policy think tank.

461,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, after a halting start, is now marshaling the full power of his office to win over holdout conservatives and waffling senators to support the House Republicans’ replacement for the Affordable Care Act. There are East Room meetings, evening dinners and sumptuous lunches — even a White House bowling soiree. Mr. Trump is deploying the salesman tactics he sharpened over several decades in New York real estate. His pitch: He is fully behind the bill to scotch President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, but he is open to negotiations on the details. In so doing, Mr. Trump is plunging personally into his first major legislative fight, getting behind a bill that has been denounced by many health care providers and scorned by his base on the right. If it fails, Mr. Trump will find it difficult not to shoulder some of the blame. “He understands the power he has as president to drive the legislative process,” said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina and a top House vote counter, who was part of a meeting with Mr. Trump in the East Room on Tuesday. “He made it clear that this is his priority, that it has to get done, and he made clear that he has to get it through before he moves on tax reform,” Mr. McHenry added.

464,"President Donald J. Trump has yet to put his mark on the federal budget, but in a possible harbinger of leaner times to come, officials in New York City are already contending with declines in federal financing for programs that assist some of the city’s poorest residents. Two city agencies that provide subsidized housing were told in letters sent last month that they would receive less from the federal government. In all, the funding shortfalls at the two agencies, the New York City Housing Authority and the Housing Preservation and Development agency, could total more than $58 million by the end of the year. Mayor Bill de Blasio has for weeks insisted that the city would not make pre-emptive adjustments to its budget to account for what could amount to major cuts to federal funding for city programs. New York City received about 10 percent of its budget, or about $8.8 billion, from the federal government in the 2017 fiscal year. “We also are not going to say to folks in Washington, go ahead and cut us because we have so much money to put in — we don’t,” the mayor said Wednesday during an unrelated news conference about the city’s coming ferry service. “Our reserves could be eaten up very, very quickly if the magnitude of budget cuts that’s possible here was to play out.” The decline in funding to the housing agencies does not affect only New York and was not initiated by the Trump administration. Nor does it represent a budget cut in the usual sense: a new federal budget has yet to be introduced in Congress. The federal government and all its programs are currently operating on the basis of a continuing resolution, which keeps the funding levels flat. That translates in some cases into a de facto decline because of rising costs. But rather than a simple cut, the decline in funding received by New York City was the result of a new formula adopted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington in anticipation of what is likely to be a dramatic change in the federal budget from a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.

465,"A new Israeli law, approved Monday, will bar entry to any foreigner who supports the B.D.S. movement (boycott, divestment and sanctions) against Israel for its occupation of the West Bank. It’s a strong statement by the Israeli right wing, intended to characterize supporters of the movement as enemies of Israel. But it changes little on the ground. Israeli border authorities already had the authority to turn back people the government deemed hostile to the Jewish state, which they did most recently with Omar Shakir, an American working for Human Rights Watch. No doubt there are haters of Israel among B.D.S. supporters. But there are also many strong supporters of the Israeli state, including many American Jews, who ardently oppose the occupation of the West Bank and who boycott products of the Israeli settlements in occupied territories. Publicly declaring all of them to be haters of Israel is unjust and counterproductive. Counterproductive because the law projects an image of Israel as hostile to anyone who disagrees with the occupation and settlements, encouraging louder calls for boycotts every time a visitor is turned back at the airport. In fact, the occupation has been a source of passionate debate within Israel itself and in the Jewish diaspora from the time Israel first took control of the territories in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Many Israelis who are fully devoted to their country believe the occupation, and the settlement construction on it, undermine the democratic ideals on which Israel was founded and thus pose a threat to the state. As for foreign critics, one of Israel’s most compelling responses has always been to urge them to come see the land for themselves. Visiting the country, witnessing the challenge of ensuring its security, traveling in Israel and the Palestinian territories and participating in open and impassioned debates may not persuade visitors to support the settlements, but it will demonstrate that Israel is not afraid of allowing people to see the problems and conflicts firsthand. The new law, by contrast, proclaims, “You’re with us or against us.” The United States, Israel’s strongest military supporter, has consistently criticized the building of settlements in the occupied territories as detrimental to seeking a lasting peace. Even President Trump publicly asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the Israeli leader’s visit to Washington last month to “hold back on the settlements.” Unfortunately, the Israelis who called for barring advocates of B.D.S. seem emboldened by the Trump administration. An American president who has closed doors to Muslim refugees may not be in a position to question the Israeli law. But it should be condemned by all who value Israel’s tradition of debate and dissent and who support the search for a lasting peace.

466,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Sept. 17, 1862, was the bloodiest battle day in United States history. More Americans — some 3,600 — died as Northern and Southern armies clashed at the Battle of Antietam, in western Maryland, than on any other single day before or since, even more than on Sept. 11. One hundred and fifty years later, as the National Park Service commemorated the terrible loss at Antietam, I stood on the stage in a large tent on the battlefield before several hundred eager tourists, curious locals and enthusiastic Civil War buffs of every age and origin. We had gathered to discuss a documentary made by Ric Burns based on a book I had written about death and the Civil War, a chronicle of the experiences of more than 700,000 Americans who died between 1861 and 1865, leaving a nation of mourners in a world profoundly altered by the scale of such human tragedy. The audience posed questions to Ric and me about history, about war, about patriotic sacrifice, about American identity, about the meanings of life and death and human mortality — and about how all those things were both different and the same across the century and a half that separated us from our Civil War ancestors. Ric’s film, and the moving discussion it generated, were made possible by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Reports suggest that the Trump administration’s coming budget will defund the endowment. I would wager that few readers of this newspaper, and probably few Americans anywhere, are untouched by an N.E.H.-sponsored project or program. In 1990, for example, Ric Burns and his brother Ken produced an 11-and-a-half-hour documentary on the Civil War that was broadcast over five consecutive nights and seen by more than 40 million viewers. For much of the nation, it was an early form of binge-watching. The humanities endowment made that film possible.

468,"The relationship between a new president and the intelligence agencies that serve him can be difficult in the best of times. But it’s hard to imagine a more turbulent transition than the current one, which has been marred by assertions that the administration has tried to both politicize and marginalize intelligence gathering. No White House likes it when intelligence agencies — such as the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency — deliver bad news, or when that information undercuts the executive’s preferred policies or political positions. But I can’t remember another White House so quick to dismiss those agencies’ judgments or so willing to discredit them as dishonest or incompetent. We’ve seen presidential tweets with “intelligence” in accusatory quotation marks, a kind of dog whistle that equates intelligence assessments with news reporting that the president condemns as “fake.” In addition to lumping the intelligence agencies in with the “dishonest” mainstream media, the president has compared his espionage services to Russians, Nazis and WikiLeaks. Last weekend, Mr. Trump accused President Barack Obama of ordering phones at Trump Tower tapped during the 2016 campaign, a claim so outrageous that James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, denied it a day later. (So did the F.B.I. director, James Comey, according to this paper.) And last month, Mr. Trump blamed the intelligence community, along with the press, for the downfall of his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, saying on Twitter that “information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes and @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (N.S.A. and F.B.I.?).” As the former director of both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., I know that leaks are a real problem that can endanger national security. But why would the administration reflexively and punitively blame its own services for leaks, since we do not yet know who is responsible for them? The president has asserted that the leaking will stop “because now we have our people in,” a choice of words that creates more than a little shudder in the ranks of intelligence professionals, who prefer to work in the background for presidents, Democratic or Republican.

Nothing seems impossible any more. That includes the most towering suspicion of all: that Trump’s team colluded in some way with Russia to interfere with the U.S. election. This is the central issue that we must remain focused on. There are a lot of dots here, and the challenge is how to connect them. Be careful: Democrats should avoid descending into the kind of conspiratorial mind-set that led some Republicans to assume Hillary Clinton was a criminal about to be indicted or to conjure sex slaves belonging to her in a Washington pizza restaurant. Coincidences happen, and I think there has been too much focus on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, not enough on Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager. Here are 10 crucial dots: 1. President Trump and his aides have repeatedly and falsely denied ties to Russia. USA Today counted at least 20 denials. In fact, we now know that there were contacts by at least a half-dozen people in the Trump circle with senior Russian officials. 2. There’s no obvious reason for all these contacts. When Vice President Mike Pence was asked on Jan. 15 if there had been contacts between the Trump campaign and Kremlin officials, he answered: “Of course not. Why would there be?” We don’t know either, Mr. Vice President. 3. There were unexplained communications between a Trump Organization computer server and Russia’s Alfa Bank, which has ties to President Vladimir Putin. These included 2,700 “look-up” messages to initiate communications, and some investigators found all this deeply suspicious. Others thought there might be an innocent explanation, such as spam.

471,"Reader, guess when this paragraph was written: These words appeared in The New York Times Magazine in May, 1970. The quote comes from Kevin Phillips, the originator of Richard Nixon’s election-winning Southern strategy. In fact, the problems that plagued the Democratic Party 50 years ago continue to do so. The 2016 election and its aftermath have produced turmoil on the right while once again forcing into public view worrisome long-term trends in the Democratic electorate. On Feb. 27, The Conversation, an academic website, published “The Democratic Party is Facing a Demographic Crisis,” by Musa al-Gharbi, a Lazarsfeld fellow in sociology at Columbia. Al-Gharbi challenges a widespread Democratic assumption (succinctly articulated in a recent book by Ruy Teixeira, “The Optimistic Leftist”) that guided the two Obama campaigns as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 bid. From that vantage point, the party is the beneficiary of demographic destiny: A swelling population of single women, knowledge workers, minorities and millennials guarantees the emergence of a majority left coalition. Instead of a “Rising American Electorate,” al-Gharbi describes a party on a steady downward trajectory over the last three presidential elections. “In 2008, Barack Obama beat John McCain by 192 Electoral College votes and 8.54 million popular votes,” al-Gharbi writes: Based on his examination of exit poll data, al-Gharbi points out that His conclusion: One of the mainstays of Democratic optimism is the conviction that a growing body of young voters — more liberal than their elders — will soon dominate elections, just as the baby boomers did before them. In point of fact, however, millennials are slowly, incrementally becoming a less reliable Democratic constituency. Ronald Brownstein, writing in the Atlantic, found “there’s no guarantee Democrats can reap big benefits from millennial mistrust of Trump.” As Brownstein notes: Clinton did less well than Obama in 2012 among millennial voters, winning them by 19 points compared to Obama’s 23-point margin.

472,"Complaining that the United States has one of the world’s highest corporate tax levels, President Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly vowed to shrink it. Yet if the level is so high, why have so many companies’ income tax bills added up to zero? That’s what a new analysis of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies that earned more than $3.8 trillion in profits showed. Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group in Washington, found that 100 of them — nearly 40 percent — paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. Eighteen, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E, incurred a total federal income tax bill of less than zero over the entire eight-year period — meaning they received rebates. The institute used the companies’ own regulatory filings to compute their tax rates. Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe. The institute’s report cites these examples: Multinational corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Abbott Laboratories and Coca-Cola have ways of booking profits overseas, out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. (Those companies were not among the 258 whose rates were calculated by the institute, which said it could not verify the breakdown of their profits between the United States and other countries.) Citing evidence in the report, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, introduced a bill on Thursday to eliminate tax loopholes that encourage companies to shift activities offshore. “The truth is that we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations,” Senator Sanders said. “Offshore tax haven abuse has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now the ‘home’ to more than 18,000 corporations.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/business/economy/corporate-tax-report.html?searchResultPosition=48

But in recent years, the once largely white, working-class community has seen a steady influx of Lebanese Muslim families, many who say they have relocated from Sydney for a better and safer life. Among them are members of the Zahab family. Now one of them, Haisem Zahab, a 42-year-old electrician, is accused of using the internet to try to help the Islamic State develop a guided missile. Officials suspect that some of his relatives traveled to Syria to join the extremist group, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. The allegations about the Zahab family have rattled many residents of this town, who have long taken pride in its peaceful multiculturalism. They have also stoked some of the worst fears about homegrown links to terrorism in a country that is grappling with immigration policy and labor shortages. “One argument developing is that Muslims cannot be trusted, they are all bad, and with so many in our town, it was only a matter of time before trouble raised its head,” Craig Thomson, editor of The Young Witness, the local newspaper, wrote in an opinion column after Mr. Zahab’s arrest. “The other point put forward is that hatred is not the way to handle this situation and one man’s actions should not condemn the entire town’s Muslim population.” The case is playing out as Australia contends with the same nationalist, anti-immigrant forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the American presidency and that prompted voters in Britain to approve a withdrawal from the European Union. Visiting Australia last year, Mutuma Ruteere, the United Nations special rapporteur on racism, condemned Australian politicians as engaging in “xenophobic hate speech,” and likened the country’s mood to nationalist ideologies brewing in Europe and the United States.

But the holy grail of leaks remains elusive: President Trump’s tax returns. As taxpayers scramble to file their own returns and Republicans push to overhaul the tax code, attention has shifted back to Mr. Trump’s taxes and how he could benefit from the sweeping legislation he hopes to sign. Looking for the ultimate leak, opponents of Mr. Trump have wondered aloud how it could be that top intelligence agencies are suddenly fonts of classified information while the staid tax collector remains hermetically sealed. “The American people deserve to know what conflicts of interest are hiding in Trump’s taxes,” said Delvone Michael, a member of the Tax March executive committee, which is organizing a mass demonstration to call for the release of the tax returns next month. “Every president in a generation has released his taxes. Trump must too.” Mr. Trump broke with 40 years of tradition as a presidential candidate, declining to make his tax information public on the grounds that he was undergoing an I.R.S. audit. The government has made clear that is, in fact, no impediment to release, but since corporations like the Trump Organization are audited constantly, the excuse will not disappear, and he is not expected ever to release his returns willingly. So how might Mr. Trump’s returns come to light? If you’re thinking about a rogue I.R.S. agent or Russian cybertheft, don’t count on it. After one of Mr. Trump’s advisers said in January that he had no intention of ever releasing his returns, WikiLeaks accused him of breaching a campaign promise and called for leakers to send the filings its way for publication. Similar calls bubbled up last week when The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump hopes to sharply cut the funding of the I.R.S., and critics on social media urged people inside the agency to take revenge by distributing his records.

The endowment gave $14.5 million to 419 organizations in New York City in the fiscal year 2016, according to a study by the city comptroller’s office. That was more than 10 percent of all N.E.A. grants that year, making New York City groups the top recipients of such grants in the country. “The only real consistent funding that sustains our company is the government-funding sources,” said Emily Joy Weiner, artistic director of Houses on the Moon Theater Company, which is based in Manhattan. The group received a $10,000 grant from the N.E.A. for the play “The Assignment,” which focuses on gun violence and will debut next month. The grant was about 8 percent of the cost of putting on the production, she said. The group also received funding from the New York State Council on the Arts, which in turn gets a large annual grant from the federal endowment. “Without those sources our company would never have been able to continue to grow and sustain itself,” Ms. Weiner said.

This season of the anthology show, which has its premiere on Sunday night, has an unexpected setting, given the big-agriculture theme: It takes place not out West, but in North Carolina, where tens of thousands of Spanish-speaking migrant workers help bring in crops of fruits and vegetables. Structurally, the series uses one crime to illuminate an array of story lines and issues, and this season eventually follows that template, but it also suggests that the bigger crime is the exploitation and poor treatment of workers on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. In the show’s first two seasons, Regina King won Emmys for her work, and she is strong again in Season 3 as a social worker who wants very much to conceive a child. But she may have competition in the accolade department this time from Benito Martinez, playing Luis, a father who makes his way — illegally — to North Carolina from Mexico to search for his son. Luis knows that the young man worked in the fields before the family stopped hearing from him, so though Luis is not a farmhand, he masquerades as one, discovering a world where workers are trapped by debts to those who smuggled them and provide their wretched housing. John Ridley, the series’s creator, has never tiptoed around the issues he attacks, and he’s particularly blunt here, showing brutality by the overseers who manage the workers, sexual assaults on female migrants and more. In among the foreign migrant workers is the American-born Connor (Coy Henson). View him as Mr. Ridley’s response to the argument that illegal immigrants are taking jobs from American workers. Connor, a drug addict trying to get clean, can’t handle the hard labor, and he’s pretty much the only Caucasian in the fields. Americans are not exactly lined up to fill the backbreaking, low-paying jobs. The contractors who provide workers to the big farms have to lie and obfuscate to get anyone, legal or illegal, to jump in their trucks.

479,"President Trump’s executive order banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries faced a new front of opposition from the states on Thursday, as the attorney general of Washington announced that he would seek to block the order from taking effect next week. Backed by several fellow Democratic attorneys general, Bob Ferguson of Washington said he would ask a federal district judge, James Robart, to extend an order freezing the first version of Mr. Trump’s travel ban and apply it to the updated restrictions the White House unveiled on Monday. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Ferguson acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s updated order was less sweeping than its predecessor. But he argued that the travel restrictions remained “effectively a Muslim ban,” with many of the same legal weaknesses as the first version. “It’s fair to say that the revised executive order does narrow the scope of who’s impacted by it in an adverse way,” Mr. Ferguson said. “But that does not mean it has cured its constitutional problems.” His announcement in Seattle opened a new phase in the legal battle over Mr. Trump’s attempt to sharply limit travel to the United States from a group of majority-Muslim countries — including Syria, Libya and Iran — as a collection of Democratic-leaning states that attacked the first ban increasingly mass their efforts behind Mr. Ferguson’s litigation. Among the attorneys general backing Mr. Ferguson on Thursday were Eric T. Schneiderman of New York and Maura Healey of Massachusetts, both of whom dropped separate litigation against Mr. Trump to join Mr. Ferguson’s suit, and Ellen F. Rosenblum of Oregon. Mr. Ferguson and his colleagues, along with Attorney General Lori Swanson of Minnesota, are expected to file updated complaints aimed at taking down the new travel order in the coming days.

More worrisome, perhaps, is the question of who else knows about these security weaknesses. Hackings are rarely discovered in a secure facility accessed only by spooks. They are more often than not found in the online bazaar of hackers and cyberweapons dealers trading security information for fun and profit. And the C.I.A. is hardly the only intelligence agency looking to acquire that information. It is safe to say that intelligence and law enforcement authorities from most countries — not to mention a wide array of hackers — are on the lookout for ways to break into smartphones and other security devices. So what should you do about it? The Times’s Brian X. Chen offers a few tips: First, update your software if you are using an iPhone or an Android phone. Most of the breaches described in the documents appeared to target older software. On your personal computers, also make sure you have the latest operating system and antivirus software. You should also update the firmware in your router. The bad news? If hackers can really turn Samsung TVs into monitoring devices, there is no easy solution. Samsung says it is looking into the issue. More tech news: Uber says it will stop employees from using a program called Greyball to thwart regulators. In the wake of a New York Times article about the tool, which appeared to allow drivers to avoid officers in Oregon, the company said it was conducting a review of how it is used.

485,"JERUSALEM — After much national hand-wringing, four new judges were appointed to Israel’s 15-member highest court late last month. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, who comes from a right-wing religious party and has long championed changes to the court, considered the appointments a victory: One of the new judges is a settler; another is an Orthodox Jewish woman; a third is also considered a conservative. (The fourth judge is an Arab Israeli.) The new judicial appointments, Ms. Shaked argued, “reflect the human and legal diversity” that she said had “until now has been so lacking on our highest court.” After decades dominating politics, the Israeli right had finally broken through into this bastion of unapologetic liberalism. Now the right has the opportunity to prove that it can run the country effectively without being fettered by a liberal court. Engineering this political earthquake required some serious politicking. A nine-member committee selects the judges for the High Court of Justice. Four members are politicians, two of them ministers and two members of the Knesset. Three are sitting judges on the court. Two are representatives of the Bar Association. To get the conservative judges added, Ms. Shaked cunningly forged a coalition between the politicians and the lawyers. When the judges on the committee tried to block most of the new appointees, she made them back down by threatening to pass legislation that would in effect cancel their power to veto candidates they highly dislike. The High Court had been a target of right-wing complaints for more than two decades. In the 1990s, a liberal-minded court began interpreting Basic Laws — Israel’s partial substitute for a constitution — more expansively. The court also became more aggressive in inhibiting government actions. The new approach, labeled a “constitutional revolution” by Aharon Barak, then the chief justice, aimed to fill a void left by Israel’s lack of a constitution. The timing couldn’t have been more out of step with the direction of the country. As the court was becoming more liberal and interventionist, Israel’s voters and politicians were moving rightward. As liberals lost elections, they increasingly turned to the courts. Meanwhile, judges became a constant irritant to the conservatives who won elections only to see their agendas constrained by the judiciary. Critics said the court was forcing its liberal values onto Israel’s elected officials. For example, in 2013 the court rejected a government policy enabling the state to detain without trial illegal immigrants for three years. For years, settlers and their supporters have accused the High Court of going easy on Arabs who build without proper licenses, while being tough on settlers who do the same thing. Ms. Shaked and many of her peers in the government harshly criticized the court in these cases.

486,"FRANKFURT — Central bankers like to portray themselves as being aloof from the hurly-burly of politics, coolly assessing the economic data as they ponder whether to add a jolt of stimulus or take some away. But with populism on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, opinion polls have arguably become one of the European Central Bank’s most important sources of data points. Faced with a series of national elections in which anti-euro candidates play prominent roles, Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, mounted a spirited counteroffensive on Thursday. He portrayed the currency as the key to European prosperity and even took an implicit jab at the protectionist rhetoric of President Trump. “Open trade has been the pillar of world prosperity for many, many years,” Mr. Draghi said. Although it made no major changes to monetary policy on Thursday, the bank is under increasing pressure to begin withdrawing the stimulus program that has prevailed for a decade. That task, delicate in the best of times, is even more difficult in the charged political atmosphere that permeates not only Europe but also the United States and the rest of the world. Some political candidates are questioning the whole idea of a united Europe and the European Central Bank’s fundamental reason for being. The situation raises the stakes whenever the bank makes a decision. Britain, which was never in the eurozone, has voted to leave the European Union.

487,"WASHINGTON — Republicans are rarely as exercised as when they are fighting with themselves. And as the House debates how to best dismantle the Affordable Care Act, a familiar array of interest groups with deep pockets, incensed talk radio hosts and online agitators is again assuming its posture of aggression toward the House Republican leadership. “Swampcare,” the writer and radio personality Erick Erickson scoffed at the new American Health Care Act, the culmination of seven years of promises to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. “Obamacare 2.0,” declared Breitbart.com. “RINOCARE,” Mark Levin wrote on Twitter, using the acronym for Republican in Name Only. Political groups backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and other powerful players on the right, such as Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, have come out quickly and strongly against the bill. Some have threatened to punish lawmakers by docking their conservative ratings on the influential “scorecards” they distribute to voters. Activists are already swarming Capitol Hill and demanding that Congress take a harder line and pass a repeal measure that would leave no trace of the Affordable Care Act. “I feel lied to,” said Anna Beavon Gravely, the deputy state director of the North Carolina chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed group that is funding a grass-roots push against Republicans in Congress who want to stop short of an outright repeal. “We trusted you because you said you were going to do something about this.

Huntsman Jr. has accepted President Trump’s offer to be ambassador to Russia, people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday, taking on a diplomatic assignment that would be challenging in the best of times but is more so now, given the questions swirling around the Trump campaign and its links to Russia. Mr. Huntsman, a former Republican governor of Utah, served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011. Experts said he will need his political dexterity to navigate Moscow at a time when Mr. Trump has called for better ties even as Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election remains under intense scrutiny. “Not only is there this mess with the investigation that will complicate his assignment, there’s a lot of incoherence within the Trump administration regarding its policy toward Russia,” said Michael A. McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. The F.B.I. is known to have examined possible contacts between Russia and Trump advisers. Congress also has opened an inquiry. While Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign to defrost the relationship with Moscow after the chill of the Obama years, senior officials in his cabinet have so far signaled less change than continuity. The administration, for example, has said it will not lift sanctions until Russia withdraws from Crimea and stops destabilizing Ukraine. The prospect of further investigations into Russia and the Trump campaign may make it politically impossible for Mr. Trump to pursue a new start.

491,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s spokesman on Wednesday deflected concerns that a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act had yet to be scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office by questioning the agency’s track record. “If you’re looking at the C.B.O. for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said. “I mean, they were way, way off the last time in every aspect of how they scored and projected Obamacare.” “If you look at the number of people that they projected that would be on Obamacare, they are off by millions,” he added. “But, the idea that that is any kind of authority based on the track record that occurred last time is a little far-fetched.” Mr. Spicer has a point that the C.B.O.’s projections for how many people would gain insurance under the health law were “off by millions.” But imprecision in Affordable Care Act projections does not give an accurate impression of the C.B.O.’s overall track record. The agency, created in 1974, released its analysis of the completed version of the health care law in March 2010. It estimated 21 million people would be enrolled in public marketplaces by 2016. The year ended with 11.5 million enrollees. But according to a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, a health care research group, the C.B.O.’s projections for the Affordable Care Act were more in line with what actually happened than four other prominent analyses from 2010.

492,"With all the attention paid to President Trump’s lightning-rod secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, and her advocacy for private school vouchers, little public notice has been paid to the action on education in Congress — where lawmakers have broader power than Ms. DeVos to make changes to the nation’s school system. Now, Congress has done exactly that, voting to repeal crucial regulations associated with the Every Student Succeeds Act, one of President Barack Obama’s final legislative achievements. When Mr. Obama signed the act in December 2015, many Democrats and Republicans alike celebrated the supposed end of what they saw as an era of federal overreach into local schools. The measure, known as ESSA, took a more collaborative approach than its predecessor, No Child Left Behind. Many critics viewed No Child, passed under President George W. Bush, as well as Mr. Obama’s first-term education policies, as punitive. The policies pushed for test scores to be used to remove underperforming teachers and to shut down struggling schools. They were also unpopular because they led to an explosion in the number of tests students took each year. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, children still have to take standardized tests in math, reading and science, and schools still need to report on the progress of at-risk groups, like disabled students, nonwhite students and those learning English. But fewer consequences are now tied to low test scores and more emphasis is placed on holding schools accountable for providing access to advanced classes and for reducing student suspension rates. In addition, states are now able to come up with their own plans for how to intervene in failing schools. Mr. Obama called the bill a bipartisan “Christmas miracle.” The National Council of La Raza, a Latino-rights organization, gave ESSA’s two Senate co-sponsors, Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, an award for their work on behalf of students learning English.

According to a recent Tax Policy Center report, under the Trump plan, “about 70 percent of benefits go to families with at least $100,000 and 25 percent of benefits go to families with at least $200,000.” Low-income families would have to wait until the end of the year for a refundable tax credit — which, according to your article, could be as little as $10 — something that households with limited cash flow can ill afford. The Trump plan offers little or no improvement over the existing Child and Dependent Care Credit. If we really want to increase the supply of high-quality, affordable child care, we should focus on urging Congress to allocate funds to improve staff salaries and benefits and adult-to-child ratios, increase oversight, and provide substantial direct subsidies to low-income families to cover their child care expenses.

494,"Faced with an American president who has shown higher regard for President Vladimir Putin of Russia than for NATO or the European Union, European leaders are drawing up defense plans that rely more on themselves, in case they can’t rely on the United States. President François Hollande of France warned on Sunday that Mr. Trump’s ignorance of Europe “means we must prove to him the E.U.’s political cohesion, its economic weight and its strategic autonomy.” Mr. Hollande invited Britain, despite its departure from the bloc, to join Europe’s defense. On Monday, European Union ministers agreed that military training operations underway in Africa should have a headquarters in Brussels, a cost-saving move that is also a step toward the permanent European command structure called for in the union’s 2009 Lisbon Treaty. More troubling, though, is talk of nuclear expansion. After Mr. Trump’s election in November, Roderich Kiesewetter, a foreign policy spokesman in Germany’s ruling party, warned that, in the absence of nuclear protection by the United States, “Europe still needs nuclear protection for deterrent purposes,” and that he would look to nuclear powers France and Britain to provide it. And Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party, said in interview published last month that strategic autonomy means Europe “would have to be able to keep up with Russia” on the nuclear front, raising the prospect of a nuclear arms race between Europe and Russia. As long as NATO’s tactical nuclear weapons remain in Europe, there is little possibility of Europe creating another nuclear deterrent. Yet, despite recent assurances from Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the Trump administration remains committed to a strong NATO, Mr. Trump’s alarming statements questioning America’s commitment to the alliance and his ignorance of the treaties that underpin nuclear security have unnerved Europe’s leaders. “Europe cannot be naïve and has to take care of its own security,” states a paper released by the European Commission this month, in laying out scenarios for Europe’s future. “Being a ‘soft power’ is no longer powerful enough when force can prevail over rules.” Europe seems to see Mr. Trump as a threat to stability forged through rules. For the sake of Europe, the United States, and our collective security, Mr. Trump must show that he understands the limits of unilateral action.

497,"Having reached the top of a major corporation and amassed a fortune, chief executives often wonder: What’s next? After Donald J. Trump, the answer may well be a run for the White House. Mr. Trump had no political or military experience, the traditional routes to high political office. Virtually his only qualification was his business career, and a checkered one at that, considering his own brush with personal bankruptcy. “There is this sense that if Trump got it, why shouldn’t they?” said David Gergen, co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and an adviser to four presidents. “They’ve been more successful, they have more experience, and they’ve run a public company, which is more equivalent to what a president does than a private company” like the Trump Organization. Stu Loeser, once the press secretary for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who considered a presidential run last year, concurred. “If you run a company that has employed tens of thousands of people, and generated lots of profit and been undeniably successful, and you look at a sitting president who, to be honest, a lot of business people don’t have much respect for, you think, why not me?” he said. Mr. Loeser now runs his own strategic consulting firm, and told me he has clients who are business executives considering a run for high public office. “I can’t tell you their names, obviously,” he said. Boldface corporate names widely discussed as contenders for the next Democratic presidential nomination include chief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com, along with Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, and Oprah Winfrey, chairwoman and chief executive of Harpo Inc., which owns half of the Oprah Winfrey Network.

498,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s weekend Twitter message asserting that former President Barack Obama had tapped his phones forced the White House into ever more verbal contortions on Thursday as aides struggled to defend the president’s charge. In the latest iteration, the Justice Department declined to comment on whether Mr. Trump is — or is not — the subject of an investigation. “No comment,” a department official said. In normal circumstances, a “no comment” from the Justice Department on the status of any investigation would be standard practice. And certainly there has never been any indication that Mr. Trump himself was the target of inquiries by the department and congressional intelligence committees into possible contacts between his associates and members of the Russian government. But by venting his ire against Mr. Obama in a series of Twitter messages at dawn on Saturday, Mr. Trump awkwardly raised that possibility himself, since any wiretapping could have been the direct result of an investigation targeting him. One presidential tweet in particular — “how low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process” — clearly portrayed Mr. Trump as the victim of surveillance. Thursday’s verbal gymnastics actually started on Wednesday when Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, insisted to reporters that the president is not the target of a counterintelligence investigation involving contacts with Russia. He said, flatly, that “there is no reason to believe there is any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice.” That prompted Thursday’s comments from a Justice Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. The official said that Mr. Spicer had not relied on any information from the department in denying the existence of an investigation targeting the president.

On the day the threat arrived, the congregation of Masjid Bilal Ibn Rabah had planned a potluck dinner. Earlier that afternoon — March 4 — the president of the mosque in Lexington, Ky., found an envelope in the mail from Sheffield, England. Inside was a green index card that read, “An explosive device will be placed at your mosque very soon.” Waheedah Muhammad, who worships at the mosque, was shocked when she heard about the threat. The congregation is not used to threats and has a strong relationship with the surrounding community. Prior to the threat, neighbors and others had sent the mosque notes of support and donations — a Sunday school class even sent the mosque love notes. “It was just so bizarre that this would happen here where we have a sense — maybe a false sense — of security,” said Ms. Muhammad, who is also the Kentucky chairwoman of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Masjid Bilal Ibn Rabah is one of more than a dozen mosques to receive threats since January, according to reports collected by the council. Threats, vandalism and other forms of discrimination targeting mosques in the United States have risen in recent years, from 39 in 2014 to 139 in 2016. The council has also found a more than 50 percent increase in incidents of bias against American Muslims between 2015 and 2016.

501,"To construct an “America First” budget, the initial trade-off for President Trump was fairly obvious: The military and veterans would get more of what they want or need, while diplomats and foreign countries would have to make do with less. But in his first spending blueprint since taking office, Mr. Trump also made choices demonstrating that parts of America will be more first than others — and some of the budget losers, it turns out, may be some of the very constituencies that have been most supportive of the new president during his improbable rise to power. While border guards will have more prisons to lock up unauthorized immigrants, rural communities will lose grants and loans to build water facilities and financing to keep their airports open. As charter schools are bolstered, after-school and summer programs will lose money. As law enforcement agents get more help to fight the opioid epidemic, lower-income Americans will have less access to home energy aid, job training programs and legal services. The budget proposal that will be unveiled by Mr. Trump’s White House on Thursday represents the most dramatic shift in how national resources are divvied up of any presidential spending plan since Ronald Reagan. In his rhetoric both before the election and since his inauguration, Mr. Trump outlined a vision of a country getting back to basics, tapping into a visceral sense among many Americans that Washington has been too generous with taxpayer money spent wastefully both at home and abroad while doing nothing to alleviate what he called the “American carnage.” The budget is his first attempt to translate that into concrete reality. Mr. Trump wants to slash deeply into domestic and international programs to pay for a large military buildup and protect Social Security and Medicare without increasing the deficit or raising major taxes. As a practical matter, the budget may stand little chance of passing intact. But as a political statement, it represents a new way of doing business.

President Trump also proposed scrapping the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a key revenue source for PBS and National Public Radio stations, as well as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. It was the first time a president has called for ending the endowments. They were created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation declaring that any “advanced civilization” must fully value the arts, the humanities, and cultural activity. While the combined annual budgets of both endowments — about $300 million — are a tiny fraction of the $1.1 trillion of total annual discretionary spending, grants from these agencies have been deeply valued financial lifelines and highly coveted honors for artists, musicians, writers and scholars for decades. Nothing will change for the endowments or other agencies immediately.

503,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Republicans in Congress have pummeled the Affordable Care Act, complaining of high deductibles, soaring premiums and a shrinking menu of options for consumers. But does the Republican alternative solve these problems, or does it exacerbate them? A report this week from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office provides some answers. What follows is a report card analyzing the Republicans’ plan by the standards they have used in judging, and condemning, President Barack Obama’s health care law. THE CRITICISM While some people have gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act, “the deductibles are so high, you don’t even get to use it,” Mr. Trump said Monday at a meeting with people he described as victims of the law. “The deductibles are so high that you really don’t have insurance.” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said this week that “deductibles are unaffordable.” Many consumers, required to pay deductibles of more than $10,000 a year for family coverage, agree. THE REPUBLICAN ANSWER Legislation drafted by House Republican leaders and approved by two House committees could make the situation worse. Consumers’ out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles, “would tend to be higher than those anticipated under current law,” the budget office said, and it gave two reasons.

504,"WASHINGTON — Dina Powell, President Trump’s senior counselor for economic initiatives, has been named as a deputy national security adviser for strategy, Trump administration officials said Wednesday. The selection of Ms. Powell is the most prominent appointment on the National Security Council staff since Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster was picked last month to serve as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. K. T. McFarland will continue to serve as the principal deputy national security adviser, making her the second-ranking official after General McMaster. Ms. Powell was asked to take the job by General McMaster, who wants to put a greater emphasis at the council on developing and implementing strategy. Although she does not have extensive experience on national security issues, Ms. Powell has spent 15 years in government, has worked in the private sector and has a broad network of contacts. Ms. Powell also works closely with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and will be his closest liaison with the council. Ms. Powell was recently the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. During her years at Goldman Sachs, she worked with Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump’s senior economic policy adviser, and she is expected to continue her role working on the administration’s economic initiatives. She was born in Egypt, is fluent in Arabic and participated in Mr. Trump’s meeting this week with Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi Arabian deputy crown prince and defense minister. Ms. Powell was an assistant secretary of state for education and cultural affairs during President George W. Bush’s administration. Before working at the State Department, she was an assistant to the president for personnel. In the early phase of her career, she worked on Capitol Hill, and she has close relationships with Democrats as well as Republicans. Her familiarity with working across government agencies may be useful for an administration that has gotten off to a rocky start. “General McMaster understands that one of the things that is going to be especially important is interagency coordination, and to get that right requires additional senior level talent and somebody with real clout,” said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the council. “Ms. Powell’s private and public sector expertise will be essential.” General McMaster has also asked Nadia Schadlow to join his staff as a deputy assistant to the president for national security strategy. Ms. Schadlow served as a senior officer at the Smith Richardson Foundation and is the author of a recent book that examined 15 cases in which the United States Army intervened abroad, and the service’s role in political and economic reconstruction. She will be tasked with drafting the United States national security strategy, a comprehensive statement of the administration’s foreign policy and defense goals, which is issued by the White House.

Soon afterward, Neil M. Gorsuch — then a top Justice Department official — sent an email to a White House colleague in case he needed “cheering up” about the administration’s setback. The email from Judge Gorsuch, nominated by President Trump to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, linked to articles about a less-noticed provision in the act that undercut the rights of Guantánamo Bay detainees by barring courts from hearing their habeas corpus lawsuits. “The administration’s victory is not well known but its significance shouldn’t be understated,” wrote Judge Gorsuch, who had helped coordinate the Justice Department’s work with Congress on the bill. The email about the court-stripping provision — which the Supreme Court later rejected — is among more than 150,000 pages of Bush-era Justice Department and White House documents involving Judge Gorsuch disclosed by the Trump administration ahead of his Senate confirmation hearings next week. Judge Gorsuch’s time in the executive branch was brief. He joined the Justice Department in June 2005 as the principal deputy associate attorney general, meaning he was the top aide to the No. 3 official in the department. He left in August 2006, when Mr. Bush appointed him as a federal appeals court judge in Denver. But those 14 months were tumultuous ones for the Bush administration amid controversies over detainee abuses, military commissions, warrantless surveillance and its broad claims of executive power.

At the same time, facing resistance to the bill from within his own party, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said it would be refined and improved. “We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government,” Mr. Trump told about 10,000 supporters at the Municipal Auditorium in downtown Nashville. He spoke against the backdrop of a giant American flag to a crowd dotted with red trucker caps bearing his signature slogan, “Make America Great Again.” “We’re going to all get together, we’re going to get something done,” Mr. Trump said. “Remember this: If we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we’d need 60 votes, so we’d have to get the Democrats involved. So we’re doing it a different way, a complex way.” “It’s going to be fine,” Mr. Trump added. The remarks were a nod to the complicated and politically risky approach Republicans have taken in pushing through legislation to repeal the health care law. The House plan championed by Mr. Ryan is coming under strain amid resistance, both from conservative Republicans concerned it is too close to Obamacare and from moderates who fear it will provide insufficient coverage for Americans who lack health insurance. Mr. Ryan, fighting to keep the measure on track, said Wednesday that he was making “some necessary improvements and refinements” to the package to answer the concerns, which intensified this week after the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that the legislation would increase the number of people without health insurance by 24 million by 2026. “Now that we have a score, we can incorporate feedback to improve this bill, to refine this bill, and those kinds of conversations are occurring between the White House, the House and the Senate, and our members,” Mr. Ryan said.

The results were immediately cheered by pro-European politicians who hoped that they could help stall some of the momentum of the populist, anti-European Union and anti-Muslim forces Mr. Wilders has come to symbolize, and which have threatened to fracture the bloc. Voters, who turned out in record numbers, nonetheless rewarded right and center-right parties that had co-opted parts of his hard-line message, including that of the incumbent prime minister, Mark Rutte. Some parties that challenged the establishment from the left made significant gains. The Dutch vote was closely watched as a harbinger of potential trends in a year of important European elections, including in France in just weeks, and later in Germany and possibly Italy. Many of the Dutch parties that prevailed favor the European Union — a rare glimmer of hope at a time when populist forces have created an existential crisis for the bloc and Britain prepares for its withdrawal, or “Brexit.” “The Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said ‘Whoa’ to the wrong kind of populism,” Mr. Rutte told a wildly enthusiastic crowd, excited that his party, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, had come in first among the parties and lost fewer seats than it had feared. “Today was a celebration of democracy, we saw rows of people queuing to cast their vote, all over the Netherlands — how long has it been since we’ve seen that?” Mr. Rutte said.

That same afternoon, the president’s spokesman took a wait-and-see approach, suggesting only that the administration’s chief lawyer would review options. Other officials, speaking on background, suggested that the chief counsel was looking for evidence to back up the president’s claim. The second-day response was twofold: criticize the news media coverage and try to shift the responsibility for providing information to Capitol Hill by demanding a congressional investigation. By the Tuesday after the tweet, administration officials were trying to move past the issue.

Every winter the two factions in the Capitol, the Republicans who rule the Senate and the Democrats who dominate the Assembly, each put forth a gorgeous what-if of a resolution, outlining a vision for the state’s spending — with one gigantic, unspoken caveat: that these proposals have no chance of becoming reality. The Senate Republicans won’t adopt all of the Democrats’ ideas, of course, nor will the Assembly go for all of the Republicans’ plans. The final budget will inevitably be a compromise between the two, with the added — and enormous — input of the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat whose politics generally fall between right and left. On Wednesday, both houses passed their resolutions with an added wrinkle: The Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of eight Democrats who partner with Senate Republicans, decided that it too would release a one-house resolution. Not to be outdone, the Senate Democratic Conference — whose 23 members are the minority in the 63-seat chamber — also released their budget resolution. That’s four budget resolutions, each with a snowball-in-a-sauna’s chance of being adopted wholesale. Yet the various plans — and the Venn diagram of their overlaps and outliers — offer hints as to what the actual budget will look like when it’s adopted at the end of March. (If it’s adopted then: Mr. Cuomo has a six-year record of on-time or close-to-on-time budgets on the line.)

American workers will see gradual pay raises that keep compensation rising faster than inflation. Interest rates will rise gradually, while staying low by historical standards. And that’s all before accounting for any major stimulative policies that may emerge from the Trump administration and Congress. That was the view of the economy sketched by the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, at her first news conference of 2017 on Wednesday. In short, the Fed believes that after nearly eight years of trying to nurse the economy back to health, its work is nearly done. The general sense of rosiness isn’t really anything new — for years, Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, have forecast that the economy will steadily converge toward a Goldilocks-like state of being neither too hot nor too cold. Two things have changed. First, that day now feels imminent, with the unemployment rate at 4.7 percent and inflation closing on the 2 percent the Fed thinks best. That is a key reason the Fed raised its interest rate target Wednesday. Second, markets now believe the Fed’s message that higher rates are on the way; bond markets suggest that the Fed will actually follow through with its intentions on gradual interest rate rises. You couldn’t say that a year ago. “The simple message is: The economy is doing well,” Ms. Yellen told reporters. The overwhelming message was of gradualism — both on the rate of economic improvement and the Fed’s own efforts to wind down its era of low interest rates. She suggested no urgency toward a tightening of the money supply that might suggest a hair-trigger readiness to accelerate interest rate increases. Ms. Yellen evinced little fear that the Fed is behind the curve, suggesting that two more interest rate increases are on the way over the remainder of 2017.

512,"ATLANTA — As Republicans in Washington grapple with altering the Affordable Care Act, they have proceeded in a direction that will do little to curb the cost of health care in America. Instead, they are pushing a bill that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, might save the government money, but will end coverage for 24 million people (though several million of those would be willingly giving up coverage the law now requires them to have). If it passes, Republicans will not only own the nation’s health care problems for years, but they will also have violated more than six years of promises. Since 2010, Republicans have pledged to repeal — not fix, not tinker with, but abolish — Obamacare. In 2016, that was a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s campaign. Republicans ran advertisements noting they had voted 70 or more times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they would do it as soon as they had control of Congress and the White House. Voters gave them just that. And now Republicans, who had used the word “repeal” like a meditation chant, act like the proverbial dog that caught the car. The plan they all liked in 2015 — one that would have ended the law’s mandates, subsidies and Medicaid expansion — would not pass today. Yes, Republicans, you really did once author a plan to credibly repeal Obamacare, unlike what you are considering now. Of course, Republicans are acting this way in large part because of President Trump’s voters. Despite all the hard talk about repealing Obamacare, Mr. Trump’s voters supported a man who promised a government-run health care plan that would provide universal coverage. In other words, he promised more than Obamacare. For that matter, Mr. Trump promised more government involvement in health care than Hillary Clinton did. It is not hard to see why Republicans think they can get away with breaking their promises. Their own party’s presidential nominee promised more than what President Obama offered and claimed he could pay for it all without raising taxes.

A few things: Without the supporting schedules for that return, nothing can be gleaned about the president’s conflicts of interest and/or possible compromising ties to foreign entities. And even if there were some suspicious information revealed in that return, that it is more than a decade in the past would certainly ameliorate the consequences. Lastly, just because some numbers are presented on a 1040 tax form does not mean that it is the tax return that was filed with the Internal Revenue Service. As lending officers have found, the only true way to confirm the veracity of a tax return is to have a borrower sign a form allowing them to get the information directly from the government. NEIL STEIN, BROOKLYN To the Editor: The tax returns arrived “over the transom.” David Cay Johnston, the journalist who received the documents, speculated that President Trump might have sent them himself. Of course the pages came from the Trump team, in my opinion. Why would a third party send these two pages to an adversarial reporter? These two pages show that Mr. Trump paid $38 million in taxes. It is almost impossible to believe that a third party would somehow have gotten only two pages of the tax return. And all of the unfavorable information (write-offs and charitable deductions or lack thereof) is contained in the other pages. Someone sympathetic to Mr. Trump would have sent the return to a pro-Trump reporter. An anti-Trump person would have sent the whole return to Mr. Johnston. So the only logical explanation is that Mr. Trump sent the two favorable pages to an adversary. Once again, he has played the media like a fiddle. JEFFREY L. FELDMAN

A version was introduced in 1969 after Congress discovered that — are you ready? — 155 taxpayers with taxable incomes over $200,000 paid no tax. But critics across the political spectrum have long complained that it has failed to live up to the promise. Both Mr. Trump and the House Republicans’ proposed overhaul of the code would eliminate the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. During his Democratic presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont suggested replacing the A.M.T. with a flat 28 percent rate on deductions for high-income households. Even the National Taxpayer Advocate within the Internal Revenue Service once called it the most serious problem facing taxpayers. The minimum tax has gone through several iterations, but the essential intent has not changed: to limit the amount of deductions available to the richest Americans. Over the years, though, inflation has eaten away at its effectiveness — as has the exclusion of interest and dividend income, which insulates the richest Americans. About 30 percent of households earning $200,000 to $500,000 in 2016 are being hit by the minimum tax, as are 63 percent of those earning $500,000 to $1 million, according to calculations from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. But only a fifth of the total earn more than $1 million and face the minimum tax. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/business/economy/trump-alternative-minimum-tax.html?searchResultPosition=107

Mr. Trump’s advisers have likened him to Jackson, the first populist to win the White House. The president has hung Old Hickory’s portrait in the Oval Office and called him “an amazing figure in American history.” So how alike are the nation’s seventh and 45th presidents? Mr. Trump, who relishes junk food like Doritos and disdains physical exercise, stands at 6-foot-3 and weighs 236 pounds, according to a letter from his doctor last year, qualifying him as overweight with a body mass index of 29.5. Some think he is overstating his height (his driver’s license lists him at 6-foot-2) and understating his weight (one writer estimated by 30 pounds). Jackson, who survived diseases like smallpox, malaria, dysentery, rheumatism and dropsy and endured physical disability most of his adult life after being shot in the chest during a duel, was just shy of Mr. Trump in stature, standing 6-foot-1. But Jackson was far thinner, with estimates between 145 pounds and 154 pounds, putting his body mass index at 20 or lower. At age 13, an unruly Mr. Trump was packed off by his frustrated parents to New York Military Academy, but he never served in the armed forces, receiving five deferments from the draft during the Vietnam War, four for education and one for bone spurs in his heels.

518,"MOSCOW — The Ukrainian authorities halted all trade with two Russian-controlled separatist enclaves in the country’s east on Wednesday, using an economic weapon to strike at what has been a long-festering military problem. The decision to block all but humanitarian trade dealt another blow to the much-beleaguered Minsk peace process and raised tensions not just with the separatists but with their patrons in Moscow, who could be called upon to provide aid and markets to the breakaway regions. President Petro O. Poroshenko has been reluctant to isolate the breakaway areas, in a region known as the Donbas, fearing that would implicitly recognize their independence and be a first step toward the country’s partition. But the idea of halting trade has long animated Ukrainian nationalists as a way to shift the cost of sustaining the approximately three million people in the eastern region onto Russia’s already weakened economy. In recent weeks armed bands of men in tattered camouflage had begun doing exactly that, blockading rail shipments from the east, mostly coal trains. They enjoyed strong public support, and their actions helped force the issue to the top of the nation’s agenda. When, in retaliation, separatist leaders started nationalizing Ukrainian mines and factories, the president said he felt forced to act. In televised comments at a meeting of the Ukrainian Security Council, Mr. Poroshenko minimized the damage that halting trade would do to the separatist regions, saying that far greater economic harm would befall Ukraine, which was losing an important source of cheap fuel.

519,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year would slash the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent and cut State Department spending by a similar amount in a brash upending of the government’s priorities, according to congressional staff members familiar with the plan. The budget outline, to be unveiled on Thursday, is more of a broad political statement than a detailed plan for spending and taxation. But it represents Mr. Trump’s first real effort to translate his bold but vague campaign themes into the minutiae of governance. The president would funnel $54 billion in additional funding into defense programs, beef up immigration enforcement and significantly reduce the nondefense federal work force to further the “deconstruction of the administrative state,” in the words of Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Yet for all its headline-grabbing bold strokes — and the White House claims that it will reset the process of Washington policy making — major elements of the plan have already been declared dead on arrival by the Republican leadership in Congress, and much of the fiscal fine print will be filled in by Capitol Hill lawmakers and their aides over the next month. House appropriations subcommittees began reviewing the plan late Wednesday. Among the cuts: drastic reductions in the 60-year-old State Department Food for Peace Program, which sends food to poor countries hit by war or natural disasters, and the elimination of the Department of Transportation’s Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes flights to rural airports. The plan to be released at 7 a.m. tomorrow is a “skinny budget,” a pared-down first draft of the line-by-line appropriations request submitted by first-term administrations during their first few months. A broader budget will be released later in the spring that will include Mr. Trump’s proposals for taxation as well as the bulk of government spending — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs. Mr. Trump’s version is likely to be even skinnier than usual, a result of the chaos, inexperience and staffing problems encountered by the Trump White House over the first two months.

520,"Donald Trump’s Form 1040 for 2005, disclosed by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC on Tuesday night, left political questions unanswered about the president’s Russian ties and business conflicts. But it clarified an important policy question: Should the alternative minimum tax be repealed? Answer: No. In a world of honest policymaking, that clarification alone would be enough to change the trajectory of the tax debate now unfolding. Instead, it highlights how dishonest the debate has become. If not for the alternative minimum tax, a part of the code that applies to wealthy taxpayers, Donald Trump would have paid just 4 percent of his reported $150 million income in federal taxes in 2005. But thanks to the AMT — which disallows excessive deductions so that the very rich pay something closer to a fair share — Mr. Trump paid tax equal to 25 percent of his income. That’s still too low; the merely affluent, who earn six and seven-figure incomes, are subject to similar rates and rules. But it’s better than it would be if there were no AMT. So, of course, a linchpin of the tax reform plans by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans is to get rid of the AMT.

521,"Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, author of “Americanah” and “We Should All Be Feminists,” remembers the hushed tones that accompanied her first period. In a recent interview in New York, she leaned in to mimic her mother’s voice. “‘What are you doing with your menstrual pads?’” she whispers. “My mother taught me to go burn them in the backyard when nobody’s looking.” Ms. Adichie never fully understood the shame that was supposed to usher in womanhood, which made her hide her pads and made her friends apologize to boyfriends for having periods at all. “I’m not going to have my daughter have that kind of shame,” she said. Ms. Adichie’s latest book, “Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions,” is a 63-page blueprint for achieving that reality. Written as a letter to a friend, the book offers a set of guidelines for how to raise a feminist daughter. “Teach her to love books”; “never speak of marriage as an achievement”; “‘because you are a girl’ is never a reason for anything.” The premise of feminism, Ms. Adichie writes, is simply: “I matter. I matter equally.” The Washington Post wrote that much of the book would be familiar to readers of Ms. Adichie’s previous work but that it was “more personal, more urgent.” In person, Ms. Adichie, 39, is warm and thoughtful, and also distinctly glamorous. She has spoken often about the pleasure she takes in fashion, and she is the face of Boots No7, a makeup brand. Ms. Adichie has cultivated these two strands of her identity: the serious literary author and the fashion icon. In turn, she has been celebrated both by mainstream pop culture and the literati. She won a MacArthur fellowship in 2008, and her novel “Americanah” won the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction and was chosen as New York City’s “One Book” for 2017. Her 2012 TEDx talk, “We Should All Be Feminists,” was sampled by Beyoncé in her music, and excerpts appeared on T-shirts at Dior’s Paris Fashion Week show last year. The pop and the literary threads are not opposites to her, and their merger is central to the way she presents her public self and her work.

Granting the automakers their top wish, Mr. Trump halted an initiative by the Obama administration to impose stringent fuel-economy standards by 2025 — rules meant to cut carbon emissions and meet international commitments to address climate change. Instead, Mr. Trump vowed to keep cutting regulations as a means to accelerate economic growth and add new jobs. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he declared. The move to reopen the government’s review of the standards will allow automakers to argue for less stringent — and less costly — mileage standards than the target of 54.5 miles per gallon set in 2012 by President Barack Obama. But the Trump administration is expecting things from the automakers in return for its pro-industry stance: new American jobs, and less investment in foreign operations. And while Mr. Trump vowed to improve business conditions at home, he pledged again to stop the flow of automotive investment and jobs to Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he termed “a total disaster.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/business/trump-auto-industry-emissions-rules.html?searchResultPosition=105

In a third-class cabin was a gray-eyed Irishman named Richard Michael Cawley, fleeing poverty and war. The son of a tailor from a rural village, Mr. Cawley, then 20, had come of age during a guerrilla conflict. Now, with Irish fighting Irish, he had made his way to America to join his older brother and uncle. He would settle in Chicago, a city bursting with Irish Roman Catholic life; marry a teacher; find work as a streetcar driver; and sing ballads by the piano on Saturday nights. He would become an American citizen, march in St. Patrick’s Day parades and visit Ireland, looking, one cousin marveled, like “a real Yank.” It is a familiar American tale, except for this: Mr. Cawley’s grandson and namesake, Michael Richard Pence, is the vice president of the United States, which is in the thick of a roiling immigration debate. On Thursday, Mr. Pence, wearing a spray of shamrocks in his lapel, welcomed Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, for breakfast at the vice president’s residence as part of the White House’s St. Patrick’s Day festivities.

525,"President Trump has wasted no time in cracking down on immigration. He pledged to build a wall, hire 15,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents and speedily deport millions of undocumented immigrants. He justified these actions by claiming that immigrants regularly flout the “rule of law and pose a threat.” In his first speech to Congress, he directed the Department of Homeland Security to create a new office — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice — dedicated to helping victims of crimes perpetrated by “removable aliens.” I am an immigrant and an American citizen, and, as a philanthropist, have supported migrants all over the world for more than 30 years. Based on my experience and the facts, the president’s approach to immigrants is just wrong — and a new round of court injunctions against Mr. Trump’s latest proposed travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries suggests many in the federal judiciary agree. It does nothing to make America safer, while whipping up emotions against immigrants that have translated into an alarming surge in hate incidents all across our nation. My heart goes out to the victims of violence, whatever the source. But in the name of protecting the population from a relatively minor source of concern, he is branding all immigrants as criminals. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s claims, immigrants commit significantly less crime than native-born citizens. This has been borne out in study after study, using a wide range of methodologies, dating back decades. According to the nonpartisan American Immigration Council, the percentage of the population that is foreign-born grew to 13.1 percent from 7.9 percent between 1990 and 2013. F.B.I. data shows that the violent crime rate dropped 48 percent during that time and today remains near historic lows. A recent study by the Journal on Ethnicity in Criminal Justice shows that immigrants actually drive down crime rates in the neighborhoods where they live. But targeting immigrants and minorities with false and prejudicial rhetoric, as Mr. Trump has done during the campaign and in the early weeks of his presidency, has spurred a surge in hate acts against them. The Southern Poverty Law Center found that hate incidents reported in the first few weeks following Mr. Trump’s victory were at levels normally seen over a six-month period. No community appears safe from this rash of hate — with reports like school bullying against Muslim children, stories of Latinos being harassed on the street and told to “go back to your country,” attacks on blacks and gays, and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. This is a country that prides itself on neighbors looking out for one another. In Donald Trump’s America, we are increasingly at one another’s throats.

The potential elimination of about $445 million in annual funding, which helps local TV and radio stations subscribe to NPR and Public Broadcasting Service programming, could be devastating for affiliates in smaller markets that already operate on a shoestring budget. Patricia Harrison, the corporation’s president, warned in a statement on Thursday that the Trump budget proposal, if enacted, could cause “the collapse of the public media system itself.” But the power players in public broadcasting — big-city staples like WNYC in New York City — would be well-equipped to weather any cuts. Major stations typically receive only a sliver of their annual budget from the federal government, thanks to listener contributions and corporate underwriters. Podcasts and other digital offshoots have also become significant sources of revenue. Rural affiliates, however, rely more heavily on congressional largess, which can make up as much as 35 percent of their budgets.

Contrary to Randall’s assertions, the book clearly states it follows one interpretation of quantum mechanics (the “relational” interpretation) among the many defended today and presents the Big Bounce as a possibility that seems to emerge from loop quantum gravity. Randall’s declarations of fact (the realism of the wave function, for example) are subject to the same caveats. A core argument of my book is that on current issues in fundamental physics there is no consensus. Nobody has the Truth in her pocket. Disagreement nourishes science, but assaults on different schools of thought weaken it. Randall also mischaracterizes my discussion of how modern science builds upon earlier concepts. Of course ancient ideas are not the same as contemporary ones: The entire book is about this difference.

But even members of his own party questioned some of the cuts — and what was not being cut. The harshest criticism of Mr. Trump’s budget came from Democrats and liberal organizations. But in a city where many federal programs enjoy longstanding bipartisan support, some Republicans also assailed the president’s judgment. “While we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the president’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,” said Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. “We will certainly review this budget proposal, but Congress ultimately has the power of the purse.” The spending plan’s bottom line is roughly the same as in President Barack Obama’s last budget request, but it marks Mr. Trump’s first major attempt to dismantle what his aides dismissively call the “administrative state.” The $1.1 trillion spending plan envisions deep cuts to many government programs while leaving entitlement programs like Social Security untouched. It increases spending on the military and border security. Mr. Trump was elected on a promise to wage war against what he has frequently mocked as a bloated and ineffective federal work force, and he is betting that his first budget will help consolidate support by calling for a significant shift of resources away from established programs that aid the poor, the environment, foreigners and the arts.

Instead, President Trump sent them a budget even many Republicans found difficult to love. To fulfill a campaign promise to leave Social Security and Medicare — which represent more than 40 percent of annual federal spending — untouched while constructing an expensive border wall, Mr. Trump went after a relatively small pot of money, discretionary spending, goring Republicans’ pet programs in the process. He does propose increasing military spending by 10 percent, something many conservatives would also like to see, but he probably cannot unilaterally break through legal budget caps, imposed after a battle in 2011 over raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling.

The result is deeply unsatisfying for many in his party, which has been yearning for a unified government to finally make major changes to entitlement programs to bring the deficit in line. “This is a good budget if you want to spend your time fighting small fires,” said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who as the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee spent years trying to rally lawmakers to do the hard work to balance the budget. “It’s a statement of policy, which is legitimate, that the government is too big,” Mr. Gregg said. “As a practical matter, it does not affect the big issues that drive that.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/budget-republicans-democrats.html?searchResultPosition=39

We may be about to find out, for this year’s St. Patrick’s Day jamboree at the White House will be a breathtaking celebration of double standards and the willful forgetting of America’s recent past. Even by the crooked yardstick of the Trump administration, the disconnect is surreal: The president will salute the legacy of one wave of immigrants even as he deploys against other immigrants the same calumnies once heaped upon the Irish. In the blizzard of executive orders, it was easy to miss a proclamation President Trump issued on March 1. The president declared this Irish-American Heritage Month and called on “all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish-Americans to our nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities and programs.” The proclamation could hardly be more upbeat in its praise of the Irish for “overcoming poverty and discrimination and inspiring Americans from all walks of life with their indomitable and entrepreneurial spirit.” Mr. Trump embraced these poor and despised foreigners as the forebears of “the more than 35 million Americans of Irish descent who contribute every day to all facets of life in the United States.” The Irish are at least as fond as anyone else of being told how great they are, but as an Irish person, I find this more than a little disconcerting. It is like having your chastity praised by a brothel keeper, or your temperance and thrift eulogized by a drunken sailor. The whole thing would be funny if it did not raise the most uncomfortable question: Is it right to applaud the legacy of mass immigration from Ireland because the Irish are white and Christian? The question is especially pertinent because so many of the people who have devised, defended and attempted to carry out Mr. Trump’s policy of identifying immigrant communities with criminality and terrorism are themselves Irish-Americans. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, announcing in January that his boss would continue the tradition of accepting a bowl of shamrock from the Irish prime minister on March 17, told reporters that the St. Patrick’s Day reception is “an issue that’s near and dear to me” because of his pride in his own Irish roots. Mr. Trump’s senior strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, boasts of his “blue-collar, Irish Catholic” family background. Kellyanne Conway (née Fitzpatrick) is half-Irish. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, who has the job of enforcing Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant policies, “is remembered fondly” in Massachusetts, according to The Boston Globe, “as an adventurous Irish Catholic son who reached the highest echelons of military service.” These are intelligent people, and it seems unlikely that they are so romantic as to imagine they’re descended from Irish kings and Celtic goddesses. Most probably, some of their ancestors were wretched people. The Irish Catholic immigrants who washed up in the United States after the potato famine of the 1840s were, on the whole, the most destitute national group ever to arrive on American shores.

535,"To the Editor: In “Donald Trump vs. the Food Snobs” (column, March 5), Frank Bruni scolds us for judging the food choices of our politicians. But a politician’s attitude toward food is often reflected in policies that affect us all. Michelle Obama often explicitly tied the Obama administration’s anti-childhood-obesity efforts to her own family’s eating habits: After a wake-up call from their daughters’ pediatrician, the Obamas shifted away from packaged convenience foods to healthier fare. After developing diabetes, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, gave up his beloved fried foods for a lean, less processed diet, lost 105 pounds and became a staunch proponent of anti-obesity measures in his state. While President Trump should be allowed to eat his ketchup-doused steak in peace, it would be negligent to completely overlook his eating habits, which include a heavy reliance on fast food. Given his ability to steer our food policies — including those relating to school food and other child nutrition programs — we have every right to peer a little more deeply into that bucket of KFC.

536,"LOS ANGELES — California’s top judicial official asked the Trump administration on Thursday to stop immigration agents from “stalking” courthouses in the state to make immigration arrests. “Courthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country’s immigration laws,” Tani Cantil-Sakauye, the chief justice of California, wrote in a letter to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security. “Enforcement policies that include stalking courthouses and arresting undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom pose no risk to public safety, are neither safe nor fair,” she continued. “They not only compromise our core value of fairness, but they undermine the judiciary’s ability to provide equal access to justice.” Justice Cantil-Sakauye did not provide specific examples of immigration agents’ conducting arrests in courthouses, but several lawyers have reported seeing both uniformed and plainclothes immigration agents in and around courts in Southern California. Lawyers and judges in other parts of the country, including Texas and Colorado, have also complained of immigration agents in courts. Officials have repeatedly expressed fear that seeing immigration agents in court will erode public trust in the judicial system and make undocumented immigrants less likely to comply with investigations or serve as witnesses. In Colorado, one prosecutor said she had already dropped several domestic violence charges after the victims said they would no longer go to court. Federal immigration agents generally comply with what is known as the sensitive location policy, avoiding schools, hospitals and places of worship. But courts are not considered sensitive locations, and federal officials have said they are increasingly moving to make arrests there because fewer local law enforcement agencies are working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain suspects so they can be picked up and processed for deportation. Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said, “While ICE does arrest targets at courthouses, generally it’s only after investigating officers have exhausted other options.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/immigration-agents-should-not-stalk-courts-california-justice-says.html?searchResultPosition=44
537,"From the moment that “Fearless Girl,” a bronze statue of a small child, landed in Lower Manhattan to face off against the 7,000-pound sculpture of a charging bull, installed in 1989 as a symbol of Wall Street resilience, there were reasons, it seemed, to feel queasy. Where, for instance, was her nanny? While others saw a narrative of female defiance — the girl’s torso thrusts forward as if she has a chance — I imagined a poorly paid caregiver fired for leaving her charge unattended, and ultimately trampled to death. The statue, created by an artist named Kristen Visbal previously known for a series of larger-than-life sculptures of college football coaches, is an exercise in corporate imaging. It was put in place on the eve of International Women’s Day, March 8, by the investment firm State Street Global Advisors to celebrate “the power of women in leadership,” a message the company delivered, we might note with some irony, absent the depiction of an actual woman. Corporate feminism operates with the singular goal of aiding and abetting a universe of mothers who tuck their daughters in at night whispering, “Someday, honey, you can lead the emerging markets and sovereign debt team at Citigroup, and then become a director at Yahoo.” The point of “Fearless Girl” was to advertise a State Street initiative pushing companies to include more women on their boards. Although the firm has said it is working to improve the number of female executives in its own ranks, it hasn’t been close to exemplary in this regard: Of its 28-person leadership team, only five are women, according to the company website. Is the root of this effort an organic wish to buoy the ambitions of confident little girls in high-tops? Not particularly. As the firm’s marketing materials clearly state, “research shows that companies with greater levels of gender diversity have had stronger financial performance” and “fewer governance-related issues such as bribery, corruption, shareholder battles and fraud.” With this assertion, we are returned to the era of temperance movements, when 19th-century women were enlisted as moral safeguards essentially for the purpose of propelling capitalism’s journey forward on the backs of a sober labor force, ensuring that rich industrialists got richer. Just as the theory has been floated that President Trump might have leaked his 2005 tax returns to deflect the country’s attention from the potential evisceration of the Affordable Care Act, it is worth considering the timing of State Street’s clarion call. In January, following an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Boston field office, the Justice Department announced that State Street Corporation, the parent company of State Street Global Advisors, had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government, consenting to pay more than $64 million to resolve fraud charges.

Roberts Jr. presided over the case, brought by several boys, played by actors, who had come to regret whitewashing Aunt Polly’s fence. Tom’s guile in persuading them to do his work, they said, amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation. The boys, though of limited means, had somehow managed to hire Paul D.

But Mr. Clement faced an uphill fight. “Your clients are not blameless in this affair,” Chief Justice Roberts said. “They don’t come here with clean hands.

539,"When faced with a tough question about nearly any aspect of the health bill moving through Congress, Republican officials like to mention their plan’s other “prongs.” In a briefing Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, cited the prongs again and again. Paul D. Ryan, the House Speaker, is fond of mentioning them. So is Tom Price, the secretary of Health and Human Services. They say the bill needs to be understood as part of a larger strategy of reforming the health care system, not a piece of legislation that, alone, can achieve their goals. Details about the second and third prongs of the strategy are still sketchy, but some ideas have begun to emerge. This week, Mr. Price and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sent a letter to governors welcoming them to submit applications to waive normal Medicaid rules, and add policies like work incentives and premiums. Such changes to regulations and standards are said to be Prong No. 2. As for Prong No. 3? Members of the House have said they will soon take up bills that deal with medical malpractice and antitrust protections. Here’s why the prongs are crucial to the effort to roll back Obamacare: Republicans have chosen to pass their health reform bill using a special budget procedure that limits the policy changes they can make. That means that many of their key policy promises made over the past few years — and even days — can’t be achieved in the bill.

540,"Since moving downtown, the Whitney Museum of American Art has grown up, thanks to a larger, dashing new building, more ambitious exhibitions and new responsibilities brought by rising attendance and membership. No surprise, its biennial has grown up, too. Perhaps less expected: So has the art in it. This show’s strength and focus make it doubly important at a time when art, the humanities and the act of thinking itself seem under attack in Washington. The 2017 Biennial, the first held in the expansive Renzo Piano-designed structure on Gansevoort Street, is an adult affair: spatially gracious to art and visitors alike, and exceptionally good looking, with an overall mood of easy accessibility. My first thought: It needs a little more edge. Yet this show navigates the museum’s obligations to a broader public and its longtime art-world audience with remarkable success. Organized by Christopher Y. Lew, the Whitney’s associate curator, and Mia Locks, an independent curator, it has some immature inclusions and other letdowns. But once you really start looking, there’s edge all over the place. The show spotlights 63 artists and collectives working at the intersection of the formal and the social, and in this it announces a new chapter of so-called political art — though one already brewing in small museums, galleries and studios. Many of these artists confront such American realities as income inequality, homelessness, misogyny, immigration, violence, hatred and biases of race, religion and class. But they are equally committed to the artistic exploration of media and materials, and to the creation of bold and strange things to see and think about. Important messages are conveyed through perception. Take Henry Taylor’s gripping history painting of Philando Castile dying in the passenger seat of his car in a St. Paul suburb, having just been shot by a policeman whose gun, arm and uniform are visible through the car window. We are inside the car, in the driver’s seat, bearing witness with Diamond Reynolds, Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, as she live-streams his mortal injury on a cellphone. Mr. Castile, a school cafeteria manager, has the noble head of a Greek bronze, complete with a jawline beard and an eye whose flat whites the Greeks would have made from silver or alabaster inlay. His shirt is spattered with paint, not blood. Mr. Taylor’s style is harsh but it doesn’t overplay. Samara Golden’s “The Meat Grinder’s Iron Clothes” is a dystopian combination of mirrors and eight half-size miniature interiors — including some upside down — that create endless kaleidoscopic reflections of class conflict. Overlooking the Hudson River, it includes a drab office full of computer stations, an all-white aspirational Upper East Side living room and some merging of high-end hospital and prison featuring pink wheelchairs and filthy toilets. The melding of pleasure and horror it can elicit would have delighted Georges Bataille, the radical philosopher for whom “truth has only one face: that of a violent contradiction.” This Biennial follows the lead of Kerry James Marshall’s painting retrospective at the Met Breuer last fall, which set a high standard for social engagement sustained by formal ambition. This presentation is also an important bookend to the 1993 Biennial, a raucous, untidy show unforgettable for the real-life issues it threw in viewers’ faces — and for often overly didactic, hectoring and visually dry art. The current Biennial reflects the emergence of artists committed to political subject matter but unwilling to limit themselves artistically or to lecture viewers. Mr. Marshall, who presides here in absentia, has lots of company.

541,"CHICAGO — So much has happened during these early weeks of President Trump’s administration that it is easy to lose sight of the single event that may well have the most powerful and troubling impact on American democratic society. I speak of the administration’s startling assertion following its first travel ban, which was blocked by the courts, not merely that the president’s executive order limiting immigration from seven nations was constitutional, but that the president is actually immune from judicial review of the constitutionality of his action. The president’s lawyers explicitly made this argument before the Ninth Circuit, and the presidential counselor Stephen Miller has asserted that presidential power over immigration cannot be questioned. The constitutionality of the president’s bans on travel from parts of the Muslim world — the most recent one was blocked this week, by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland — gives rise to complex issues on which reasonable people can differ. But what is not in dispute is the ability of the judiciary to determine their constitutionality, free from control by the executive branch of government. Indeed, not only is such thinking largely inconsistent with over 200 years of established American constitutional practice, but it also ignores and undermines the genius of the Constitution’s framers, who saw the judiciary as perhaps the most important deterrent to tyrannical power. By “tyranny” the framers did not mean simply the abuse of power. Rather, it is the very accumulation of such power that they saw as the essence of tyranny, because once the power is accumulated, the harm has already taken place. The framers considered the Constitution to be the primary protector against authoritarianism. The document is framed in mandatory language and can be amended only by a complex process. Congress cannot simply enact a law repealing a provision of the Constitution. Rather, those who wish to amend it must go through an intentionally difficult process requiring substantial supermajoritarian majorities. The framers knew that throughout history republican governments ultimately degenerated into authoritarian regimes. To preserve democratic government in which those in power remain representative of and accountable to the populace, that government must be subject to the control of a countermajoritarian document — the Constitution. This describes the democratic paradox that underlies American constitutionalism: to preserve democracy, we must limit democracy. Once we understand the special role played by the Constitution in preserving democratic government, the role of the judiciary in enforcement of that document flows inescapably. Of the three branches of the federal government, only one is explicitly insulated from the dictates of democratic representation and political accountability: the judicial branch. Article III of the Constitution guarantees to federal judges life tenure (subject only to removal through the impeachment process) and protects their salaries from reduction. A nation that only a few years earlier had fought a revolution over the slogan “no taxation without representation” protected one of the three branches of its federal government against the check of political accountability. Why would the framers have done this? ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/trump-is-not-above-the-courts.html?searchResultPosition=35
542,"WASHINGTON — The former president denied it. So did the former national intelligence director. The F.B.I. director has said privately that it is false. The speaker of the House and the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees — all three Republican — see no indications that it happened. But President Trump insists he is right. No matter how many officials, even in his own party, dismiss his unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama secretly tapped his phones last year, the White House made clear on Thursday that it would stand by the assertion. Ultimately, it insisted, the president will be proved correct. Nearly two weeks after Mr. Trump first accused his predecessor in a series of Saturday morning Twitter posts, the standoff between the president and the available record has come to shadow the White House even as it tries to overhaul the nation’s health care system and drastically rewrite the federal budget. Much like his longstanding assertion that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, Mr. Trump dismisses contrary information with undiminished surety. Indeed, the White House even added a new assertion on Thursday during a fiercely combative and sometimes surreal briefing by the press secretary, Sean Spicer, who berated reporters and read from news accounts that either did not back up the president’s claims or had been refuted by intelligence officials. One report that Mr. Spicer read contended that Mr. Obama used Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, the signals agency known as GCHQ, to spy on Mr. Trump. In effect, the White House was embracing a claim that the United States’ closest ally collaborated with a president against a presidential candidate. “There’s widespread reporting that throughout the 2016 election, there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people,” Mr. Spicer said. Asked if the president stood by his original allegation, Mr. Spicer said, “He stands by it.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/richard-burr-mark-warner-trump-wiretap.html?searchResultPosition=26
543,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and House Republican leaders worked Thursday to win conservative support for legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, offering concessions to speed cutbacks in Medicaid and dismantle more of President Barack Obama’s signature health law. But in a bid to ensure passage of the Republican health care bill in the House, White House and Republican leaders risked losing support in more moderate quarters of their party — not only in the narrowly divided Senate, but in an increasingly nervous House. A faster path to Medicaid cuts, new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and potentially smaller tax credits for the working poor could mollify conservatives who are pressing for a smaller government footprint on the health care system, but they would cut deeper into the benefits that many Trump voters have enjoyed under the Affordable Care Act. White House officials have made clear that they are open to supporting amendments that would require a quicker end to the expansion of Medicaid under the 2010 health care law, according to an administration official involved in negotiations with Congress. Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, and other conservatives want to freeze the expansion of Medicaid next year, two years earlier than under the legislation drafted by House Republican leaders. Referring to this change, Mr. Barton said, “The Trump administration is open to it.” But in an interview, Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said: “I am opposed to that. New Jersey expanded Medicaid. I don’t want that to be eliminated.” The federal government pays at least 90 percent of Medicaid costs for newly eligible beneficiaries, and Mr. Lance said, “I would like that to continue for at least several years.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/health-care-repeal-affordable-care-act.html?searchResultPosition=46
544,"The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, defended the president’s budget proposal for 2018 by saying it puts numbers on Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. That it does, but in so doing, it shows that many of those promises simply cannot be kept. As he pledged, Mr. Trump would spend heavily on the military and border security — but only, as it turns out, by spending far less in areas like education and infrastructure that he had once deemed important. This is, of course, very much a political document, full of bluster and preposterous cuts that Mr. Trump must know that Congress, including many Republicans, will not accept. But the spirit behind the “budget blueprint” is clear enough: With a few big exceptions, Mr. Trump is in full tear-down mode. He would cut the State Department by 29 percent, enfeebling diplomacy and international aid, while relying more on military might to protect national interests. He would cut the Department of Health and Human Services by 16 percent, undermining vital research by the National Institutes of Health. Smaller agencies that promote justice, arts and letters would be eliminated entirely, including the Legal Services Corporation, which finances legal aid groups; the National Endowment for the Arts; the National Endowment for the Humanities; and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The budget would raise spending in only three of 17 major categories — Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs — while slashing it in most of the rest. Hardest hit would be the Environmental Protection Agency, with a cut of 31 percent. These cuts would end climate change research — a global setback. They would eliminate money to carry out President Obama’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants — the centerpiece of his strategy to combat global warming. They also would disadvantage states that went for Mr. Trump. For Wisconsin and Michigan, for example, the budget would zero out initiatives to restore the Great Lakes. For Virginia, it would end restoration of Chesapeake Bay, whose watershed affects Pennsylvania also. Farm states, which largely supported Mr. Trump, would face a 21 percent reduction in the Department of Agriculture. Rural Americans would also be hurt by the elimination of federal aid to rural airports and reductions in subsidies for long-distance Amtrak services, while low-income Americans in general would see the end of $3 billion in block grants to states and localities for Meals on Wheels, housing aid and other community assistance.

Watson’s language was stern, even biting: In an order on Wednesday that blocked President Trump’s travel ban from taking effect, he rebuked the government for its “illogic” and for presenting arguments he bluntly called “not true.” The sometimes cutting opinion drew applause on social media, as critics of Mr. Trump’s policy cheered on Judge Watson like a gladiator in the ring. To friends of the judge, that role would seem an unlikely one: He is known to them not as a feisty scrapper, but as a placid and patient colleague, an even-tempered former Army reservist and automobile aficionado who rarely gets riled up, except where baseball is concerned. “The only time he probably gets extremely emotional is with respect to the Dodgers,” said James A. Bruen, a San Francisco-based litigator who worked closely with Judge Watson at two law firms. Far from an attention seeker, Judge Watson eschewed the typical ceremony for his installation on the bench in 2013, telling The Honolulu Star-Advertiser, “It’s just not me.” Yet if Judge Watson, 50, is an uneasy temperamental match for his sudden role in history, there are elements in his career that appear to have put him, and his native Hawaii, on a kind of legal and political collision course with Mr. Trump.

The resources to respond to those emergencies, along with much of the other state-level work performed by the agency, would be eliminated or sharply reduced by President Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal 2018, which cuts the E.P.A. by 31 percent, more than any other agency. While the agency may be known for sweeping regulations to curb climate change, increase auto fuel efficiency or mandate smokestack controls, the agency’s bread and butter is more prosaic. The staff and scientists at its regional offices and laboratories across the country regularly respond to emergency calls from city and state officials: a December 2016 chemical leak from an asphalt plant into the water supply of Corpus Christi, Tex.; airborne drifts last summer in southern Missouri of dicamba, an herbicide that damages non-genetically modified crops; a 2014 fire at a perfume factory in Bridgeport, Conn., that spewed dangerous chemicals into the surrounding neighborhood. Funds to respond to many of those calls would no longer be available under Mr. Trump’s budget.

In Buchanan’s lyrical first novel, Yuki, a sensitive and lonely teenager, has persuaded her parents to let her remain in New York to pursue a career as an artist when they return to Japan. The first of the novel’s two alternating strands follows Yuki’s artistic education through the bohemian romance of New York City in the 1960s and ’70s. The second, set in the present, is narrated by her adult son, Jay, who was 2 years old when Yuki left him and his father and moved to Berlin to devote herself to her work.

551,"They are streaming into New York from Calgary, Montreal and, of course, Newfoundland. Some wear red, stay warm in gloves adorned with the maple leaf, or carry a provincial flag. Canada is having a rare moment on Broadway — “Come From Away,” a musical written by a married Canadian couple, set in Newfoundland and celebrating Canadian decency, has just opened at the Schoenfeld Theater. The show was already drawing an unusually high number of Canadian ticket-buyers, and an extraordinary amount of Canadian media attention, even before this week, when it hit the apotheosis of Canadianness: The country’s charismatic and popular prime minister, Justin Trudeau, attended with a group of 600 allies and diplomats. And now the show has turned unexpectedly into a form of Canadian soft power: an expression of Canadian ideals, seemingly at odds with those of the new American administration, on stage nightly in the heart of New York City. On Wednesday night, Mr. Trudeau sat side-by-side with Ivanka Trump, the American president’s daughter and close adviser, as the 100-minute musical celebrated the welcome extended by residents of Gander, a small town in Newfoundland, to thousands of air travelers diverted during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The show is packed with distinctive local details; one scene, inevitably, is set in the ubiquitous doughnut chain Tim Hortons. The timing was rich: As Ms. Trump, joined by Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and Mr. Trudeau, accompanied by his wife, Sophie, watched an artistic tribute to the virtues of embracing foreigners, President Trump was proposing to eliminate federal funding of the arts and to ban travel from parts of the Muslim world.

552,"Rachel Maddow’s slow-walk reveal of President Trump’s decade-old tax records on Tuesday night did not earn her much journalistic praise. But it certainly earned her a lot of viewers. More than 4 million people tuned in on Tuesday to watch Ms. Maddow’s report on MSNBC, the biggest audience in her show’s nine years on the air. It was the third-ranked show across all of television at 9 p.m., beating the broadcast networks ABC and Fox. Ms. Maddow drew 1.1 million more viewers than her Fox News rival, Tucker Carlson, who typically dominates the 9 p.m. time slot. And excluding major events like elections, conventions and debates, her program on Tuesday was the second-highest rated show ever to air on MSNBC, the network said, narrowly missing a Keith Olbermann episode in October 2008. The ratings may have been stellar, but the response was anything but. Since the report aired, Ms. Maddow’s approach — dragging out the revelation for more than 20 minutes, past the first commercial break — has been mocked by the late-night host Stephen Colbert and criticized as overly dramatic by political reporters. In the end, what Ms. Maddow revealed was less than scandalous: two pages of a single federal tax return from 2005, in which Mr. Trump paid a 25 percent effective tax rate totaling $38 million. But the vast audience she attracted, after teasing viewers with a vague post on Twitter about 90 minutes before airtime, points to a large interest in Mr. Trump’s tax records, which the president has declined to make public. And Ms. Maddow seemed to strike a nerve at the White House. The president’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, denounced the report as “despicable and reprehensible.” Mr. Trump, in an interview with Fox’s Mr. Carlson on Wednesday, dismissed the journalist who obtained the tax forms, David Cay Johnston, as “not much.” MSNBC’s audience on Tuesday peaked between 9:15 and 9:30 p.m., around the time Ms. Maddow was informing viewers of Mr. Trump’s tax payment. Viewership dipped slightly after that, but enough viewers stuck around to boost MSNBC’s 10 p.m. host, Lawrence O’Donnell, to a rare victory over Sean Hannity on Fox News, according to Nielsen figures. As for Mr. Carlson’s interview with Mr. Trump on Wednesday, cable-news ratings for that evening were not yet available on Thursday. Viewership figures in the television industry have been delayed this week because of an electrical problem at a Nielsen company facility near Tampa, Fla.

553,"Some members of the elite legal community are making an unusual appeal to one of their own, asking that he speak out against the White House’s attempt to restrict travel to the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries. A group of 27 former associates from the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell sent a letter on Thursday to Walter J. Clayton, who is known as Jay, a Sullivan & Cromwell partner and President Trump’s nominee to become chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the letter, the group urge Mr. Clayton, whose Senate confirmation hearings are set for next week, to publicly denounce Mr. Trump’s proposed travel ban. The former Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers ask that Mr. Clayton speak out during his confirmation hearings and stand up for the legal profession by “unequivocally opposing” the president’s executive orders and “the unlawful, cruel and shameful actions of this administration.” Mr. Trump has issued two such orders, the first of which suspended entry to the United States by individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, and the second removing Iraqi nationals from the list. Mr. Clayton is a longtime partner Sullivan & Cromwell, which is known for its representation of Goldman Sachs and major financial firms. As the president’s choice to lead the S.E.C., he has come under scrutiny over whether he will use his experience to protect investors or to loosen regulations that have constrained Wall Street activities in recent years.

He recently moved into an apartment two blocks from the underpass where he spent 20 years sleeping, and often smoking crack. Now Mr. Gaymon is sober and taking classes at an adult learning center run by Strong City Baltimore, a nonprofit that operates with federal funds from the Community Development Block Grant program — which President Trump’s budget for fiscal 2018 would eliminate. “I’d be hurt and upset if this place was gone, and this program wasn’t here anymore,” said Mr. Gaymon, 49. “I need it. I need my education. I want my G.E.D. But I’ll leave it in the hands of God.” Mr. Gaymon’s worries echoed across the country’s urban centers on Thursday as city leaders, nonprofits and poverty experts lamented Mr. Trump’s proposed budget, which would make drastic cuts to programs aimed at helping the country’s inner cities and some of its most vulnerable populations. Mr. Trump spent months on the campaign trail promising to fix “broken” inner cities, appealing to African-Americans with the question, “What do you have to lose?” In terms of money, the answer turns out to be: plenty. Mr. Trump would cut the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development by 13 percent and eliminate programs like the Community Development Block Grant, which cities have used to fund programs like Meals on Wheels as well as homeless shelters and neighborhood revitalization initiatives.

555,"Bucking fears that the Netherlands would be the next populist domino after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump’s election in the United States, the Dutch turned out in record numbers on Wednesday to reject the anti-Muslim platform of the far-right candidate Geert Wilders. The Dutch election was seen as a potential bellwether for elections in France and Germany, where far-right populist parties have gained ground. But it is premature to assume the Dutch result signals the defeat of far-right populism in Europe. The Dutch parliamentary election was a highly fractured affair, with 28 parties competing for 150 seats. It takes 76 seats to form a government. Though the final result will not be announced until Tuesday, with most of the votes already counted, Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy won with 33 seats. Mr. Rutte will have to seek — as is the usual case in the Netherlands — partners to form a coalition government, which could take weeks or even months. Mr. Rutte is likely to turn to the conservative Christian Democratic Appeal party and the center-left, pro-European Democrats 66 party, each of which won 19 seats. Even if those parties joined his coalition, he would still need at least one more party to reach 76 seats. That party could be the left-leaning, pro-European Greens, which increased their seats to 14 from just four. But, however the horse trading goes, the Netherlands looks set to form a staunchly pro-European government. That idea has cheered European leaders. On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, which will hold its election in September, said she “was very happy that a high turnout led to a very pro-European result, a clear signal.” President François Hollande of France hailed a “clear victory against extremism.” Still, it would be a mistake to assume the Dutch vote will translate into a defeat for Marine Le Pen and her far-right National Front party in France. While polls indicate the En Marche! candidate Emmanuel Macron will beat Ms. Le Pen in a second round of voting on May 7, polls have had a sorry track record in populist-fueled elections. They predicted a far stronger showing by Mr. Wilders, and missed the Brexit and Trump victories. Despite his defeat, Mr. Wilders’s Party for Freedom did come in second with 20 seats, and he remains a powerful far-right provocateur. “Rutte has not seen the last of me yet!” Mr. Wilders wrote on Twitter. Nor would a defeat for Ms. Le Pen in May put an end to her movement. The Dutch vote is encouraging, but the threat of far-right populism in Europe continues.

556,"Before he became president, Donald J. Trump called climate change a hoax, questioned the safety of vaccines and mocked renewable energy as a plaything of “tree-huggers.” So perhaps it is no surprise that Mr. Trump’s first budget took direct aim at basic scientific and medical research. Still, the extent of the cuts in the proposed budget unveiled early Thursday shocked scientists, researchers and program administrators. The reductions include $5.8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health, which fund thousands of researchers working on cancer and other diseases, and $900 million, or a little less than 20 percent, from the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, which funds the national laboratories, considered among the crown jewels of basic research in the world. The White House is also proposing to eliminate climate science programs throughout the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency. “As to climate change, I think the president was fairly straightforward: We’re not spending money on that anymore,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said at a White House briefing on Thursday. “We consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that.” While the budget is only a blueprint and is sure to face strong opposition from members of both parties in Congress — many lawmakers have already said that certain cuts, like those to the N.I.H., are nonstarters — policy makers expressed concern about what the proposal says about the administration’s commitment to science.

As with so many of these scattershot acts of resistance, the call to reserve tickets and leave the seats unoccupied seemed pointless for a first-come-first-served event issuing unlimited tickets. I made my reservations anyway on the off chance I was wrong. Then I thought, “I should just go.” Not as a protester — megaphone-to-megaphone combat is a fine American tradition, but it’s not a great fit for someone who likes pretty much everybody. Most Tennesseans might consider me a Yellow Dog Democrat, but President Trump’s people are my people — the people I come from, the people I live among.

President Trump has produced an “America First” fiscal plan that is not even earning much praise from his own allies in Congress. His $1.1 trillion spending plan does not reduce the deficit. It sharply increases military spending while cutting the budgets of federal agencies and programs, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. It is a gamble for a politician whose supporters include low-income workers who rely on many of the programs he proposes to reduce, including grants that feed hungry children and help local law enforcement. “This will be a heavy lift for the House, and for the Senate, a lot of this will be nonstarters,” said former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who chaired the Budget Committee.

559,"During a recent meeting with stock analysts to discuss a huge loss, the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland sought to inject some levity. “I have a question online from the White House — sorry, sorry, Goldman Sachs,” said Howard Davies, to the sound of guffaws from the audience. The chairman, who was fielding a variety of questions that day from analysts from Goldman and other financial firms, then read out the Goldman inquiry about returns on capital. Jokes like that are commonplace in these first 100 days of the Trump administration. Stacked with former Goldman employees and embracing business-friendly policies, President Trump’s White House would appear to give Goldman a unique and influential edge. Already, Mr. Trump’s proposals to cut corporate taxes and reduce regulation — which would benefit Wall Street broadly — have lifted the stock prices of Goldman and other banks. Shares of Goldman are up more than 36 percent since the election. Yet the Trump connection may actually be more of a liability, people close to the firm contend. That’s because of differences over both style and substance, as well as the constant scrutiny a company naturally falls under when five of its former executives are named to prominent government positions. Other big financial institutions, including the money manager Fidelity and the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, can claim only one former executive apiece among those put forward for major staff or secretary roles in the Trump administration.

560,"WASHINGTON — Making the rounds at the Capitol on a recent evening, Mick Mulvaney, President Trump’s budget director, decided to add an unscheduled stop: a meeting of the House Freedom Caucus, the group of hard-line conservatives that once counted Mr. Mulvaney as a founding member. This history, it seems, does not afford lifetime privileges. After addressing the room briefly, amid the group’s push to oppose the Republican health care bill endorsed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Mulvaney was interrupted, respectfully, by the caucus’s chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina. “Mark said, ‘Look, Mick, we’re going to ask you to step out because we know your loyalties are different now than they were,’” recalled Mr. Mulvaney, a South Carolina congressman from 2011 until his confirmation last month. “And I said, ‘Mark, you’re absolutely right.’” He left without complaint. As Mr. Trump unveils his budget plans this week — against the backdrop of a health care bill that Mr. Mulvaney’s former colleagues detest — the man charged with executing the White House’s fiscal vision is a figure who, not very long ago, might well have been leading the opposition to much of it. While Mr. Mulvaney’s first budget does call for some of the deepest cuts to domestic programs in decades, in many ways his fiscal philosophy appears at odds with that of the president. Mr. Mulvaney has long railed against runaway military spending; Mr. Trump wants a huge increase. He has favored drastic changes to Medicare and lifting the eligibility age for Social Security, placing him at odds with Mr. Trump, who has pledged to protect those entitlement programs.

562,"“Shots Fired,” a new murder mystery created by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Gina Prince-Bythewood, debuting Wednesday, March 22, on Fox, was inspired by recent racially charged police shootings. But it has been percolating for years. It started before this married couple even started dating, when, as writers on “A Different World,” they bumped into each other as each sought solace, after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, at the First A.M.E. Church of Los Angeles. More than two decades later, when their son was distraught over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, Mr. Bythewood showed him a documentary about an even older injustice, the lynching of Emmett Till. “We started feeling like, as artists, we don’t want to always be on the sidelines,” Mr. Bythewood said. “We felt the need to do something like this.” Originally conceived as a feature film, “Shots Fired” became a 10-episode TV series when Fox asked Ms. Prince-Bythewood (“Beyond the Lights”) to create a show about such themes in the wake of the 2014 killing of Michael Brown and resultant demonstrations in Ferguson, Mo. “Because of the reach of network television, we could put this out into the world in a big way,” she said.

One surrounds a high-profile police shooting, which inverts the typical dynamic by having a black officer, played by Tristan Wilds, shoot an unarmed white man.

563,"The parliamentary election in the Netherlands on Wednesday was predicted to be the next populist show of strength after the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump’s election. The Dutch would be the first of a number of European countries to succumb to the right-wing populists’ siren songs in 2017, with the French not far behind. It didn’t work out that way. Geert Wilders, who is all too often described as a bleach blond or referred to as “the Dutch Trump,” did not defeat the conservative prime minister, Mark Rutte. In fact, he didn’t come close. With more than 95 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Rutte’s People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, or V.V.D., came first with 21.2 percent of the vote, compared to Mr. Wilders’s Party for Freedom, which took only 13.1 percent. Mr. Wilders barely improved on his margin in the 2012 election (where he took 10.1 percent) and failed to do as well as he did in 2010 (where he got 15.5 percent of the vote). The real story in Dutch politics isn’t Mr. Wilders’s rise, it is the unprecedented fragmentation of the political system. Together, Mr. Rutte’s and Mr. Wilders’s parties look set to make up only 33 percent of the Parliament, with 11 more political parties constituting the rest. This splintering of Dutch politics is making effective governance of the country increasingly impossible. While previous Parliaments have counted 14 or more factions, what has changed is the relative size of the parties. In 1986, the top three parties together won 85 percent of the vote. In 2003, it was down to 74 percent. Today it is just around 45 percent. Because of its proportional representation system of voting, the Netherlands is an extreme case. But the trends are similar across Western Europe: The main center-right and center-left parties are shrinking, smaller parties are growing and unstable coalition politics are becoming the norm. There are many reasons for this — from secularization to deindustrialization to the emergence of new political issues, like the environment or immigration.

564,"SYDNEY, Australia — President Trump’s combative phone call with Australia’s prime minister and his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal have left many Australians wondering whether it is time to pay less attention to the United States and engage more with China. Stephen FitzGerald, Australia’s first ambassador to China, delivered a speech on Thursday that will only amplify that debate, arguing that the world had reached the end of an era defined by European and American leadership. He called on Australia to make China its primary focus of diplomacy and economic policy and to “implant in our education the study of China and Chinese.” “We are living in a Chinese world,” he said. “But we don’t have a relationship to match it.” Dr. FitzGerald’s comments — delivered as part of a popular lecture series known as the Gough Whitlam Oration, named after the prime minister who sent Dr. FitzGerald to China in 1973 — reflect a view that has been gaining momentum in Australia for years, but especially so since Mr. Trump’s victory. After decades of Australia sidling up to the United States, sharing intelligence and fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, many Australians in the foreign policy and economic establishment are now questioning what some have come to describe as a complacent favoritism for American priorities in the region. Dr. FitzGerald, an esteemed figure in Australia whose comments on China are always closely parsed, seemed especially eager to seize on Mr. Trump’s rise to argue for a shift in focus. In his remarks, at Western Sydney University, he said that Mr. Trump both threatened the old order and provided “a moment of opportunity” in which Australia could become more independent of Washington and develop the kinds of ties to Beijing that would allow Australia to moderate China’s behavior in the region. He did not hold back on what he hoped Australia could affect: Dr. FitzGerald explicitly criticized China’s anti-democratic tendencies, calling out the way it seeks to influence Australian politics through investments and campaign contributions. He also condemned China’s efforts to control information and opinions within Australia’s Chinese community.

566,"MEXICO CITY — Even as Mexico fumes over President Trump’s aggressive stance toward its people, the Mexican government is quietly trying to rip up basic legal protections for its citizens at home and gut longstanding efforts to fix the nation’s broken rule of law. Legal experts fear the move will set back human rights in Mexico by decades. The tool is an innocuous-sounding bill, submitted last month by a close ally of President Enrique Peña Nieto — only a day after his government publicly chided the Trump administration to respect the rights of all Mexicans. The governing party says the bill, labeled a reform to the criminal code, will make “adjustments” to Mexico’s new legal system, a linchpin of cooperation with the United States that was completed last year with more than $300 million in American aid. It is widely considered Mexico’s most important legal advancement in the past century. But while the American-backed legal system is supposed to enshrine human rights in a nation desperately lacking them, this new bill heads squarely in the other direction. Legal scholars say it will broaden the power of the Mexican government to detain suspects for years before trial, enable the police to rely on hearsay in court and potentially allow prosecutors to use evidence obtained by torture. Beyond that, the bill, which has not yet been approved by Congress, flips the very premise of modern justice on its head: Rather than innocent before proved guilty, it would require concrete evidence of reasonable doubt, essentially shifting the burden of proof to the accused. “It is not only a counter reform, but it has reforms that contravene the right to a proper defense,” said Alejandra Ramos, a judge in the state of Chihuahua. “They want to pass this because it is easier to do than to train police officers and prosecutors, clean up the entire system and break the use of torture as the main tool of investigation.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/world/americas/mexico-trump-pena-nieto-wall-drug-war.html?searchResultPosition=73

The proposal, which includes a $2 billion down payment on Mr. Trump’s signature border wall, is one of the single largest investments in the president’s budget plan. Yet experts say it appears only to scratch the surface of what Mr. Trump has pledged, and highlights the difficulty of translating campaign promises into a workable, governing reality. “It’s easy to promise things until you have to pay for them,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security. “It is certainly an attempt to begin to carry out what he promised.” Mr. Trump is proposing to pay for his border security plan by marshaling savings from across the federal government. To what extent it is ultimately funded will depend in large part on Congress, which makes spending decisions based on the president’s proposals. Democrats have pledged to fight tooth and nail against the wall and stepped-up immigration enforcement. That means that funding is likely to come down to how much political capital the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill is willing to spend on a project they have tried to downplay, despite Mr. Trump’s urgings. The changes will not come cheaply. If funded, Mr. Trump’s plan would spend billions of dollars on the design and construction of the wall. It would also prompt a hiring spree in the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to step up enforcement and the deportation of people who are in the United States illegally. Programs and agencies of all sizes from across the federal government would face cuts to pay for the plan.

But the nomination did not run into serious trouble until journalists disclosed that Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, had submitted a confidential sworn statement accusing Judge Thomas of sexual harassment. Judge Thomas issued vehement denials. “This is a circus,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “It’s a national disgrace. And from my standpoint, as a black American, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.” The confirmation hearings riveted the nation but did not resolve the protagonists’ conflicting accounts.

569,"WASHINGTON — Rarely do a presidential candidate’s own words so definitively haunt his presidency. For the second time in two months, two federal judges on Wednesday refused to allow President Trump to impose a travel ban, citing his campaign rhetoric as evidence of an improper desire to prevent Muslims from entering the United States. The judges’ stunning rebukes were a vivid example of how Mr. Trump’s angry, often xenophobic rallying cries during the campaign — which were so effective in helping to get him elected — have become legal and political liabilities now that he is in the Oval Office. It is a lesson that presidents usually learn quickly: Difficult and controversial issues can easily be painted as black-and-white during a long campaign, but they are often more complicated for those who are in a position to govern. That is especially true for Mr. Trump’s bellicose remarks about immigrants, which animated his upstart presidential campaign but now threaten to get in the way of his broader agenda for a health care overhaul, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It all seemed so simple before. Five days after terrorists in California killed 14 people in December 2015, Mr. Trump whipped up his supporters at a rally by vowing to impose a complete ban on entry by Muslims “until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-campaign.html?searchResultPosition=76

It is a moment that seemed impossible to him just six weeks ago, when President Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. “I cannot see my family,” he said. “I cannot go back to Jordan, they cannot come to America, so we are like, stuck.” Mohammed was born and raised in Amman, Jordan, but because his father was Iraqi, he, too, is an Iraqi national. As an Iraqi living in Jordan he had trouble finding steady work. In 2010, he traveled to Iraq for the first and only time to renew his passport, and wound up in jail. When he returned, he applied for U.N. refugee status and came to the United States in 2012. Now a United States green card holder, he married his Jordanian girlfriend, Kholoud Sammour, on a trip back to Amman in 2014. Soon afterward, he petitioned the United States government to allow her to live with him in Louisville, Ky. While the visa application was pending, Mohammed visited Kholoud; the couple soon had a baby, Lilav, who is now 5 months old. Like her father, Lilav holds Iraqi citizenship, although she’s never been to that country in her short life.

Of the 260 people on the Forbes list described as “self-made,” 250 were men. Wealth — and the ability to generate more wealth — must still be considered a reliable proxy for power. But at the other end of the scale, men of all races and ethnicities are dropping out of the work force, abusing opioids and falling behind women in both college attendance and graduation rates. Since 2000, wage inequality has grown more among men than among women, as the accompanying chart from the Economic Policy Institute shows. A study by the Dallas Federal Reserve published in 2014, “Middle-Skill Jobs Lost in U.S. Labor Market Polarization,” found that: From 1979 to 2007, seven percent of men and 16 percent of women with middle-skill jobs lost their positions, according to the Dallas Fed study. Four percent of these men moved to low-skill work, and 3 percent moved to high-skill jobs. Almost all the women, 15 percent, moved into high-skill jobs, with only 1 percent moving to low-skill work.

572,"Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are getting plenty of advice in the run-up to next week’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. I offered my own advice in the days immediately following Judge Gorsuch’s nomination: Senators should ask how he would have decided Supreme Court cases from the past. Don’t accept the standard nominee response that “I can’t answer because that question might come before the court.” It has already come before the court. (This suggestion is based on a 2006 article by two Yale law professors, Robert Post and Reva Siegel.) As it happened, the Supreme Court promptly obliged a few weeks later by serving up a perfect specimen for an experiment on whether the modern confirmation process has any utility left: whether it can actually succeed in eliciting a nominee’s views. Buck v. Davis, issued on Feb. 22, was a death penalty case, although the question before the court was nowhere near as straightforward as whether a Texas death-row inmate named Duane Buck should live or die. Rather, the case lay deep in the weeds of state and federal habeas corpus — a “labyrinth,” as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. put it in his majority opinion, which ordered a federal appeals court to consider the inmate’s appeal, “where it has wandered for the better part of two decades.” The contorted procedural status of the case may account for the fact that even as a rare Supreme Court victory for a death-row inmate, the decision received relatively little attention. Further, the facts were as unusual as they were disturbing, with the majority insisting that it was making no new law and the dissenters taking pains to point out that the decision was unlikely to affect anyone but Mr. Buck. In other words, the perfect case for a question to Judge Gorsuch, who now sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver. Texas law at the time of Mr. Buck’s sentencing in 1995 made a prediction of “future dangerousness” a necessary predicate for a death sentence. Evidently incited by a romantic breakup, he had gone on a murderous rampage, shooting his former girlfriend to death in front of her children, killing a male friend of hers and wounding his stepsister. Part of the defense argument against a death sentence was that a romantic entanglement of the sort that precipitated Mr. Buck’s crime wouldn’t happen again because he would be serving a life sentence in prison. But then the defense lawyer called as a witness a psychologist, Walter Quijano, whom the judge had appointed to evaluate Mr. Buck and numerous other defendants facing a potential death sentence. Dr. Quijano had reported that while on the facts of the case Mr. Buck was not likely to be violent in the future, his race, black, meant an “increased probability” because “there is an overrepresentation of blacks among the violent offenders.” Mr. Buck’s lawyer had read the report but called Dr. Quijano to testify anyway. While Mr. Buck was unlikely to be violent, the psychologist told the sentencing jury, race was nonetheless a factor “known to predict future dangerousness.” The prosecution reiterated this testimony at the close of its argument. The jury obliged by returning a death sentence. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/a-time-to-choose-for-the-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=79

His entire life, Trump has sold shimmer and called it silver. It was and is all an illusion, a brand built on selling banality with braggadocio. He shaped vapors into dreams and delivered them to those hungry for a taste of the showy, hollow form of the high life he came to represent. He was successful at exploiting those with an ostentatious appetite for the air of success. Trump’s life story is a pyramid scheme of ambitions. He took that history to a people struggling through a drought of opportunity and he exploited their weaknesses: a shrinking sense of economic security and growing nativist tendencies. But Trump doesn’t speak so much from facts as from feelings. For him, the truth is malleable and a lie is valuable. He creates his own reality rather than living in the reality of others. Deception is just a tool; betrayal is just an inconvenience. Now even some of the people who once supported him with vigor are being forced to remove the scales from their eyes. They are now the betrayed disciples of a false prophet.

574,"For nearly a decade, drone strikes have been central to America’s counterterrorism policy. Operated from remote locations, the small aircraft can hover over targets for long periods of time and kill extremists with precision without risking American casualties. President Barack Obama found drones so effective and useful that over two terms, he approved 542 strikes that killed 3,797 people in non-battlefield areas where American forces were not directly engaged, including Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. But this seductive tool of modern warfare has a dark side. Seemingly bloodless and distant, drone strikes can tempt presidents and military commanders to inflict grave damage without sufficient forethought, violating sovereign rights and killing innocent civilians. Civilian deaths during Mr. Obama’s tenure undermined American counterterrorism operations and became a recruiting tool for more extremists. Mr. Obama was persuaded to impose sensible constraints on the use of drone strikes between 2013 and 2016. The White House would decide which individuals outside of the traditional war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan could be targeted, and there had to be “near certainty” that no civilians would be killed. In traditional war zones, military commanders make these decisions without interagency review, and the threshold for acceptable civilian casualties is less strict. Now comes disturbing news: President Trump and his administration are moving to dilute or circumvent the Obama rules. This could have disastrous outcomes, not least because Mr. Trump seems even more enticed by drone warfare than Mr. Obama was. In the days since his inauguration, the tempo of airstrikes has increased significantly. Mr. Trump has already granted a Pentagon request to declare parts of three provinces in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is fighting Iranian-backed Houthis rebels, to be an “area of active hostilities.” This, The Times has reported, would enable more permissive battlefield rules to apply. The president is also expected to soon approve a Pentagon proposal to do the same for parts of Somalia, where militants of the Shabab who are linked to Al Qaeda threaten regional stability. Both designations are supposed to be temporary, giving the administration time to decide whether to rescind or relax the Obama rules more broadly.

578,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will send a budget to Congress on Thursday that sharply reorders the nation’s priorities by spending billions of dollars on defending the southern border and bolstering the Pentagon while severely cutting funds for foreign aid, poverty programs and the environment. The budget would fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to shock Washington by slashing the government work force — but it is virtually ensured to be discarded by Hill Republicans who see many of Mr. Trump’s cuts as too rushed, indiscriminate and reckless. “You can’t drain the swamp and leave all of the people in it,” Mick Mulvaney, the White House’s budget director, said during a briefing on Wednesday. The budget would cut the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent, the State Department by 28 percent and Health and Human Services by 17.9 percent. Funding to several smaller government agencies that have long been targets of conservatives — like the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts — would be axed entirely. The chances of Mr. Trump’s first budget passing Congress in its current form are slim. Many of the proposals would be nonstarters for Democrats, and some would be problematic for Republicans. The proposed $54 billion increase in military spending — a 10 percent increase — would also require a repeal of spending caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act; Democrats oppose such a move without equal spending increases for domestic programs.

First, François Fillon, the embattled conservative candidate for president of France, currently lagging in third place and charged on Tuesday with embezzlement, was accused by Le Journal du Dimanche of having received “presents” from an unidentified friend in the form of 13,000 euros (about $13,880) in custom suiting from Arnys, the tailor that LVMH acquired in 2012 to merge with Berluti, its men’s wear label. Cue multiple headlines along the lines of this one from ledauphine.com: “The very expensive clothes of François Fillon.” Then it transpired that Ivanka Trump’s fine jewelry line was no more, having been, depending on how you look at it, either shut down or transformed into Ivanka Trump Fashion Jewelry (i.e., no longer involving precious gems and metals, created with a different licenser, and instead of costing $428 to $47,000, costing $28 to $198). Both of these developments underscore an unavoidable reality about life in the public eye: With populism on the rise, what politicians and their families wear (or put their name on) increasingly has a dollar, or euro, sign attached. And therein problems may lie. Price sensitivity isn’t limited simply to objects on shelves in stores; it now goes with wardrobes, too. Better take it … well, into account. Ms. Trump apparently did. After all, though the general attitude toward any Trump-related product these days is to treat sales as a referendum on the president and whether people are buying the lines he (and his family) are selling, note that, according to a statement from the brand’s president, Abigail Klem, the decision to discontinue the fine jewelry had nothing to do with revenue generation, but rather was made “as part of our company’s commitment to offering solution-oriented products at accessible price points.” In other words, to make the jewelry consistent with the rest of the brand’s positioning. The question being: Which brand? Because, according to a company spokeswoman, this decision was actually made back in December. That is, after Ms. Trump had separated her personal social media accounts from her brand’s social accounts, but before she had taken a formal leave of absence from the company. Which is interesting. Because segueing away from high-end jewelry doesn’t just bring the collection in line with the rest of the Ivanka Trump product portfolio — the clothes and bags and shoes — it brings it in line with what is increasingly emerging as the Ivanka Trump personal portfolio: the issues of child care, working parents and sacrifices made.

Allergies are worse in the spring than they are in the winter.

Allergies are worse in the suburbs because there are more trees. Myth. “Cities in general can have more problems with allergies,” Dr. Reisacher said. “Most of the pollen in New York City actually comes to us along the prevailing winds, which move west to east. The tall buildings can make allergy symptoms worse by creating a ‘wind tunnel’ effect.” Definitely or debatable? Springtime sniffles are mostly the result of pollen in the air. Debatable. “Older buildings in the city tend to have higher amounts of indoor allergens, such as dust mites, mold and pet dander,” Dr. Reisacher said. “Nasal symptoms can also come from nonallergic sources, such as airborne chemical, pollution, and particulate matter in the air from industry and construction.” Right or wrong? The trees are probably making me sneeze these days.

Nobody ever talks about the fact that it was in quotes,” he said on Fox News before adding, “I think you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront in the next two weeks.” Here’s an assessment of some of his recent claims. This is misleading. The Times article Mr. Trump referred to did use the word “wiretap” but it did not assert that Mr. Obama had ordered surveillance of Mr. Trump, nor did it even mention Mr. Obama. Rather, the story referred to intercepted information collected overseas. The headline in print read, “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides.” And the word appeared twice in the text of the article: “intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House” and “If Mr. Sessions is confirmed, he will for a time be the only person in the government authorized to seek foreign intelligence wiretaps on American soil.” False. Mr. Trump has proposed to add $54 billion to the Pentagon’s budget, which amounts to a 10 percent increase.

A big defense contractor, the Raytheon Manufacturing Company of Waltham, Mass., put a help-wanted notice in the Sunday Business-Financial section, saying it was looking for electrical engineers to develop 2450-megacycle microwave ovens. “Most helpful previous experience: magnetron tube development, large-cavity resonators or magnetron feeds,” the ad said. Clearly, this was to be something more than a Mixmaster. “Cooking the new electronic way,” was how Raytheon described it. There was nothing new about it. Times readers had waited a decade, having begun salivating over this tantalizing article by Jane Nickerson, our food editor, in 1946: “Within a year housewives may be able to buy a stove operated by the magnetron tube, the basis of radar, that will cook a six-pound beef rib roast in 3 minutes, a hamburger in 35 seconds and gingerbread in 29 seconds,” she wrote.

591,"Federal and state prosecutors said on Thursday that they would not bring criminal charges against Mayor Bill de Blasio or his aides following separate lengthy investigations, even as one concluded that the mayor acted on behalf of donors seeking favors from the city and the other said that some of their practices appeared to violate “the intent and spirit” of the law. The disclosures were unusual; prosecutors rarely announce the conclusion of such inquiries when no charges are filed. The federal inquiry found a pattern in which Mr. de Blasio or his associates solicited contributions from donors seeking favors from the city and then contacted city agencies on their behalf, according to a statement from the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. But the decision not to bring charges, the statement said, came after weighing among other things, “the high burden of proof, the clarity of existing law” and challenge of proving corruption without “evidence of personal profit.” State prosecutors, who examined Mr. de Blasio’s unsuccessful 2014 effort to help Democrats regain control of the State Senate, concluded that the aspects of the undertaking amounted to an “end run” around limits on contributions to candidates, according to a 10-page letter outlining their findings. Mr. de Blasio was quick to try to put the issue behind him. “I’ll just say simply it’s been basically a year, I’ve said consistently that we acted appropriately,” he told Brian Lehrer on WNYC in a previously scheduled interview Thursday morning, shortly after the prosecutors released their findings. “This confirms what I’ve been saying and what all my colleagues have been saying.” He added, “We gotta get back to work.

592,"WASHINGTON — The United States is the only country with a truly global foreign policy. But the Trump administration does not have a lot to say about it. On his first day as secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson vowed to “deploy the talent and resources of the State Department in the most efficient ways possible.” For “efficient,” read minimalist. During his first two overseas trips, to Germany and Mexico, his public statements amounted to 625 words total. His predecessor, John Kerry, might have taken that many to answer a single question at one of his frequent press encounters. This week, Mr. Tillerson visited Japan, China and South Korea against the backdrop of increased regional tensions thanks to North Korea’s recent missile tests. Normally, the secretary of state would be accompanied by a dozen or so reporters, but Mr. Tillerson left the State Department press corps behind — offering a single seat on his plane to an obscure conservative outlet that devotes more attention to America’s culture wars than its foreign policy. This is part of a pattern. Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Greece all visited the State Department in recent days for bilateral meetings. There were photos of handshakes, but the secretary had nothing to say about how the United States views the challenges these important allies face, or how it might help. Last week, the State Department released its annual human rights report. Mr. Tillerson wrote an introduction but made no presentation of the report’s findings, another departure from past practice. The low-key rollout — interpreted as a downgrade of human rights as a policy priority — drew a sharp rebuke from Senator Marco Rubio. What corporate executive would stop all advertising and marketing as he learned a new job? That’s effectively what Mr. Tillerson has done. There were no daily press briefings for six weeks. In the modern era, this is unheard-of. “He’s not a media guy,” one official acknowledged recently.

The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s executive order on immigration can be felt across California, especially in the cluster of kebab houses and Iranian-American businesses known as Little Tehran or Persian Square in Los Angeles, home to the world’s largest Iranian diaspora. The latest order, which was blocked on Wednesday, would have imposed a 90-day ban on citizens from Iran and five other predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the U.S. The original ban, issued in January, was ultimately blocked by a federal appeals court. The chaos over the ban’s rollout has put into flux travel plans ahead of the most important Iranian cultural holiday, Nowruz. The 13-day secular celebration of the Persian New Year begins on the first day of spring, which is Monday. Nowruz (pronounced NO-rooz) dates back thousands of years to the old Iranian solar calendar. It’s a part of the cycle of planting and harvesting and renewal. “There is lots of anxiety in the community,” said Peyman Malaz, program manager in the Los Angeles office of Pars Equality Center, an Iranian-American advocacy group. “Everyone is terrified actually.

594,"SOFIA, Bulgaria — As I follow the news and listen to politicians these days, I am struck by the extent to which America and Europe are awash in conspiracy thinking. Conspiracy theories have replaced ideologies at the heart of politics. They mobilize people to take to the streets; they connect political leaders to their followers. They decide the outcome of the elections. But as the saying goes, “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.” Russian hacking of the servers of the Democratic National Committee was not a conspiracy theory but a fact. Neither was it a conspiracy theory that the United States was snooping on the chancellor of Germany and the president of Brazil. Most of the corruption scandals in the Western world right now are not conspiracy theories, either. They are actual conspiracies. Yet is the existence of bona fide conspiracies a good enough reason to view everything happening in the world in that light? Is the epidemic of mistrust that is tearing apart democratic societies making us more or less free? And does the rise of a new kind of citizen — let’s call him or her the “paranoid citizen” — imperil our democracies? In Poland it was the shared belief that the death of President Lech Kaczynski along with 95 other members of the Polish elite in a plane crash near the Russian town of Smolensk in 2010 was an assassination rather than an accident (a claim that was officially rejected) that correlated with voting for the now governing right-wing Law and Justice party in the last parliamentary elections — probably more than education, income level, church attendance or any other factor. In the United States, very few Democrats cast doubt on the argument that President Trump is in the pocket of the Kremlin. Across the aisle, few of the Republican faithful are willing to publicly disavow Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that he and his campaign were wiretapped on the order of President Barack Obama; fewer still will contest the lie that protesters against the new president are paid by leftist billionaires.

595,"When considered individually, the main journalistic components of today’s article on the troubling state of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef are nothing new — a focus on the climate, an international dateline (“SYDNEY, Australia”), arresting visuals. Each is a mainstay of New York Times reporting. In this case, though, their combination in a single article quietly hints at a series of changes. The article resulted from a collaboration involving two recent projects at The Times: a newly established bureau in Sydney, and a newly formed team of journalists devoted entirely to climate issues — both of which played crucial roles in the article’s conception and execution. “The climate team was formed to handle breaking news stories exactly like this one, along with bigger enterprise pieces like last month’s story on the water crisis in Mexico City,” said Hannah Fairfield, who leads the new group from Washington. The team, which has been around for a little longer than a month, exists as its own desk in the newsroom (just like, say, the national desk or the sports desk) and consists of editors and reporters in New York and Washington. The goal, Ms. Fairfield says, is to produce visual, explanatory and investigative journalism at a time when, as today’s article indicates, the calamities caused by climate change seem to be intensifying. The team is also coming together at a time of uncertainty regarding the Trump administration’s environmental policies. Just yesterday, President Trump announced a rollback on fuel-economy standards set by President Barack Obama. Climate change has long been a critical area of coverage in The Times’s news report. And the establishment of a dedicated team for climate coverage is just the latest iteration in an evolving approach to reporting on the environment. (A similar team, called the environment desk, existed from 2009 to 2013, for example, but was disbanded to allow for a more interdisciplinary approach.)

With no fewer than 137 institutions of higher learning, from community colleges to world-class private universities to specialized colleges like the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Juilliard School for music, there is a school for virtually every academic pursuit. Even, it may come as a surprise, for future merchant mariners. Tucked away under the Throgs Neck Bridge in the Bronx is the often overlooked State University of New York Maritime College, which has become known for its strong engineering and marine transportation programs. According to a new study, recent graduates of SUNY Maritime earn more than graduates of any other university in the United States. When Payscale.com surveyed the annual incomes of 1.4 million midcareer graduates with bachelor’s degrees, Maritime College ranked first, with an average income of $144,000, surpassing M.I.T., Harvey Mudd College and Princeton University. The college is an unusual blend of engineering school and military academy; a majority of the students train to be merchant mariners, wearing uniforms and following a strict regimen that prohibits freshmen, for one thing, from leaving campus during the school week. A typical cadet is Cullen Palicka, a 20-year-old junior who was raised in Manhattan and attended the Harbor School, a maritime-themed high school on Governors Island, which provided his first taste of life at sea.

598,"The author of “A Colony in a Nation” says his ideal literary dinner would include Walt Whitman and Hannah Arendt. And “James Baldwin is a no-brainer. (I’d let him smoke inside.)” What books are currently on your night stand? There are two: The first is “Black Over White: Negro Political Leadership in South Carolina During Reconstruction,” by Thomas Holt. It was published in 1979, but it’s still one of the most comprehensive looks at the black elected representatives who held power in South Carolina from 1867 to 1876. To me, this is perhaps the most fascinating and tragic period in American history. The other is a galley for the novel “Touch,” by Courtney Maum; it comes out in May, and I’m about halfway through it. So far it’s a really smart and funny look at the insane psychological and social costs of our era of constant connectedness. I know Courtney from college, and my wife really liked her first novel, “I Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You,” which got raves. What’s the last great book you read? I’ll name two because I basically read them at the same time, as I was working on my own book. “Ghettoside,” by Jill Leovy, which is at one level just the story of one homicide detective in L.A., but is more profoundly about violence and policing and the ways in which our criminal justice system exhibits its contempt and devaluation of black lives through policing as well as overpolicing. The other is “Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life,” by Karen and Barbara Fields. I’m slightly embarrassed to say that I’d not heard of it until my research assistant for the book, George Aumoithe, who’s a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia, recommended it to me. It’s a book of essays that grapple with a pretty simple question: What is race? It’s permanently altered the way I think about the concept and the language I use to describe it. Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets — working today do you admire most? There are way, way too many for me to list here, particularly journalists, because there is just an incomprehensible amount of amazing work being produced right now. But here are a few: Ta-Nehisi Coates; David Grann; Masha Gessen; Junot Díaz; Stephen Karam; Lin-Manuel Miranda; Sarah Ruhl; Tony Kushner; Lynn Nottage; Rebecca Solnit; George Saunders; Michelle Alexander; China Miéville; and my brilliant, talented friend Alix Sobler, who is a playwright you will be hearing a lot from. What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? The vast majority of book reading I do right now has to do with writing projects I’m working on, so for about a year and a half it was mostly criminal justice, policing, race and early colonial U.S. history. Now I’m reading a ton of history books about Reconstruction; in fact, it’s basically all of what I’m reading.

A typical opioid overdose involves pills that a doctor prescribed legally but that someone other than the intended patient ingested. This pattern is a sign that doctors often prescribe too many pills at once. After surgery, for example, many patients use only a small portion of the painkillers prescribed — and the remainder become available for a relative or friend who’s addicted to painkillers to abuse. Here’s how bad the opioid crisis has become: More Americans now die of overdoses than died of AIDS at the peak of that epidemic, as Atul Gawande writes in a special report published by the Annals of Surgery, a medical journal. The journal’s report points to several common-sense solutions, such as smaller prescription amounts and easier refills for patients who really need painkillers. If you don’t generally enjoy reading medical journals, I sympathize, and suggest you read the short, easily understandable introduction to the opioid report from Gawande, the surgeon and New Yorker writer. I also recommend an Op-Ed in The Times today by J.D. Vance, the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” one of the most talked-about books of the past year. Vance describes his decision to move back home to Ohio, where he is starting an organization to fight the opioid crisis. (Given Vance’s prominence and interest in policy, I wouldn’t be surprised if he eventually ran for office.) Because it’s hard to talk about almost any medical issue without talking about Trumpcare, I also recommend Doyle McManus’s explanation, in The Los Angeles Times, of how the Republican health bill would hamper treatment of opioid addiction. More broadly on Trumpcare: Margot Sanger-Katz debunks the idea that it reduces the cost of medical care, while Sarah Kliff and Ezra Klein lay out the past, present and future of the American health care system in a brisk 6,000 words.

600,"HONG KONG — When the United States Air Force wanted help making military robots more perceptive, it turned to a Boston-based artificial intelligence start-up called Neurala. But when Neurala needed money, it got little response from the American military. So Neurala turned to China, landing an undisclosed sum from an investment firm backed by a state-run Chinese company. Chinese firms have become significant investors in American start-ups working on cutting-edge technologies with potential military applications. The start-ups include companies that make rocket engines for spacecraft, sensors for autonomous navy ships, and printers that make flexible screens that could be used in fighter-plane cockpits. Many of the Chinese firms are owned by state-owned companies or have connections to Chinese leaders. The deals are ringing alarm bells in Washington. According to a new white paper commissioned by the Department of Defense, Beijing is encouraging Chinese companies with close government ties to invest in American start-ups specializing in critical technologies like artificial intelligence and robots to advance China’s military capacity as well as its economy. The white paper, which was distributed to the senior levels of the Trump administration this week, concludes that United States government controls that are supposed to protect potentially critical technologies are falling short, according to three people knowledgeable about its contents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “What drives a lot of the concern is that China is a military competitor,” said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who is familiar with the report. “How do you deal with a military competitor playing in your most innovative market?” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/technology/china-defense-start-ups.html?searchResultPosition=83

The Washington Tidal Basin, the reservoir that sits between the Jefferson Memorial and Washington Monument, is usually jammed with visitors on a weekend morning in late March. They come to see the cherry blossoms that surround the basin in a flush of pink. On Sunday, however, the area was “basically deserted,” as the website Cherry Blossom Watch noted. Why? There wasn’t yet much to see. Washington has just had its warmest winter on record (with a February that was warmer than an average March). The warmth brought many cherry blossoms to the cusp of a very early bloom, at which point they’re delicate. And when a cold spell came last week, it killed many, leaving them wilted and brown. “This is something that has never happened in the 105-year history of cherry blossoms in D.C.,” Mike Litterst of the National Park Service told The Washington Post. The real-world consequences of climate change are accelerating. The Great Plains is suffering its worst drought in a century, hurting many farmers. Pollen counts are rising, aggravating allergies. Warming oceans have killed huge sections of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, turning their glorious colors to a bleached white that’s as dispiriting as a wilted brown cherry blossom. Just a couple of miles away from the Tidal Basin, on the other end of the Washington Mall, Neil Gorsuch had his second day of confirmation hearings yesterday. For a summary, I recommend coverage from The Times, Slate and Scotusblog. You can also listen to NPR’s Nina Totenberg. Climate change hasn’t been a major focus of the hearings. Yet I expect that the climate will end up being a large part of Gorsuch’s legacy if he joins the Supreme Court. He could be the deciding vote on pollution cases that will come before the court in the near future. Longer term, when the country next has a president who takes climate change seriously, many efforts to fight it are likely to end up before the court. Gorsuch is extremely conservative, and the best working assumption is that he will be hostile to environmental regulation. But that’s not the only possibility. “Gorsuch’s record on environmental cases is sparse,” Patrick Parenteau of Grist has written. “His decisions generally reflect the views of a conservative jurist, but not a particular animosity toward environmental regulations. Plus he’s an avid fly-fisher, which surely counts for something.” Ultimately, some influential conservatives will surely decide they care about the health of the planet. Right?

But in the social media age, where protest movements often remain relegated to cable news screens and hashtags, some have wondered whether the fervor and energy would be reflected in local, state and federal ballots. The answer seems to be a resounding yes. A surge in demand for programs around the country like the one at Rutgers, along with a significant spike in off-year small dollar fund-raising for local races, suggests that the protest movement is producing a flood of first-timers, led predominantly by new female candidates, on local ballots, from school boards to town councils to state legislatures.

But Obama-era positions suggest otherwise. They include what constitutes a war zone (in effect, the entire planet); who the enemy is (any group “associated” with Al Qaeda whether or not Congress has authorized hostilities); who is targetable within such a group (never made clear); and what constitutes an “imminent” threat (a threat that may materialize in the future). So it is no surprise that the Trump administration would cast the removal of President Barack Obama’s constraints as lawful.

That policy failed to constrain a program that has produced enough fissile material for about 21 nuclear bombs and enabled Pyongyang to accelerate the development of missiles that could carry warheads to hit Japan, South Korea and, one day, the United States — and that has people like China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, warning of a “head-on collision” between North Korea and the United States. Mr. Tillerson seemed to rule out negotiations with the North and suggested that the United States might be forced to take pre-emptive military action if the North Koreans “elevate the threat of their weapons program” to an unacceptable level. This sort of talk is jarring and risky, and even though negotiations are a long shot, there is little hope of moderating the North’s position without them. En route from Seoul to Beijing, he told a reporter from the conservative-leaning website Independent Journal Review that while “all options are on the table,” there are “a lot of steps and a lot of distance between now and a time that we would have to make a decision like that.” He talked of a multistep process in which countries, especially China, would be encouraged to carry out United Nations Security Council sanctions intended to press the North to give up its nuclear program, and he said that even tougher sanctions — ideas under discussion include barring North Korea from the global financial system and penalizing Chinese banks that do business with North Korea — could be considered.

610,"WASHINGTON — In the century or so since Congress first assigned the Secret Service the task of protecting the president of the United States, its top job has always gone to an agency veteran. Like so many things in the Trump era, that may soon change. Aides to President Trump are narrowing a list of candidates to lead the Secret Service, the beleaguered agency that protects the country’s top government officials and investigates certain crimes. Unlike in transitions past, no clear front-runner has emerged. But top aides have been looking at candidates inside and outside the agency who can improve its morale and regain the credibility lost after a string of embarrassing lapses. They hope to name a new director in the coming weeks. The search has taken on new urgency in recent days, as a series of attempted intrusions on the White House grounds — including a successful one in which a man was able to wander close enough to peer through the windows — have reignited concerns about management, training and security vulnerabilities thought to be on the mend. Critics of the agency have seized on the most recent cases to amplify calls for the White House to recruit a leader from outside the Secret Service, which would be unprecedented in the famously hidebound agency’s modern history. They insisted that only someone untethered from the agency’s ways of thinking could institute the kind of reforms necessary to guide the organization. “I still believe they have a deep-seated cultural problem,” Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, and the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in an interview. “We need a transformative figure to truly change the culture at the Secret Service.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/politics/secret-service-white-house.html?searchResultPosition=79
611,"WASHINGTON — On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump falsely accused President Barack Obama of founding the Islamic State. He said Mr. Obama “did not get it,” in terms of fighting the extremist group that is based in Iraq and Syria, and vowed to obliterate them on the battlefield. But in the Trump administration’s first major announcement of its still-nascent plans to defeat the militants, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Wednesday closely parroted Mr. Obama’s strategy. His comments came as talk of fighting the Islamic State was overshadowed by an attack in London that killed four and injured 40. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, or if the Islamic State was linked to it. “The great commonality among we who have gathered today is a commitment to bringing down a global force of evil,” Mr. Tillerson said at the start of a conclave of the 68-nation coalition to defeat the Islamic State that was held at State Department headquarters. In his 20-minute speech, Mr. Tillerson noted that over the past year, the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria had dropped more than 90 percent, and that 75 percent of the Islamic State’s online propaganda had been eliminated. Both gains occurred largely on Mr. Obama’s watch. “Reflecting on the past year or so, we should be encouraged by the significant progress we as a coalition are making,” Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Trump has long insisted that citing “radical Islamic terrorism” is key to defeating the Islamic State. “You can’t solve a problem if you refuse to talk about what the problem is,” he said in November 2015. Yet Mr. Tillerson used those three words together only once — when he requested that Saudi Arabia and Egypt do more to combat extremism.

612,"WASHINGTON — For the House Republicans who have never served under a Republican president — roughly two-thirds of them — the vote scheduled for Thursday on a measure to replace President Barack Obama’s health care law is a legislative fantasia, the culmination of seven years of campaign promises impeded by Mr. Obama’s veto pen. But weeks of back-room machinations to bring a disparate group of lawmakers on board have left many Republicans with an excruciating choice: Pass a bill with an extremely limited constituency that could well wreak havoc with their own voters, and with Republicans’ re-election prospects, or vote it down, undermining President Trump’s agenda. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday that he was confident the House would pass the bill. But as of late Wednesday, roughly 30 Republicans had said they either would vote against the measure or had not made up their minds. That left the bill’s sponsors short of the 216 votes needed, and on Wednesday night Mr. Ryan scheduled a meeting in the Capitol to try to win over skeptics. If House Republicans reject the measure, the working relationship between the White House and Republican leaders in Congress, still in its infancy, will suffer a powerful blow. In Washington, failure often begets more failure, as opposition forces strengthen, alliances fragment and the thin foam of bipartisanship evaporates. “How do we have any momentum to do anything else?” asked Representative Richard Hudson, Republican of North Carolina. “Without this bill, I don’t know how you do tax reform,” he said.

Gorsuch veered, somehow, to the matter of mutton busting. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wanted to hear about the Denver rodeo. And Judge Gorsuch, elusive all week as Democrats have strained to pinpoint his judicial leanings, turned instantly expansive. “Mutton busting, as you know, comes sort of like bronco busting for adults,” he began on Tuesday. “You take a poor little kid, you find a sheep and you attach the one to the other and see how long they can hold on.” He went on. “…You know, it usually works fine when the sheep has got a lot of wool and you tell them to hold on — I tell my kids hold on monkey-style, you know? Really get in there, right? Get around it…” The Democrats stared blankly. “…Because if you sit upright, you go flying right off, right? So, you want to get in. But the problem when you get in is that you’re so locked in that you don’t want to let go, right? And so, then the poor clown has to come and knock you off the sheep.” Judge Gorsuch smiled. “We can talk mutton busting all day,” he said. They may as well have. As Judge Gorsuch glided through the third day of his hearings on Wednesday, suffering few slips and answering no question he did not wish to, Senate Republicans were eager to assist.

But do they know that scientific data shows that the Earth’s climate is already changing? And do they know that people and communities are already being affected by these changes? In this lesson, students use the Times’s series Carbon’s Casualties to learn about how climate change is displacing people around the world. They then practice the important skill of explaining the science to a skeptical public that sometimes doubts what it doesn’t see with its own eyes. _________ Warm-Up and Background To get the most out of the main activities in this lesson, students should have a familiarity with the science of climate change. Teachers may want to do part of this Warm-Up as a brief refresher, or they might choose to do the entire Warm-Up as an extended background lesson before tackling the more in-depth articles. Warm-Up: Ask students to engage in a free write for five minutes in response to the term “climate change.” This practice of informal writing can encourage them to activate prior knowledge and to explore questions that they have in a nonthreatening, non-evaluative way. They can write what they know, what they think they know, what they’ve heard, what they’re confused or unsure about, or what they want to know. After students are done writing, ask them to turn and read their writing to a partner. After they have heard each other’s writings, ask them to work together to write a collaborative summary in which they combine their ideas. As a class, discuss what students noticed as they went through this process. What did they know? What did they learn from their peers? What was it like to engage in this process? What questions do they have? Were there disagreements?

615,"The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal is known for its conservative tone, but an editorial the newspaper published online Tuesday night would stand out even in the pages of its left-leaning peers. The editorial was an extraordinarily harsh rebuke of President Trump, calling him “his own worst political enemy” and asserting that he was damaging his presidency “with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods.” In particular, the editorial board pointed to Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that former President Barack Obama had tapped his phones. “The President clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle,” the editorial said, even though senior intelligence officials, as well as Republicans and Democrats, have said they have seen no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s accusations. The paper’s editorial and opinion writers have been critical of Mr. Trump in the past, although the language of this editorial, which ran in Wednesday’s paper, seemed intended to remind the president to focus on his stated goals rather than distractions. And the timing of the editorial — during a week in which Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, is testifying at confirmation hearings and the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the Republican health care bill — is almost certainly not a coincidence. In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Journal said, “The editorial speaks for itself,” and declined to make Paul Gigot, the editorial page editor, available for an interview. The editorial, headlined “A President’s Credibility,” criticized President Trump for “rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims” — namely, repeating an unsupported allegation by a Fox News commentator that British intelligence had wiretapped Mr. Trump on behalf of the Obama administration.

But its plan to present the North American premiere of a work by the Syrian playwright Mohammad al-Attar risks being stopped at the United States border if President Trump’s travel ban is upheld. To present the play, “While I Was Waiting,” Lincoln Center is seeking visas for several artists with passports from Syria — one of several predominantly Muslim nations from which the Trump administration has sought to temporarily ban travelers. The recent pair of executive orders seeking the ban were both blocked by court orders. The festival is hoping the visas will be granted. “Our choice of artists predated the travel ban,” Nigel Redden, the director of the Lincoln Center Festival, said in an email. “But the very idea of the ban shows how important it is for us to have greater understanding of the world beyond our own borders.” “While I Was Waiting,” about the travails of a middle-class family in Damascus, is one of several international plays planned for this summer’s festival, which will run from July 10 to 30. The festival will begin with “Opening Skinner’s Box,” from Britain’s Improbable Theater, and will feature two productions from Israel: David Grossman’s “To the End of the Land” and Amos Gitai’s “Yitzhak Rabin: Chronicle of an Assassination.” Dance Companies From Around the World A previously announced highlight of the festival will be an unusual international performance of George Balanchine’s “Jewels,” with the Paris Opera Ballet, New York City Ballet and the Bolshoi Ballet trading acts of a work that evokes different national dance styles.

With accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election and the F.B.I. investigating whether members of President Trump’s campaign were involved, Washington seems to be getting all the espionage attention. Yet we’d like to point out that New York’s streets, parks and libraries have long been grounds for covert operations. “New York is one of the great espionage capitals of the world,” said Edward Lucas, the author of “Deception: The Untold Story of East-West Espionage Today.” “But the spying that happens in New York doesn’t always involve United States.” A big draw for foreign agents is the United Nations, Mr. Lucas said. For spies, “it’s like a pond: Any fish you want swims through there.” New York has long been a hub of Russian spies because the Russian Mission to the U.N. was a way of getting agents into the United States, where they could work covertly and recruit Americans to their cause, Mr. Lucas added. A few of our city’s most famous Soviet spies include: • Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a Manhattan couple accused of perpetuating the “crime of the century” from their Lower East Side apartment. They were convicted of an espionage conspiracy for stealing atom bomb secrets for the Soviets, and were executed by electric chair in 1953. (Mrs. Rosenberg’s defenders, among them her two sons, say she was innocent and should be exonerated.)

618,"President Trump is not fond of regulations. Within weeks of taking office, he and his appointees began to roll back rules that govern the financial industry, guns, the energy business and broadband internet providers. Last week was the auto industry’s turn. In a speech in Ypsilanti, Mich., Mr. Trump said he would alter rules imposed by the Obama administration to raise vehicles’ fuel standards, which are aimed at curbing greenhouse gases. The rules, Mr. Trump said, are killing jobs. Getting rid of them would prompt a resurgence in the auto industry that would make America “the car capital of the world again,” he said. That’s one possibility. We also have to consider another scenario: Loosening the fuel-economy rules could remove a primary incentive for big carmakers to catch up with innovative upstarts like Tesla and leave the American car industry out of step with a future ruled by electric motors rather than the internal combustion engine. This might happen because the effects of regulation are not as simple as Mr. Trump argues. The president’s view that rules almost always hurt businesses is not supported by history. Researchers who study regulation and its effects on business said there have been numerous instances in which regulation speeds along, rather than impedes, technological progress. It has happened in the energy business, the electronics industry and health care. And it’s happening now in cars. Vehicles powered by electricity keep getting better. Electric cars are getting less expensive, their range is increasing, and the infrastructure to sell, charge and maintain them is improving. As a result, electric cars keep getting more popular, even in a time of low gas prices. There are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California. “Having long-term targets is driving investments in innovative technologies,” said Don Anair, who studies the auto industry for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group. “Maintaining those standards is critical for maintaining that progress.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/technology/electric-car-regulations-trump.html?searchResultPosition=99

Could investors’ optimism and composure, so steady even through political volatility, be waning? Are they now questioning President Trump’s ability to pass market-friendly laws? There are some troubling signs. The Russell 2000 small-cap index tumbled on Tuesday — an indication of concerns over tax overhaul (small businesses would benefit from a corporate tax cut). The value of the dollar slid, and the yield on 10-year Treasury notes slipped, indicating that investors were piling into safer government bonds.

620,"Last week I was in London to participate in a scientific symposium. During coffee breaks, many British colleagues asked me and other American visitors to explain the bewildering news that President Trump had announced his intention to cut the budget for the National Institutes of Health by 18.3 percent, about $5.8 billion. My answer to “What is going on?” did include some consoling reminders. A presidential budget request is a proposal, not a done deal. The actual fiscal year 2018 appropriation for the N.I.H. will be determined by Congress, which has historically provided enthusiastic bipartisan support for biomedical research. Although the N.I.H. has lost a substantial amount of its spending power gradually over the past decade, it has only rarely experienced a sharp decline in actual dollars and never of this magnitude. Furthermore, strong nonpartisan opposition to Mr. Trump’s proposal will come from many quarters, including advocates of research on specific diseases. But it would be a mistake to be complacent about the president’s proposal, because it is likely to have real consequences. Yes, some have said that the proposed cut to the N.I.H. will be dead on arrival in Congress. But the president’s budget proposal is still important: The administration’s representatives will need to defend it at hearings, and it could be the starting point for negotiations among appropriators. It is not difficult to imagine a compromise in which the N.I.H. suffers a steep reduction. To understand just how devastating a cut of less than 20 percent of an agency’s budget would be requires some understanding of how the N.I.H. operates. Very little of its typical annual budget is spent on the agency’s administration: The industrious, underpaid government scientists who manage the funding of the N.I.H.’s research programs consume less than 5 percent of its budget. Only a bit more, about 10 percent, supports the work of government scientists. In sharp contrast, over 80 percent of its resources are devoted to competitively reviewed biomedical research projects, training programs and science centers, affecting nearly every district in the country. The N.I.H. awards multiyear grants and contracts, but receives annual appropriations that must be spent that year. This means that at the start of each year most of its dollars are already committed to recipients of awards from prior years. A budget cut of the size that is proposed would effectively prevent the awarding of new grants or the renewal of any that have reached the end of a multiyear commitment. Junior scientists, already struggling in a highly competitive atmosphere, may not get a chance to have an academic career. Senior investigators might need to lay off staff, disrupting research teams and leaving projects unfinished.

621,"BANGUI, Central African Republic — The Pentagon is poised to significantly scale back a decade-long mission to capture or kill Joseph Kony, one of Africa’s most notorious warlords, in a sign that the United States and its African allies no longer see him as a regional threat. Mr. Kony and his violent guerrilla group, the Lord’s Resistance Army, gained worldwide attention after the social media video “Kony 2012” was viewed more than 100 million times on YouTube. The L.R.A. is notorious for its use of child soldiers but has also carried out massacres, sexual violence, mutilations, pillage and abductions. The Pentagon’s Africa Command now wants to shift from a counterinsurgency operation against the guerrilla group to building African defense institutions and a more narrow pursuit of Mr. Kony, whose fighting force has dwindled to about 100 soldiers from a peak of 3,000. That change could free up perhaps dozens of the approximately 150 United States troops now assigned to the effort, allowing them to undertake other Special Operations missions. A decision on renewing the mission for six more months is scheduled for April, but the Trump administration, even before taking office, signaled its desire for change in a series of questions from its transition team to the State Department. “The L.R.A. has never attacked U.S. interests, why do we care?” the Trump transition team asked. “I hear that even the Ugandans are looking to stop searching for him, since they no longer view him as a threat, so why do we?” Mr. Kony and his militant force emerged in Uganda in 1987 to fight against President Yoweri Museveni. From 1987 to 2006, the armed group abducted more than 20,000 children to use as soldiers, servants or sex slaves, according to Unicef.

624,"CODY, Wyo. — During Donald Trump’s campaign, he repeatedly cast himself as a supporter of L.G.B.T. rights. As president, however, he is being urged by fringe-right groups and raging extremists to sign a “religious liberty” executive order that would allow discrimination against gays, women and religious minorities. As one Republican to another, I’d like to offer this bit of advice to President Trump: Don’t do it. I wish it were as simple as pointing out that supporting discrimination against anyone is just a bad idea and that doing so in the name of religion is hypocritical as well. But just for good measure, I’ll offer a few more reasons. The prospective executive order would authorize wide-ranging, taxpayer-funded discrimination against women, gays and members of minority faiths across federal programs and services. For example, a Social Security Administration employee could cite his religious beliefs to refuse benefits to the surviving spouse of a married same-sex couple. The idea itself is extraordinarily unpopular. According to an August poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, 63 percent of Americans oppose these religious exemptions, and only 30 percent back them. The survey affirms what polling has found over the last several years: Americans are becoming more tolerant and inclusive, with support for equal rights continuing to grow. Sixty-two percent of Americans in the survey say they favor same-sex marriage, compared with 47 percent just five years ago. But Mr. Trump, if you don’t trust the polls, then trust the people. When a White House draft of the executive order was leaked several weeks ago (yes, I know that’s painful), it unleashed a wave of negative news coverage and backlash from voters across the country. Most of them were plain dumbfounded, wondering why a president who just days before had crowned himself a steadfast supporter of the L.G.B.T. community would even consider signing an executive order that would license discrimination. Even faith leaders (400 of them) sent you a letter last month urging you not to further pursue this executive order, reasoning that, because religion is already fully protected under the law, this would then amount to something even worse: taxpayer-funded discrimination.

He can indulge his persecution complex, firing off missives that compare Barack Obama to Joseph McCarthy and American intelligence officers to Nazis, or he can recognize it as a gateway to disgrace and irrelevance. He can make his presidency about his own viscera, or he can make it about the country’s welfare. He can do what feels cathartic in the moment, or he can do what’s constructive in the long run. He can dabble in bright colors and shiny objects, or he can deal in durable truths. I’m focusing on Twitter because it teases out his worst traits. It’s the theater for vainglorious, vindictive, impulsive Trump, and it was the realm in which he made the wild accusations that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. On Monday, James Comey debunked those charges, certifying them as the gaseous fulminations we more or less knew they were. And through much of Tuesday, Trump’s personal Twitter account essentially went dark. There was nothing from the hours around dawn, which is when he typically visits with his darkest vapors. There was only anodyne stuff later on: a shout-out to the scientists at NASA, a salute to American farmers. Either someone in his orbit convinced him, at least briefly, of the damage he was doing and the miserable situation he’s in, or Trump himself summoned some wisdom and restraint. He must be capable of that. Can he continue it? It could be argued that every presidency is a tug of war between private demons and the public interest, between the commander in chief’s indulgence of his own psychological needs and his attentiveness to the hard work of America.

626,"“Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,” goes the saying — one that now seems like a relic of simpler times. Today, President Trump is sticking with his own facts — his claim that the Obama administration wiretapped him during the election — in the face of testimony to the contrary by the F.B.I. director, James Comey. When asked about the accusations Mr. Trump had made on Twitter, Mr. Comey told a Senate committee on Monday, “I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the F.B.I.” Other government authorities have come to similar conclusions. But Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said after the hearing that Mr. Trump stood by his wiretap allegations despite Mr. Comey’s testimony. Mr. Trump’s claims may appear to his opponents to have been embarrassingly debunked. But social science research suggests that Mr. Trump’s alternative version of reality may appeal to his supporters.

627,"On your new show, “Believer,” you examine niche, sometimes extreme, global religious traditions. Do you think this is the best time for a show like this? It is the most perfect time possible. There is no medium on this earth that has more power to transform the way that people think about others than television. You received some backlash after the first episode, in which you featured a Hindu sect that engaged in cannibalism, and critics called it sensationalist. You have to admit you couldn’t have filmed that without thinking, This is going to make good television. Of course. It is actually a relatively brief part of the episode, and you come to a fairly profound conclusion about Hinduism, but people didn’t really talk about that. Do you think TV is an ideal place to educate people about different religions? Can it accommodate nuance? Look at what’s happening with Islamophobia or anti-Semitism: 1 percent of the population of America is Muslim. Two percent is Jewish. You could very likely be born, raised, grow old and die in America without ever once setting eyes upon a Muslim or a Jew. And so the only Muslims or Jews that you will ever be exposed to are the ones on television. If bigotry is a result of fear and not ignorance, then to me that becomes the medium through which to dispel fear of the other. You were raised Muslim, but you briefly departed from the faith in your youth and ended up having an “intellectual conversion” back to Islam as an adult. What did that look like? I grew up in Iran in a fairly secularized Muslim family. We came to the United States, and for the first time I realized that my religious faith was an issue. This was a time of tremendous anti-Muslim and anti-Iranian sentiment in the U.S. because of the Iran hostage crisis. I separated myself as much as possible from my culture and religion and converted to Christianity in high school. Once you’re a Christian, that’s your “you belong here” card. Apparently because you didn’t want people to know that you were from Iran, you used to tell people you were Mexican. Yeah, that tells you how little I knew about America. I didn’t realize you guys don’t like Mexicans either. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/magazine/reza-aslan-thinks-tv-can-end-bigotry.html?searchResultPosition=103

efore I set sail with Tim and Karen Bartel on their 52-foot Bluewater yacht, Let It Ride, I didn’t tend to think of water as a place. I learned my geography by that wooden map of the United States — the jigsaw puzzle of the lower 48 with the inset Hawaii and Alaska to the side. The puzzle-piece states were the places to go, and everything else was just negative space. You could not visit the compass rose in the corner, nor the unvarnished pine off the coast of Oahu. The winding Mississippi and proboscoid Great Lakes gave shape to the puzzle but didn’t qualify as destinations themselves. In a nation transfixed by the dream of the road trip, a river is just a reason for a tunnel or a bridge. But if you let your eyes go blurry, you might imagine the inverse — the young woman hidden in the profile of the old hag. Inland water isn’t merely a breach in the freeway, but an intricate arterial network of its own, explorable by boat if you happen to have one. By this reverse image, the eastern half of the United States is an island, circumnavigable by water across the Great Lakes, down the Mississippi and into the Gulf of Mexico, then back up north along the shores of the Atlantic. In 2016, some 150 boaters circled the length of this so-called Great Loop — setting sail from any point along the way and crossing their own wakes about 6,000 miles later. These Loopers, as they call themselves, are mostly retirees traveling as couples, on boats named things like Living Life and Last Chance. The culture coalesces around the A.G.L.C.A. — America’s Great Loop Cruisers’ Association — a club and online forum for all things Great Loop. I emailed the A.G.L.C.A.’s director in search of a boat to take me aboard for a couple of days. The Bartels, sight unseen, said they would let me ride along as they knocked off the Central Florida leg of their Loop. I had never traveled the United States by water. Tim and Karen are in their mid-50s and wear Crocs and a lot of boat-themed shirts. They began in Ohio on Sept. 2 and set out from Fairport Harbor, bound for Fairport Harbor. Traveling Lake Erie up into Lake Huron, their boat continued north along Michigan’s shore, rounding the mitten at Mackinac Island before heading south around Charlevoix. Lake Michigan carried them into Chicago. From there, they passed through a chute of widening waters: the Calumet, the Illinois, the Mississippi. At Kimmswick, Mo., almost all Loopers stop at Hoppie’s, the last marina with gas until the Tennessee. Their progress from there was a series of detours — up the Cumberland, onto the Tennessee, to the Tenn-Tom — leading them eventually into the Gulf of Mexico near Mobile, Ala. Along the shores of the gulf, there is a fork in the Loop where a boat must either circle the Florida Peninsula or cut across the state by the Okeechobee Waterway. Each route is preceded by the same open-water crossing: 200 miles from a small town on the panhandle called Apalachicola, through the gulf into Clearwater harbor. Tim and Karen crossed the gulf with another boat called Shell Bell, piloted by two Loopers who had done this leg before. They ran Let It Ride for 25 hours straight, taking turns napping in the cabin below. This was the longest Karen ever manned the wheel — alone for three hours, trailing Shell Bell’s light. Tim woke as the lip of a thick fog unfurled, and together they followed the radar to port. From Clearwater, they floated down to the start of the Okeechobee canal in Fort Myers. When I arrived at the marina in Fort Myers on Feb. 15, they had been living on the water for more than five months.

629,"The general who oversees the United States’ atomic weapons arsenal has expressed concern over what he described as “much more aggressive” behavior by Russia in recent years, saying it justifies the need for a strengthened and modernized nuclear deterrent force in this country. Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein of the Air Force made the remarks against the backdrop of a reassessment by the Trump administration of American nuclear policy, including whether nuclear disarmament, as advocated in 2010 under President Barack Obama, is a realistic goal. General Weinstein, the deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration, said in an interview on Tuesday with editors at The New York Times that he believed that history had shown that nuclear deterrence had basically kept the peace between the major powers since the end of World War II. The general expressed confidence that the United States’ nuclear arsenal remained effective, saying, “I sleep very well at night.” But like an aging vehicle, the general said, the arsenal is overdue for an overhaul. “When you look at our deterrent, it was really built in the 1960s,” he said, and was last updated in the 1980s. “It should have happened in 2000 and 2001,” the general said, but “obviously our country was a little bit busy in 2001 based on another horrific act.” Although the Obama administration spoke of its aspiration to eliminate nuclear weapons around the world, it did designate tens of billions of dollars to upgrade nuclear laboratories and prolong the lives of aging warheads.

632,"DALLAS — Before taking office, Donald J. Trump pledged that his business empire would forgo new deals abroad while he was president. But as the Trump Organization unveils a new brand of hotels, that promise is not preventing the company from bringing foreign deals home. The company, now largely run by Mr. Trump’s eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., has been pursuing a downtown Dallas hotel project with a real estate firm that has deep Turkish roots. The hotel, if built, would fall under the Trump Organization’s Scion chain, a more affordable alternative to its five-star luxury line. An examination by The New York Times of records including corporation registrations, private emails and archived websites found that Alterra Worldwide, the real estate firm that would own the hotel and be partners with the Trumps, has business ties in Russia, Kazakhstan and at least two dozen other countries. Ordinarily, such international experience would be a selling point for the firm, but it is a complicating factor when dealing with Mr. Trump’s company, where concerns already have been raised internally about some of Alterra’s foreign connections. These revelations show that as the Trump Organization rolls out its new hotel line across the country — properties that the Trumps will manage and their partners will own — a partnership with Alterra may invite the foreign entanglements and potential conflicts of interest that the company said it sought to avoid in its international dealings. Alterra’s president, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, is a familiar face in Dallas, where he has recruited foreign investment to other developments that earned praise from city officials. Mr. Sarimsakci — who goes by Mike, or, alternatively, the “Turkish Trump” — is also listed on an expert consultant website charging $465 an hour for advice on doing business in such countries as Iran, Mexico and Nigeria. And he has counseled the governments of Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Sudan and Georgia, among others, on renewable energy, he acknowledged to The Times. His brother and longtime business partner, Yusuf Sarimsakci, has helped oversee numerous developments around the world, including the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow near the Kremlin, the hotel where Mr. Trump stayed in 2013 while his Miss Universe pageant came to town. On that project, Yusuf worked with a wealthy Kazakh businessman who has ties to the strong-arm leader of that country.

633,"WASHINGTON — Judge Neil M. Gorsuch continued to be questioned Wednesday at his confirmation hearing, but the real struggle over his nomination to the Supreme Court is already well on its way to the Senate floor. Republicans reveled in the nominee’s gaffe-free performance — one Democrats found a tad too scripted and stuffed with a lot of gollys and gees — and are ready to move ahead as quickly as they can. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, was emphatic Tuesday that Mr. Gorsuch would be seated on the Supreme Court before the Senate leaves for its April recess in two weeks. At the same time, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accused Judge Gorsuch of being evasive in his testimony, which stretched more than 10 hours. He insisted that the nomination would require 60 votes for approval when Republicans hold just a 52-seat majority and not a single Democratic senator has committed to supporting him. Those conflicting positions provide the inflammatory ingredients for a floor showdown. Mr. McConnell seemed to be laying the groundwork for a move to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on Supreme Court nominees if Democrats hold firm. “If Judge Gorsuch can’t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?” Mr. McConnell asked.

Matt Bevin of Kentucky was unrestrained in his praise for President Trump: Opening for him at a rally on Monday, Mr. Bevin, a conservative Republican, echoed Mr. Trump’s “America First” slogan and only gently noted the nagging divisions in their party. “We now have a president and a Congress that are united in party, and yet we still have disagreements among us,” Mr. Bevin said, insisting, “This is healthy and good.” In private, Mr. Bevin has been blunter about the party’s disagreements. Just days before appearing with Mr. Trump in Louisville, he joined a conference call with the president’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, to protest a White House proposal to defund the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development agency that spans 13 states and steers millions of dollars in federal money to Kentucky. Mr. Bevin was not alone in his dismay. As Mr. Trump and his advisers press for bone-deep cuts to the federal budget, Republican governors have rapidly emerged as an influential bloc of opposition. They have complained to the White House about reductions they see as harmful or arbitrary, and they plan to pressure members of Congress from their states to oppose them. Of acute concern to Republicans are a handful of low-profile programs aimed at job training and economic revitalization, including regional development agencies like the Appalachian commission and the Delta Regional Authority, which serves eight Southern and Midwestern states, seven of them with Republican governors. They are also protective of grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a $3.4 billion job training program funded through the Labor Department. Mr. Trump’s budget office has proposed to eliminate or deeply slash funding for all of those programs, along with dozens of others.

635,"They are two of the nation’s pre-eminent playwrights. Each has won nearly every award their field has to offer, including the Pulitzer Prize. Each has written works that are staged around the world and have become required reading in college classes. And each has earned an admired position in the academy, teaching aspiring dramatists at Ivy League institutions. One milestone, however, has long eluded Paula Vogel and Lynn Nottage: Broadway. This spring, their conspicuous absence comes to an end. “Sweat,” Ms. Nottage’s timely exploration of stressed relationships among a group of friends in a working-class city battered by industrial layoffs, opens Sunday, March 26, at Studio 54; “Indecent,” Ms. Vogel’s retrospective dramatization of the rise and fall of a play deemed scandalous during an ill-fated journey from the Yiddish theater to Broadway, opens April 18 at the Cort Theater. “It’s about damn time,” said Marsha Norman, also a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and co-director of the Juilliard playwrights program, who called Ms. Vogel and Ms. Nottage “the heroes of generations of women writers and readers, actors and audiences.” She added, “Thank you, universe.” The fact that these two writers are just now making their Broadway debuts raises uncomfortable questions for the theater industry, which season after season sees plays by men vastly outnumber plays by women in the all-important commercial spaces where money can be made, reputations burnished and Tony Awards won. “Indecent” and “Sweat” are the only new plays by women this Broadway season; by contrast, there are eight new plays by men (none of whom has credentials comparable to those of Ms. Vogel and Ms. Nottage). The disparity is sometimes worse; in 2013-14 there were no new plays by women. Such imbalance remains a striking incongruity for Broadway, where an estimated 67 percent of the audience is women.

638,"WASHINGTON — For weeks, President Trump has insisted that President Barack Obama tapped his phones even as the F.B.I. director and members of Mr. Trump’s own party said there was no evidence for his charge. But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump got an assist from a powerful House Republican who said the president or his closest associates may have been “incidentally” swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, introduced the new claim into the deepening controversy over Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Yet Mr. Nunes also told reporters on Wednesday that he had no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claim that he was directly or personally wiretapped. Democrats quickly denounced the disclosure and said it bolstered the need for an independent investigation to replace the House inquiry being led by Mr. Nunes. Mr. Trump responded positively to Mr. Nunes’s remarks. “I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found,” the president told reporters at the White House, evidently referring to sources Mr. Nunes said he would not name. Mr. Trump said he felt vindicated, up to a point. “I somewhat do,” he said. Mr. Nunes acknowledged that the incidental intelligence gathering on Trump associates — during the presidential transition late last year, when Mr. Obama was in office — was not necessarily unlawful. American intelligence agencies typically monitor foreign officials of allied and hostile countries, and they routinely sweep up communications linked to Americans who may be taking part in the conversation or are being spoken about. The real issue, Mr. Nunes told reporters, was that he could figure out the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. He said some Trump associates were also identified by name in the reports. Normally, intelligence agencies mask the identities of American citizens who are incidentally present in intercepted communications.

639,"WASHINGTON — Hundreds of Syrian fighters and their American military advisers, backed by American artillery and attack helicopters, have begun a major operation to cut off the western approaches to Raqqa, the city the Islamic State has proclaimed as its capital, officials said Wednesday. It was the first time that the United States had carried out an air assault with Syrian fighters in its campaign against the Islamic State, and the mission, which began Tuesday, reflected the leeway the Trump administration has given its commanders to carry out operations without prolonged review in Washington. In a significant commitment of American forces, American helicopters ferried fighters across enemy lines while Marine Corps howitzers, Army Apache attack helicopters and American warplanes provided firepower for the operation. Army surface-to-surface Himars rockets, which are based in northern Syria, are also part of the mission. American Special Operations forces were advising the Syrian fighters on the ground, although a military spokesman said they were not involved in direct, front-line combat. The mission represented a new stage in the broader offensive to cut off and seize Raqqa. Its objective was to take control of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River near Lake Assad, the nearby town of Tabqa and a local airfield. An immediate goal was to take the dam intact, but the structure was still under the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and officials said that the fighting was intense. “The fighting is raging on as I speak and is expected to last several weeks until the dam, airfield and city are free from ISIS control,” said Col. Joseph E. Scrocca, a spokesman for the American-led command in Baghdad. As the operation unfolded, Syrian state television and local residents asserted that at least 30 Syrian civilians were killed in an airstrike that hit a school where they had taken shelter in a rural area of Raqqa Province on Tuesday.

641,"WASHINGTON — Schools may not settle for minimal educational progress by disabled students, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday, rejecting a standard that some lower courts have applied, and that the nominee to join the high court, Neil M. Gorsuch, has been criticized for using. The federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act requires “free appropriate public education” for all children. In multiple cases, the federal Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, has held that the law demands little “more than de minimis” — merely a program intended for a student to show some annual gains. “It cannot be the case that the Act typically aims for grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who can be educated in the regular classroom, but is satisfied with barely more than de minimis progress for those who cannot,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for a unanimous court. “When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing ‘merely more than de minimis’ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,” he wrote. “The IDEA demands more. It requires an educational program reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child’s circumstances.” In a 2008 ruling, Judge Gorsuch, who sits on the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, applied the “de minimis” standard in rejecting a parents’ claim that a school’s provisions for their autistic child were inadequate. Since Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court by President Trump, some Democrats have cited that and other opinions as evidence that the judge hews to an extreme conservative philosophy. At about the same time that Chief Justice Roberts was announcing the decision on Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch was questioned about the issue in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The United States attorney’s office in Los Angeles has been examining the extent to which the North Korea government aided and abetted the bold heist in February 2016, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. In the theft, the attackers, using a global payment messaging system known as Swift, were able to persuade the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to move money from the Bangladesh bank to accounts in the Philippines. The Swift system is used by some 11,000 banks and companies to transfer money from one country to another. In the months that followed the Bangladesh heist, it was disclosed that cyberthieves had also attacked banks in Vietnam and Ecuador using Swift. North Korea’s involvement in the attack on the Bangladesh bank had not been publicly known until The New York Times reported last May that security researchers had found evidence that pointed to the country. The researchers discovered that a rare piece of code used in the theft had also been used in the hacking attack on Sony Pictures in December 2014. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles are also investigating the Sony breach, and what they uncovered in that inquiry led them to examine the bank theft.

he scientist cried when he saw the evidence” — that was the detail from our article about the death and bleaching of Australia’s magnificent Great Barrier Reef that a former New York Times colleague grabbed onto and tweeted out. To some, the story was about climate change and the fragility of underwater ecosystems. To others, it was an emotional tale of life and avoidable death, of beauty lost to human failure. Our editors seemed to have both elements in mind; they pushed Justin Gillis and I to add more detail about why damage to the reef mattered, leading us to explain that the death of coral reefs worldwide could rob the world of not just colorful creatures, but also tourism income and human lives because of all the millions of people who get their protein primarily from reef fish. That editorial challenge — how to make people think deeply about subjects that may seem dense, or just distant — can be found embedded in much of the best work The Times produces.

645,"WASHINGTON — Paul Ryan’s plan to replace Obamacare is headed to the House floor on Thursday for a vote that, even now, could go either way. That may sound surprising since Republicans have a sizable majority in the House. But if you’ve been following the debate over their replacement plan, the American Health Care Act, you know that, as harsh as it is, it’s not draconian enough for some members of Speaker Ryan’s party. In an attempt to win over those lawmakers, the Republican leadership has offered ideas to restrict coverage even further. One of the worst is a Medicaid work requirement. That may sound sensible to conservatives who, contrary to evidence, believe that Medicaid receipt discourages work. But it’s a mistake. Not only would this proposal make an already punishing bill even harsher, but it also constitutes an unnecessary add-on that has nothing to do with the purpose of Medicaid. Most poor people who can work do: A recent study of adults affected by Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, for example, found that 87 percent of able-bodied beneficiaries were working, looking for work or in school. Of the remaining 13 percent, it found, “three-quarters report they are not working in order to care for family members and the rest report other reasons, like being laid off.” Most other able-bodied people already receiving Medicaid before the expansion are also working, raising the question of what problem, exactly, the proposed requirement is meant to solve.

646,"WASHINGTON — The House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act faced an uncertain fate on Wednesday as conservative Republicans pushed to eliminate federal requirements that health insurance plans provide certain benefits to consumers. House Republican leaders met with members of their party late into the night on Wednesday as they struggled to muster support for the bill, scheduled for a vote on the House floor on Thursday. President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, worked through the day to placate conservative House Republicans who said that the bill did not do enough to lower health insurance costs by reducing federal regulations. The legislation would roll back major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a significantpillar of President Barack Obama’s legacy. But in trying to satisfy conservatives, the Trump administration and House Republican leaders risked jeopardizing support for the bill among more moderate Republicans. On the eve of the crucial vote, party leaders appeared to be short of a majority and were working into the night to whip their members into line. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, expressed optimism on Wednesday night that talks with Republican leaders would lead to revisions to the bill. “We’re encouraged tonight, just based on the real willingness of not only the White House, but our leadership, to make this bill better,” Mr. Meadows said, crediting the personal involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence.

647,"WASHINGTON — In his final day of questioning at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch continued to answer with practiced generalities on Wednesday, frustrating Democrats who seemed unable to rattle him or pin him down. “You have been very much able to avoid any specificity like no one I have seen before,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “And maybe that’s a virtue, I don’t know. But for us on this side, knowing where you stand on major questions of the day is really important to a vote.” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said he was searching to find “a beating heart and an independent streak” behind Judge Gorsuch’s testimony. After trying over a span of 20 hours over two days, Democrats were not able to move Judge Gorsuch off script. Instead, interest in the hearing seemed to wane, and many in the Capitol came to view a confirmation as inevitable. Judge Gorsuch managed to endure as much by what he did not say as by what he did. Most Supreme Court nominees are fairly reticent, but Democrats said Judge Gorsuch outdid the last two Republican appointees, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. They gave their views on seminal Supreme Court decisions, said Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. “We’ve had justices nominated by Republican presidents who have been willing to discuss past precedent,” Mr. Leahy said. “I was just kind of hoping you would be as transparent as these prior nominees were.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/politics/supreme-court-confirmation-neil-gorsuch.html?searchResultPosition=60
648,"President Trump’s Homeland Security Department turned its immigration purge — and assault on the Constitution — up a notch this week. It posted the first of what it says will be weekly online reports identifying state and local law enforcement agencies that decline its requests to keep immigrants in jail to give federal agents time to pick them up. The idea is to name and shame these agencies, accusing them of recklessly loosing dangerous aliens onto the streets. The report, on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website, trumpets itself as a “Public Safety Advisory.” It includes a grim warning from the acting ICE director, Thomas Homan, about the agency’s requests, called detainers: “When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission.” The accusation is dishonest. The report is a sham. And the claim of protecting public safety is ridiculous — dangerously so. When local authorities decline to honor ICE detainers, they can have any number of good reasons for doing so. A likely one is the Fourth Amendment, which forbids imprisoning anyone without justification. If a police department is about to release someone who posts bail, it can’t prolong the detention — in essence, arrest that person again — just because ICE asks it to. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the local police cannot be forced to honor a detainer in violation of the Constitution. That is, without an arrest warrant from a judge. Which an ICE detainer is not. Beyond the constitutional problems lies an argument about public safety, which also finds the Trump administration on the wrong side of the facts, in service of a campaign of fear. Mr. Trump has been trying to make Americans fear unauthorized immigrants. He has succeeded in making these immigrants terrified of him, having declared open season on the undocumented, in effect making every one of 11 million people a priority for deportation. Nobody — not parents of citizen children, not students, not those with clean records and deep American roots — is above suspicion or safe from arrest.

Now he is contending with a thicket of ethical and legal considerations as his former boss — Donald J. Trump — serves as president. But Mr. Danziger, previously a top executive at such huge brands as Wyndham and Starwood, is plowing ahead with plans for the company’s new Scion chain of hotels. These hotels will offer a four-star alternative to the company’s five-star luxury properties. Already, Mr. Danizger said, the company has signed some 30 letters of intent with potential developers in places such as Cincinnati, Nashville and Valley Forge, Pa. The partners would own the hotels while the Trump company brands and manages them. None of the deals have been completed, and all are subject to the approval of an outside ethics adviser. One of the potential deals — to build a Scion hotel in downtown Dallas — has already led to questions about the international connections of the local partner. Last week, Mr. Danziger spoke to The New York Times about Scion and the issues that the new hotels present for the company. Below are excerpts from the interview. How closely involved are Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump in Scion and in meeting with partners? Very much. And when Ivanka was involved, too. That’s why I joined this company.

Mr. Trump mischaracterized the London mayor’s remarks. Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as “part of living in a big city,” as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was “part and parcel of living in a great global city.” “That means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities; it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice,” Mr. Khan said in a video interview published by The Evening Standard, another British paper.

652,"LONG BEACH, Calif. — In recent weeks, Dr. J. Mario Molina has anxiously approached lawmakers on Capitol Hill and governors across the country, warning them that the Republican efforts to overhaul the health care system could be devastating for insurers and patients alike. As head of the California company founded by his father, Dr. Molina has become one of the few insurance executives publicly criticizing the House bill, which he believes could strip away coverage for millions of their clients and cause considerable turmoil for the insurance industry. The major insurers have mostly stayed silent during the debate, supporting some of the Republicans’ provisions that promise near-term stability for the insurance exchanges and a repeal of a tax on health insurance. But while big insurers like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna have already largely abandoned the individual marketplaces, Molina Healthcare has been a mainstay of the current federal health care law, offering Medicaid plans in 12 states and Puerto Rico. It has signed up about one million customers in the state marketplaces, and more than doubled its revenue in the last three years to nearly $18 billion. But now Dr. Molina, a Democrat who took over Molina Healthcare in 1996 and runs it with his brother and sister, is warily watching the Republicans’ bill in the House as it comes to an expected vote on Thursday. Provisions that would cap federal funding for Medicaid to the states or cut subsidies for lower-income people threaten to upend some of the markets where Molina and other insurers have been trying to cement a baseline clientele. Insisting that he is not bluffing, Dr. Molina said that his company might also have to abandon the individual market after this year because so much is in flux. The Senate has yet to debate measures that could deeply affect insurers, and Molina Healthcare just reported to investors last month that it lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 2016 because of what Dr. Molina, its chief executive, called flawed federal funding formulas. While the exit of other insurers has been problematic, a withdrawal by Molina “would be hugely damaging,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University.

Judge Gorsuch may be another Antonin Scalia, but we are already accustomed to having that kind of “originalist” on the court. While I struggle with the originalist philosophy in the face of an ever-changing world, I think of Judge Gorsuch as the lesser of many other potential evils. It is a hopeless endeavor to try to get him to tip his hand on his views of the controversial issues of the day. But he seems to be smart, and we know he is experienced. He is certainly not on the lunatic fringe. He is by far the best nominee for any post that Mr. Trump has so far put forth.

Why, then, should confirmation hearings proceed for a Supreme Court nominee chosen by a president who is under a cloud of suspicion? The only sensible step is to delay hearings until it can be determined that the choice of Judge Neil Gorsuch was made by a legitimate president. Senate Republicans have to date had no issue with having a lengthy vacancy on the court. Democrats have a sound basis other than tit-for-tat to delay the Gorsuch hearings.

658,"LONDON — “The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts,” George Eliot wrote in “Middlemarch.” On Thursday, in a statement to the House of Commons about the attack that had occurred right outside Parliament the day before, Prime Minister Theresa May echoed that sentiment, paying tribute to the “millions of acts of normality” that are the most powerful weapons against extremist violence. This was London’s counterattack: to show that it takes more than a murderous rampage through Westminster to shut down this mighty city. Somber but undaunted, members of Parliament of all parties expressed their admiration for the courage of the police, doctors and nurses who had responded with such speed and vigor, rushing to help those who had been mowed down by car on Westminster Bridge. Five people died in the attack: a London teacher, an American visitor and a 75-year-old man; a police officer, Keith Palmer; and the attacker, who has been identified as a 52-year-old Briton, Khalid Masood. As many as 40 people were injured, several of whom remain in critical condition. The deputy speaker of the House, Lindsay Hoyle, voiced the feelings of all his colleagues when he described Constable Palmer as “one of our village policemen.” Westminster is indeed a village, and, as a commentator on Britain’s political scene, I treat it as my professional workplace. For all its architectural grandeur, it is really a noisy souk, a forum for gossip, ideas and haggling. Shortly before the attack, I had been to see a cabinet minister who was worried about a “difficult year ahead” for the government. When I returned, Parliament Square had been closed off by the police and the traffic was gridlocked. The sirens of ambulances told their own distressing story. “You’d think they’d have sorted it out, for God’s sake,” a taxi driver complained out of his open window, to nobody in particular. As callous as that might sound, it was the authentic voice of London: unfazed, querulous, eccentric. The city’s cabbies are more fearful of traffic than they are of “nutters with knives” (another Londonism I overheard as I walked across Vauxhall Bridge, trying to find a way home). Here’s what really counts: By Thursday morning, London was, if not quite back to normal, then certainly back in business. As I traveled through the south of the city, up to Chelsea and later over to King’s Cross, Londoners really were going about their lives as on any other day.

The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t mandate paid leave. “There’s massive distrust of federal government mandates in the United States,” said Joan Williams, director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings. “Support for paid leave is depressed by the overall hostility to government.” In a first, presidential candidates from both parties talked supportively about paid leave, but the Trump administration’s proposal, led by Ivanka Trump, faces hurdles because of deep divisions about what the policy should look like.

It is almost the end of March, and so far, the United Nations has received less than a tenth of the money — $423 million, according to its Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The funding appeal, and the paltry response, comes as the Trump administration is poised to make sharp cuts to its foreign aid budget, including for the United Nations. Historically, the United States has been the agency’s largest single donor for humanitarian aid. For all four countries at risk — Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen — the United States has given $277 million so far this year, not all of it for famine relief. The conditions for famine are specific and not easy to meet, which is why the last time a famine was declared was in Somalia in July 2011, after 260,000 had died of hunger and related complications. The three criteria for declaring a famine are when one in five households in a certain area face extreme food shortages; more than 30 percent of the population is acutely malnourished; and at least two people for every 10,000 die each day. A famine has already been declared in a swath of South Sudan. A similar risk looms over Somalia, still reeling from years of conflict, and Yemen, where Houthi insurgents are battling a Saudi-led coalition supported by the United States and Britain.

Illustrated. 315 pages. Pantheon. $26.95. “One test of un homme sérieux,” Christopher Hitchens wrote, “is that it is possible to learn from him even when one radically disagrees with him.” By this measure, Camille Paglia is une femme sérieuse indeed. Her best book remains her first, “Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence From Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson” (1990), a surprise academic-press best seller about decadence in Western art. It grew out of her doctoral dissertation at Yale, where her mentor was Harold Bloom. If you’ve forgotten “Sexual Personae,” or have never read it, Paglia helpfully reprints a few chunks of it in her new essay collection, “Free Women, Free Men: Sex, Gender, Feminism.” These chunks are fiercely erudite, freewheeling and sex-drenched. Nothing else in this collection can touch them. Paglia’s second-best book is “Break, Blow, Burn: Camille Paglia Reads Forty-Three of the World’s Best Poems” (2006). Her exegeses are prickly and acute, the Helen Vendler-meets-Patti Smith grad seminar you wanted but never quite got. One reason Paglia gets under people’s skin is that she has no sacred cows. Reviewing “Break, Blow, Burn” in The New York Times Book Review, Clive James got at why she made some readers uncomfortable. “The most threatening thing about her, from the American viewpoint, is that she refuses to treat the arts as an instrument of civil rights,” he wrote. “Without talent, no entitlement.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/books/review-camille-paglia-free-women-free-men.html?searchResultPosition=15

American and Israeli officials refused to say how many of those threats the suspect was accused of making. And some recent anti-Semitic acts were apparently committed by others, like threats against Jewish centers for which a Missouri man was charged, and the vandalizing of Jewish cemeteries. But officials made it clear that they considered the teenager, who lived in the Ashkelon area of southern Israel, to be the primary source of the threats, though they did not offer a motive. “This is the guy we are talking about,” an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said. The suspect made threats to sites in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States, and to at least one commercial airline flight, prompting an emergency landing, Mr. Rosenfeld said. A judge ordered the suspect, who has not been charged, held until at least March 30 and ordered a medical examination. His father was ordered held for eight days, on suspicion that he might have been aware of the threats, or even been involved.

Members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus emerged from a negotiating session with President Trump without an agreement on changes to Republican’s health care bill that would satisfy them. But they were closer. “We’re certainly trying to get to ‘yes,’” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. “We’ve made very reasonable requests and we’re hopeful that those reasonable requests will be listened to and ultimately agreed to.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the president had agreed to the conservatives’ demands that the bill strip out a set of “essential benefits” required of insurance policies by the Affordable Care Act.

667,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee’s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber. As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump’s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation. While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch. The Senate’s “cloture” rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster. “After careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court,” Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuch’s record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence, adding, “My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.” Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster — a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions. If Democrats band together, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has threatened to pursue the so-called nuclear option eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court selections. Mr. Trump has urged Mr. McConnell to take that step if necessary. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/democrats-filibuster-neil-gorsuch-nomination.html?searchResultPosition=29
668,"Like or loathe Donald J. Trump, you have to give him this: He’s done more to shine a spotlight on the loopholes and fundamental unfairness of the tax code than any other American president. In doing so, he’s made a powerful case for tax reform, though perhaps not quite along the lines he has in mind. This, of course, has happened despite Mr. Trump’s strenuous efforts to conceal his returns, reneging on a campaign promise to release them at some point, and defying a decades-long tradition in which presidential candidates have made public, at minimum, their recent tax returns. What we’re left with are scraps from Mr. Trump’s voluminous tax filings that have been leaked to the news media by anonymous sources: his federal Form 1040 from 2005, disclosed last week by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, and a few pages of his 1995 state tax returns, which include some data from that year’s 1040, revealed by The New York Times last fall. Flimsy and incomplete as they are, those returns nonetheless contain some startling revelations. Last week’s disclosure, on the face of it, was pretty tame: In 2005 Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, paid $38.4 million in federal tax, or about 25 percent of a reported income of nearly $153 million. So for at least one year, Mr. Trump did pay a substantial amount in federal tax, and he made a lot of money — two claims he has made before that were greeted with a fair amount of skepticism. But scratch the surface, and a far more complicated and troubling picture emerges. On the line for “other income,” the Trumps reported negative $103 million. Tax experts told me that is almost certainly what was left of the $916 million loss reported on the 1995 returns reported by The Times, an amount that could be carried over and used to offset income in future years.

669,"Of the 860,000 Nebraskans who cast ballots in last fall’s election, only two are suspected of casting fraudulent votes. But while the actual number of illegal voters may be minuscule, State Senator John Murante says, there is an even better reason for Nebraska’s Legislature to crack down on fraud at the ballot box. “First and foremost, we know the confidence that Americans and Nebraskans have in the election system is at an all-time low,” said Mr. Murante, a Republican who is backing a constitutional amendment that would require all voters to display photo IDs. “The perception exists that voter fraud is a serious issue, and that perception itself has to be addressed.” Nationwide, Republican state legislators are again sponsoring a sheaf of bills tightening requirements to register and to vote. And while they have traditionally argued that such laws are needed to police rampant voter fraud — a claim most experts call unfounded — some are now saying the perception of fraud, real or otherwise, is an equally serious problem, if not worse. Given Republicans’ history of raising undocumented claims of fraud, Democrats and voting rights advocates say that citing perceptions of tainted ballots as a reason for voting restrictions is disingenuous at best. “It seems strange that someone who created the problem of perception then says we have to solve the problem, when there is no problem,” said Lloyd Leonard, the advocacy director for the League of Women Voters, which has sued to block a number of restrictive voting laws.

670,"STOCKHOLM — Global warming is a scientific fact as much as the hole in the ozone layer or Earth’s orbit around the sun. Global temperature records have been broken three years running. Arctic Sea ice is declining rapidly. Sea levels are rising. For some societies, such as small island nations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, environmental havoc is not a distant threat. It has arrived. To reduce the risk of a global environmental catastrophe, and to avoid reversing the course of human progress, the world must urgently bend the curve of global emissions away from fossil fuels. Global warming must be kept below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit); beyond that we will face major social and economic consequences. The math to keep the increase below that critical level doesn’t get much simpler. Emissions must peak no later than 2020, and we must reach a fossil-fuel-free world economy by 2050. National pledges made for the Paris Climate Agreement fall short. Indeed, the political landscape is dominated by governments willing to make only incremental progress: two steps forward and one step back, or giant leaps back, in the case of the United States, where President Trump has threatened to retreat from international climate action and has proposed devastating cuts in funding for climate science and international collaboration. The vast divide between what is necessary and what politicians are willing to do leaves many scientists nervous that we could blow our last chance to reduce the grave risk to our environment and world stability. Still, there are good reasons for cautious optimism. Despite the halting progress made by politicians, history shows that the modern world has been shaped by major moments of disruption. Think about the recent United States election, Brexit, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the rapid advances made in the technology sector in recent decades.

The Story of Beauty, Inequality, and the Struggle for Oral Health in America
By Mary Otto
291 pp. The New Press. $26.95. Politicians, journalists and researchers have a long-running problem when it comes to talking about class. The definitions we use are myriad and not always overlapping. Is the boundary of the middle class a college degree, a certain level of income? Perhaps a certain type of job: a teacher or a doctor versus a coal miner or factory worker? We might be missing a still more useful — and more personal — indicator, however. This is the premise, though not so bluntly stated, of Mary Otto’s new book, “Teeth: The Story of Beauty, Inequality, and the Struggle for Oral Health in America.” The dividing line between the classes might be starkest between those who spend thousands of dollars on a gleaming smile and those who suffer and even die from preventable tooth decay. If the idea of death from tooth decay is shocking, it might be because we so rarely talk about the condition of our teeth as a serious health issue. Instead, we think of our teeth as the ultimate personal responsibility. We fear the dentist because we fear judgment as well as pain; we are used to the implication that if we have a tooth problem, if our teeth are decaying or crooked or yellow, it is because we have failed, and failed at something so intimate that it means we ourselves are failures. Otto’s book begins and ends with the story of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died of an infection caused by one decaying tooth, and the system that failed him. In pointing out the flaws in that system, Otto takes us back through the history of dentistry and shows us how the dental profession evolved, separately from the rest of health care, into a mostly private industry that revolves almost entirely around one’s ability to pay. In other words, all of the problems with health care in America exist in the dental system, but exponentially more so. On the high end of the $110 billion-a-year dental industry, there are veneers for $1,000 each, “gum contouring” and more than $1 billion per year spent on tooth whitening products. A dentist tells Otto that members of his profession “once exclusively focused upon fillings and extractions, are nowadays considered providers of beauty.” And thanks to decades of deregulation, allowing medical advertising and then medical credit cards, they are doing well at it — according to a 2010 study, dentists make more per hour than doctors.

Vance, through his decision to move back to Ohio to help citizens in need (“Why I’m Moving Home,” Op-Ed, March 16), exemplifies a great bipartisan American tradition: acknowledging personal fortune and giving back to community. Yet Mr. Vance’s exercise of J.F.K.’s plea to “ask what you can do for your country” is increasingly rare among the conservative elite. The presidency is being used to increase Trump family fortunes; Republican leaders cheer destruction of public services, from Steve Bannon’s purported wish to destroy the “administrative state” to Grover Norquist’s goal of drowning the American government in a bathtub; and Republican members of Congress bitterly denounce those taxes that pay for public protections and social programs while simultaneously lying to their own voters about everything from climate change to Obamacare.

Today is a big day in the House of Representatives — and for millions of Americans at risk of losing their health insurance. House Republicans are planning to bring up their health care bill for a vote, and it’s not clear whether the bill will pass. A quick summary: The bill would take away health insurance from an estimated 24 million people and raise costs for many older Americans. It would channel the savings into large tax cuts for the affluent. House leaders considered late changes to the bill Wednesday night, which would worsen it even further by cutting benefits for mental health services and pregnancy, among other things. And the leaders won’t wait for a full analysis of the changes by the Congressional Budget Office before voting today. Democrats and a few moderate Republicans — as well as groups representing doctors, nurses, hospitals, retirees and patient groups — oppose the bill, because of its general terribleness. Some conservative Republicans also oppose the bill, because it retains a larger government role in health care than they believe wise. But most Republicans support the bill. To pass, it needs at least 215 of the 237 House Republicans to vote for it. (A bill usually needs 218 votes, but five House seats are vacant and a Democrat may miss the vote in the wake of his wife’s death.)

674,"WASHINGTON — Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of a House panel investigating Russian interference in the presidential election, may have dealt his own inquiry a fatal blow on Wednesday. Armed with intelligence that some Republicans said bolstered President Trump’s widely disputed claim of being wiretapped by the Obama administration, Mr. Nunes bypassed Democrats and went directly to the White House. The new information, Mr. Nunes said, showed that American intelligence agencies monitoring foreign officials may have “incidentally” picked up communications of Trump transition team members. The move angered Democrats who said that Mr. Nunes’s attempt to buttress Mr. Trump’s accusation raised questions about his ability to conduct an impartial bipartisan investigation. The House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, issued a challenge, saying that Mr. Nunes had to decide whether he was chairman of an independent investigation or “is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both.” Mr. Nunes apologized on Thursday to committee members for sharing new information with Mr. Trump and the news media before communicating with Mr. Schiff, according to two Democrats on the committee. Mr. Nunes described his decision as a judgment call. “At the end of the day, sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you make the wrong one,” Mr. Nunes told reporters on Thursday. “But you’ve got to stick by the decisions you make.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/nunes-puts-credibility-of-house-panel-he-leads-in-doubt.html?searchResultPosition=36

In this podcast, the opinion columnist Andrew Rosenthal talks about the news — the good, the bad and the most maddening. Lets get the bad news out of the way. The week’s worst news, says Times columnist Andrew Rosenthal, is that “the Trump administration is well on its way to rolling back all of the progress on climate change that we made under President Obama, which was not all that much, and thereby eliminating any real chance we have for dealing with this planet-killing issue.” The president wants to gut the Environmental Protection Agency — and that’s just the start. “The circus freak show about the Russian connection and the president’s lies about being wiretapped by the Obama administration have to be the most maddening developments in the most maddening two months in modern political history,” says Mr. Rosenthal. When the F.B.I. director and head of the National Security Agency denied there had been wiretaps at Trump Tower, President Trump, says Mr. Rosenthal “began spinning a new conspiracy theory about the F.B.I. director somehow colluding with President Obama about the Russia connection. It’s incomprehensible. It’s ridiculous. But it’s not funny. It’s damaging — to the White House, to the presidency, to the country.” Lastly, the good news. Mr. Rosenthal says it is that “the nation’s Republican governors, who are an indispensable source of support for the Republican Party in general and the president in particular, are starting to push back on the administration’s budget cuts.” He notes that governors have powerful platforms: “If they keep telling the truth about what’s going on in Washington, who knows?

676,"WASHINGTON — President Trump issued an ultimatum on Thursday to recalcitrant Republicans to fall in line behind a broad health insurance overhaul or see their opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act vanish, demanding a Friday vote on a bill that appeared to lack a majority to pass. The demand, issued by his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in an evening meeting with House Republicans, came after a marathon day of negotiating at the White House and in the Capitol in which Mr. Trump — who has boasted of his deal-making prowess — fell short of selling members of his own party on the health plan. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan emerged from the session and announced curtly that Mr. Trump would get his wish for a vote on Friday. Mr. Ryan refused to answer reporters’ questions about whether he expected the measure to pass. Although the House Republicans’ closed-door meeting became a cheerleading session for the bill, their leaders braced for a showdown on the floor, knowing they were likely to be at least a handful of votes short of a majority for the health insurance bill and would need to muscle their colleagues to the last to prevail. Some conservatives were still concerned that the bill was too costly and did not do enough to roll back federal health insurance mandates. Moderates and others, meanwhile, were grappling with worries of their states’ governors and fretted that the loss of benefits would be too much for their constituents to bear.

677,"WASHINGTON — During commercial breaks in “Fox & Friends” and “Saturday Night Live” this month, a peculiar advertisement has flashed across television screens in New York, Washington and West Palm Beach, Fla. In what seems like a parody of a Billy Mays OxiClean commercial, a smiling salesman wielding a white bucket peddles a product he promises will cause the cost of cars, food, clothing and medicine to soar: “The all new BAT tax is specially designed to make your disposable income disappear!” Airing in those locations and during those programs, the ad is clearly meant for the eyes of President Trump. But its creator, the National Retail Federation, wants it to influence Republicans in Congress and voters, too. That’s because the BAT the salesman promotes is the “border adjustment tax” — the keystone of the plan to overhaul the tax code being pitched by House Republicans and spearheaded by Speaker Paul D. Ryan. The commercial is the first strike in what is becoming an outright ad war, the harbinger of a bigger battle over tax policy that may make the current fight over health legislation look tame.

Times headlines often differ in print and online, in part because of variations in presentation and in part because of space. This disparity is always noted at the end of the web version and has been noted since the story was first published in print on Jan. 20. In this case, the article appeared in print with the headline, “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides,” followed by two subheadlines, “Examining Russian Ties” and “Business Dealings of Campaign Advisors Are Investigated.” Online, the headline read, “Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/fact-check-trump-misleads-surveillance-wiretapping.html?searchResultPosition=24

It was specious, libelous and reckless, regardless of the weak revelations of “incidental collection” that the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Trump transition team member Devin Nunes outrageously made public, briefing the president without first briefing his fellow committee members. Nunes’s announcement was a bombshell with no bomb, just enough mud in the water to obscure the blood in the water for those too willfully blind to discern the difference. Second, Donald Trump will never apologize. Trump’s strategy for dealing with being caught in a lie is often to tell a bigger lie. He seems constitutionally incapable of registering what others would: shame, embarrassment, contrition. Something is broken in the man — definitely morally and possibly psychologically. Third, and to me this is the biggest, Comey confirmed that the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to the Russians who tampered with our election is not “fake news” manufactured by Democrats stewing over a bitter loss but a legitimate investigation that has been underway for months and has no end in sight. Individuals who were associated with the president of the United States’ winning campaign are under criminal investigation. That is an extraordinary sentence and one that no American can allow to be swallowed up by other news or dismissed by ideologues. Depending on the outcome of this investigation, we could be facing a constitutional crisis. Oddly, it is likely that the reason Trump is even in the Oval Office is Comey’s original, extraordinarily inappropriate and unprecedented action. The Trump machinery then used that action to scare Americans about Clinton, in one of the most astonishing acts of deflection and hypocrisy in American history.

Reeves, of the Brookings Institution, has been doing research on the persistence of social and economic disadvantage for a long time. He often directs his attention to noncognitive skills. In a 2014 paper, “The Character Factor: Measures and Impact of Drive and Prudence,” Reeves and two co-authors, Kimberly Howard and Joanna Venator, focus on what they call “performance character strengths” and the crucial role played by noncognitive skills in educational attainment, employment and earned income. These character strengths — “perseverance, industriousness, grit, resilience, curiosity, application” and “self-control, future orientation, self-discipline, impulse control, delay of gratification” — make significant contributions to success in adulthood and upward mobility. As the accompanying chart demonstrates, upper-income kids perform well on tests of noncognitive skills, but there are substantial numbers of low-income children who do well also. “There is a long research literature on the importance of self-control, or the ability to defer gratification — a close corollary of our conceptualization of the character strength of prudence,” Reeves and his two colleagues write.

After the Brexit vote in Britain and the election of Donald Trump in the United States, Ms. Le Pen, the leader of one of the oldest far-right parties in Europe, now smells victory in what her team is calling “the third battle.” Ms. Le Pen can already claim the backing of more than one in four French voters. These National Front supporters are a disgruntled lot who are more likely than others to say they’re certain to vote. Although recent opinion polls suggest that Ms. Le Pen would most likely lose in the presidential election’s second-round runoff, her strategists believe that she, too, will prove the pollsters wrong — by winning the first round in April, and then knocking out her leading rival, the upstart centrist Emmanuel Macron, in the second round the month after. They see the 39-year-old Mr. Macron as an ideal opponent, a former investment banker for Rothschild and a liberal elite technocrat who represents precisely the interests of “savage globalization” that Ms. Le Pen rails against. “Macron is a living and breathing embodiment of the globalist elite,” said one of Ms. Le Pen’s senior strategists at a recent presentation in London. (The briefing was conducted off the record, so I cannot attribute the remarks reported here to specific officials.) “How can a man from Rothschild understand French workers?” According to her team, Ms. Le Pen expects to win a plurality and eliminate lesser rivals in Round 1 by sweeping up protest votes. For the head-to-head contest in Round 2, however, she will focus relentlessly on Mr. Macron’s privileged background and his close ties to the departing president, François Hollande, who has historically low approval ratings. Ms. Le Pen’s team hopes that Mr. Macron’s economic liberalism will encourage traditional left-wingers either to abstain or back her own protectionist message, which is wrapped in the theme of national preference, the idea of putting native French workers first and introducing additional taxes on contracts for foreign employees. Ms. Le Pen’s populist rallying cry also includes promises to start a re-industrialization and to push back against global corporations like Ikea, forcing them to buy commodities locally and pay higher taxes if they hire non-French workers.

But in person, their bigness still feels unexpected, revelatory. And the delirium of their size is enhanced by their age, by the knowledge that some of the oldest sequoias predate our best tools for processing and communicating phenomena like sequoias, that the trees are older than the English language and most of the world’s major religions — older by centuries, easily, even millenniums. The physical appearance of a tree cannot be deafening, and yet with these trees, it is. Facing down a sequoia, the most grammatically scrambled thoughts wind up feeling right. Really, there’s only so much a person can do or say. Often I found myself expelling a quivering, involuntary Whoa. The first time that happened, I was driving into Sequoia National Park from the foothills of central California’s Sierra Nevada, south of Yosemite. Suddenly, the Four Guardsmen came into view: a tight quartet of elephantine sequoia trunks through which the road passes. The trees have tops, too — those trunks lead to crowns — but that’s immaterial; the trunks are all you have a hope of registering from inside your car. They fill the windows and function as a gateway. They were like living infrastructure, rising out of the snow. The rental-car company had given me a squat Fiat micro-S.U.V., which, though it was equipped with all-wheel drive and seemed to be handling capably enough, was so strikingly unbrawny in appearance that crunching up the icy, winding mountain road, I wasn’t brave enough to push it any faster than a feeble crawl. Now, with the squeeze through the Guardsmen ahead of me tightening, I slowed even more. I heard myself letting out an anticipatory holler, like a Hollywood fighter pilot banking through a dogfight, and threaded the needle at nine miles an hour. There are more than 8,000 sequoias in the Giant Forest, the three-and-a-half-square-mile centerpiece of the park. The largest grow more than 300 feet tall and 30 feet across, barely tapering as they rise until, about two-thirds of the way up, the scrambling madness of their branches starts. The branches are crooked and gnarled, while the rest of the tree is stoic and straight. The branches are grayish and brownish — average American tree colors — while the trunk, particularly in sunlight reflected off snow, hums with a dreamy reddish-orange glow. The branches often seem to have nothing to do with the sequoia they’re attached to; they are trees themselves. In 1978, a branch broke off a sequoia called the General Sherman. It was 150 feet long and nearly seven feet thick. All by itself, that branch would have been one of the tallest trees east of the Mississippi. The General Sherman Tree is one of the park’s primary attractions. It’s 275 feet tall, 100 feet in circumference, and known to be the largest tree on Earth, by volume. (The National Park Service drives home its massiveness on a sign in front of its trunk this way: If the General Sherman were hollowed out and filled with water, it’d be enough water for you to take a bath every day for 27 years.) The General Sherman is not far off the Generals Highway, which runs through the park. It is a tree with its own parking lot. Though the pathways were ice-crusted or snowed under when I visited last month, I watched tourists of all shapes and sizes hobble and skitter over them toward the tree for photographs: the Italian dude with the soul patch posing with double thumbs up; the overweight couple huffing, “You make it to the tree?” to a few young women returning to their car; the young man looking up at the tree, eyes closed and still, face in the sun — a tranquil image of cosmic, momentary oneness were it not for his self-aggrandizing sweatshirt, which read, I AM NOT A GOD BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR. And then there was the woman with a moaning child in her arms. She was whispering, “Last one, I promise,” while her husband set up a tripod and timer, far, far away, struggling to frame his teensy family against the universe of the tree. Eventually the man found he had to reposition and walked right in front of me. When we made eye contact, he said, “It’s big!” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/magazine/sequoias-in-the-land-of-giants.html?searchResultPosition=46
687,"Rick Perry, the former Texas governor and current United States energy secretary, says the recent presidential election might have been stolen. It isn’t the legitimacy of his boss, President Trump, that Mr. Perry is calling into question. No, he has reservations about last month’s election for student body president at his alma mater, Texas A&M University. In a piece published by The Houston Chronicle on Wednesday, Mr. Perry took the remarkable step of weighing in on the most local of politics. In it, he argues in great detail that the election of the school’s first openly gay student body president was mishandled and that the true winner was denied victory, an outcome that never would have been allowed were he not a straight, white male. The process, overseen by the school’s Student Government Association, at best “made a mockery of due process and transparency,” Mr. Perry wrote. “At worst, the S.G.A. allowed an election to be stolen outright.” At issue was the election of Bobby Brooks, who is reportedly set to become the school’s first openly gay student body president when he takes office next month. Mr. Perry wrote that Mr. Brooks’s victory initially made him proud, but he soon found cause for concern. “The election appeared to demonstrate a commitment to treating every student equally, judging on character rather than on personal characteristics,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, a closer review appears to prove the opposite.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/rick-perry-texas-am-student-election.html?searchResultPosition=38
688,"WASHINGTON — Republican senators moved Thursday to dismantle landmark internet privacy protections for consumers in the first decisive strike against telecommunications and technology regulations created during the Obama administration, and a harbinger of further deregulation. The measure passed in a 50-to-48 vote largely along party lines. The House is expected to mirror the Senate’s action next week, followed by a signature from President Trump. The move means Verizon, Comcast or AT&T can continue tracking and sharing people’s browsing and app activity without permission, and it alarmed consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers. They warned that broadband providers have the widest look into Americans’ online habits, and that without the rules, the companies would have more power to collect data on people and sell sensitive information. “These were the strongest online privacy rules to date, and this vote is a huge step backwards in consumer protection writ large,” said Dallas Harris, a policy fellow for the consumer group Public Knowledge. “The rules asked that when things were sensitive, an internet service provider asked permission first before collecting. That’s not a lot to ask.” The privacy rules were created in October by the Federal Communications Commission, and the brisk action of Congressional Republicans, just two months into Mr. Trump’s administration, foreshadowed a broader rollback of tech and telecom policies that have drawn the ire of conservative lawmakers and companies like AT&T, Verizon and Charter. Republican lawmakers and the new chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, have said the privacy rules were onerous and unfairly strapped regulations on telecom carriers, but not on web companies such as Facebook and Google that also provide access to online content.

690,"SAN FRANCISCO — The big banks and Silicon Valley are waging an escalating battle over your personal financial data: your dinner bill last night, your monthly mortgage payment, the interest rates you pay. Technology companies like Mint and Betterment have been eager to slurp up this data, mainly by building services that let people link all their various bank-account and credit-card information. The selling point is to make budgeting and bookkeeping easier. But the data is also being used to offer new kinds of loans and investment products. Now, banks have decided they aren’t letting the data go without a fight. In recent weeks, several large banks have been pushing to restrict the sharing of this kind of data with technology companies, according to the tech firms. In some cases, they are refusing to pass along information, like the fees and interest rates they charge. Both sides see big money to be made from the reams of highly personal information created by financial transactions. The struggle over this data points to a growing recognition in the world of finance that personal records rank among the most valuable currencies in the increasingly digital economy. It is, of course, not just financial data that companies are fighting over. There are numerous legal battles going on over who should have access to your health records and even your web-browsing history. Just this week, in fact, Republicans won a vote to roll back rules that would have stopped internet providers from tracking their customers’ online activities and selling that information to marketers. Corporations are eager to gain access to the digital trails that people leave behind to determine which products are marketed to whom, and at what prices. The data ultimately affects how much people pay for everything from a home loan to car insurance.

691,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump sent greetings to the Iranian people on Wednesday for the Persian New Year, or Nowruz, it offered a glimpse into an administration that is still debating how to deal with a country that Mr. Trump has painted as an implacable foe. The five-paragraph statement went through multiple drafts, according to two people involved in the process. Hard-liners in the White House first tried to kill the message, and when that failed, stripped it of references to engaging with the Iranian government or a future in which Iran and the United States might peacefully coexist. Instead, the statement, issued a day after the holiday began, reached out to the Iranian people while ignoring the government in Tehran. It paid tribute to Iranian immigrants in the United States, even as Mr. Trump’s travel ban prevented relatives of those immigrants from entering the United States. And it celebrated the ancient history of the Persian Empire while implicitly criticizing the persecution of religious minorities by the mullahs who rule the Islamic republic of today. “Nowruz means ‘new day’ in Persian,” the president said in the statement. “It is an occasion to celebrate new beginnings, a sentiment that is particularly meaningful for so many Iranians who have come to our country in recent decades to make a new start in a free land.” Among the sections deleted were one that said America looked forward to engaging someday with a “representative Iranian government” on the basis of mutual respect, and another that cited Henry A. Kissinger’s oft-repeated line that Iran needed to decide whether it is a “nation or a cause.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/in-greeting-to-iranian-people-trump-leaves-out-their-government.html?searchResultPosition=44

694,"One of the biggest bank robberies of all time has shown what could be the next front in cyberwarfare. The United States attorney’s office in Los Angeles is said to be examining the extent to which the North Korean government aided and abetted a heist in which $81 million was stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh in February 2016. Federal prosecutors are building cases that would target Chinese middlemen who prosecutors believe helped North Korea orchestrate the theft, according to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the potential charges. Using Swift, the global payment messaging system, the hackers persuaded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to move money from the Bangladesh bank to accounts in the Philippines, where much of it disappeared.

696,"A common piece of wisdom in business circles is that regulation is bad and stifles innovation. But that leaves us with the curious case of electric cars, as Farhad Manjoo writes. Electric cars are becoming less expensive and more reliable. The typical range they can drive on a single charge is extending, and charging stations are becoming more commonplace. What’s more, electric cars are spreading from innovative high-end companies like Tesla, an automaker based in Palo Alto, Calif., to mainstream manufacturers in the United States, China, Japan and areas of Europe. “There are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California,” Mr. Manjoo writes. Not surprisingly, many auto companies disagree with that sentiment, arguing that gradual acceptance of the technology and more affordable prices have contributed to the cars’ popularity. So what prompted the initial investments? There is a theory: Regulations prodded companies to invest in technologies they might otherwise have ignored. This led to the commercialization of the technology. Would shifts in technology occur if companies did not get a shove? Sure. But regulation can force change to happen more quickly than if it were left to the market. More tech news: AT&T and Johnson & Johnson are pulling ads from YouTube.

699,"CAIRO — Ten Egyptian soldiers and 15 militants were killed during a raid on an Islamist insurgent base in the restive Sinai Peninsula, a military spokesman said Thursday. The deaths underscored the strength of the Sinai insurgency, led by an Islamic State affiliate, despite almost four years of concerted Egyptian counterterrorism operations. In recent months Sinai militants have expanded their area of operations, targeted Christian civilians and fired rockets into Israel. In a statement posted on Facebook, Tamer el-Refai, an Egyptian military spokesman, said the Egyptian soldiers died in two roadside blasts on Wednesday during an operation that had targeted two Islamist storehouses in the deserts of central Sinai, outside their stronghold in the north of the peninsula. Among the soldiers killed were three officers and seven enlisted men, Mr. Refai said. Seven militants were arrested, he said, and explosives, medical supplies, cellphones and four-wheel-drive vehicles were seized. The death totals and other details from the operation could not be independently corroborated as most journalists, Egyptian or foreign, are prohibited from working in Sinai. The raid came a month after a series of attacks by militants targeting minority Christians in northern Sinai forced more than 250 people to flee the area, mostly to the nearby city of Ismailia.
