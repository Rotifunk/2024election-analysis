2,"WASHINGTON — With more and more states running out of money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, parents took their case to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, pleading with Congress to provide money before their sons and daughters lose health care and coverage. But the program, known as CHIP, which insures nearly nine million children, took a back seat as lawmakers raced to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut. CHIP’s fate, it appears, is now caught up in a messy fight over an end-of-the-year deal on spending that must be struck by Friday to avert a government shutdown. “CHIP is being used as a pawn in larger debates and negotiations,” Linda Nablo, the chief deputy director of the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, said Tuesday in an interview. “It has fallen victim to the dysfunction and partisanship in Congress. And we are getting very close to the point where some children will also be victims.” Virginia sent letters last week to parents of 68,000 children warning them that CHIP coverage would end on Jan. 31 unless Congress took action. Congress has known since April 2015 that funds for the popular children’s insurance program — created and sustained for two decades with bipartisan support — would expire this year at the end of September. The Senate Finance Committee approved a five-year extension of funding for the program in early October, but did not specify how to pay for it — and Republicans insist that it must be paid for. The House passed a bill to provide five years of funds in early November, but those funds would come from public health programs set up under the Affordable Care Act and an increase in premiums for affluent Medicare beneficiaries, provisions that are unacceptable to most Democrats. House Republicans plan to send those same provisions to the Senate again this week as part of a stopgap spending bill, knowing they will be killed. "
3,"WASHINGTON — The sting of failure on health care still lingered in the Senate on Aug. 3, when Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, summoned the Republican members of the Budget Committee to his office. We need to pass a tax bill this fall, Mr. McConnell told his colleagues, and we need a budget that allows us to do that. There was no dissent. Within two months, party leaders had hammered out a budget that steamrolled their previous concerns over adding to the federal budget deficit, in order to pave the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. In rapid order, the budget passed the Senate, then the House, putting Republicans on track to deliver a tax bill at breakneck speed to President Trump’s desk by Christmas. The $1.5 trillion bill represents the most sweeping overhaul of the United States tax code in decades, delivering deep and permanent cuts to corporations and temporary tax cuts to individuals. Early Wednesday morning, Republicans claimed victory as the Senate voted 51-48 to pass the bill, which the House passed on Tuesday 227 to 203. But in many ways, the bill represents a political and economic gamble for Republicans. A majority of Americans oppose it, and relatively few believe they will benefit personally from it, polls show. Economic analyses predict it will add more than $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next decade, an amount that would betray the party’s longstanding messaging that mounting federal debt will sap economic growth. Republicans spurned those concerns, rallying around what has been the animating ideology of their party since the Reagan era: that tax cuts will drive faster growth and national prosperity. More immediately, they followed an overwhelming desire to notch a legislative “win” for the president, their donors, the restless voters of their party base and for their own political fortunes. There were crucial steps that ensured passage, including a deficit bargain struck between Senators Patrick J. Toomey and Bob Corker in September, pressure from Mr. Trump on a controversial push to tweak retirement savings in the bill and, in the Senate, an early and crucial endorsement from John McCain of Arizona, the Republican wild card whose late defection killed the health care bill. "
4,"WASHINGTON — The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has influenced Republican White Houses and shaped conservative policy since the 1970s, named a new president on Tuesday who has deep ties to the party’s social conservative and evangelical Christian wing as it moved to steady itself after a year of internal turmoil. Kay Coles James, who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, will fill the vacancy left this year when Heritage’s board unexpectedly removed Jim DeMint, the former senator from South Carolina who became a leading practitioner of the uncompromising, no-apologies style of conservatism that characterized the Tea Party revolt. If Mr. DeMint’s appointment in 2013 was a sign that Heritage was embracing the grass-roots energy that had proved so disruptive to the Republican Party, naming Ms. James was an acknowledgment that many inside the organization believe Heritage had strayed from its mission of acting as the intellectual and policy guide star for conservatives. Like other institutions that had grown comfortable in their roles as fixtures of the political establishment, Heritage has struggled to find a meaningful role for itself in President Trump’s Washington. Some inside the group complained that it had little influence in shaping debates on Capitol Hill that conservatives should have been far better prepared for — like the struggle over repealing the Affordable Care Act. And a few of Heritage’s largest donors and board members like Rebekah Mercer, whose family helped finance Mr. Trump’s campaign, agitated for change, arguing that the group was squandering its opportunity to lead at a time when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. Inside the organization, people viewed Ms. James as a safe choice who, while unlikely to resolve the tensions over Heritage’s direction, would not make them any worse. "
5,"Donald Trump has often been described as the second coming of P. T. Barnum, the legendary 19th-century showman. Biographers, academics and journalists have embraced this idea, as have members of Mr. Trump’s family. “He is P. T. Barnum,” his sister once said. With a movie opening on Wednesday that is loosely inspired by Barnum’s life — “The Greatest Showman,” starring Hugh Jackman — we’re likely to hear these comparisons again. Please: Barnum would be appalled by Mr. Trump. While they share some superficial similarities, it’s the differences that stand out. Phineas Taylor Barnum is a figure frequently invoked but rarely understood. He amassed a fortune promoting a bewildering range of popular entertainments: an elderly slave masquerading as George Washington’s nursemaid; a gifted Swedish opera singer, Jenny Lind, whom he turned into an international superstar; a half-monkey, half-fish masterpiece of taxidermy that he advertised as the FeeJee Mermaid; and other attractions, dubious and genuine. Many of these he exhibited at his American Museum in Lower Manhattan. Later, he took the show on the road, touring the world with his famous circus and sideshows. Barnum’s hyperbole, his willingness to bend the truth when promoting his entertainments, his artful manipulation of the press, never mind his participation in outright hoaxes, invite comparisons with Mr. Trump. Likewise, Barnum’s fondness for living large — he built a garish Moorish mansion he called “Iranistan” — calls to mind Mr. Trump’s gilded excesses. Both men became teetotalers; both went bankrupt, only to claw their way back to the top. And then, of course, there’s Barnum’s famous saying: “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Except that Barnum never said that or anything like it, though it was a popular saying among 19th-century con artists and flimflam men. As a showman, Barnum went to great lengths to distinguish himself from these swindlers. He believed that if he accepted customers’ hard-earned cash, he had to give them their money’s worth. “No one,” Barnum declared in his autobiography, “can say that he ever paid for admission to one of my exhibitions more than his admission was worth to him.” A patron of Barnum’s museum might dispute the authenticity of some exhibits. But visitors rarely, if ever, came away feeling shortchanged or cheated. "

7,"WASHINGTON — An end-of-the-year showdown that was once promised over delicate issues like immigration, health care and surveillance appeared to fizzle on Wednesday as key Republicans dropped their demands to shore up shaky health insurance markets and Democrats appeared to abandon their goal to force adoption of a measure protecting young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Instead, Congress moved toward a one-month punt that would keep the government funded into January and once again put off policy confrontations. As Republicans celebrated the passage of their tax overhaul at the White House with President Trump, the party’s leaders in the House and Senate worked behind the scenes to shape a stopgap spending measure to fund federal agencies and avert a government shutdown. Only days ago, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she would vote for the tax bill because she had secured a promise from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to include two health care provisions to stabilize insurance markets in an end-of-the-year spending measure. On Wednesday, she dropped that demand and said she hoped it would be passed in early 2018. “It looks like the Christmas present of lower health insurance premiums will now have to be a Valentine’s Day present,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who had joined Ms. Collins’s demand. Similarly, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, traded his vote on the tax bill, in part for a promise from Republican leaders to consider a deal to protect young immigrants brought into the United States as children, known as Dreamers. Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that if negotiators could reach bipartisan agreement on the deal in January, he would put it to a full Senate vote. Behind those decisions was a desire to avoid confrontation and leave Washington for the Christmas holiday. “I can’t think of a bigger act of political malpractice after a successful tax reform vote than to shut the government down,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. “Talk about stepping on your own message. I mean, really, how dumb would that be?” But the price for peace was anger and frustration in both parties. By maintaining current spending levels into January, Republican leaders would make it difficult to bolster military spending as promised until well into the fiscal year. Democrats, especially in the House, said they were outraged that their leaders again squandered a moment of leverage to leave young immigrants unprotected. “To everybody who says, ‘We can wait until next year’ — we can’t,” said Representative Luis Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois. “Because you know what? Your work permit didn’t expire. Your children are not going to face deportation. Your hope for the future does not vanish.” But no final decisions were made on Wednesday, and funding for much of the government runs out at midnight Friday. Still awaiting attention is the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, whose funding expired on Oct. 1, as well as legislation to reauthorize a program allowing warrantless surveillance of foreigners abroad, which expires Dec. 31. House Republicans seemed poised to attach a short-term extension of the surveillance program to that chamber’s spending bill, which would fund the government through Jan. 19. The Senate was likely to follow a similar course, putting off the question of what to do about the law until early next year. Also left unresolved is an $81 billion package of relief for hurricane- and fire-ravaged areas. House Republicans have put together a measure that would provide the money, raising the total amount of disaster aid approved by Congress since September to more than $130 billion. But it is unclear when the measure will be considered. With the punt, lawmakers from both parties appear determined to avoid a Christmas Eve crisis. House Republicans had previously unveiled a plan that would provide temporary funding to keep the government open through Jan. 19, coupled with a full year of funding for the Defense Department. But that approach would be a nonstarter in the Senate, where Democrats have the power to block spending measures. House Republicans have since backed away from that plan, only to face resistance from defense hawks in their conference during a closed-door meeting Wednesday evening as they tried to corral the votes necessary to pass the spending bill. “Right now, this is all about defense,’’ said Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York. “It comes down to, the defense hawks want money and assurances that, unfortunately, the Senate’s not in a position to give them.” Although the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct. 1, lawmakers are still far from reaching an agreement on a long-term spending package to fund the government. Republican and Democratic leaders want to reach a deal to raise strict spending caps that were imposed in 2011. But they have so far been unable to agree, and until such a pact is made, a long-term spending bill cannot be negotiated. Leaders of both parties in the House and the Senate support legislation to provide five years of funding for CHIP, but they have been unable to agree on how to pay for it. And Republicans insist that Congress must find a way to offset the cost of new spending on the program, a position that infuriates Democrats, who say the tax bill was not “paid for.” “All these senators that have insurance paid for by the taxpayers are celebrating at the White House today, doing this tax cut, while they’re willing to go home having not taken care of 209,000 children in my state,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. “Millions of families in the United States are now facing Christmas vaguely understanding that insurance for their children might be cut off at the end of the year,” Mr. Brown said. As it became increasingly clear that Congress would put off action on Democratic priorities like CHIP and immigration, some Democrats and activists accused Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the House and Senate Democratic leaders, of giving up. NextGen America, a group that often focuses on climate and energy issues, said Democrats should vote against the spending bill if it did not include the immigration measure, known as the Dream Act. “If we truly want to be the party of progress and opportunity, the party of ‘Si, se puede,’ then we must protect young immigrants,” said the group’s founder, Tom Steyer, using Spanish for “Yes, we can.” “Leaders Pelosi and Schumer looked Dreamers in the eye and promised to stand up for them — and now is the time to do it. If we won’t fight for our young people, then what are we doing?” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate and the chamber’s main champion of the Dream Act, said the White House had been demanding a number of border security and enforcement measures that Democrats opposed. One Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations in the Senate said that Democrats were increasingly worried that they would be blamed for a government shutdown if their party blocked the spending bill and held firm on having an immigration deal before January. But Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, Democrat of New Mexico and the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said she refused to accept that lawmakers would choose to go home for the holidays while young undocumented immigrants were holding hunger strikes and being arrested at protests to keep families together. “The second I accept that we can do something later is the second I tell folks who are here — losing their jobs, having their families separated, taking incredible risks — that their issues and the parents who are struggling to have CHIP funding, and veterans, that they are not worth our support,” she said. "
8,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court indicated on Wednesday that federal courts in California had moved too fast in ordering the Trump administration to disclose documents concerning its decision to end a program that protected some 800,000 young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. In an unsigned opinion, the justices instructed the lower courts to consider the administration’s arguments on two threshold legal issues before requiring that the documents be turned over. The administration contends that its decision to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was within its lawful discretion and that the courts are in any event without jurisdiction to review the matter. “Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the district court to examine a complete administrative record,” the Supreme Court’s opinion said. Should the courts reject those arguments, the opinion said, they should nonetheless consider requiring fewer documents to be produced and allow the administration to present arguments about whether particular documents are privileged. There were no noted dissents from Wednesday’s opinion, which appeared to be the product of compromise. That was in contrast to the Supreme Court’s first order in the case on Dec. 8, when the justices split 5 to 4 along ideological lines. The more conservative members of the court were in the majority, and they allowed the administration to temporarily shield the documents. The dispute arose in five consolidated lawsuits in California that accused administration officials of acting unlawfully when they abruptly rescinded the program. The plaintiffs include four states: California, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota. Judge William H. Alsup of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered the administration to turn over internal documents concerning its reasons for canceling the program. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the administration’s request to block Judge Alsup’s order, with the majority saying that the few documents provided by the administration had been inadequate in light of the magnitude of the decision to end the program. In an emergency application to the Supreme Court, the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, asked the justices to step in. He said Judge Alsup’s order was an “extraordinary departure from bedrock principles governing judicial review of federal agency action,” given the practical burdens it imposed and in its intrusion into the administration’s internal deliberations. In its opinion on Wednesday, the Supreme Court noted that the administration had produced just 256 pages of documents, of which “nearly 200 pages consist of published opinions from various federal courts.” In setting aside the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, the Supreme Court said it was not expressing any views on the merits of the dispute. "
9,"When President  Trump adds his distinctive signature to the tax bill, he will also be making a huge bet that the Republican strategy of deep cuts for businesses and wealthy individuals will fuel extraordinary growth across the board. Perhaps more than any other American political leader, Mr. Trump knows that long shots, like his own presidential bid, sometimes pay off. In that vein, he and congressional Republicans are arguing that their bitterly contested and expensive rewrite of the tax code will ultimately create more jobs and raise wages. If they are proved correct, they will be repudiating not only historical experience, but most experts. From Congress’s own prognosticators to Wall Street’s virtuosos, scarcely any independent analyses project anything like the rosy forecasts offered by the president’s top economic advisers. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the normal models just do not fully capture the high-octane “rocket fuel” embedded in the tax plan. Mr. Trump intuitively understands just how much attitudes and expectations can shape economic decisions. With a businessman in the White House, Mr. Trump argues that companies, large and small, have a renewed faith in the economy. And the corporate tax cut, combined with the rollback in regulation, will prompt waves of new investment and hiring, as middle-class Americans liberally spend the extra money in their pockets. “We’re going to easily see 4 percent growth next year,” the National Economic Council director, Gary D. Cohn, said. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared the tax plan would generate enough growth to more than pay for its $1.5 trillion cost. But those pronouncements are at odds with estimates from the former employer of both men, Goldman Sachs. The bank projected that the tax bill will add just three-tenths of 1 percent of growth in the next two years, before its impact peters out. The firm’s annual growth estimate of 2.5 percent for 2018 matched the one issued this week by the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, while the latest median Wall Street forecast hovered close by. And in 2019, growth is expected to drop to 1.8 percent, Alec Phillips, chief United States political economist for Goldman, said Wednesday after the Senate vote. “We note that the effect in 2020 and beyond looks minimal and could actually be slightly negative,” the company said in a recent published summary. Such projections are unlikely to deter Mr. Trump and Republican leaders from declaring success next year. Lower taxes and extra incentives to invest in 2018 are almost certain to encourage consumers to spend and businesses to expand. Reduced rates mean most Americans will start taking home more money right away. Roughly three-quarters of taxpayers are expected to get a cut next year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Employers may offer other sweeteners, even if they were not specifically spurred by the tax plan. AT&T announced Wednesday that it was giving more than 200,000 domestic employees a $1,000 bonus when the tax bill is signed. Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati, also promised a $1,000 bonus and said it would raise the company’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. At the same time, the anticipated cut in the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and other business perks are lifting the stock market to new heights. In an earnings call this week, Alan B. Graf Jr., FedEx’s chief financial officer, said the company planned to use part of its tax windfall to fatten dividends. But like a shot of adrenaline, that initial burst of economic activity is likely to fade. Some provisions of the bill were intended to be sharp and short. Next year, for example, businesses will be able to borrow money and deduct the cost of those loans at the current rate of 35 percent. But later on, when they reap the profits, they will pay a tax rate of only 21 percent. That could end up causing firms to simply shift the timing of investments they would have made regardless of a change in the tax code. “The really hard question a year from now is going to be is how much of the miniboom we see is just an acceleration of stuff that was going to happen anyway or additional investment that is really going to spur the economy,” said Mihir A. Desai, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School. Tax cuts can provide an added incentive to invest. But as most chief executives acknowledge, they are generally not the crucial factor. Investment decisions are much more closely linked to demand for goods and services or technological advancement. As it is, manufacturers are not making full use of the capacity in their existing facilities. Mr. Graf of FedEx held out the possibility of more spending on capital investment and hiring next year. But he noted that the economy as a whole would first have to “increase materially.” Over time, most of the broad-based tax cuts will disappear. Although the richest sliver of Americans will continue to get a break, most people who earn less than $100,000 will see their taxes rise, which could slow the economy’s primary engine, consumer spending. Further tightening is likely if the Republicans follow through on sharply cutting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other programs that tend to put extra cash into the pockets of lower and moderate-income households. Either way, the deficit will continue to balloon. Over the last decade alone, the deficit has more than tripled. So far, the interest needed to cover that enormous loan has remained relatively small because interest rates have been at historically low levels. But those costs are expected to soar. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to slowly but surely raise the benchmark interest rate. Some economists support such deficit spending during recessions, but they worry that offering stimulants when the economy is on fairly steady ground can backfire. Although employers have resisted raising salaries by much, they continue to complain about the tightness of the labor market. The jobless rate has dipped to 4.1 percent while job openings have remained at record high levels. Virtually no economists believe that the tax cuts will pay for themselves. Several studies have shown that they rarely cover more than a third of the cost. Others have questioned whether cuts produce any significant growth at all — even if they do encourage some individuals to work, save and invest. In a study that William G. Gale and Andrew Samwick did for the Tax Policy Center, they concluded that cuts that increase budget deficits “in the long term will reduce national saving and raise interest rates.” The pattern of short-term promise followed by disappointment is one that other presidents have experienced. President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 both passed tax cuts that delivered temporary bumps to the economy followed by slowdowns and rising deficits. “The clear consensus among independent economists is that the impact of the tax cuts on growth is nowhere close to what the administration is talking about,” said Mr. Desai of Harvard. Whatever growth does occur, he added, will be “counteracted by the fiscal irresponsibility of the bill.” "
10,"Time was when any New York politician with a grain of ambition had to show reverence for the three I’s. That would be Ireland, Italy and Israel. For anyone aspiring to high office, visiting those lands was almost as fundamental as breathing, and a balanced citywide ticket contained descendants of each I. So you had carefully assembled combos like O’Dwyer, Joseph and Impellitteri (Democrats, 1945) and Lefkowitz, Fino and Gilhooley (Republicans, 1961). The three-I rule hasn’t disappeared, though it lacks the power it once had. These days, New York politicians seem more in thrall to a one-I imperative: Iowa. That’s where Mayor Bill de Blasio was to be found this week, talking up a progressive agenda at a gathering of like-minded liberals in Des Moines. Given that Iowa sounds the opening bell in presidential races, did the trip reflect his 2020 vision? Not at all, Mr. de Blasio insisted repeatedly in an echo of Calvin (“I do not choose to run”) Coolidge. Somehow, no matter how many times he said it, not everyone was convinced. When political types book passage to Iowa and deny any thought of national office, they sound an awful lot like guys who claimed back in Playboy’s heyday that they bought the magazine solely for the Nabokov and Cheever short stories. Iowa got a heavy dose of New York in 2015 and early 2016, what with campaign tramping by Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who may represent Vermont but still speaks with the unmistakable cadences of his Brooklyn yout’. This week, in addition to the mayor, the city imposed itself on Iowans in the form of anti-de Blasio labor protests. The Transport Workers Union bought billboard space and took out ads in The Des Moines Register — “a warning to the people of Iowa” that this Bill was “phony as a $3 bill.” And the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association dispatched officers to stalk the mayor with a message that he shouldn’t be allowed “to stand on the mantle of being progressive and pro-labor when we know the truth is different.” Those were the words of the P.B.A. president, Patrick Lynch, not normally noted for worrying about the state of progressivism in America. "
11,"DES MOINES — The House of Representatives had just passed its sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code, and Mayor Bill de Blasio unfurled his long arms in a windowless Iowa conference room to express his displeasure at what he said was a “bad day for the country.” “Now,” he said, “comes the work of dealing with it.” The bill will deeply affect New York City, but on Tuesday Mr. de Blasio was a time zone away, talking up his two-pronged plan to remake the Democratic Party and then retake Congress in 2018. Buoyed by his own re-election last month — he volunteered his winning percentage multiple times in a 30-minute interview here — the mayor said he sees himself as proof positive that his “brand” of “progressive economic populism” sells. “I think that gives me license to say, ‘Hey guys, I want to give you a good example,’” he said. “I don’t pretend to be the arbiter of all truth, but I think I have something to contribute. And I think people are listening.” So Mr. de Blasio flew to Iowa this week, tucking his nearly 6-foot-6 frame into a pair of coach seats (he had a layover) to visit the state that kicks off the presidential nominating contest. Coming here guaranteed that Mr. de Blasio would get the 2020 question — no, he says, he is not running — even as he feigned frustration that it’s been asked and answered. Some passengers recognized him and could be overheard discussing his itinerary. “Big ambitions?” one person said. “Yup,” said another. If the idea of Mr. de Blasio-to-Iowa rings familiar, that’s because it is. He did much the same in 2015, to notable failure. He tried to get Democrats to adopt his “progressive agenda,” launched a nonprofit group and promised a presidential forum. All three fizzled. He then stalled for months before endorsing his former boss, Hillary Clinton, and when he finally did, her campaign buried his blessing among an avalanche of other mayoral backers. Now he is again unapologetically opening his political aperture far beyond New York City, even before his second-term swearing-in. His 28-hour jaunt to Iowa, he said, is just the first stop. Why here and now? "
12,"As Republican lawmakers celebrate the passage of a tax bill that will make the wealthiest Americans richer, many lower-income families are faced with the real possibility that their children will soon lose their health insurance because Congress didn’t care enough to renew funding for it. The Children’s Health Insurance Program has enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation in 1997. It covers about nine million kids from families who are not affluent by any stretch of the imagination but happen to earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. In the past, the program was typically reauthorized for five years with little controversy. Not this time. Republican leaders in Congress have been unwilling or unable to make CHIP, as the program is known, a priority since funding lapsed nearly three months ago. The situation has gotten so bad that families with young children who benefit from the program visited Capitol Hill this week to beg lawmakers to fund CHIP. This has forced state governments, which run the program, to scramble. This week, officials in Alabama said they would drop the coverage of 7,000 children and freeze the program to new enrollees on New Year’s Day. That state would have to end its program, which serves 84,000 kids in total, on Feb. 1. Virginia told parents of 68,000 children that its program could end on Jan. 31. Connecticut, Colorado and other states have issued similar warnings. All told, 16 states will run out of CHIP funds by the end of January, and another 21 will run out of money by the end of March, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Republican lawmakers say they will eventually get around to reauthorizing CHIP. First, though, they insist that Democrats must agree to cut other spending to offset some of the cost of the program. For example, they have proposed raising Medicare premiums on affluent retirees and cutting spending on public health programs created by the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have rightly balked at such demands, especially since Republicans just passed a tax bill that will mostly benefit corporations and the wealthiest families in the country while adding more than $1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. By contrast, CHIP costs just $14 billion a year, or $140 billion or more over a decade. In dismissing concerns about the program, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah epitomized the degradation of so much of the Republican Party this year. Mr. Hatch, who helped create this program with Senator Edward Kennedy, said on the floor of the Senate, almost sneering sanctimoniously, “the reason CHIP’s having trouble is because we don’t have money anymore.” Mr. Hatch and his Republican colleagues had no trouble finding boatloads of money to cut taxes on real estate developers, hedge fund managers and corporate chief executives.

15,"President Trump on Wednesday commuted the prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, whose Iowa meatpacking plant was the target of a huge immigration raid in 2008, and whose 27-year prison sentence angered many Orthodox Jews. Mr. Rubashkin made national headlines nine years ago after federal agents arrived by helicopter at the Agriprocessors plant in Postville, Iowa, and detained nearly 400 undocumented immigrants, including several children, who were working there. Mr. Rubashkin was the company’s chief executive, and the plant had been the largest kosher meatpacking operation in the country. He was later convicted of bank fraud in federal court. Many Jewish leaders have rallied behind Mr. Rubashkin, whose treatment they said was unfair, perhaps even anti-Semitic, and whose sentence they considered unduly harsh and out of line with what other white-collar criminals received. Mr. Rubashkin had tried for years to get a reduced sentence, but was repeatedly turned down by the courts. “Rubashkin has remained strong throughout his ordeal and convinced he would eventually obtain justice,” said Guy R. Cook, the lead trial lawyer for Mr. Rubashkin, in an email on Wednesday night. “Rubashkin and his family are overjoyed he is free and will be reunited with them.” In a statement announcing the commutation, White House officials said they had received letters from more than 30 members of Congress, including several members of both parties, supporting an examination of the case. “The president’s review of Mr. Rubashkin’s case and commutation decision were based on expressions of support from members of Congress and a broad cross-section of the legal community,” the White House statement said.

18,"President Trump’s National Security Strategy marks a dramatic departure from the plans of his Republican and Democratic predecessors, painting a dark, almost dystopian portrait of an “extraordinarily dangerous” world characterized by hostile states and lurking threats. There is scant mention of America’s unrivaled political, military, technological and economic strength, or the opportunities to expand prosperity, freedom and security through principled leadership — the foundation of American foreign policy since World War II. In Mr. Trump’s estimation, we live in a world where America wins only at others’ expense. There is no common good, no international community, no universal values, only American values. America is no longer “a global force for good,” as in President Obama’s last strategy, or a “shining city on a hill,” as in President Reagan’s vision. The new strategy enshrines a zero-sum mentality: “Protecting American interests requires that we compete continuously within and across these contests, which are being played out in regions around the world.” This is the hallmark of Mr. Trump’s nationalistic, black-and-white “America First” strategy. But the world is actually gray, and Mr. Trump’s strategy struggles to draw nuanced distinctions. Throughout, China and Russia are conflated and equated as parallel adversaries. In fact, China is a competitor, not an avowed opponent, and has not illegally occupied its neighbors. Russia, as the strategy allows, aggressively opposes NATO, the European Union, Western values and American global leadership. It brazenly seized Georgian and Ukrainian territory and killed thousands of innocents to save a dictator in Syria. Russia is our adversary, yet Mr. Trump’s strategy stubbornly refuses to acknowledge its most hostile act: directly interfering in the 2016 presidential election to advantage Mr. Trump himself. On China and Russia, I suspect the White House realists, to escape the embarrassment of a strategy that ignored Russia’s hostile behavior, agreed to lump China with Russia and almost always mention China first, to placate their nationalist colleagues who hate China but admire Russia. The result is a flawed analysis that may actually drive Russia and China closer together. In several respects, including nuclear weapons and arms control, weapons of mass destruction, counterterrorism, intelligence, cyberthreats, space policy, unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property, the strategy falls within the bipartisan mainstream of United States national security policy, differing little from that of a more traditional Republican president. In other areas, it helpfully corrects this administration’s wavering course, as in its unequivocal embrace of United States allies and partners and reaffirmation of our Article V commitment to defend NATO. The strategy recognizes the threat from pandemics and biohazards and the importance of strengthening global health security. And it maintains at least a nominal commitment to women’s empowerment and providing generous humanitarian assistance. "
19,"WASHINGTON — President Trump issued a threat on Wednesday to cut off American aid to any country that votes for a resolution at the United Nations condemning his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Mr. Trump’s statement, delivered at a cabinet meeting in which he exulted over the passage of a tax overhaul, followed a letter to General Assembly members from the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, in which she warned that the United States would take note of countries that voted in favor of the measure. “All of these nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council or they vote against us, potentially, at the Assembly, they take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,” Mr. Trump said. “Well, we’re watching those votes,” he added. “Let them vote against us; we’ll save a lot. We don’t care.” It is difficult to see how Mr. Trump can make good on that threat because it could involve cutting off financial assistance to the country’s most strategic allies in the Middle East. Some of those programs, like Egypt’s, are congressionally mandated. While the president can hold up aid unilaterally as a form of leverage, canceling it would require new legislation. Still, the bitter confrontation at the United Nations shows the lingering repercussions of Mr. Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem, which defied world opinion and upended decades of American policy. While the decision has not unleashed the violence in the Arab capitals that some had feared, it has left the United States diplomatically isolated. The General Assembly is scheduled to vote Thursday on a resolution that would express “deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem,” according to a draft text. It would urge other countries not to move their embassies there from Tel Aviv. Mr. Trump announced this month that the United States would relocate its embassy to Jerusalem, though State Department officials said a move was several years away because of the logistics of constructing a new embassy complex. In Ms. Haley’s letter, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, she said, “As you consider your vote, I want you to know that the president and U.S. take this vote personally.” “To be clear,” she wrote, “we are not asking that other countries move their embassies to Jerusalem, though we think it would be appropriate. We are simply asking that you acknowledge the historical friendship, partnership and support we have extended and respect our decision about our own embassy.” In a Twitter post on Tuesday, Ms. Haley said of the vote in the General Assembly, “the US will be taking names.” On Monday, the United States used a rare veto to block a resolution in the Security Council calling for the administration to reverse its decision on Jerusalem. The vote on the resolution, which was drafted by Egypt, was 14 to 1, suggesting there could be a similarly wide margin against the United States in the 193-member General Assembly. Canada, the Czech Republic and Hungary might abstain from the vote, according to diplomats. Days after the United States, the Czech Republic recognized West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, though it said it would not move its embassy before negotiating with countries in the region. Egypt received $77.4 billion in foreign aid from the United States from 1948 to 2016, according to the Congressional Research Service, including about $1.3 billion in annual military aid. Yemen and Turkey are sponsoring the General Assembly resolution, which underlines the problem Mr. Trump would face in retaliating for an anti-American vote. Yemen, which is torn by civil war, receives humanitarian aid from the United States, while Turkey is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump struck a familiar tone, declaring that “people are tired of the United States — people that live here, our great citizens that love this country — they’re tired of this country being taken advantage of, and we’re not going to be taken advantage of any longer.” Derek H. Chollet, who served in the Obama administration, said: “This is an empty threat. Some of the countries Trump professes to be most admiring of would be caught in the cross-hairs of this.” President Barack Obama withheld Harpoon missiles and F-16 fighter jets from Egypt in 2013 after the country’s army ousted President Mohamed Morsi. But Mr. Obama did not try to kill the overall aid program, even though some officials argued that the army’s action constituted a coup, grounds for cutting off the aid. In 2015, he reinstated the aid. “The idea that you can use foreign assistance as a lever to influence the behavior of countries is not a not new one,” Mr. Chollet said. “But this is bluster that other countries will see right through.” Mr. Trump has threatened to hold up aid to Pakistan if it does not cooperate more with the United States on counterterrorism operations. During the 2016 presidential election, he warned that the United States might pull out of NATO because it shouldered an unfair burden in paying for the alliance. It was also not the first time that Ms. Haley has used this language at the United Nations. Soon after taking her post, she said, “You’re going to see a change in the way we do business.” The United States, she said, would back its allies and expected their backing in return. “For those who don’t have our back,” she added, “we’re taking names.” At the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Trump praised Ms. Haley, saying, “That was the right message that you and I agreed to be sent yesterday.” But the deepening dispute over Jerusalem casts an even longer shadow over Mr. Trump’s hopes to broker a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians. Vice President Mike Pence postponed a trip to Israel this week that some officials hoped would be a victory lap for the administration. White House officials said Mr. Pence stayed in Washington as an insurance policy because of the vote in the Senate on the tax bill. But the trip was shaping up as divisive: the vice president was not going to meet with Palestinian leaders, who are still seething over Mr. Trump’s decision on Jerusalem, which they regard as the capital of a future Palestinian state. “They thought they were taking Jerusalem off the table,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East negotiator, said of the Trump administration. “They now have guaranteed it will be there for breakfast, lunch and dinner.” "
20,"BERLIN — Deborah Feldman has learned to follow the sun. December marks the 31-year-old Brooklyn-raised writer’s fourth winter living in Berlin, a place notorious for its long, gray months, and by now she has it down: On the rare days when the cloud cover breaks, she hurries to her local market hall, a 100-year-old, light-flooded space in Berlin’s Kreuzberg neighborhood. There, the sun shines around noon, for an hour. Then, juggling TV interviews, photo shoots, newspaper deadlines, public readings, awards ceremonies, child care and work on her new novel, Ms. Feldman moves to a west-facing terrace in a nearby cemetery, before heading to her favorite cafe table at around 2 p.m. for a final 20-minute glimpse of the sun. “I try to get all the light I can,” Ms. Feldman said, with a smile. This perseverance has characterized much of Ms. Feldman’s extraordinary life. Born into a Yiddish-speaking Hasidic Jewish sect founded by Holocaust survivors, after World War II, in Brooklyn, Ms. Feldman was raised to believe that Hitler’s extermination of the Jews was God’s punishment for European Jewish assimilation. To save the Jewish nation, she was taught that Jews must live apart from society, and abide by old Jewish rules and traditions. She documented her repressive upbringing, the arranged marriage she entered into at 17 and her decision to take her young son and leave the community in her best-selling memoir, “Unorthodox,” which was published in the United States in 2012. But even after the success of her book, Ms. Feldman never felt quite at home in the United States. She found mainstream American life disorienting. “I grew up in a shtetl,” Ms. Feldman said, referring to the economic, political and cultural bubble she lived in. “It would have been really hopeless for me to try to become American.” In one of the dramatic ironies that punctuate her story, Ms. Feldman — who was raised by a loving but traumatized grandmother (her father was mentally ill and her mother left the marriage and the community when Ms. Feldman was young) who barely survived several Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen — instead found herself drawn to Berlin.

21,"We’d like to add to the chorus of New York Times year-end lists — from Best Books and Most Important Scientific Findings to Five Times the Internet Was Actually Fun — by sorting a few of our own resources for you, with the hope that they help when you’re back in the classroom in January. According to our analytics, these were our most-popular pieces published in 2017. But because we create over a dozen types of features weekly on our site, we’ve added a bit of context to explain each, and included other popular posts that are part of the same feature. What were the most interesting things you taught or learned in 2017? Let us know in the comments. _________ 1. Our List of 401 Writing Prompts Our list of 401 prompts for argument writing was the most-viewed resource we published in 2017. It’s the latest in a family of popular prompt lists, including our 650 prompts for narrative and personal writing. 2. A Special Summer News Quiz At the end of each year, and at the end of every summer, we publish a special news quiz that rounds up the most important current events. These are typically 50-question, or more, fill-in-the-blank versions of our weekly news quizzes. This year, our summer news quiz was our second most-viewed resource. 3. A Lesson Plan on “Fake News” Our most popular lesson plan in 2017? In an “alternative facts” year, maybe it’s no surprise that “Evaluating Sources in a ‘Post-Truth’ World: Ideas for Teaching and Learning About Fake News” was our third most-viewed resource. Though we publish “evergreen” lessons regularly — like those that teach skills — our other most-popular lesson plans this year also responded to the news: • Analyzing Trump’s Immigration Ban: A Lesson Plan
• Teaching Hurricane Harvey: Ideas and Resources
• Island in Crisis: Teaching About Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria
• Text to Text: Comparing Jewish Refugees of the 1930s With Syrian Refugees Today
• Teaching Orwell and ‘1984’ With The New York Times
• Investigating the Heroin and Prescription Opioid Epidemic: A Lesson Plan 4. A Collection of Mini-Films on Race and Bias In March we published a group of 25 mini-films exploring race bias and identity with students drawn from our weekly Film Club, and teachers were delighted. As one reader, Kendra, a public-school teacher in Georgia, wrote: 5. Our Student Editorial Contest We run contests all year long, but two dominated this year in terms of the number of student submissions we received. Our 2017 Editorial Contest, our fifth most-viewed resource published this year, received almost 8,000 entries. Our Summer Reading Contest received almost 9,000 submissions. To find out when these contests, and others, will run during 2018, check out our Contest Calendar. 6. Our Country of the Week Announcement This school year we added a new weekly quiz to take advantage of Times global reporting and multimedia, and our announcement about how the feature can build students’ geography skills was one of our most-viewed posts. To see how the feature works, try our quizzes on Kazakhstan, Bolivia or Zimbabwe. 7. A Student Opinion Question on Columbus Day Each school day we ask students a new question based on a Times article. The prompt “Should the United States Celebrate Columbus Day?” ranks next on our list of most-viewed items. Other popular 2017 Student Opinion questions, based on the number of student comments they received? • Who Should Decide Whether a Teenager Can Get a Tattoo or Piercing?
• What Are Your Reactions to the First Days of the Trump Presidency?
• What Kinds of Games and Puzzles Do You Like? 8. Our Announcement of a New Feature, What’s Going On in This Graph? This school year, we added a new monthly feature called “What’s Going On in This Graph?”, which we produce in partnership with the American Statistical Association. On the second Tuesday of each month we ask students to look closely at a Times graph, chart or map displaying data and notice, wonder and interpret. Our September announcement of this feature is next on our most-viewed list. 9. A Roundup of 160 Picture Prompts In 2016 we invented a new feature we call Picture Prompts — short, accessible, image-driven questions that invite a variety of kinds of writing. We suspected that our June 2017 roundup post, “A Year of Picture Prompts: Over 160 Images to Inspire Writing,” would be popular, and it was. The two Picture Prompts that garnered the most student comments this year? Winter Comforts and Texting While Walking. 10. An Article of the Day About Hurricane Harvey Each day we also publish a brief lesson plan, called Article of the Day, that includes a warm-up activity and critical thinking questions. Because they are short, we can often get them up quickly to respond to breaking news, so it is no surprise that three big events made our most-popular list. In order of page views, they are: • Teaching Activities for: Hurricane Harvey and ‘In Houston, Anxiety and Frantic Rescues as Floodwaters Rise’
• Teaching Activities for: ‘What We Know About the Attacks in Spain’
• Teaching Activities for: ‘Man Charged After White Nationalist Rally in Charlottesville Ends in Deadly Violence’ 11. A September Edition of “What’s Going On in This Picture?” Week after week, “What’s Going On in This Picture?” wins the prize for receiving the most comments of any feature on our site. Our Sept. 11 photo, above, is next on our most-popular list, based on page views, but the Sept. 25 photo shattered the commenting record, with over 1,800 responses. 12. The Announcement of Our New “Current Events Conversation” Feature At the start of this school year we announced a new way for us to promote student voice on The Learning Network. In our Current Events Conversation, we celebrate student writing about the issues of the day, whether politics, the #MeToo moment or Fiona the Hippo. Our September announcement about the feature squeaks in as the last entry on our most-popular list. _________ "
22,"MOSCOW — The war in rebel-held eastern Ukraine has escalated sharply this week, with the heaviest fighting in nearly a year, European observers and Western diplomats reported on Wednesday. The fighting broke out in the midst of a snowstorm overnight Tuesday and has continued unabated since, the observers say. While skirmishes are common, the heavy artillery barrages have been the thickest since a flare-up in February. Ukrainian authorities linked the escalation to the Russian military’s decision to withdraw officers from a joint Russian and Ukrainian liaison group that had assisted in monitoring the shaky cease-fire deal, known as the Minsk 2 agreement. The Russian Foreign Ministry placed the blame for that on Ukraine, saying the Ukrainians had been intimidating the officers and that “all responsibility for possible consequences lies fully on the Ukrainian side.” Since then, a Ukrainian village and a town have been hit with rocket-artillery barrages, wounding eight people and damaging about 50 homes, and at least eight Ukrainian soldiers have been killed. The fighting has also drawn perilously close to a water-treatment plant that stores poisonous chlorine gas, alarming Western officials. “This is considered extremely dangerous,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said of the fighting that has now come within about 500 yards of the plant. Pipes that transport the gas — used mostly to disinfect water today, but as a chemical weapon during World War I — are now vulnerable. "
23,"WASHINGTON — President Trump ended a chaotic first year by achieving his most convincing legislative triumph on Wednesday, making good on his promise to deliver what he called a “big, beautiful” tax cut before Christmas and finally demonstrating the political power of unified Republican control in Washington. Mr. Trump will soon affix his signature to the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that will have broad and far-reaching implications for individual and corporate finances, and will cement the president’s political ownership of an already growing economy that he inherited from his predecessor, President Barack Obama. House lawmakers gave final approval to the tax bill on Wednesday, voting 224 to 201 to drop the corporate rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent, and to deliver tax breaks to other businesses. As Republicans seek to bolster American competitiveness and spur economic growth, the bill also includes tax cuts for individuals that are set to expire after 2025 to make the bill comply with budget rules. The president’s turbulent first year in office has been dogged by investigations, staff turmoil and legislative missteps. But with passage of the tax overhaul, Mr. Trump will enter his second year in office with a roster of Republican achievements that he and his party will try to sell to voters in the 2018 midterm elections: lower taxes, more conservative judges, fewer regulations and more restrictive borders. “This is a big week,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a longtime Trump supporter. “A wide range of people are starting to say, ‘I like him, the tweets may irritate me, but something’s happened.’ Clearly this was the pièce de résistance — this bill at this moment just before Christmas.” It is not clear whether Mr. Trump is going to sign the bill before the end of the year. Republicans need to work with Democrats to avert automatic spending cuts that could be set off as a result of the tax bill adding to the deficit. They need support from Democrats to avoid these spending cuts, and if they wait until next year, it will buy them extra time to reach such a deal. Republicans in Congress were struggling to reach an agreement that would keep the government funded into January and avoid a shutdown. "
24,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’re dealing with uncertainty. How will the Trump administration’s national security strategy, which doesn’t mention global warming, influence military planning for a changing world? How can city planners prepare for rising seas when we don’t know how quickly those seas will rise? How much of a lasting imprint will oil drilling leave in the Arctic wildlife refuge? If all of that is worrisome, not to fear. You’re certain to like next week’s newsletter, when we’ll  look back at some of our biggest climate coverage of 2017. This week, national security experts and environmental activists lamented that President Trump’s new national security strategy does not identify climate change as a threat. It’s a stark reversal from President Barack Obama’s strategy in 2015, which stated that rising global temperatures were an “urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.” "
25,"It was the year when athletes got political again, very political. By the time December arrived, it seemed more routine than incendiary when Lindsey Vonn, the star American skier, made it plain in a CNN interview that she would not be accepting an invitation to the White House if it were extended after the coming Winter Olympics. She said she would be representing her nation at the Games but not President Trump. “I am proud to be an American, and I want our country to continue to be a symbol of hope, compassion, inclusion and world unity,” Vonn said later, in another sign of the times, on her Instagram account. “My travels around the world have recently made clear that this is no longer how people view the United States. You cannot pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV in Europe without noticing how people are questioning our direction.” In a different era, Vonn, with her extensive list of corporate sponsors and hard-earned prominence in a niche sport, might have been the sort of well-entrenched figure who would have determined that she had much more to lose than to gain by taking a stand (or a knee) on a polarizing matter. There are still ample risks: see Colin Kaepernick’s current employment status after leading the way on national anthem protests in the N.F.L., or the menacing messages Vonn said she received from Trump supporters. But there is no doubt that Vonn was part of a sports chorus in 2017. “I think ‘take a knee’ has really taken on a life of its own and spearheaded everything else that’s been going on,” said the former tennis champion Martina Navratilova, 61, who came out as a lesbian and often spoke up — to her own commercial detriment — during her remarkable career. “Things always kind of operate by waxing and waning. This has been a big spurt, and it’s not done yet, because it hasn’t really been resolved one way or the other as far as I can tell.” The chorus has been amplified by the megaphones of social media and also by the old-fashioned snowball effect in a time of societal shifts and global tension, not all of it generated by the American president. When one superstar goes public with strong personal views, it makes it less risky for the next. There is also the mentor factor. When a leading coach, like Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors or Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs, is so outspoken — and eloquent — on political issues, it is less risky for players to follow their lead. “Maybe during the Michael Jordan era, there was the idea that sponsors would frown upon this sort of thing, but the consequences I think are a lot more complex,” said Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist and the director of the Sports Governance Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. “As athletes cross the lines that were maybe once taboo and they learn that the consequences are either not negative or, if you’re LeBron James or Steph Curry, maybe even positive, I think we’ll see more of it because that’s the incentive structure.” Could “Just Say It” become the new mantra to sell shoes? That depends on whether this surge in athlete activism is truly a new paradigm or whether it is part of the same cycle that led from Muhammad Ali and other Vietnam-era sports stars to the apolitical, resolutely mercantile approach of Jordan and Tiger Woods in a less fraught time. “I think now because of the situation we have in our country, reporters are more apt to ask political questions of athletes,” Navratilova said. “Kaepernick kind of opened that door again. We thought we were past it, but we’re not. When Obama was elected, I was like, O.K., we don’t need to worry about racism nearly as much anymore. And now it’s worse. We’re going backwards, which is why I think the athletes are speaking out more, because we are going backwards on so many fronts.” What is evident is that the internet’s capacity to make the distant seem personal is not going away. Whether they are asked political questions or not, athletes, like other celebrities, will continue to be able to deliver their messages — be they solipsistic or deeply civic — directly and immediately to the public, no gatekeepers required. The paradox is that Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, is more symbol than spokesman (he has declined many offers from universities and others to speak). His decision to sit and later kneel during the national anthem before games in 2016 in protest over racial inequality and police violence was the spark that led to the flame and other anthem protests from prominent athletes, including the American women’s soccer star Megan Rapinoe. But the flame turned into a genuine bonfire only in September when Trump politicized the issue by criticizing the patriotism of N.F.L. players and urging owners to take action. It was the N.F.L. that mandated players be on the field for the anthem, beginning in 2009. “By the N.F.L. using athletes as props to try to market America as part of the N.F.L., they also gave athletes power to protest,” Pielke said. The protests angered Trump, and led to tweets that involved the president and two of the biggest American stars: Curry and James. When Trump withdrew a White House invitation to Curry — the point guard who had led the Golden State Warriors to the N.B.A. title but who did not plan on making the usual celebratory appearance at the White House — James weighed in on Twitter. “U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain’t going! So therefore ain’t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up.” Athletes not only used their celebrity and new communication tools to get political in 2017. J.J. Watt, the star defensive lineman for the Houston Texans, started a fund-raising campaign to help  Houston after Hurricane Harvey and raised more than $37 million. Others, like members of the United States women’s national soccer and hockey teams, reaped the financial rewards after taking strong public stands about their right to better pay and working conditions. But while athlete activism was most audible in the United States in 2017, sports figures spoke out elsewhere, too. Prominent Australian athletes — including Australian Rules football players and rugby league players — urged their compatriots to vote yes in the same-sex marriage postal survey that eventually led to Australia legalizing same-sex marriage in December. In Spain, athletes were weighing in or being asked to weigh in on Catalonia’s independence referendum, despite the Spanish government deeming it unconstitutional. Rafael Nadal, back at No. 1 in the tennis rankings, did not hesitate to respond when asked. “I can’t imagine Spain without Catalonia, and Catalonia without Spain; I don’t want to see it,” said Nadal, who is from Majorca and grew up speaking Catalan and Spanish. But more than 20 other Catalan athletes and coaches openly declared their support for independence. Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City coach and former Barcelona star and coach, spoke at a pro-independence rally earlier in the year. Though the Spanish government would declare the referendum illegal and take measures to block it, Gerard Piqué, the star Barcelona defender, was adamant that the Catalans should have had the right to vote. In the wake of the violence sparked by the government crackdown, Barcelona played a home game at the cavernous Camp Nou stadium against Las Palmas behind closed doors without spectators. Piqué was later booed and whistled as he took part in a Spanish national team training session. Though Piqué declined to say how he would have voted, he offered to leave the Spanish national team if Coach Julian Lopetegui believed it was best (Piqué stayed). “Politics is a drag, but why shouldn’t I express myself?” Piqué told reporters. “I understand those players who don’t want to say anything. We’re footballers but we’re people too. Why can a journalist or a mechanic express themselves but not a footballer?” But unlike the biggest stars and leading coaches in the N.B.A., the planet’s leading men’s soccer players have been much more reluctant to get political or even topical. They are restricted by club and national team policies and pressures, by concerns about sponsor reaction but also by their own proclivities. In 2015, Cristiano Ronaldo abruptly and profanely ended a CNN en Español television interview, which he had agreed to with the aim of promoting a new line of headphones, when he was asked about the FIFA corruption scandal and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. “I don’t care about FIFA, and Qatar!” he said. But there is no doubt the impact would be powerful if the Ronaldos, Messis and Neymars of the world were to find their voices on societal, political and soccer governance issues. The questions and opportunities will keep coming. There are plenty of flash points ahead, including next year’s World Cup in Russia, where human rights remain a major issue, just as they did when the Russians hosted the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. Beyond that are the European Games in Minsk in authoritarian Belarus in 2019, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. “If you look at the calendar in the short term to 2018 and then beyond to 2022, you have some of the biggest human rights abusers hosting the biggest sports events,” said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. “With Russia at least, you have a perfect storm of all the major human rights abuses. They had North Korean slave labor building the St. Petersburg stadium. They’ve got laws restricting freedom of protest and expression. They’ve been arresting journalists as recently as last week and crushing civil society and of course there’s still the anti-gay law on the books with the added terrifying exhibit of the recent anti-gay purge in Chechnya.” Will athletes speak out in 2018 in a way they did not or felt they could not in Sochi? Or will they decline to take the risk, which Navratilova makes clear is still there. “I was lucky because I played an individual sport and couldn’t be kept out,” she said. “If I’d been playing on a college basketball team and I come out, the coach doesn’t put me in, and I don’t get to play. With Kaepernick, if he were a golfer or tennis player, he would still be playing, so rotten luck.” "

27,"Congressional Republicans have finally done it: Both the House and Senate passed tax legislation. The bill has now headed to President Trump’s desk for his signature. Most dissection of the plan has focused, for obvious reasons, on the way it changes our tax bills. The Tax Policy Center found that in the first years most people would get a tax cut, although the biggest cuts are reserved for the wealthiest. By 2027, lower- and middle-income Americans would get no benefit or actually pay more in taxes. But this bill also serves as a setup for steep government cuts. Programs from Medicare to flood insurance to food stamps will be at risk the moment President Trump’s signature dries. Some reductions would be inflicted automatically. Others, Republicans will pursue with a handy justification — the revenue hole created by their own legislation. Under the Pay-as-You-Go Act of 2010, or Paygo, the Office of Budget and Management has to order automatic spending cuts if legislation passed by Congress is set to increase the deficit and the rules aren’t waived or the loss isn’t covered by new revenue. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, spending cuts would have to total $136 billion for a bill, such as the tax legislation, that increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion over a decade. What would get cut? Some programs, like Social Security and unemployment benefits, are spared. But plenty of others are seriously exposed. While there are limits on how much Medicare would be pared back, it would still be slashed by $25 billion. The rest of the $111 billion would have to come from other mandatory government programs, and because most have no protection, they would be reduced to barely any funding or nothing at all. That includes block grants for things like Meals on Wheels, farm aid like the crop insurance fund, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and the National Flood Insurance Program. "

29,"WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on five Russian individuals on Wednesday, including the leader of the Republic of Chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses and involvement in criminal conspiracies, a sign that the Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on Russia. The move, which comes despite a more accommodating tone that President Trump has struck with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, blocks property investments that the individuals hold in the United States and forbids Americans from engaging in financial transactions with them. The Treasury Department unveiled the sanctions under the authority of the 2012 Magnitsky Act, an American law that freezes the assets — held in the United States — by Russian officials responsible for human rights abuses, and bars them from receiving American visas. The law was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention after exposing a $230 million tax-theft scam plotted by Russian officials. “Treasury remains committed to holding accountable those involved in the Sergei Magnitsky affair, including those with a role in the criminal conspiracy and fraud scheme that he uncovered,” said John E. Smith, director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. “We will continue to use the Magnitsky Act to aggressively target gross violators of human rights in Russia, including individuals responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture and other despicable acts.” Among those targeted by the sanctions were Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, and Ayub Kataev, a Chechen law enforcement official, for their roles in extrajudicial killings and torture. In 2013, Mr. Kadyrov was placed on a classified list of Russians that the Obama administration had barred from traveling to the United States and whose assets were frozen.

31,"To the Editor: Re “Republican Tax Bill Passes Senate in 51-48 Vote” (nytimes.com, Dec. 20): During the second 2016 presidential debate, Donald Trump laid the responsibility for failing to close tax loopholes, which he freely admitted to exploiting, squarely at Hillary Clinton’s feet: “Why didn’t you change it when you were a senator?” He then promised — twice — to eliminate the carried interest provision (“one of the greatest provisions for people like me”), along with offering the assurance of “big league” tax relief for the middle class. Mrs. Clinton’s reply is worth remembering: “I’ll tell you what he’s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had … Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.” One of those candidates was telling the truth. The other is now the president of the United States. HOWARD KORDER, SANTA FE, N.M. To the Editor: The 27th Amendment says any pay raise that members of Congress give themselves cannot take effect before an intervening election, so that constituents can have a voice in whether the raise was deserved. Something is terribly foul, then, when Republicans in Congress enrich themselves and their president through a blatantly self-interested tax bill, enacted with no public hearings and minimal scrutiny. In all likelihood, the new tax code will benefit many politicians much more than any raise would. It took our Republic more than two centuries to ratify the 27th Amendment. It took the 45th president and Congress less than two months to render it irrelevant. "
32,"UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations High Commissioner for human rights, who has openly criticized powerful governments, including the Trump administration, has made the unusual decision to not seek a second four-year term, saying it “might involve bending a knee in supplication.” The decision by the official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and former diplomat, was conveyed in a short statement that was emailed to his staff early Wednesday and shared with The New York Times. His four-year term expires next September. “After reflection, I have decided not to seek a second four-year term,” he wrote. “To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication; muting a statement of advocacy; lessening the independence and integrity of my voice — which is your voice.” Most United Nations officials serve as long as their mandate allows. Of the previous human rights chiefs, not one has served a full four-year second term. It has been unclear for months whether Mr. al-Hussein’s boss, Secretary General António Guterres, would support him in seeking a second term or whether the five veto-wielding permanent members of the United Nations Security Council would use their influence to block it. Mr. al-Hussein has been critical of all of them. He has been outspoken about the Russian-backed government of Syria. He has warned of the prospects of genocide by the Chinese-backed government of Myanmar. And he has called out the Trump administration several times, most pointedly on the travel ban against citizens of Muslim-majority countries and after the demonstrations by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. “Zeid has done a very impressive job,” said Harold Hongju Koh, a professor of international law at Yale Law School. “He’s operated in a very difficult environment and hasn’t hesitated to speak on very difficult issues.” Mr. al-Hussein’s willingness to take on the powerful by name, along with what he has described as the “eye-watering stupidity” of abusive governments, made him few friends. In his email to his staff, he said, “There are many months ahead of us: months of struggle, perhaps, and even grief — because although the past year has been arduous for many of us, it has been appalling for many of the people we serve.” Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres, confirmed Mr. al-Hussein’s plans to leave after his term expires. “The high commissioner informed the secretary general last week of his intention not to seek another term,” Mr. Dujarric said. “The high commissioner has always enjoyed the full support of the secretary general.” Mr. al-Hussein proved confounding to many by defying classification: the first human rights chief from the Middle East but a sharp critic of violations by Arab governments; a Muslim who condemned Islamic militants; and a Jordanian prince who discarded his title to take the job and become an advocate for victims. “Even more than his predecessors, Zeid fully embraced the role of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights as ‘conscience for the world,’ eloquently using his voice to become ‘a sort of nightmare’ for dictators, demagogues, and anti-democratic foes,” said Felice Gaer, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, in New York. "
33,"WASHINGTON — Senior national security officials in the Trump administration are embracing a proposal to transfer to Saudi Arabia an American citizen being held in Iraq as a wartime detainee, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. A meeting last week of the National Security Council’s “deputies committee” — the No. 2 leaders of national security departments and agencies — found its members united around a goal of pursuing such a transfer for the detainee, suspected of being a low-level Islamic State fighter, who has been held in military custody as an “enemy combatant” for the past three months, the officials said. The man, whose name the government has refused to make public, was born in the United States to visiting Saudi parents, the officials said. A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to comment. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal deliberations. The Trump administration has been wrestling with what to do with the man since a Syrian militia turned him over to American forces in mid-September. Legal pressure to resolve his fate has been building since the American Civil Liberties Union filed a habeas corpus lawsuit in October challenging his detention on his behalf. The government initially wanted to prosecute the man in a civilian court for providing material assistance to terrorism, but the F.B.I. was unable to assemble sufficient courtroom-admissible evidence against him. "
34,"The estate of Rachel Lambert Mellon, the millionaire heiress and tastemaker known as Bunny, has been selling off her massive collection of art, fashion and fineries since her death in 2014, at the age of 103. But there are gems yet to be sold. Mrs. Mellon’s 2,100-square-foot aerie on the 28th floor of Essex House, an Art Deco hotel and condo tower facing Central Park, is expected to list for $8.9 million. The three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath apartment carries monthly common charges of $9,465; taxes are $2,010 a month. Among her many properties, which include d homes in Antigua, Paris and a more than 2,000-acre estate in Upperville, Va., the New York condo was low on the list. She bought it primarily for business appointments and social gatherings when she visited the city, said Alex Forger, her attorney and executor of her will. She bought two adjacent units for $5.9 million in 2000, according to public records, and combined them into a unified space with a wall of windows overlooking the span of Central Park. Like many of Mrs. Mellon’s purchases, it is both lavish and understated, consciously so. Besides the titan-of-industry view, there are no gilded accents or eye-catching fixtures. The walls are painted white — to be fair, five shades of it, the designer said — and the herringbone floors are well worn. There is recessed lighting in the nine-foot ceilings and painted cabinets on either end of the living room, now filled with reams of estate paperwork. "
35,"The jury considering the fate of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker charged with participating in an oil-for-gold smuggling scheme that violated United States sanctions against Iran, was sent home by the judge on Wednesday after deliberating for half a day without reaching a verdict. Mr. Atilla, 47, was a deputy general manager of a Turkish state bank, Halkbank, that prosecutors say was crucial to the success of the sanctions evasion. The government presented evidence that Mr. Atilla helped to devise the scheme and that he deceived United States Treasury Department officials about it. “This is a case about lies,” a prosecutor, Michael D. Lockard, said Tuesday in the government’s closing argument. “This is a case about the lies that Mr. Atilla told to cover up a multibillion dollar sanctions-busting scheme operating out of his bank.” Mr. Atilla, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he had participated in any such conspiracy or that he had engaged in wrongdoing. His lawyers painted him as the victim of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who pleaded guilty in October and has been cooperating with the government. “Hakan Atilla is a blameless pawn, collateral damage in a story that belongs in the ‘Twilight Zone,’ not in an American courtroom,” Victor J. Rocco, a lawyer for Mr. Atilla, told the jury on Tuesday in the defense’s summation. Over seven days of testimony, Mr. Zarrab, 34, said the scheme had been approved at the highest levels of the Turkish government. In 2012, he said, Recep Tayyip Erdogan — then Turkey’s prime minister, now its president — ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the operation. Mr. Erdogan has denounced the prosecution of Mr. Atilla and Mr. Zarrab, claiming it was based on fabricated evidence and raising the matter with American officials, including President Trump. In Turkey, the impact of the widely watched case continued this week with a court issuing detention orders for the parents, wife, two sisters and a brother of Huseyin Korkmaz, a former Turkish police officer who testified for the government at the trial, according to the Anadolu News Agency. None of Mr. Korkmaz’s relatives were found in their residences. Mr. Korkmaz had led a Turkish corruption investigation that resulted in the 2013 arrest of Mr. Zarrab and others, an inquiry that was later quashed by Turkish officials. Mr. Zarrab was released and restarted his smuggling scheme, according to trial testimony, while Mr. Korkmaz was jailed and later fled from Turkey. He carried with him a trove of evidence that he gave to United States authorities. Mr. Korkmaz testified last week that he had given certain pieces of evidence to his mother for safekeeping. Earlier Wednesday, the trial judge, Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan, instructed the jurors on the law before sending them out at 12:35 to begin deliberations. At day’s end, the jury requested certain pieces of evidence, including an arrest video of Mr. Atilla, diagrams Mr. Zarrab had drawn for the jury, as well as highlighters, Post-it notes, pens, coffee, tea, milk and hot water. The deliberations were to resume on Thursday. "

37,"CAIRO — Vice President Mike Pence’s planned visit to the Middle East, the cradle of Christianity, ought to have had a particular poignancy in the days before Christmas. It didn’t quite work out that way. When he first floated the idea of a trip in October, Mr. Pence, an evangelical Christian, vowed to highlight the persecution of Christians at the hands of Islamic State extremists, and he scheduled meeting with several Christian leaders, which was sure to play well with his conservative American base. “Christianity now faces an exodus in the Middle East unrivaled since the days of Moses,” he said in a speech sprinkled with biblical references. “Help is on the way.” But then on Dec. 6, President Trump recognized  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, smashing seven decades of American policy and provoking violent protests. One by one, Christian leaders publicly canceled their meetings with Mr. Pence. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority — a critical figure in the Trump administration’s ambitious plans for a sweeping Middle East peace deal — also canceled. Then Mr. Pence himself canceled the whole trip, saying he needed to stay in Washington to oversee an important tax reform vote — an assertion that drew a measure of skepticism. A White House official also said it was “not practically possible” for Mr. Pence to travel because the tax vote would have pushed his trip against the Jewish holiday of Shabbat and Christmas. Now, as he prepares for his tentatively rescheduled trip in mid-January, the unanimous chorus of rejection from Christian leaders bodes ominously for his ambitions for the visit. Mr. Pence had hoped the trip would help end the storm of recrimination unleashed by Mr. Trump’s decision on Jerusalem and allow the administration to push forward with other priorities, like countering Iran and combating the Islamic State. “This trip is part of kind of the ending of that chapter, and the beginning of what I will say is the next chapter,” a senior administration official told reporters during a background briefing in Washington on Friday. Instead, opprobrium over Mr. Trump’s decision has sliced through political and sectarian lines across the Middle East, cutting into even the president’s most cherished alliances in the region. Among the religious leaders who refused to meet Mr. Pence is the head of Al Azhar, Cairo’s ancient bastion of Sunni Muslim scholarship — a bold move unlikely to have been taken without at least tacit approval from President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, an otherwise staunch Trump ally. That was a blow. The Trump administration has made much of the plight of the Copts, the largest Christian denomination in the Middle East, who have suffered a spate of devastating attacks on churches and buses filled with pilgrims this year. Palestinians viewed Mr. Pence’s original delay with skepticism. “Take it with a large grain of salt — he wanted a way out,” said Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian Christian lawmaker and a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee. “He knew he was not welcome.” Certainly, the optics would most likely have been poor. In Bethlehem — where the Abbas-Pence meeting had been scheduled to take place, according to Palestinian officials — banners that read “Bethlehem refuses US vice president’s visit,” now hang over Manger Square, near the Church of the Nativity. On Sunday, a small group of Palestinian protesters burned photographs of Mr. Pence and his chief negotiator, Jason Greenblatt, in the square and stamped on them, according to witnesses. And the regional wave of anger over the Jerusalem issue has yet to subside. A spokesman for Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic patriarch of Egypt, underscored the depth of feeling. “The pope will simply not sit down with anyone so long as this is the American position,” said the spokesman, Rev. Boules Haliem. “We will always stand with the people of Palestine.” In Jerusalem itself, the patriarchs and leaders of 13 Christian churches said in a Christmas message on Wednesday that Mr. Trump’s decision “tramples on the mechanism that has maintained peace throughout the ages,” and warned it “will lead to a very dark reality.” Even close American allies in the region have shown displeasure. On Monday, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, had to resort to America’s veto power to block a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Egypt, that demanded Mr. Trump to rescind his decision on Jerusalem, and his plans to move the American Embassy there. On Tuesday, Ms. Haley lashed out at allies who voted against her, warning on Twitter that “The US will be taking names.” The public snubs from Christian leaders are a sign of the deep ideological gulf between American evangelicals like Mr. Pence, whose support for Israel is rooted in biblical prophesy, and the Christian communities that have lived in the area since the time of Jesus himself. The conservative evangelical leaders who endorsed Mr. Trump in his run for the White House say they made it clear to him early in the campaign that recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was one of their top priorities, right up there with opposition to abortion and gay marriage. In multiple meetings at the White House with Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence and their aides, these evangelical advisers said, they repeatedly pressed Mr. Trump to recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and to move the American Embassy there, and were promised it would happen. Mr. Pence became a main conduit for these religious leaders. “I definitely believe the decision would not have happened without the influence of evangelicals who are in communication with the White House,” said the Rev. Johnnie Moore, an evangelical writer who has become a spokesman for the evangelical advisers to the Trump administration. “It has been an issue of priority for a long time.” Their reasons are both theological and political. Evangelicals believe in the biblical prophecy that God promised the land of Israel — including modern-day Jerusalem — to Abraham and his descendants. They also believe in the prophecy that the Jews must return to Israel from the diaspora before Jesus will return — but evangelical leaders insist that these “end times” prophecies are not a major factor driving their passion on the issue. Palestinian Christians do not identify with the evangelicals’ vision. Though the list of Christian representatives originally scheduled to meet Mr. Pence had not yet been completed, some, according to one Palestinian official, had been curious to meet him for a theological argument. When they heard that the meeting was off, he said, none were particularly disappointed. “To declare Jerusalem as the capital based on some biblical argument is a dangerous thing,” said Father Jamal Khader, the Catholic parish priest of Ramallah. “He’s wanting to separate Christians from the rest of the community. But we are part of the community.” It is unclear if any Palestinians would ultimately have met with Mr. Pence quietly, in Jerusalem. But by Wednesday, Mr. Abbas had left on what appeared to be a hastily scheduled trip to Saudi Arabia. Expected in France on Friday, he is scheduled to be back in time to attend the traditional Christmas Eve Mass in Bethlehem on Sunday. “I don’t agree with an ideology that looks at Christians as Westerners, or wants us to side against Muslims,” Father Khader added. “No — we lived together for 1,400 years, and we can live with them now.” "

39,"WASHINGTON — It was an unsightly and painful yearlong slog, but Republicans are finally getting what they so desperately craved — a major legislative victory in the form of a consequential tax overhaul. By coupling a substantial corporate tax cut with an assortment of naked appeals to undecided lawmakers, Republican leaders pushed their tax bill through the House on Tuesday and the Senate on Wednesday, touching off a self-congratulatory tidal wave by a party that had struggled mightily through nearly all of 2017. After an embarrassing inability to repeal the Affordable Care Act — a core promise by congressional Republicans since 2010 — Republicans knew they had no choice but to deliver a tax package or face brutal repudiation by their voters and campaign donors. “Our attitude from the beginning was failure was not an option,” said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No.3 House Republican and the party’s chief vote counter. But even as they closed in on what they celebrated as a historic triumph, Republicans found another creative way to stumble. A challenge to the House-passed measure by Senate Democrats discovered three provisions — including the very title of the bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — that violated special Senate rules being used to skirt a filibuster. The flub necessitated the formality of a second House vote on Wednesday after Speaker Paul D. Ryan and his membership had already spiked the ball after initial approval of the bill on Tuesday. The final legislative outcome was not in doubt, but the ramifications of the legislation were. Republicans said the bill would prompt an economic boom sufficient to offset a projected explosion in the federal deficit, create jobs, raise wages and even contribute to national unity. “This is a new beginning, if you will, and a time for America to really forge a path of leadership in this new century that provides a better quality of life and a higher standard of living for American families,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No.3 Senate Republican. Congressional Democrats — who all rejected the measure — predicted a severe political backlash. They are itching to pound Republicans for what Democrats consider to be an ill-timed and ill-conceived giveaway to the rich by a party and a president who promised to intercede for the working class. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, labeled the bill “simply theft — monumental, brazen theft from the American middle class and from every person who aspires to reach it.” Republicans dismissed the denunciation as sour grapes. They didn’t seem overly worried about the political consequences of tying their future to legislation that was polling badly. For many, this was precisely what they had come to Washington to do, and they had finally done it with the help of President Trump — a man who might sometimes make their lives more difficult but was eager to sign their tax bill and claim his share of the credit. “Even before the rise of Donald Trump, we have been awaiting this day to be done for a long time,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said in a recent interview. “We just didn’t have the pieces in place to achieve it. And all of the sudden after November’s election, we did have the pieces in place.” Mr. McConnell has considered criticism of his party for its lack of accomplishment to be a bad rap, pointing to the flurry of conservative judicial appointments he has engineered as well as successful efforts by the Trump administration to ease the federal regulatory environment. But there was no denying that Republicans, in full control of the White House and Congress, had failed to meet their own lofty expectations set at the start of the year, and the furious two-month drive to pass the tax bill reflected that sentiment. For Mr. Ryan, this was a watershed day. His pursuit of a tax cut had dominated his career and he gaveled down the winning vote with such enthusiasm that the gavel fell to the floor. “This is profound change and this is change that is going to put our country on the right path,” Mr. Ryan said. Yet he had shifted his message from a few weeks ago when he dismissed parallels to the Democratic passage in 2010 of the new health care law, which proved an anchor for Democrats in midterm elections that year. Mr. Ryan had initially said that the tax cut was not unpopular, as the health care law had been; now he says that the tax cuts will prove popular as Americans realize the benefits. “Results are going to make this popular,” he said. But Democrats, even those up for re-election in areas dominated last year by Mr. Trump, expressed their opposition with their votes. Not one was willing to support the bill, which Democratic strategists said would penalize suburban swing voters who have already shown increasing antipathy to Republicans in elections this year. “This bill is a significant missed opportunity,” said Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana, one of the Democrats facing re-election who is most at risk of losing his seat next year. Republicans were already facing a rough time in 2018 given the usual reverberations against a first-term president of the same party, and the tax bill could exacerbate those difficulties. Not to mention that lawmakers still had to extricate themselves from the possibility of a voter-alienating government shutdown by the end of the week. Republicans said they were confident that voters would quickly see gains under the tax bill — lower payroll withholding and strong employment numbers, for example — and reward those who supported the legislation. They acknowledge it is a gamble, but one they saw as well worth taking. After all, it is precisely what many of them came to Washington to do. "
40,"A scientist recruited by the renowned Cleveland Clinic is stuck in India because his visa is delayed. An entrepreneur courted by Silicon Valley companies had his application denied. Many green card applicants have new interviews to pass. The Trump administration has pursued its immigration agenda loudly and noticeably, ramping up arrests of undocumented immigrants, barring most travel from several majority-Muslim countries and pressing the case for a border wall. But it has also quietly, and with much less resistance, slowed many forms of legal immigration without the need for Congress to rescind a single visa program enshrined in the law. Immigration and State Department officials are more closely scrutinizing, and have started more frequently denying, visas for people seeking to visit the United States on business, as well as for those recruited by American companies, according to lawyers representing visa seekers. Foreigners already in the United States whose employers wish to extend their stays are also facing new hurdles. “I call this the real wall,” said Anastasia Tonello, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The wall is being built.” The changes show how the Trump administration has managed to carry out the least attention-grabbing, but perhaps farthest-reaching, portion of the president’s immigration plans: cutting the number of people entering the United States each year as temporary workers or permanent residents.

ordan Peele is famous, in part, for imitations — of rappers and dingbats and the 44th president of the United States. But he would be impossible to imitate. He isn’t ribald. He’s droll. Sometimes he’s not even that. Sometimes he’s quiet. Sometimes he’s sitting across from you expecting you to hold up your end of a conversation. Sometimes he’s listening and hearing you — like, really hearing you. This is the Peele who made “Get Out,” and it takes a minute to square him with the Peele from “Key & Peele.” On Halloween, we had lunch at one of those casually cool American bistros in Los Angeles where all the food seems as if it was grown out back. He chose a spot outside, not to be seen (although a few people saw him) but mostly to see. Peele, who is 38, lives in his head, and he watches the world around him intensely. I got the duck, then so did he, and while we ate I was pretty sure I could hear him thinking. It was toward the end of the meal when he saw someone he recognized. Well, he thought he did. “He’s dressed like Chris,” he said with some amusement. “Do you think he’s being Chris?” He was looking past me, so it was hard to turn all the way around to confirm with any subtlety. But Peele’s gaze made it perfectly obvious to the person approaching that Peele was looking at him. “Are you Chris from ‘Get Out’ for Halloween?” Peele asked, committing less an act of racial profiling than an uncanny identification of his own handiwork. “Get Out,” of course, is the surprise hit movie that Peele wrote and directed about a black man named Chris, who discovers that his white girlfriend’s family is running a nasty racist conspiracy. Chris has big, watery eyes that seem red from weariness (or weed) and wears a collarless blue chambray shirt over a gray T-shirt and jeans. The man Peele thought might be costumed as Chris was also black, with skin as dark and eyes as striking as those of Daniel Kaluuya, the actor who plays Chris. This impostor was indeed Chris-attired too. And the white woman he was with could also have been part of the costume. It was the sort of similarity that, once pointed out, can’t be unseen. Alas, it wasn’t Halloween for this guy, just Tuesday. He was thrilled, nonetheless, to be stopped by Chris’s inventor, and he asked Peele for a photo. Peele, who got a kick even out of being wrong, asked him for one, too. The impostor then offered an incidental, partial explanation for why “Get Out” became the phenomenon it did: No, he wasn’t Chris, “but I could be.” It has been 10 months, and we’re still talking about this movie and its alarming presentation of white racism. “Get Out” opened at the top of the box office at the end of February and has grossed many, many times the $4.5 million it cost to make. Racism is old, but Peele found a poetic new way of talking about it. He gave us language we didn’t know we lacked. For a white audience, the movie might be one of the few times they’ve been asked to identify with a regular, imperiled black person without the sweetener of a white co-star — no Spencer Tracy or Sandra Bullock here, just Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford as the Armitages, the sort of parents who’ll inquire about the history of their daughter’s interracial relationship by asking: “How long’s this been going on? This thang,” as daddy Armitage does. For a black audience, the movie could have ended right there. What does an affluent, middle-aged, suburban white dude know about a thang? And what’s he doing saying the word with this much insinuating self-delight, this much put-on jive? “I didn’t want any white saviors,” Peele said over lunch. White saviors hog the history of race in American film. Instead, his movie is full of white people whom Peele reveals as insatiable predators of blackness. "

Portugal had initially offered to return the territory in the 1970s, but China’s leaders demurred because they feared losing a trading link to the outside world, The Times reported on the eve of the 1999 handover. “Since then, the Portuguese administration has presided over Macau’s steady deterioration into a disreputable, vaguely sinister gambling destination for weekend wagerers from Hong Kong,” the Times story said. The territory, which is about 40 miles west of Hong Kong, has a population of roughly 650,000. A different kind of milestone was reached less than a decade after the handover, when Macau overtook Las Vegas to become the world’s biggest gambling center, with $6.95 billion in annual revenue. “Where Macau was once derided for its seedy gambling dens and endemic organized crime, it is now being referred to as Asia’s Las Vegas, and not just by the locals,” The Times reported in 2007.

43,"Early in “The Greatest Showman,” P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: “Just once I’d like to give them something real.” What fun is that? Even after the long-running circus bearing his name closed up shop this year, P.T. Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There’s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: “We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.” “The Greatest Showman,” a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It’s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right. “Showman” has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year’s hit movie “La La Land” (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show “Dear Evan Hansen” (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn’t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn’t get any wittier than that. "
44,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “To pause and look back is a revelation.” See the photos that our editors chose for The Year in Pictures, including the image above, of Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar. “It’s a cliché to remark that the time has moved quickly and slowly all at once,” our writer Amanda Hess says in an accompanying essay. “But one of the dark powers of our devices is to bend time, to suck us into the screen and spit us out seemingly months later. To study these photos is to be perpetually surprised at everything that happened this year.” _____ 2. Congress passed the $1.5 trillion tax cut (the House for the second time in two days, after a procedural snag). It’s on its way to President Trump’s desk, and he celebrated its passage at the White House, above. The measure is the biggest overhaul of the tax code in a generation, and Democrats vowed to use it as a cudgel in the 2018 midterm elections. Republicans say the bill’s results will make it popular. The measure also eliminates the Affordable Care Act’s rule that most people have health insurance or pay a penalty. We discussed the idea’s Republican, conservative origins, and what the change will mean on “The Daily.” _____ 3. At a cabinet meeting, President Trump threatened to cut aid to any country that votes in favor of a resolution at the U.N. General Assembly denouncing his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. It’s difficult to see how Mr. Trump could deliver on his threat, since it could involve cutting off aid to a number of strategic allies, including Egypt. The vote comes Thursday. _____ 4. Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as archbishop of Boston in 2002 amid the pedophile priest scandal seen in the film “Spotlight,” died in Rome. He was 86. His funeral will be held in St. Peter’s Basilica on Thursday. In his long career, he had campaigned for civil rights and social justice, defended church orthodoxy and become a friend of presidents, the pope and other powerful figures. But his stature was shattered by revelations that he had protected child molesters for years. _____ 5. The European Union’s highest court declared that Uber is a transportation business, not just a tech platform that connects drivers with riders. Above, an anti-Uber protest in Spain. The ruling is a blow to Uber, which must now abide by the same rules as taxi companies. And it could have big ramifications for other tech companies benefiting from the gig economy, built on freelance, short-term workers. _____ 6. The season of giving has also become a time for stealing other people’s gifts. The rise in online shopping means bonanzas for porch pirates, who help themselves to boxes left outside homes. People are using surveillance technology to thwart thieves — and social media to shame them. _____ 7. When the Winklevoss twins invested their Facebook settlement in Bitcoin, many snickered. But the soaring value of Bitcoin is giving the entrepreneur brothers a moment of vindication: Their stockpile is now worth $1.3 billion. _____ 8. It was just another day in the recording studio. That was the key to writing Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You,” the runaway hit that topped Billboard’s year-end singles chart and has become the most-played track ever on Spotify, with more than 1.5 billion streams. In this video, Mr. Sheeran and his writing mates explain how they crafted the tune in just 90 minutes. And he sheepishly admits he had no idea it was anything special. _____ 9. Thursday is the solstice, the shortest day of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the longest day of summer in the Southern. In New York City, the sun will be in the sky for just over nine hours. Starting Friday, the days will start to get longer once again. Here’s more about how it works — and why humans might not exist without it. _____ 10. Finally, the latest episode in our video series “Dance in the Real World” takes you inside the vogueing scene in New York City, above. And late-night hosts had a lot to say about the tax bill. Jimmy Fallon noted a report that found many Americans would end up paying more in taxes by 2027. “Trump said it’s payback for the majority of Americans who voted for Hillary Clinton,” he joked.

46,"Andrew Ross Sorkin was a 24-year-old mergers and acquisitions reporter for The New York Times when, in 2001, he began sending a daily email roundup to his readers. He called it “DealBook.” Now, almost 17 years later, DealBook is an integral part of The Times’s news report — and has expanded its coverage in print, on the web and through an annual conference. In the meantime, Mr. Sorkin, who first wrote for The Times while still in high school, has written a best-selling book (“Too Big to Fail”), won two Gerald Loeb Awards and helped create a television series, “Billions,” for Showtime. He is also a co-anchor of Squawk Box, a financial news program on CNBC. What follows is a lightly edited Q. and A. about the origins — and the future — of DealBook, which relaunched in November. _____ We’re expanding our mandate to become a smartly curated, one-stop shop for all the day’s key business and policy news and analysis in real time. The business world is now inextricably linked with policy — in Washington, in Brussels, in Beijing — in a way that it has never been before. Corporate C.E.O.s and investors increasingly spend as much time in D.C. as they do on Wall Street. Business has become politics. And politics is business. That’s why we’re relaunching DealBook with a renewed focus on the intersection of these crosscurrents, leveraging the entire reporting staff of The New York Times for our deeply loyal reader base of influential business and policy leaders and an expanding global audience. We’re going to be touching on everything from lobbying to technology to taxes to automation’s impact on jobs to the business community’s approach to climate change. Our goal is to bring readers unique insights and exclusive behind-the-scenes details about the day’s most important headlines. And of course, we will continue to cover the world of deal making and finance. It was 2001. The Times had just asked me to move back from London, where I had been covering mergers in Europe for the paper, to New York to take over the merger beat here. As I went around meeting people on Wall Street, it occurred to me that many of them were spending as much of the day as I did trying to piece together various news reports, to stay up-to-date. I figured there could be value in curating a daily report that put all of the news together from all sorts of news sources, and in prioritizing the news in a way that made sense for this audience. Back then, the idea of linking to a competitor, whether it be The Wall Street Journal or The Financial Times, was considered treasonous. Blogging was in its infancy. And the real insight was to send the report by email every morning, putting it at the top of everyone’s inbox when they woke up. Back then, by the way, we used to get requests to send the newsletter by fax! Over time, as our readership increased from a couple hundred to over 300,000, DealBook moved from being put together by me in my pajamas at home at 5 in the morning, supported by a small team, to a larger and larger team. We started our website in 2006 and began doing much more original reporting and offering analysis throughout the day. In 2010, we grew even bigger. Along the way, we added an annual conference, a daily page in the newspaper, two annual special sections and more. One of the best parts of this project: We’ve been able to hire some amazingly talented people over the years, many of whom now populate all different parts of the paper. Among them: Susanne Craig (who famously got President Trump’s old tax records in the mail); Azam Ahmed, the bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean; Ben Protess, who now covers the Trump administration and its potential conflicts of interests; Kevin Roose, our newest business columnist with The Shift; Alexandra Stevenson, a correspondent in Hong Kong; and Adrienne Carter, who is now the deputy business editor. Michael Schmidt, a star in our Washington bureau, did some writing for us early on in his career — as did Thomas Kaplan, who now covers Congress and was once on loan to us as a summer intern. Michael J. de la Merced, our most prolific DealBook writer and a mainstay of the report, started working with us all the way back in 2006. The Times was pretty early in developing email newsletters. However, many were just automated lists of headlines. It was the addition of truly original writing and reporting that really elevated The Times’s newsletters in recent years. Readers have gravitated to email newsletters — they’re the best way to cut through the overwhelming nature of everything online. For me, I have always been driven by trying to figure out what the reader wants — and what they need. Whenever I finish an interview for a story, I often ask this series of questions: “What do you read? What’s wrong with it? What’s missing? What do you wish you had that you don’t have?” Everything that I’ve ever built has come from trying to fulfill the answers to those questions. "
47,"PRIENAI, Lithuania — It was only fitting, perhaps, that an intercontinental escapade exhibiting the awesome power of the present day sports-celebrity-industrial complex began with a late-night direct message on Twitter. At around 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 6, Erikas Kirvelaitis, a 21-year-old basketball journalist in Lithuania, sent an unsolicited question via Twitter to Harrison Gaines, a sports agent in Los Angeles with two semifamous teenage clients: Would LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball, by any chance, be interested in playing professional basketball in Prienai? Kirvelaitis had been hired only a few months earlier to do part-time communications work for Prienai-Birstonas Vytautas, a small club here in the Lithuanian basketball league. His bosses did not know at first about his Twitter gambit. It was a shot in the dark, anyway. But to Kirvelaitis’s amazement, Gaines wrote back asking for more information. And less than a week later, the young Americans were signing contracts to begin their professional careers in this unassuming town nearly 6,000 miles from home. “It was like a dream, crazy, a miracle, for our club to even have contact with them,” Kirvelaitis said. “But I’m someone who believes anything can be done if you try.” "
48,"WASHINGTON — The House, forced to vote a second time on the $1.5 trillion tax bill, moved swiftly to pass the final version on Wednesday, clearing the way for President Trump to sign into law the most sweeping tax overhaul in decades. House lawmakers approved the tax bill 224 to 201 on Wednesday, after being forced to vote on the bill again after last-minute revisions were made to it in the Senate, which passed the measure 51 to 48 early Wednesday morning. The final House vote was essentially a formality, as the changes, which were made to comply with Senate budget rules, did not significantly alter the overall bill. But the need for a second vote gave ammunition to Democrats, who had already accused Republicans of trying to rush the tax overhaul through the House and Senate. “We are five days away from Christmas, but it feels like Groundhog Day,” said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who denounced the process by which Republicans undertook their tax rewrite as “nothing short of an abomination.” Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said, “We will be cleaning up this mess and the blunders in this bill all of next year.” The tax rewrite is the biggest legislative achievement for Republicans since they gained full control of Congress and the White House. The tax bill delivers deep and permanent tax cuts for corporations while providing temporary tax cuts for individual taxpayers, including the wealthiest Americans. The overhaul drops the corporate rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent, as Republicans seek to boost American competitiveness and spur economic growth. In addition, it provides a tax break to owners of pass-through businesses, whose profits are taxed through the individual code. The bill also cuts taxes for individuals, including a lower top rate of 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent. It nearly doubles the standard deduction and doubles the child tax credit, and it also doubles the size of inheritances shielded from estate taxation, to $22 million for married couples. But Republicans set the individual tax cuts to expire after 2025 in order to make the bill comply with budget rules. In a move that drew significant criticism from lawmakers from states with high taxes, the bill caps the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000. Twelve House Republicans voted against the tax bill on both Tuesday and Wednesday, and 11 of those members were from California, New Jersey and New York, three states with high taxes. The bill also eliminates the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a penalty, known as the individual mandate, providing Republicans with a victory on health care after their previous failure to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health law. It also opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a “bill passage event” at the White House with lawmakers at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, where he is expected to continue his public praise of the bill’s passage. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump cheered the tax cuts on Twitter and lamented “the Fake News” and “the defeated Dems” who “demean” the cuts. Republicans passed the bill under special procedures that allowed them to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, where they have a narrow majority. But as a result, they had to abide by budget rules that limited the contents of their bill, and three provisions were deemed by the Senate parliamentarian to run afoul of those rules. Those components included a provision to allow the use of 529 savings accounts for homeschooling expenses, as well as part of the criteria for determining whether colleges and universities are subject to an excise tax imposed on their investment income. The provision naming the bill as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was deemed out of bounds, too, because it would not have a budgetary effect. Senate Democrats challenged the problematic language, which was subsequently removed from the bill, necessitating another vote in the House. “If you believe it’s an important use of the Democratic minority’s time on the Senate side to strike the title of the bill because it doesn’t actually impact deficit reduction, it is within their right,” said Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia. “Does it represent the highest and best use of their time? It does not.” But Mr. Doggett seized on the last-minute development. “It is a bill that has no name, and of course it has no heart,” he said. Mr. Doggett suggested that the bill could be called the “Donald J. Trump Windfall Bill,” arguing that Mr. Trump and his family would be enriched by the tax rewrite. "
49,"WASHINGTON — President Trump celebrated the tax bill that Congress approved on Wednesday by characterizing it as a two-for-one victory, falsely claiming that it also made good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “When the individual mandate is being repealed, that means Obamacare is being repealed,” Mr. Trump said in a cabinet meeting. “We have essentially repealed Obamacare, and we will come up with something that will be much better.” Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he kept two key campaign promises with one bill is not accurate. Effectively, the tax bill does repeal the individual mandate beginning in 2019. The mandate is a core component of the Affordable Care Act and fines people who do not have health insurance. But the tax bill leaves every other vital part of the current health care law intact. “The A.C.A. is far more than the mandate, and the repeal of the mandate is by no means a fatal blow. Most of the A.C.A. survives, and most of its coverage gains will remain,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law and a contributing editor for the journal Health Affairs. Republicans repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act over the summer. The individual mandate was one of 12 key elements of the health care law, which also included provisions that addressed access to insurance, requirements for insurance policies and costs of coverage. Under the Affordable Care Act, businesses with at least 50 employees must offer insurance to full-time workers. Medicaid eligibility was expanded to cover more low-income people, and young adults under 26 could stay on their parents’ plans. The law stipulated that insurers guarantee essential health benefits. It limited insurers in placing annual lifetime caps on the value of benefits while prohibiting them from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions or increasing costs for older Americans. The law also set up federal and state exchanges for purchasing insurance, provided subsidies for out-of-pocket costs and gave tax credits for premiums purchased on these exchanges. Additionally, it levied a series of new taxes to pay for the costs. Repeal of the individual mandate “will undoubtedly do harm, however, to insurance markets and those who depend on them,” Mr. Jost said. It will lead to higher premiums and fewer people insured, and insurers may flee smaller markets. But millions of people will keep their health coverage, regardless of the tax bill. The expansion of Medicaid, for example, is responsible for insuring more than half of the 20 million people who gained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. While the Congressional Budget Office estimates that five million people may opt out of Medicaid coverage without the individual mandate, twice as many will remain insured because of the original expansion. Nearly 50 percent of Americans who obtain insurance through their employers will feel little impact from the individual mandate repeal. But they will continue to have health insurance plans with broader benefits, as required by the Affordable Care Act. "

53,"A day after a dramatic recount handed Democrats a single-vote victory in a Virginia House of Delegates race, the outcome abruptly shifted on Wednesday as a three-judge panel declared the race now tied. The judges meeting in Newport News, Va., agreed to a Republican request to count a problematic ballot discarded the day before, said Philip L. Hatchett, a lawyer for David Yancey, the Republican incumbent who seemed to have lost his seat to Shelly Simonds, a Democrat. A victory by Ms. Simonds, a school board member in Newport News, would evenly split the Virginia House 50-50 and end 17 years of Republican majorities. The decision sets up a remarkable scenario: a drawing of a name from a bowl to pick the winner of the race and, with it, the balance of power in a chamber of the state legislature. The drawing will take place on Wednesday in Richmond, the State Board of Elections announced on Thursday. According to James Alcorn, the chairman of the election board, each candidate’s name will be put into an old 35-millimeter film canister, the canisters will be mixed together in a bowl, and one will be plucked by an elections official. Mr. Alcorn said the same process is used regularly to choose the order of names on a ballot. The disputed ballot in that was debated in court on Wednesday showed two bubbles filled in, one for Ms. Simonds and one for Mr. Yancey, but with a fine line struck through the Simonds vote, according to a copy obtained by The Virginian-Pilot. The voter chose Republicans for governor and in other statewide races on the Nov. 7 ballot. "

56,"The tax bill passed by Congress on Wednesday is effectively a giant bet that benefits given to companies and the wealthy will help average workers. That makes them a big risk for the Republicans who control Congress. Here are five factors to measure the policy’s success. Inequality: Republicans have done a bad job selling their plan to the public, with 55 percent of Americans opposing it, according to a CNN poll. The top 5 percent of income earners would see the biggest cuts, the Tax Policy Center said. Republicans risk the biggest backlash on this front, with reductions in tax breaks like state and local deductions hitting average Americans. Any sign that the tax bill has worsened rather than eased inequity will hand Democrats a stick to thwack Republicans in midterm elections next year. Wages: Pay increases have been disappointing given the low 4.1 percent level of unemployment. The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers said a corporate tax rate of 20 percent — just below the 21 percent on which Congress settled — would result in an average annual income increase of at least $4,000 at the end of 10 years. A visible rise in wages would be a positive effect of the tax bill. Yet it’s also one of the most dubious projections because companies will be under pressure to share earnings gains with shareholders, too. Stock market: One of President Trump’s most common brags is on the rise of markets. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tweeted “DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.” Tax cuts will probably send markets even higher — and are most likely one reason valuations are already so lofty — but because it suggests investors think higher earnings will flow to the bottom line rather than being paid out to workers, it’s perhaps not such an encouraging sign. Capital investment: Nonresidential business investment has improved after being sluggish or negative over the last two years. Spending on equipment rose 10.4 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in three years. But the type of investment is important. An increase will only matter if it helps bolster sluggish productivity. G.D.P. growth: Mr. Trump predicted tax cuts would turbocharge the economy to a 6 percent growth rate, compared with the 3.3 percent annualized expansion in the third quarter. The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated an earlier Senate tax plan would add 0.8 percent to G.D.P. over a decade. Trump’s estimate is unrealistic but a modest lift is expected. Still, the tax plan will not pay for itself, as the White House contends, and may add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. That trade-off may be this tax bill’s biggest legacy. "
57,"Good morning on this drafty Wednesday. Over the last few years, we’ve noticed a disheartening commoditization and mass production taking hold of a classic holiday tradition. We’re talking about ugly Christmas sweaters. Call us traditionalists, but a true ugly Christmas sweater should lack any irony when it is made. Ideally, the garment’s makers genuinely think their unsightly design is quite lovely. Once upon a time, before ugly Christmas sweaters were a joke, that was the case. “A lot of the most popular designs of the ugly Christmas sweater revolution were taken from thrift shops or an aunt or grandmother’s closet,” said Brian Miller, one of the authors of “Ugly Christmas Sweater Party Book: The Definitive Guide to Getting Your Ugly On.” “They weren’t really intended to be funny or mass produced,” Mr. Miller said. “They were just gaudy and stood out when you put them on, and other people thought, ‘That’s hilarious.’” According to his research, the first large, organized ugly Christmas sweater party was at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver in 2002. About a decade ago, the trend caught on more widely. Personally, Mr. Miller favors Nordic designs from the 1970s made with high-quality wool. The mark of a good sweater, he said, “is basically something you would have opened from your great-aunt as a 10-year-old and thrown a fit. Those are the ones I love now.” In the search for what makes a true ugly Christmas sweater, we called a few vintage shops around town. • More is more, said Joe Markus, the owner at Star Struck Vintage Clothing in Greenwich Village: “You want a designer who just kept putting stuff on it: more trees, more designs, more flowers, more stars.” When selecting a sweater, he said, use your eyes and your ears — bells are a nice touch. “It’s great when people can hear you walking, like a cow.” • “Anything that looks grandma-ish, like cardigans with big old buttons, are really popular,” said Ashley Perez, a manager at L Train Vintage, with locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan. If you can’t find anything truly unique, make it yourself. “Handmade sweaters or D.I.Y. projects where people add lights or ornaments” usually add just the right touch of ugly, she said. • There are a few categories, said Mick Collins, a manager at Metropolis Vintage in the East Village. “Cute” ugly Christmas sweaters tend to be black and have shiny decals, like ornaments, while the truly ugly sweaters tend to be red and have details that, over time, have begun to droop. At his shop, Mr. Collins keeps a selection of “contest winning” ugly sweaters, which typically have bells or Santa designs that were “massacred” when stitched together. There are also those sweaters that are neither cute nor revolting. “They’re mediocre,” he said. “Our racks are full of them at the end of the season, and those are the really sad ones, because they’re not wanted by anyone.” Here’s what else is happening: Pull on that sweater, ugly or otherwise. While today is mostly sunny, with a high near 43, blustery winds could make it feel below freezing this morning. Afternoon hot chocolate runs will feel less whipped.

58,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday that 8.8 million people had signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s federal marketplace, a surprisingly large number only slightly lower than the total in the last open enrollment period, which was twice as long and heavily advertised. The numbers essentially defied President Trump’s assertion that “Obamacare is imploding.” They suggested that consumers want and need the coverage and subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act, even though political battles over the law, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, are sure to continue in Congress and in next year’s midterm election campaigns. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, reported the total in a Twitter post on Thursday. She said her agency had done a great job to “make this the smoothest experience for consumers to date.” The number of people who signed up this year was 96 percent of the 9.2 million who selected health plans or were automatically re-enrolled through the federal marketplace in the last sign-up season. “It’s a very, very strong number,” said Joshua Peck, who was the chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov in the Obama administration. “It implies that the final week of open enrollment this year was very big.” "
59,"Eric Schmidt joined Google in 2001 to provide what amounted to adult supervision for the company’s young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He helped take Google public in 2004 and built it into a colossus. In 2011, after being appointed executive chairman, he became a prominent emissary for the company to Washington. Now, Mr. Schmidt is stepping down as executive chairman of the internet search giant’s parent, Alphabet, the company said on Thursday. He will relinquish his role at Alphabet’s next board meeting, in January. Mr. Schmidt, 62, will continue to be a member of the company’s board and become a technical adviser, Alphabet said, adding that it expects to appoint another chairman. No reason was provided for the change. In a statement, Mr. Schmidt said that he, Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, “believe that the time is right in Alphabet’s evolution for this transition.” The shift underlines how Mr. Schmidt’s influence at Alphabet has waned over time and how a new generation of leaders is firmly in charge at the giant company. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin remain at the top of Alphabet and retain voting control, but the executives they now have working for them have evolved. More of them are younger executives who rose through the ranks, such as Mr. Pichai, or are superstar executives hired from the outside, including Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer who was brought in from Morgan Stanley in 2015. Mr. Schmidt’s stepping back is expected to have little practical effect on the day-to-day operations of the behemoth operation. But it is one of the most significant personnel shifts at the internet giant since Mr. Page took over as chief executive in 2011, and especially because Mr. Schmidt has been such a willing public face of the company for so long. Internally at Google, the inclusion of Mr. Pichai in Mr. Schmidt’s statement on Thursday, alongside the names of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, was seen as a passing of the torch and the creation of a new power triumvirate. "
60,"DUBLIN — An Irish county council on Thursday gave a golf resort owned by President Trump approval to build two sea walls, a reduced version of an earlier plan but one that still generated opposition from environmentalists. Trump International Golf Links, which owns the resort at Doonbeg, County Clare, intends to build a line of two low, concealed sea walls, 2,000 feet long and 840 feet long, on the landward side of a public beach to prevent storm waters from eroding three holes of the course. A previous application for a continuous 1.7-mile-long structure was withdrawn last year. Thursday’s decision by the Clare County Council can be appealed to the national planning authority. The resort’s new plan was supported by some local residents, who said they hoped that Mr. Trump would follow up on plans to invest millions in the property. “We’ve been campaigning for 25 years to bring investment to our community,” said Rita McInerney, a local businesswoman. “There is a not a lot of opportunity for employment here. They already employ 250 people there in the summer, and there’ll be more if they feel they can expand it. We’ll continue to work with the owners, whoever they are.” Records show that Mr. Trump paid 8.7 million euros for the resort at an auction in 2014. It had originally opened in 2002, having cost €28 million to build. Environmentalists said the new coastal walls would damage a popular public beach and vulnerable dunes and heath. Some residents also objected, saying the walls would alter tidal flows and divert storm surges into their own properties. The leader of the Irish Green Party, Eamon Ryan, who objected to the application, said the party was disappointed in the decision and would consider filing an appeal. “The best advice we had was that it would be better to move the golf holes farther inland,” he said, “where there’s room for them, rather than disrupt the beach.” Mr. Ryan said that he did not believe Mr. Trump’s ownership had influenced the council members, but that “they wouldn’t be human beings if they weren’t sensitive to the fact that the golf course in question is owned by the president of the United States.” The earlier application had included references to climate change and the threat of global warming, which Mr. Trump had previously described as a hoax, in its case for building the wall. The new application did not mention global warming. The general manager of the resort, Joe Russell, said Trump Doonbeg was pleased with the decision and had ambitious plans to expand its facilities. "
61,"WASHINGTON — In a legal victory for the Trump administration, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit on Thursday that accused President Trump of violating the Constitution by continuing to own and profit from his business empire. The complaint, filed this year in the Southern District of New York, said that Mr. Trump’s failure to divorce himself from his businesses had harmed companies or workers who compete against his restaurants or hotels in New York or Washington. By taking advantage of his official position, the lawsuit said, Mr. Trump violated clauses of the Constitution that prohibit a president from accepting any government-bestowed benefits, or emoluments, either at home or abroad. Judge George B. Daniels of United States District Court in Manhattan found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had suffered as a result of specific actions by Mr. Trump intended to drum up business for his enterprises. Even before Mr. Trump took office, the judge said, “he had amassed wealth and fame and was competing against” the plaintiffs. “It is only natural that interest in his properties has generally increased since he became president,” the judge said. Moreover, Judge Daniels said, customers might be patronizing Mr. Trump’s hotels and his hotels’ restaurants because of price or quality — reasons totally unrelated to his presidency. Beyond that, the judge found, the emoluments clauses of the Constitution are intended to protect the country against presidential corruption from foreign influences or financial incentives that might be offered by either states or the federal government. They were not meant to protect businesses from competition from presidentially owned enterprises, he ruled. Were that the case, Judge Daniels said, the Constitution would not have given Congress the power to allow a president to receive a foreign gift or benefit without considering how the president’s business rivals might be affected.

62,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Congress approved a plan to keep the government funded into January — while kicking fights over issues like immigration and surveillance into the new year. And Republicans are gearing up for what are likely to be bruising midterm elections in November. Midterms are inevitably referendums on the party that controls the White House, and President Trump has the lowest approval rating of any modern president this early in his tenure. The tax bill has given Republicans a victory to talk about, but Democrats are up in polls and donations. _____ 2. In an act of defiance against the Trump administration, the U.N. General Assembly condemned the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Despite President Trump’s threat to cut aid to the resolution’s supporters, the largely symbolic measure was approved by a vote of 128 to 9. _____ 3. In Catalonia, separatist parties were poised to hold on to a narrow majority in elections for a regional parliament, according to nearly complete official results. Above, the vote count. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain called the elections hoping to reshuffle the political deck, calculating that Catalan voters would punish the secessionist leaders who had provoked the country’s worst constitutional crisis in decades. That gamble appeared not to have paid off. _____ 4. Decades after the Ford Motor Company tried to tackle sexual misconduct at two Chicago plants, new allegations of abuse raise questions about the possibility of change. On “The Daily,” we talk to our reporter Catrin Einhorn, who spent months interviewing women who had experienced sexual harassment in Ford factories. And we hear from one of the women she spoke to. _____ 5. Dozens of major U.S. employers — including Amazon and Goldman Sachs — placed recruitment ads on Facebook that were limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The Times found. The practice raises concerns about discrimination against older workers. “Once you reach your 50s, you may as well be dead,” said Mark Edelstein, above, a 58-year-old job hunter. _____ 6. Grisly news from Asia and Australia: A fire that appeared to have started in a parking garage consumed an eight-story building in Jecheon, South Korea, killing at least 29 people. Most of the dead were trapped in a public sauna on the second floor. And in Melbourne, Australia, 19 people were injured by a man who drove an S.U.V. into a crowd. The authorities are searching for a motive, and said the suspect had a history of mental illness and drug abuse. _____ 7. Could a metropolis of 30 million people end up underwater? Experts say it’s only a matter of time for Jakarta, Indonesia’s fast-sinking capital, which must contend with man-made troubles and mounting threats from climate change. This is the latest article in our series “Changing Climate, Changing Cities.” _____ 8. Would you like NASA to fly a drone across Saturn’s largest moon, or to send a probe to collect samples from a duck-shaped comet? From a dozen proposals to the agency’s New Frontiers competition — not unlike an interplanetary “Shark Tank” for a forthcoming robotic mission — NASA announced those two as finalists. Each team will get $4 million and about a year to flesh out its idea. NASA will decide in mid-2019 which one to build, and the launch is expected by the end of 2025. _____ 9. One more question: Is that cute Christmas toy a spy? Many manufacturers are promoting internet-connected gadgets for kids this holiday season. But once a device is online, it is potentially exposed to hackers who can gain access to sensitive information via microphones and cameras. “Parents need to be aware of what they are buying and bringing home to their children,” a cybersecurity researcher said. _____ 10. Finally, Samantha Bee discussed the evangelical Christians who pushed for the White House to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. She showed footage of one evangelical leader saying that the president had signaled end times. “Of course, Armageddon is the one thing that Trump happens to get done with absolute precision,” she joked.

65,"WASHINGTON — Justice Department officials have indicated they do not believe the department can regulate the sale of gun bump stocks without congressional action, underscoring concern that an ongoing administrative review into that question is little more than an effort to slow-roll a politically divisive issue. The Justice Department announced this month that it would review whether bump stocks — a firearm accessory that can turn a semiautomatic rifle into a full-fledged machine gun — are prohibited under a federal statute that outlaws fully-automatic weapons. The review was prompted by the October mass shooting in Las Vegas, where gunman Stephen Paddock outfitted semiautomatic weapons with bump stocks to kill 58 concertgoers on the strip. But private and public comments from Justice Department officials following the October shooting suggest there is little appetite within the agency to regulate bump stocks, regardless of pressure from the Trump administration. Critics worry that whatever energy there is will fade over the holiday season. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and co-author of a bill to ban the devices, noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has said “that current law does not allow the agency to ban or regulate bump-fire stocks.” The A.T.F. is the lead enforcement agency on the issue within the Justice Department. “The A.T.F. director recently said the same thing to local police chiefs,” Ms. Feinstein said. “There’s no need for another review. It’s hard to believe this is anything other than another way for Republicans to stall congressional action.” Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, said “the attorney general has stated clearly that we will go through the regulatory process that is required by law to determine whether or not certain bump stock devices are covered by the prohibition on the possession of firearm parts used exclusively in converting a weapon into a machine gun.” “We are committed to a deliberate and thorough review,” he added. The A.T.F. referred all questions regarding the bump stock review to the Justice Department. Those hoping to limit bump stocks are losing what little momentum they had in Congress. A once-narrow, bipartisan effort to limit the sale of the device has diffused into other gun control measures after another mass shooting, on Nov. 5, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, highlighted the gaps in the government’s background check system. Thomas Brandon, the acting director of the A.T.F., told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month that it was a “possibility” that bump stocks could be considered as a restricted device under standing regulations that ban machine guns, and that the A.T.F. could regulate them without action from Congress. “If that wasn’t a possibility at the end, we wouldn’t initiate this process,” Mr. Brandon said of the review. But since the Las Vegas shooting, Mr. Brandon and other A.T.F. officials have indicated repeatedly — both publicly and in private — that they do not believe that possibility exists. Instead, they say, legislation from Congress will be required. In the week following the shooting, Justice Department officials — including the head of the department’s Firearms and Ammunition Technology division — met behind closed doors with Senate Judiciary Committee staff to discuss bump stock devices. According to some who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it, the Justice Department officials said they would not be able to take devices off shelves without new legislation from Congress. Later in October, speaking to police chiefs at a law enforcement conference in Philadelphia, Mr. Brandon of the A.T.F. said his agency did not currently have the regulatory power to control sales of bump stocks. According to a letter sent to Congress by Art Acevedo, the Houston police chief, Mr. Brandon told the conference that new legislation would be required to allow them to regulate the device. “I was seated next to the A.T.F. director at a recent meeting of Major Cities Chiefs when he advised the chiefs that new legislation will be required,” Mr. Acevedo wrote. Despite the misgivings of its own officials, the Justice Department is still opting to work the bump stocks issue through the A.T.F. That route avoids the messier politics of seeking legislation in Congress, which could pit the administration against the powerful gun lobby. The National Rifle Association has said it believes the bump stock question should be handled through the A.T.F., prompting once-amenable Republican lawmakers to back off legislative fixes. The A.T.F. announced on Dec. 5 that it had sent a notice to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget about the policy review. Once posted in the federal registry, it will be open for comment from the public and gun industry for 30 days. It is expected to be posted next week. "
66,"Janet Benshoof, a lawyer who spent much of her career defending a woman’s right to an abortion, then expanded her work to champion causes for women around the world, including those raped in war zones, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 70. Her son David Benshoof Klein said the cause was uterine serous carcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of endometrial cancer. “For there to be justice, peace and security in the world, there has to be equality of women in fact,” Ms. Benshoof said at a Google talk in 2008. “If women are always out of the boardrooms and the decision makers and the military, then you do not have the sustainable justice, peace and security that is our ultimate aim.” Over 40 years, she pursued her advocacy at three organizations in New York City: as director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s reproductive freedom project and as the founder and president of the Center for Reproductive Rights and, most recently, the Global Justice Center. Ms. Benshoof (pronounced BEN-shawf) plotted the legal strategy for abortion and sex-education cases in state courts and the United States Supreme Court, and trained judges in Iraq to prosecute rape and sexual violence cases under international law. “No single person has done more to promote reproductive rights than Janet in the United States and globally,” Sylvia Law, a professor of law, medicine and psychiatry at New York University, said in a telephone interview. "
67,"The surprising thing about Frances A. Rosenfeld’s extremely tall map of New York City is that the lake in Central Park is not first or second or even third. It is merely No. 4. Dr. Rosenfeld’s white-on-light-chocolate map shows the chronology of ice skating in the city by location. It turns out that the lake in Central Park came late to a craze that had captivated early Dutch and English settlers, and so No. 1 on Dr. Rosenfeld’s map is the colonial-era canal that was covered over for what New Yorkers now call Broad Street. No. 2 was a pond in Lower Manhattan, and No. 3 was another pond, on what later became fashionable Fifth Avenue. But — oh! — No. 4, the see-and-be-seen magnet that fixed skating in the city’s consciousness. Dr. Rosenfeld, who has documented the pastime for a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, says that the Central Park lake pulled in the crowds when the still-unfinished park opened in December 1858, wintry temperatures having done what wintry temperatures will do to 18 acres of water. “It was a flash mob kind of thing for its day,” she said. “All of a sudden, there was this new, artificial landscape that people heard about — Central Park — and they went there to go skating, and more people heard about it and went there to go skating, and more. It was wildly popular, way more than boating in the summer.” And that was that — the real beginning of skating in New York City, according to “New York on Ice: Skating in the City,” the exhibition that will continue through April 15, a full two weeks after the Wollman Rink in Central Park is to close for the season. (From Tuesday through Dec. 31, the first 100 visitors each day can have free hot chocolate at Chalsty’s Cafe, run by Amy’s Bread on the second floor of the museum.) Dr. Rosenfeld, who learned to skate as a child growing up on the Upper West Side and says she still skates confidently — “It’s not like I’m doing axels” — calls the exhibition “my passion project.” It is an homage to what she describes as “a seemingly innocuous topic that turns out to have great depth.” Skating figured in the culture and night life of the city, and even in the ascension of Midtown Manhattan as an entertainment district before World War I. Skating was once so popular that there were rinks on the roofs of hotels and rinks in the shadows of Gilded Age mansions — the Rockefellers skated on their own very private ice, next to their mansion on West 54th Street, long before they turned a sunken plaza in Rockefeller Center into a very public rink. Strolling through the exhibit, you almost expect to hear “Les Patineurs,” the timeworn “Skaters’ Waltz” — composed in the 1880s by Émile Waldteufel — even though it was inspired by the frozen Seine and a rink in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. Dr. Rosenfeld is fond of a closer-to-home waltz, “Skating in Central Park,” which the Modern Jazz Quartet performed at the Wollman Rink in 1973. She created her map from a spreadsheet on which she recorded any reference to a skating rink or pond or “skating site” that she came across in a year of research and preparation for the exhibit. “I found references to 116 rinks,” she said. “But ‘rinks’ is a loose term. It doesn’t mean indoors, it means a site for skating.” Eighteen of the entries have opened since 2004. Every curator makes choices about what to show in an exhibition. Dr. Rosenfeld considered giving pride of place to a famous photograph of skaters on the lake with the Dakota apartment house in the background, still so new it was the only building that far uptown. But she decided on something else. “I thought people who know about New York would know about that photo,” she said, explaining why she enlarged a lithograph of the Empire City Rink, which opened in the 1860s in the East 60s. It was roughly the size of a modern professional football field — and it was among the first indoor skating palaces. With refrigeration came more such places — there were three “Icelands” in Midtown Manhattan alone — and more ice that had to be cleaned. The first Zamboni-like cleaner was “one horse and a guy,” Dr. Rosenfeld said. “I’m not sure what they called the tool, but it planed the ice.” The contraption did its work at No. 36 on Dr. Rosenfeld’s map, the St. Nicholas Arena, on West 66th Street at Columbus Avenue. It had famous backers, including John Jacob Astor and Cornelius Vanderbilt, both amateur hockey players who wanted to face off indoors. But it is more notable as one of the first rinks in the city to make its own ice. That was something that had been tried in London at least as far back as the 1840s, when an inventor mixed salts, sulfate of copper and “hog’s lard, to render it more slippery” and patented a “substitute for ice for skating and sliding purposes.” For financial purposes, the rink that used it, the Glaciarium and Frozen Lake, was a flop. Another London rink, also called the Glaciarium, tried again in the 1870s, using pipes filled with coolant to chill the skating surface. The St. Nicholas rink depended on a similar system, tubes gurgling with coolant that lay on a concrete bed. Skating in the city surged and waned in distinct waves over the decades. The St. Nicholas rink’s heyday was from the mid-1890s to the mid-1920s, when it became a boxing arena. Later on, Floyd Patterson made his professional debut there and Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) fought there. It also earned a footnote in rock ’n’ roll history: In the mid-1950s, the disc jockey Alan Freed presided over the first “Rock ’n’ Roll Ball” in New York there. The ABC television network bought the arena in the 1960s and used it as a studio for 20 years before demolishing it to make way for offices and newer studios. Dr. Rosenfeld chronicled “the first Sonja Henie,” a skater named Charlotte Oelschlägel, who appeared at the New York Hippodrome — on Sixth Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets — in a revue called “Hip-Hip-Hooray!” in 1915. “Five thousand seats, sold out every night,” Dr. Rosenfeld said. And she has an unexpected nickname for Robert Moses, who ravaged neighborhoods as the “master builder,” or master “Power Broker,” in the words of Robert A. Caro, his biographer. She called Moses “the secret Santa” of skating rinks, because as parks commissioner, he built several, including the Wollman Rink in 1949 and the Kate Wollman Memorial Rink, in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, in 1961. She said that he was also involved in planning the Lasker Rink, which opened in 1966. Also in the exhibit is a photograph from 1986, of a real-estate developer who had recently turned 40 cutting the ribbon at the refurbished Wollman Rink. It was Donald J. Trump, who tackled the project after the city had spent six years and $12 million without getting the job done. As he declared at the time, in news conference after news conference, he spent $3 million and finished more than two months ahead of schedule. Inevitably, though — given her emphasis on the lake in Central Park — a conversation with Dr. Rosenfeld circles back to No. 4 on her map, the site where skating in its earliest days amounted to “civic dancing.” (Skating was banned there in the 1950s.) “A rink is like a big dance floor,” she said, “but you didn’t have to be paired with anyone and you didn’t have to touch anyone. You could show off in the middle, so it was a communal activity, but you could do your own thing. It seems really New York, even then.” "
68,"WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on 52 people and entities Thursday for alleged human rights violations and corruption, a list that included Maung Maung Soe, a top Burmese general cited for an ongoing deadly crackdown on the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group. Maj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe was the chief of the Burmese Army’s Western Command during a crackdown that survivors say involved government soldiers stabbing babies, cutting off the heads of boys, gang-raping girls and burning entire families to death. More than 620,000 refugees have flooded into neighboring Bangladesh since August, fleeing what Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson described as “ethnic cleansing.” Maj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe is the first high-level Burmese military official to named in sanctions, an action that the Treasury Department said grew out of credible evidence of his involvement in the crackdown. “Today, the United States is taking a strong stand against human rights abuse and corruption globally by shutting these bad actors out of the U.S. financial system,” said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, adding that the sanctions send “a message that there is a steep price to pay for their misdeeds.” Among others penalized on Thursday was Yahya Jammeh, former president of Gambia who came to power in 1994 and stepped down in 2017. Mr. Jammeh created a terror and assassination squad called the Junglers that he used to intimidate, interrogate and kill people who threatened him, according to the Treasury designation. Benjamin Bol Mel of South Sudan, Dan Gertler, who did business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mukhtar Hamid Shah of Pakistan were also on the list. The designations are the first to result from the passage last year of the Global Magnitsky Act, a bipartisan bill intended to punish people around the world who are credibly accused of serious violations of human rights and of corruption. The law was a follow-on to a similarly named law passed in 2012 designed to punish such people only in Russia. On Wednesday, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on five Russians in designations from that earlier law. Among those targeted on Wednesday was the leader of the Republic of Chechnya. The sanctions freeze any assets the individuals or entities hold in the United States and also prevent them from using any American financial institution for banking or other purposes. Since the United States financial system has such broad global reach, the sanctions make it difficult for the individuals to use major banks anywhere in the world. The laws were named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention after exposing a $230 million tax-theft scam plotted by Russian officials. Human rights advocates cheered Thursday’s designations. “The fact that these listings were made today reflects the reality that despite many disagreements in Washington about the U.S. government’s role in promoting human rights, there is a bipartisan consensus the U.S. government can and should act to hold human rights abusers to account,” said John Sifton, the Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. The sanctions against Maj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe are among the first concrete actions by the United States against a top Burmese official for the continuing murderous campaign against the Rohingya. Administration officials have been nervous about punishing Myanmar’s government because they worry that broader sanctions could jeopardize the country’s fragile transition to democracy after decades of repressive military rule. The crackdown on the Rohingya is thought to be broadly popular in Myanmar, which is majority Buddhist. The Trump administration has cut back on refugee resettlements, arguing that preserving refugees in their home countries is better and more efficient. Whether the Rohingya will ever be able to return to Myanmar is far from certain. Trump administration officials would not say whether more Burmese leaders would be added to the sanctions list. Mr. Sifton said the State Department may be keeping some names in reserve in hopes of persuading Burmese officials to stop the brutal campaign. Senator John McCain, Republican from Arizona, and Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat from Maryland, who co-authored the Global Magnitsky Act, released a joint statement welcoming Thursday’s designations. “We look forward to continuing to work with the administration and the human rights community to end a global culture of impunity and ensure robust and comprehensive implementation of this landmark law,” the statement said. "
69,"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Eric Schmidt is stepping down as executive chairman of Alphabet. • Goldman continues to embrace Bitcoin. • Boeing is circling Brazil’s Embraer. • Apple is big, but just how big? Want this in your own email inbox every morning? Here’s the sign-up. In Eric Schmidt’s decade running Google, the company went from internet upstart to a tech giant. And as it did, Mr. Schmidt’s profile had grown and broadened. He gave speeches about the economy and cultivated government relationships. But Google’s size and search dominance also raised concerns among lawmakers and regulators in both the United States and abroad. So when Mr. Schmidt stepped aside as chief executive in 2011 and became executive chairman, one of his primary focuses was on government outreach. In the years since, he has hopscotched the world, developed close ties to lawmakers and served on White House advisory panels for the Obama administration. Perhaps Google’s biggest victory during this time was its defeat of the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust probe. Officials for the agency had recommended in 2012 that the commission sue to challenge some of Google’s business practices, in what would have been the biggest antitrust case since the government sued Microsoft. "
70,"About one in five inmates in federal prison are foreign-born, and more than 90 percent of those are in the United States illegally, according to a report released on Thursday by the Trump administration, which has sought to highlight the dangers it says unauthorized immigrants pose to public safety. Officials at the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security quickly framed the statistics as evidence that the country needed stricter anti-immigration measures, particularly the wall President Trump has pushed to erect across the southern border. The report arrives as the White House and Republicans in Congress insist that any legislative deal to restore legal protections for young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children must include more restrictions on legal and illegal immigration. “At the border and in communities across America, our citizens are being victimized by illegal aliens who commit crimes,” the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said in a statement on Thursday, calling on Congress to pass Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda. “The simple fact is that any offense committed by a criminal alien is ultimately preventable.” Administration officials have repeatedly emphasized what it says are links between unauthorized immigrants and crime, even opening an office to advocate for the victims of crimes committed by immigrants. But a large body of research has suggested that immigrants are no more likely, and often less likely, to commit serious crimes than native-born Americans. The proportion of unauthorized immigrants in federal prison may be explained partly by the fact that immigration offenses now account for about half of all federal prosecutions, including those for smuggling people into the United States, illegally entering the country and illegally re-entering the country after being deported. “The report proves one thing only: The administration will take any opportunity possible to twist facts to demonize immigrants,” said Tom Jawetz, the vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. “The vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with — illegal entry and illegal entry after removal. When you cook the books you shouldn’t pretend to be surprised by the results.” The report, which offers a statistical sketch of people in federal custody at the end of the 2017 fiscal year, is the third released by the government since Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January directing officials to collect data on the immigration status of federal inmates. It said that 24,476 of the 185,507 inmates in the federal Bureau of Prisons system were not citizens, with 92 percent of those in the country unlawfully, and that 97 percent of the 13,081 confirmed noncitizens held by the Marshals Service — typically people awaiting trial — were in the country unlawfully. Officials were still investigating the immigration status of 21,209 other foreign-born people in federal custody. The report did not specify which types of crimes the foreign-born inmates were convicted of, but senior administration officials said future reports would include such information. In the meantime, they pointed reporters to data from the United States Sentencing Commission, which they said indicated that noncitizens were convicted of offenses related to immigration, money laundering and drugs at a disproportionate rate along the southern border. Drug-related prosecutions tend to cluster there because of trafficking activity involving the Mexican cartels. But scanning the records of immigrants in federal custody can yield only limited information at best. State and local prisons and jails hold approximately 90 percent of the country’s total incarcerated population, according to the Justice Department, and the vast majority of violent crimes such as murders, assaults and rapes are prosecuted at the local, not federal, level. Mr. Trump’s executive order also directed his administration to gather data on immigration status from state and local facilities. Federal officials have not yet formally requested such statistics, senior administration officials said on Thursday, but obtaining the numbers is likely to be complicated. Local officials in liberal-leaning areas known as sanctuary cities have already resisted helping federal agents arrest unauthorized immigrants or otherwise cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.

71,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It could hardly come as a surprise to anyone who travels around the state: the number of people who are homeless in California continues to rise at a steady clip. Every year, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development releases a Point in Time count of the homeless population. This year that number reached nearly 554,000 — a 1 percent increase from last year, driven by the dramatic surge in West Coast cities. More than one-quarter of the total homeless population nationwide lives in California, roughly 114,000. The vast majority are “unsheltered” — a more bureaucratic term to describe the thousands living on the streets, under freeways and tucked into grassy fields and parks in cities all around the state. “It’s certainly a bigger increase than we would have expected,” said Ben Metcalf, the director of the state’s Department of Housing and Community Development. “There’s a tale of different countries here: We’re seeing a real significant increase and much of the rest of the country is not. We’re all doing the same things, but here the rent is too damn high. We’ve seen an incredible increase in the cost of housing.” About 1.6 million households are considered to be living in “worse scenarios,” Mr. Metcalf said, living with low-wages and spending more than half of their income on housing. That number has ballooned continuously through much of the last decade, while wages have remained flat. There is grim evidence at county morgues, too — because of a significant hepatitis A outbreak and because the homeless population is aging, several cities have seen a dramatic rise in the number of people who die homeless. In Santa Clara County, the number of homeless deaths have more than doubled since 2011, with 132 people dying on the street last year. "
72,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. At the White House yesterday, Republicans celebrated their passage of a big tax cut. Somehow, though, they still haven’t found the time or the money to protect health insurance for millions of low-income children. In September, Congress allowed funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (known as CHIP) to expire. By the end of next month, 25 states are likely to run out of their remaining CHIP money, according to a new report by Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. That could put health coverage for 1.9 million children at risk. Eventually, if CHIP isn’t extended, almost nine million children — or about one out of every eight children in America — could lose coverage. CHIP isn’t supposed to be controversial. It enjoys bipartisan support, at least rhetorically. Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who helped create the program in the 1990s, said yesterday that Congress should remain in session until its funding is restored. But the program has become a casualty of congressional leaders’ failure to agree on a plan to fund the federal government, largely because of an insistence on budget cuts from conservative Republican members. Congress seems likely to push an overall funding bill into January, creating uncertainty and anxiety for many families. Congress’s decision to put tax cuts ahead of health care, writes The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell, “has left millions of children, including some in the middle of lifesaving care such as cancer treatment, in limbo.” She adds: “When so many dire priorities abound, it’s hard to fathom how tax cuts got to the front of the queue.” As The Times’s Robert Pear reported this week, CHIP has become a bargaining chip, a noncontroversial measure that Republicans can use to force Democrats to vote for other provisions they might otherwise oppose. ”In the meantime,” writes Vox’s Dylan Scott, “we are 11 days away from a state like Alabama freezing enrollment and Congress’s inaction having a real effect on some number of American children’s ability to access health care.” As V. Ram Krishnamoorthi and Philip Verhoef, both doctors at the University of Chicago, put it in Crain’s Chicago Business: “Our fear is that, if legislators continue to politicize CHIP funding, they will destabilize the entire program. Without a stable foundation of federal money, states are unable to budget for, much less cover, the current needs of their most vulnerable people.” Congressional leaders keep talking as if they regret the uncertainty over CHIP. But they’re the only ones who can end it. They should cut back on the platitudes and make sure children get to keep their health insurance. Trump-friendly media on tax cuts. Breitbart covered the passage of the G.O.P. tax plan in glowing terms. It played up members’ praise for the president’s leadership as well as early reports that some companies plan to offer employee bonuses because of the bill. But the coverage also included some obvious spin. In a Wednesday post, Breitbart’s John Carney tried to explain the bill’s consistent unpopularity in public-opinion polls. He blamed Americans’ negative perception of the bill partly on “journalists and politically motivated opponents of tax cuts who have spread falsehoods about the tax bill.” He also tried to discredit the Tax Policy Center, which did several objective analyses of the bill that were consistent with other independent analysis of the bill. “Americans are not really opposed to the Republican tax bill,” Carney wrote. “They are opposed to an imaginary bill that hikes taxes on many people and lowers taxes for a very small segment of American households. That is just about the photographic negative of the actual tax bill.” Carney is correct that most households initially receive a tax cut from the bill. But he’s also engaging in the common diversionary tactics of the bill’s supporters. They wave away the temporary nature of the middle-class tax cuts, essentially arguing that people should ignore Congress’s decision to let those cuts disappear in the bill’s final years. And the bill’s supporters pretend that its deficit increases bill won’t eventually lead to budget cuts that hurt the middle class, as Bryce Covert explains in The Times. The American public gets it. People saw the rushed, secretive way that Congress passed the bill. They understand that this bill is a bad deal for most families. "
73,"So it actually happened. Just last month, it was not certain that the Senate would go along with the House of Representatives’ proposal to let families use 529 college savings plans to pay for private school from elementary school onward. In a bill that offered many perks for the wealthy, the 529 provision was a particularly brazen giveaway. After all, it’s mostly wealthier people who can save enough to reap large benefits from the provision, which allows $10,000 in annual tax-free 529 account withdrawals for pre-college students starting in 2018. But it really did happen, and on Friday, President Trump signed the bill that makes it the law of the land. The short-term opportunities for affluent families are potentially worth five figures. The schools, however, will now confront a major financial aid question that the new bill forces on them. And states could make offsetting tax changes that cost 529 savers money. Any eventual populist blowback could threaten the plans, too. But let’s start with the good news, for those who have the money and the inclination. With 529 plans, you put money in, let it grow for years in mutual funds and then pull it out to use for higher education expenses. When you do, you don’t pay capital gains taxes on what you’ve earned over time. Other 529 tax breaks exist, too. It is states, not the federal government, that actually administer the plans, and 35 of them offer some sort of tax deduction or credit when you deposit money. If you want to know how things work in your state, Savingforcollege.com is an excellent resource. "
74,"COLUMBIA, Md. — The word “equality” carries special meaning in this planned community, nestled in the corridor between Baltimore and Washington. Subsidized apartment complexes and tidy townhouses coexist with single-family colonials and split- levels, and racial, socio-economic and religious diversity is embedded in the fabric. Columbia’s founding father created the town in 1967 with hopes that all types of workers could afford to live there, “from the company janitor to the company president.” It is through this lens that residents here are viewing the tax plan that Congress finalized this week. Even as people here try to assess how the new code will affect them individually, many are expressing greater concerns about the “knock-on” or secondary effects of the plan, which down the line could reduce or eliminate spending in some areas to pay for tax breaks for businesses and the wealthiest Americans. In Columbia, that could mean cuts to the well-regarded public schools and aid programs for the most vulnerable residents, changes that would further chip away at the egalitarian pillars on which the town was built. “It is definitely going to have some implications for us as a family, and yet we are solidly middle class,” said Maureen Harris as she sat with her husband, Bill, in the dining room of the house they share with their two teenage daughters. “I am not worried that we won’t be able to pay our mortgage or anything like that,” said Ms. Harris, who serves as the executive director of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Columbia. “But to me, it’s just immoral. We are on this trajectory of every person for themselves. And the bill leaves a whole heck of a lot of people behind.” "
75,"WASHINGTON — The sweeping tax overhaul approved by Congress this week hands Republicans a long-sought achievement they believe will bolster their defenses in next year’s midterm campaign, but party officials concede the measure may only mitigate their losses in what is shaping up to be a punishing election year. While the tax legislation is broadly unpopular as it reaches President Trump’s desk, the bill offers Republicans the sort of signature accomplishment they have been lacking to galvanize their demoralized donors and many of their voters. Republican lawmakers, who spent much of this year forced to explain or defend Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior, now have an opportunity to go on the offensive with an issue that unites their increasingly fractious party. And they hope that up-for-grabs voters will reward them should the economy keep growing while their tax bills are falling. “Once the withholding tables change in January, voters will realize their paychecks are bigger as a result of tax reform,” said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who runs the House Republican campaign arm. But, alluding to past midterm defeats for the party in power at the White House, he acknowledged that “history is against us.” To reinforce the party’s message, the primary House Republican “super PAC,” the Congressional Leadership Fund, is planning a $10 million advertising and grass-roots campaign beginning next month in some of their most competitive districts to highlight the rate reductions, higher standard deduction and child tax credits in the bill. Corporations such as AT&T and Wells Fargo delivered Republicans an immediate gift by announcing they would reward employees financially because of the tax cut. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said in an interview that Senate Republicans next year would batter the many Democrats who are on the ballot in states won by Mr. Trump, such places as North Dakota, West Virginia and Indiana, for opposing the bill. Yet with voters indicating by wide margins they prefer Democrats to control Congress and bestowing Mr. Trump with historically low approval ratings, the tax plan is hardly a panacea for Republican lawmakers on the ballot in 2018. At best, it is the political equivalent of tacking up plywood against exterior windows to lessen the inevitable damage of an impending storm. Officials in both parties believe Democratic gains in the House, where Republicans enjoy a 24-seat majority, could reach as high as 40 seats if the political environment does not improve for the Republicans. And, as of now, it only appears to be worsening. A CNN poll released on Wednesday found that 56 percent of registered voters said they would vote Democratic next November, compared to 38 percent who favored the Republicans, a yawning 18-percentage-point gap that was only slightly bigger than other recent polls. Through that lens, impressions of the new tax law could be warped by partisan feelings. This advantage is showing up in fund-raising, where Democrats are harvesting small-dollar contributions. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced on Wednesday that it raised $6.9 million in November, outraising its Republican counterpart for the seventh month in a row. In November, the National Republican Congressional Committee raised only $3.8 million. House Republicans, however, still have more money on hand and the Republican National Committee has far more cash than the Democratic National Committee. In the Senate, the Democratic campaign arm has slightly more money in the bank than the Republicans. Beyond the raw numbers, Democratic enthusiasm is soaring. And the sort of centrist voters that both parties covet are contemptuous of Mr. Trump because of his behavior and character, elements that are highly unlikely to change by next fall no matter what policies emerge from Washington. “The downside of doing nothing was much higher,” former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican who previously led the party’s House campaign efforts, said of the tax bill. “But the major problem for Republicans is not that they haven’t delivered — it’s the way he conducts himself.” “Republicans have a big storm coming at them,” he added. “We just don’t know if it’s a bad wind storm or a Category Five hurricane.” Mr. Trump has the lowest approval rating of any modern president this soon into his tenure, and midterm elections are inevitably referendums on the party that controls the White House. He is especially unpopular among women, who in this year’s statewide and special elections have overwhelmingly supported Democrats. According to a new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, 62 percent of female voters disapproved of Mr. Trump. So Democrats, some of them still bearing wounds from President Barack Obama’s midterm losses, believe the tax measure will ultimately be of little consequence compared to the man who occupies the Oval Office. “You can’t run from the top of your ticket,” said Representative Rick Larsen of Washington, who got a scare in the Affordable Care Act-fueled backlash of 2010. “That’s been proven to me over and over again. And the driver won’t be the tax cut vote. It’ll be the unpopularity of the president.” There is also scant evidence large-scale tax bills offer much in the way of a political lift. Republicans suffered losses in 1982, a year after President Reagan’s first tax bill, and in 1986, just a few months after Congress passed the last tax overhaul. The 2002 gains by Republicans were more the result of a rallying around the commander-in-chief in the months after the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, than the tax cuts that the party passed a year earlier. Mr. Obama’s economic stimulus plan of 2009 included tax cuts that went straight into paychecks — and were hardly noticed ahead of the Republican Tea Party tidal wave in 2010. Complicating matters for Republicans, some of their House seats that are most in jeopardy are in high-income and high-tax states where many voters will feel little benefit from a bill that limits mortgage interest deductions and state and local tax write-offs. Eleven of the 12 House Republicans who opposed the bill hail from California, New York and New Jersey, most of them from affluent districts that are already uneasy with Mr. Trump. “I think each individual congressman will be judged on how they voted,” said Representative Dan Donovan, the only Republican who represents New York City, who opposed the measure because of the limitations on local tax deductions. “The voters will know how hard we fought.” Yet as the fallout from the Affordable Care Act demonstrated in 2010, when half of the 34 House Democrats who opposed the measure still lost their re-election, opposing a controversial bill is not enough to inoculate lawmakers in wave election years. “The wave starts in those districts whether they voted for or against the tax bill,” said former Democratic Representative Steve Israel of New York, calling this moment “political déjà vu.” Notably, the House Republicans who opposed the bill also will not be the beneficiaries of the Super PAC’s spending. “We’re going to focus on those who kept their promise to their constituents,” said Corry Bliss, who runs the group. Veteran Republicans are sober about how daunting 2018 is shaping up to be, and hope that a clash on taxes at the very least offers the prospect of shifting the political debate onto more favorable terrain. “If you’re a Republican and you think about what’s coming, and the range of things you could be fighting about, to have a fight about this tax bill is among the better things they can fight over in 2018,” said Bill McInturff, a G.O.P. pollster, conceding that Republicans are facing “very tough numbers.” Mr. McInturff, who recently conducted a survey showing Republicans trailing Democrats by 12 points on the so-called generic ballot, said his party could not change the minds of those with fixed views about Mr. Trump, but that the tax bill offered an argument for those willing to hear them out. “You better have something to say that the 60 percent is willing to listen to,” he said, noting polls that show 40 percent of voters want to impeach Mr. Trump. Mr. Stivers acknowledged the partisan preferences of voters at the moment were tilting away from Republicans. “Right now there are people that don’t like the president, and they’re expressing it in that way,” he said of the generic ballot. But he suggested that voters uneasy with the president are still willing to support Republican congressional candidates, pointing to the Atlanta-area special House election the party won earlier this year despite a massive influx of money for the Democrats. And he said he had urged his members to make taxes central. “Everybody needs to be talking about the tax bill, what it means for their communities,” said Mr. Stivers. Democrats, though, said no piece of legislation could address the depth of the Republican challenge. “It is unfixable,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “And by November, tax reform could be a nonissue because what’s driving people to come out to vote is they don’t like the way the country is being run and the comportment of the president.” "
76,"WASHINGTON — Congress gave final approval on Thursday to legislation to keep the government funded into January, averting a government shutdown this weekend but kicking fights over issues like immigration, surveillance and health care into the new year. The stopgap spending bill extends government funding until Jan. 19 while also providing a short-term funding fix for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, whose financing lapsed at the end of September. After the House and Senate succeeded in passing a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul this week, the stopgap bill includes language to prevent automatic spending cuts that would be required to offset the tax bill’s effect on the deficit. The House passed the bill 231 to 188, with most Republicans voting for it and most Democrats opposing it. The Senate later gave its approval, as well, in a 66-to-32 vote. The extension of government funding saves Republicans from what would have been a colossal embarrassment just after they celebrated passage of the biggest tax rewrite in decades. But the lack of a resolution to several pressing issues leaves lawmakers facing a tough task when they return after the holidays, with the possibility of a high-stakes showdown when the next government funding deadline approaches. “I guess we better recharge our batteries,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. “It seems like Groundhog Day. We get up and do the same thing over and over and over again. It’s maddening.” "
77,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage on the story of race and Appalachia. The restaurateur and author Eddie Huang on racial stereotypes and diversity in Hollywood. Leon and Rosina Watson on marrying across the color line in 1950 — when it was still illegal in much of the country. Over the past year, we have hosted weekly live conversations about race and ethnicity on Facebook, tackling topics that ranged from black royalty to Latino baseball players to Asian-American slurs. RaceNYT, as we call the segment, is an extension of the crucial coverage on race — in America and beyond — that appears in The New York Times. We see it as a chance not only to explore important stories of race and what they mean to society, but also to give you, our readers and viewers, a chance to join the conversation. These subjects are not always easy to talk about. Why, for instance, is affordable housing built mostly in poor, heavily minority areas? What are the terms about race that make us uncomfortable? And what do the United States and major institutions like universities owe the descendants of the enslaved people they profited from? We explored these issues and more with a wide range of guests, including political strategists, filmmakers, academics and Times viewers. Here are five takeaways from the show: Our viewers tuned in from Australia, Canada, Brazil, Trinidad and beyond, voicing their views and concerns about race and ethnicity in the United States and overseas. Like racial minorities in the United States, Indigenous Australians are often relegated to the fringe of society, Craig Quartermaine, an Aboriginal television reporter and comedian, told us. “We’re window dressing,” he said. In another segment, Nakkiah Lui, an Indigenous writer and actor, told us, “The equality of human rights is something in which aboriginal people are still fighting for in many different ways in Australia.” Frida Charriere, one of our viewers, joined the conversation with Mr. Quartermaine from Canada. She said she could relate: “I am First Nation and understand the comparisons with Aboriginal people worldwide. We were taken from our homes and put into schools.” Madeline Vann reached out to us, wondering how she should handle the racially offensive remarks she was hearing in her community. She is a white freelance writer in Virginia. “What I need is an elevator speech to address this,” she said. “Does anyone have an idea of how to counter this?” We invited her to join us on Facebook Live, and scores of viewers shared advice and experiences. Ronald Wohlman said: “You must be direct. Honest. Straightforward.” Tara Leann Cantrell said it wasn’t that easy, especially when the racist comment comes from a client: “Speaking up firmly means potential loss of not only their business, but my business as a whole since it’s a tight knit retirement community.” Kaicheng Liang, who confronted a colleague who was mocking Asian names, said: “I had an >1 hour conversation with the offender, who was genuinely contrite, but it left me emotionally exhausted.” Carol Cutshall urged viewers to keep talking: “Keep the conversation open and ongoing.” The first year of the Trump presidency has been marked by a vast racial chasm where perspectives often exist in different worlds. Are Confederate monuments symbols of hate or a preservation of history? What is a black Republican to do in 2017? Americans feel increasingly divided. The Muslim-American activists Aber Kawas and Dalia Mogahed told us how they felt last month when the authorities quickly described an attack by a Muslim man in Manhattan as terrorism, while that term was never officially applied to a white man who fatally shot more than 50 people in Las Vegas weeks earlier. “Pretty much we define terror attacks as something that’s done by a Muslim,” Ms. Kawas said. Michael Quess Moore, who is black, and Richard Marksbury, who is white, sparred over the removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans. “I don’t care if it’s Andrew Jackson or George Washington or Martin Luther King — nothing should come down,” Mr. Marksbury said. “If we have issues in contemporary society, that’s the goal of educators and education, which is to explain who these people are, what they did, why we don’t agree with it, etc.” And Joseph Pinion and Ernest Lyles, two black Republicans, discussed how difficult it was to engage fellow black people on the issues when many of them view President Trump as racist. Whether we’re talking about seaside resorts or Native American citizenship, history almost always finds its way into our conversations. Stanley Nelson, the documentary filmmaker, talked about black vacation spots like Oak Bluffs in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., and their roots in segregation. Chuck Hoskin Jr., secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation, described how 19th-century slave ownership among the Cherokee affected the long-running legal battle over membership in the tribe. After the violence in Charlottesville, Isabel Wilkerson, the author and journalist, and Joshua D. Rothman, a historian, talked about how white supremacy flourished openly in middle-class communities in the 20th century. But as we’ve seen in the debates over Confederate monuments, coming to consensus on our history — and its impact on our lives today — can be challenging. These issues aren’t theoretical for us. As black journalists, we face them in our day-to-day lives. John told viewers how he and his wife were treated recently in a Mexican restaurant. Rachel described her reaction whenever she is described as “articulate” or praised for her use of the English language. (How often are white journalists praised for that?) Our colleague, Nathalie Nieves, who is Hispanic, shared her feelings about the day when a white co-worker asked whether she was undocumented. (She isn’t.) We are living with these issues and, like so many of you, we’re trying to make sense of them. Our experiences have convinced us: Dialogue matters. If we want to understand one another, we need to talk to one another, and to listen. "

President Trump’s controversial recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel brought to mind a similarly momentous announcement more than a century ago. In December of 1911, King George V of Britain, left, announced that India’s capital would be moved from the city then known as Calcutta to Delhi. For 24 hours, The Times reported, the British news media “was so astonished as to be unable to comment.” The British officials then ruling in India had proposed the move partly because Delhi was more centrally located, and partly because of growing opposition in Calcutta to the Crown’s rule, or Raj. Countries change their capitals to signal a fresh start or to move government away from economic hubs — with varying success. Myanmar, for example, built a new capital that replaced Yangon in 2005. But the city, Naypyidaw, is eerily quiet, and most embassies have stayed put. Similarly, Dodoma has been Tanzania’s seat of Parliament since 1996, but the rest of the government has been slow to move there from Dar es Salaam. Other countries whose capital relocations can trip up even the biggest geography buffs include Brazil (Brasília, not Rio de Janeiro, since 1960), Kazakhstan (Astana, not Almaty, since 1997), Nigeria (Abuja, not Lagos, since 1991) and Turkey (Ankara, not Istanbul, since 1923).

80,"To the Editor: Re “Deceit and Confusion in Talk on Law and Order” (Fact Check, Dec. 16): Addressing elite F.B.I. National Academy graduates last week, President Trump utterly mischaracterized the diversity immigration visa program and described people who use it to immigrate legally to our country as “the worst of the worst.” As experts on hateful speech, we know that such words matter. Tarring whole groups of people as terrible and threatening is dangerous rhetoric that is all too familiar from societies where it has been a precursor to violence. In addition, the president is now attacking legal immigrants with the sort of vitriol he previously aimed at the undocumented. He is training Americans to fear and despise other people simply because they are “them” and not “us.” Language that can inspire violent hatred is all the more disturbing in a speech to local law enforcement officers who serve across the country. We must call it out for what it is. SUSAN BENESCH

81,"At least for the moment, it seems that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, may keep his job. President Trump declared this week that he does not currently intend to fire him — a concession, perhaps, to the overwhelming public opposition to such a move. But that doesn’t mean Mr. Mueller’s investigation is free from peril. The inquiry remains in great danger, facing four looming threats from Mr. Trump and his allies. Curbing Mr. Mueller: Almost as bad as firing him, Mr. Trump could install someone at the Department of Justice to oversee Mr. Mueller’s investigation, a minder who could control (and cut) Mr. Mueller’s budget, eliminate some of his team or curtail the scope of his investigation. Mr. Mueller seems safe as long as his current supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, is in place; Mr. Rosenstein just vouched for the special counsel before Congress. But the president has reportedly grumbled about Mr. Rosenstein and could replace him with a crony who would be more willing to interfere. The president might also try to force out Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself over a conflict of interest, and replace him with an anti-Mueller hand, who presumably would not have such an obvious conflict. Mr. Trump would be within his powers to make such a move, but the public can push back by calling for Congress to pass pending legislation to protect Mr. Mueller’s job. Congress should maintain its recent practice of taking short, pro forma adjournments rather than taking a full recess, because the latter would allow the president to fire Justice Department personnel and replace them with recess appointments. Issuing pardons: The president may also try to pardon away the special counsel’s investigation. Mr. Trump could grant pardons to individuals who have already pleaded guilty, such as Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. this month. Or Mr. Trump might do so prospectively, to those who may be targets, such as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, or his son Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Trump might even issue one to himself (he reportedly asked about it), whether individually or as part of a blanket pardon of all those involved in the Russia investigation. Here, too, voices must be raised now, and loudly, with Senator Mark Warner’s strong comments this week in defense of Mr. Mueller as an outstanding first step. Congress has a particularly important role to play, making clear that such pardons would be a red line that would lead to abuse-of-power hearings in the House Judiciary Committee and possibly impeachment.

83,"It’s that time of year again. Some of us will get nice gifts, while others will get lumps of coal. But the rules have changed a bit this time, at least as far as the federal government is concerned. The St. Nick you knew is on vacation, possibly permanently. In his place we have Republican Tax-Cut Santa, who has different priorities. You see, the new guy doesn’t care whether you’re naughty or nice. In fact, he’ll actually reward you if you’re naughty in the right ways. But mainly he cares whether you’re rich, especially if your wealth comes from property (preferably inherited property), not hard work. In that case, you get a really big gift. If you’re an ordinary working family, not so much — and eventually you get that lump. So let’s talk about whose stockings will be stuffed by the tax bill Republicans just rammed through without a single hearing or a single Democratic vote. The centerpiece of the legislation is a huge tax cut for corporations. Republicans claim that this tax cut will be passed on to workers in the form of higher wages, but most independent studies conclude that even in the long run only between one-fifth and one-quarter of the tax cut will trickle down to workers. And the fraction will be much lower in the short run — say, the next few years. So this is basically a tax cut for shareholders. And who are these shareholders? About a third of the total benefits will go to foreigners. Among U.S. residents, while many people have some stock in their retirement accounts, those amounts are generally small. Even including indirect holdings through mutual funds, the top 1 percent of domestic households owns 40 percent of stocks, the bottom 80 percent just 7 percent. So when Tax-Cut Santa comes to town, it’s definitely good to be rich. Meanwhile, complicated things will happen to individual taxes: Some deductions will increase, others will be cut. Next year, most people will probably see a small tax cut, although for the middle class it will be a smaller cut than the one they got from Barack Obama in 2009 — a tax cut almost nobody noticed. Crucially, however, while the corporate tax cut is permanent, all these individual goodies are set to erode over time, then expire, so that when the law is fully implemented, most middle-class families will see their taxes rise. Republicans claim that we shouldn’t take this prospect seriously, because future Congresses will extend the individual breaks — that is, they’re saying that their own law is so bad that it won’t be implemented as written. And remember, that’s supposed to be a defense of the bill. Now comes the fun part — the part where it pays to be naughty. You see, the second most important piece of this tax bill, after the corporate tax giveaway, is a drastic tax cut for business owners, who will end up paying much less in taxes than people with the same income who work as someone else’s employee. It’s hard to come up with any good rationale for this move, which will discriminate among taxpayers in a way that bears no relationship to any coherent policy goal. It will, however, offer a big financial windfall to a number of elected officials, especially Donald Trump. And it will also open the door to a lot of tax-system gaming. The obvious trick is to keep doing exactly what you’re doing now, but redefine yourself as an independent contractor rather than an employee. The bill contains rules that would supposedly limit that kind of abuse, but tax experts have already found huge loopholes. And these experts were just a handful of people working pro bono for a couple of days. Over the months ahead, as thousands of top-dollar accountants and lawyers get to work, expect to see many more routes to tax avoidance emerge — but only for the rich and well connected. Consider one example we already know about. Imagine a partnership involving several doctors. Under the new rules, such a service business won’t qualify for the tax break (although it would if they were architects. Why? Who knows?). But the doctors can get around the rule by buying the building they work in, then charging themselves an exorbitant rent. Voilà! They get to pay much lower taxes — because real estate investment trusts, strange to say, do get the big tax break. Or suppose some of my colleagues form an economics consulting firm. Such a firm won’t qualify for tax breaks. But suppose they also start selling nerdy T-shirts (“Economists do it with models”). With a little hocus-pocus, as I understand it, they can basically define themselves as a T-shirt business, and pay much less in taxes. The point is that there will be hundreds of tax-avoidance games like these, costing taxpayers billions if not hundreds of billions in lost revenue. But only those who are both affluent and sneaky will be able to play these games. As I said, Tax-Cut Santa actually rewards you if you’re naughty, as long as you’re naughty in the right way. And what about those promises that rich people wouldn’t get a tax cut, that the tax system would get simpler, that you’d be able to file on a postcard, and all that? All I can say is, ho ho ho. "
84,"Alexei Wood, a journalist who was arrested while covering a protest of Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, was found not guilty at the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on Thursday of all seven counts against him, including conspiracy to riot and several counts of destruction of property. Mr. Wood had originally faced up to 61 years in prison. His five fellow defendants — Michelle Macchio, Jennifer Armento, Christina Simmons, Oliver Harris and Brittne Lawson — were also found not guilty of all charges after a nearly four-week trial. “Alexei was overwhelmed in court and doubled over crying,” Brett E. Cohen, Mr. Wood’s lawyer, said in an interview soon after the decision came in. “In these times of press persecution, I feel this is an important victory.” Prosecutors said the six defendants were among a group that cut a violent swath through 16 blocks of the city, smashing windows of businesses, tossing newspaper boxes into the street and damaging a car. Authorities tallied the damages at more than $100,000. The lawyers for the defendants had countered that their clients and most others in the group of about 500 were peacefully protesting, with only a handful becoming violent. Mr. Wood, 37, a freelance photographer and videographer based in San Antonio, was one of over 200 people arrested at the protest, which was organized by an activist group called Disrupt J20. Among those arrested were nine journalists. The government has dropped the charges against seven of those people. Mr. Wood and Aaron Cantú, a staff reporter at The Santa Fe Reporter in New Mexico who was working as a freelancer in January, were the only two journalists who faced charges. Mr. Cantú’s trial is scheduled for October 2018. Mr. Wood had primarily worked as a commercial photographer but had been trying to build his portfolio as a photojournalist when he went to cover the J20 protest. "
85,"With their tax bill, Donald Trump and the Republicans are raiding the Treasury in plain sight, throwing crumbs to the masses as the millionaires and billionaires make off with the cake. America should be aghast not only at the looting but also at the brazenness of its execution. It seems that for as long as I can remember, Republicans have been wringing their hands about deficits. And yet in this budget, they willingly, willfully exploded the deficit, not for public uplift or rebuilding America’s infrastructure but rather on the spurious argument that giving truckloads of money back to businesses will spark their benevolence. According to the government’s own nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the tax bill will lead to “an increase in the deficit of $1,455 billion over the next 10 years.” But be sure, when this bill leads to these predicted deficits, Republicans will return to their sidelined deficit rhetoric armed with a sickle, aiming the blade at the social safety net, exacerbating the egregious imbalance of the tax bill’s original sins. That’s the strategy: Appease the rich on the front end; punish the poor on the back. Feed the weak to the strong. The callousness of this calculation is hidden in the arguments over estimates and evidence, but it is not lost. Most Americans see through this charade. According to a CNN/SSRS poll released this week, most Americans disapprove of the tax bill. Furthermore, most believe the bill will benefit the wealthy, in general, and Trump and his family, in particular. "

87,"When President Trump announced that the United States would formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, he upended a central tenet of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process: Under the first Oslo Accord in 1993, the status of Jerusalem was to be resolved through direct negotiations, and not through unilateral declarations by Washington or other third parties. For over two decades, Labor, Israel’s main center-left party, has been committed to a two-state solution that would honor the Oslo agreement. Times have evidently changed for the party. Its new leader, Avi Gabbay, who scored a stunning victory in Labor’s leadership election in July, celebrated Mr. Trump’s Jerusalem announcement, saying, “a united Jerusalem is even more important than peace.” Though other Labor leaders have also called for a united Jerusalem, the tone of Mr. Gabbay’s remarks, as an Israeli news website noted, “contrasted with that of the dovish Labor, which has long been the Israeli political standard-bearer for reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians.” While most Israelis already consider Jerusalem their capital, some prominent leftist politicians, including the Meretz Party chairwoman Zehava Galon and the Joint List leader Ayman Odeh, warned that Mr. Trump’s announcement would cause instability. With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dogged by two serious corruption investigations, including allegations of graft, this should be an ideal time for the country’s beleaguered center-left opposition to mount a serious, united challenge to Mr. Netanyahu and his right-wing government. Instead, the opposition is in disarray, encumbered by both internal strife and a national trend that threatens to sideline anyone perceived as remotely leftist. Now, after years of demonization by the Likud and its political allies, including spurious accusations of disloyalty, the Israeli left’s foremost political party has internalized the message. Mr. Gabbay, the best hope for a movement capable of challenging Mr. Netanyahu, has become a sad replica of Mr. Netanyahu himself. Since assuming the leadership of Labor, he has been making hasty appeals to Mr. Netanyahu’s base. In October, in response to a question about the fate of isolated settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mr. Gabbay said, “If you make a peace deal, solutions can be found that do not necessitate evacuations,” and later said that the settlements were “the beautiful and devoted face of Zionism.” While Mr. Gabbay has since tempered his remarks on settlements and insists that he fully supports a two-state solution, his position on crucial issues seems irrefutably at odds with it. Labor’s recent moves reflect the desperate situation Israel’s left has faced since the collapse of the Camp David peace talks in 2000. Labor’s shift is happening while other parties on the left are also struggling to stay relevant. Ms. Galon of Meretz, for instance, recently resigned from the Knesset to focus on her campaign to replace her party’s arcane system of electing its leader with a proper democratic primary. "
88,"MILAN — Don Emilio is the parish priest at the cathedral of my hometown, Crema, 30 miles from Milan. He just hates Father Christmas (Babbo Natale if you’re Italian). The priest doesn’t simply ignore Father Christmas or disapprove of him: He hates him with a vengeance. A while ago he came over and rang my doorbell, and he was not a happy trouper: He’d noticed a brightly lit Santa Claus clinging to my balcony, clambering toward the window of the floor above. My family thought it was cute, but Don Emilio didn’t. He thinks Babbo Natale is an interloper and says as much in church, thundering from the pulpit now that Christmas is nigh, accusing him of elbowing out the infant Jesus — not from a manger in a Nativity scene, but from the minds of Italian children. Who brings gifts? Good old Santa, not a newborn, no matter how sweet he is. And we know how pragmatic children are. Let me say that Don Emilio has a point. We Italians tend to be xenophiles all year round, not just at Christmas. But during the festive season, our fascination with other cultures — above all with American culture — just rockets sky high. You may well say, “But Santa Claus isn’t American!” Indeed. He’s inspired by St. Nicholas of Myra, in Anatolia, a fourth-century Christian bishop. The character then got a Dutch name, entered Germanic folklore, helped the cause of the Reformation in England (the infant Jesus was considered papist), became patron saint of Russia. Later on, as we all know, he moved to Lapland, hired Scandinavian reindeers and bought a flying sledge. Not even Elon Musk owns such a cool vehicle. And Jeff Bezos, who’s testing drones to deliver packages right to his customers’ doorsteps, ought to pay royalties to Santa Claus. True, with Amazon, it’s one click; with Santa, you need snail mail (no credit card, though, since most 5-year-olds don’t carry one). Santa is an international character, you may conclude. His big white beard and big red suit, however, were products of 20th-century American advertising, given a global lift by Coca-Cola. Nothing wrong with that, of course. But there’s no doubt that this elderly foreign gentleman, who stubbornly refuses to retire and seems immune to arthritis or rheumatism, has ousted the baby Jesus. In Italy, at least. "

90,"The individual mandate, an idea inspired by conservative intellectuals but ultimately embraced by Democratic lawmakers as an essential part of the Affordable Care Act, will soon be dead. The provision would be eliminated under the tax bill passed on Wednesday. Left behind would be a policy structure that relied on the mandate to push the young and healthy to buy health insurance and thus strengthen the marketplace for millions of Americans. The Affordable Care Act, which adopted the mandate as a central provision, will remain the law, and President Trump far overstated matters when he said that “we have essentially repealed Obamacare.” But the loss of the mandate — the  best-known and least liked part of the health care law — will cause substantial changes. The magnitude of the consequences is uncertain, but most experts believe the mandate’s elimination will usher in an era of higher insurance prices and lower health coverage rates. The economists at the Congressional Budget Office estimate that as many as 13 million more Americans could become uninsured in 10 years and that insurance premiums will rise by an additional 10 percent each year. The impact won’t start to become clear until 2019, when the provision’s penalties for remaining uninsured officially expire. The mandate was devised by conservative health care experts at the Heritage Foundation in the late 1980s, who conceived it as a necessary part of a market-based system for providing health insurance in America. The mandate was intended to encourage individual responsibility: More families should be able to choose their own health plans in a market, but they would be expected to have some sort of coverage so they wouldn’t burden their neighbors if they became sick or injured. “Society does feel a moral obligation to insure that its citizens do not suffer from the unavailability of health care,” Stuart Butler, then Heritage’s director of domestic policy studies, said in a 1989 lecture that was published in a book. “But on the other hand, each household has the obligation, to the extent it is able, to avoid placing demands on society by protecting itself.” It attracted interest across the political spectrum, becoming a favored policy prescription of some Republicans opposed to President Bill Clinton’s health care overhaul plan in the early 1990s. It was discussed in economics and policy journals. And it later became the basis for a bipartisan health care bill that attracted co-sponsors from both parties but never made it to a vote. "
91,"These 12 blink-and-you-might-have-missed-them cultural moments of 2017 brightened up a year otherwise defined by the threat of nuclear war, natural disasters — from hurricanes to wildfires — that left hundreds of thousands homeless, a string of sexual harassment charges against some of the country’s most prominent political and entertainment figures and yet more terrorist attacks. These are the small but indelible pleasures that our editors and reporters have been grateful for in the past year. Let’s start with the leotards. Ruth’s is teal, with color-blocked sleeves and side panels. Arthie’s is pink, solid on one shoulder, candy-striped on the other. Tammé’s looks like she stole it from the set of “Fame.” Sheila’s is made out of fur. The scene is a training session in the second episode of the Netflix series “GLOW,” and the costumes, by Beth Morgan, are enough to snap anyone who lived through the ’80s into a nylon-spandex flashback. “GLOW,” a 10-episode comedy created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, is a heavily fictionalized account of the creation of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,” a distaff answer to the World Wrestling Federation that ran on television in the ’80s. I can remember being a kid and watching that earlier series after the cartoons ran out, bored by the phony athleticism and phonier comedy sketches, but fascinated by the hair spray and the makeup, the skintight cheerleader outfits and the scrunched-down socks. “GLOW” culminates in a televised bout, and the pleasure of the to-the-brow eye shadow and belted lamé is overpowering. But by that point the women have already turned themselves into TV-friendly caricatures — Liberty Belle, Welfare Queen, Fortune Cookie. So I have a soft spot for the costumes in the initial episodes, when the wrestling women aren’t yet playing their in-the-ring roles. If most of them are dressing for comfort, they’re also telegraphing how they’d like to be seen — Ruth’s serious blues, Arthie’s soft pinks — before they realize that the camera won’t want their real selves, Sheila’s pelt excepted. (That some of the women find their wrestling characters empowering while others don’t is one of the more interesting complications of the series.) Ms. Morgan has said that she took inspiration from J.C. Penney catalogs and a couple of ’80s movies, including “Girls Just Want to Have Fun.” The costumes are fairly true to the era, skating on the sunny side of parody. And with the leotards cut high on the thigh and the velour shorts riding low on the hips, these outfits are sexy, too. But not so sexy that they can’t survive an airplane swing or a double-leg takedown. Can Lululemon say that? Before the movie “Beach Rats” opened late in the summer, the advance buzz was about Harris Dickinson, the up-and-coming British actor playing a closeted gay Brooklyn youth struggling with his sexuality and the emptiness of his day-to-day life. But while Mr. Dickinson received justifiably strong reviews for his performance, the film’s breakout might have been Madeline Weinstein, a young actress with few film credits to her name. Her character, Simone, starts out as a slightly annoying flirt, oblivious to the signals being sent out by Mr. Dickinson’s Frankie. But as the plot unfolds and she draws you deeper into her growing desire for this troubled youth, you find your attention shifting and focusing tightly on her. Shortly into the film, after the two have had fumbling, awkward sex, Simone sits up in bed and says to Frankie, “Do you think I’m pretty?” When he refuses to answer and, even worse, mockingly repeats the question, the look that crosses her face — humiliation followed quickly by fury — reminded me of a young Debra Winger, circa “Urban Cowboy,” and the nakedness of youthful desire. I’m not sure if Ms. Weinstein has a great, Oscar-nominated career ahead of her, or if I will never again see her in a single movie. But the heartbreak of that scene will stick with me for some time to come. One of the joys of being a podcast fan in 2017 was bearing witness to another era of transformation in the medium, which, three years after the “Serial” revolution and the leap in production values that followed, still feels like a simmering primordial stew: You never know what strange new species may rise to the surface. This year, whole genres were created that redefined how a podcast can feel and function. The New York Times’s “The Daily” and NPR’s “Up First” reinvented daily morning news for a medium better known for its leisurely diversions. And “36 Questions,” featuring the actors Jonathan Groff and Jessie Shelton, took those diversions to new places, concocting an original musical written and directed for the theater between your ears. But the podcast that most thrillingly upended the field came, once again, from the creators of “Serial.” “S-Town,” a seven-part series that applied the tools of literary nonfiction and investigative reporting to a rural town in Alabama and its unforgettable residents, went bigger by going smaller, showing how our most profound and mystifying appetites — for love, and belonging and order in the universe — manifested in a single extraordinary life. I haven’t been able to shake John B. McLemore, the troubled and ferociously articulate protagonist of “S-Town,” since the series was released in March. His mesmerizing, acid soliloquies on clock repairing and climate despairing and small-town farce have no analogue in fiction. But the most delightful and surprising episode focused on another jewel of a subject, Olin Long. We meet Mr. Long — a friend and onetime love interest of Mr. McLemore’s who, as we learn in one of the show’s most endearing digressions, may be the world’s biggest fan of “Brokeback Mountain” — in Episode 6 of the podcast, after we think we have a handle on its major contours. Some criticized “S-Town” for sidestepping the pulpy tale of murder and corruption teased by its cryptic prerelease marketing. But what made the series so exceptional was its insistence on examining the human riddle at its center, turning it over and over again to uncover astonishing new facets and missed connections. Episode 6 is not the most consequential in the arc of the show, but Mr. Long’s interviews sketch a portrait of unquenched desire and suppressed heartbreak that recast everything we’ve previously heard in new light. Not so unlike Mr. McLemore, many of us have bouts of misery and misanthropy. But most of us can’t help but suspect that the cure for what ails us, if it can be found, lies somewhere in other people. If one of the greatest comedy writers alive put out a book of inspired jokes and no one noticed, was it funny? Judge for yourself by picking up Jack Handey’s “Please Stop the Deep Thoughts,” the fifth collection of his signature dry-witted setups and punch lines that was self-published over the summer to no hype, marketing or news-media attention. You can’t even find it on Amazon; Only his website sells it. The only reason I know about this book is a direct message on Twitter from the stand-up comic Anthony Jeselnik. “I’m not normally one to drop hot tips,” he wrote in October, “but the fact Jack Handey is selling a new book of Deep Thoughts and no one knows about it is a crime against journalism.” Mr. Jeselnik, who calls Mr. Handey the single biggest influence on his joke writing, has a point. Mr. Handey became famous in the 1990s because of the short interstitial jokes, called “Deep Thoughts With Jack Handey,” which ran between sketches and commercials on “Saturday Night Live.” Many didn’t even realize Mr. Handey was a real person, let alone the writer of such brilliantly off-kilter sketches as “Toonces the Driving Cat” and “Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer.” This new book is a welcome reminder of his distinctively funny voice. Each page contains one joke, often no more than a sentence long, accompanied by a generic photo of nature or wildlife or something vaguely meditative and all-American. The content shares a similar tone, full of mock-profound musings about cowboys and miracles and other things you might find in a Sam Shepard play. After quickly establishing this philosophical and folksy mood in a joke, a twist inevitably undercuts the self-seriousness. It’s often a blunt injection of attitude like “I don’t mind something being a harbinger of something else, but after that I think you have to wrap it up.” Or maybe it’s something more nonsensical: “If a pretty girl catches you picking your nose, just pretend like she’s not that pretty.” My favorites of his jokes hint at an entire life beyond the joke. They share a quality that the best acting does, how a performer can evoke an odd subtext or back story in a gesture or piece of business. Jack Handey will begin a sentence in a blandly benign narrator tone, then take a sudden wrong turn, landing who knows where: “One bad thing about ice skating is you’re always knocking over little kids.” The last thing I expected to see in the final scene of Pamela Adlon’s second season of “Better Things” was a dance. And not just any dance, but one that works as an antidote against the toxicity of the times: “Tilted” by Christine and the Queens. The stage name of the French pop singer-songwriter Heloïse Letissier, Christine and the Queens incorporates dance into all of her music. (She doesn’t like to sing when she’s totally still.) Her song “Tilted” is a celebration of being off-balance — of finding a patch of solid ground in a turbulent world, but also of embracing your awkwardness. Single shoulders twitch and shrug; a head droops over the legs and jerks to the side. “I’m in my right place,” she sings. “Don’t be a downer.” In the episode, Sam (Ms. Adlon) — a single mother raising three daughters — blindfolds Max, her oldest, and takes her outside for her graduation present. “Tilted” plays while Sam, along with her two other daughters and their grandmother, re-enacts Ms. Letissier’s video. Wearing black, they perform the choreography — sometimes shakily, but with spectacular intention — on a shiny elevated stage against a background of trees. And Ms. Letissier’s message endures: What does it mean when you lose balance? Are you falling or flying? The USA cyberthriller “Mr. Robot” has been at times a little too in love with cinematic trickery. But in November, the creator Sam Esmail and his team nailed a stunt that was as complex as one of the hero Elliot’s elaborate hacks: An entire episode seemed to unfold in a single take. The result was one of TV’s most electric hours of 2017. Or make that 45 minutes or so, presented without commercials as the camera tracked first Elliot (Rami Malek) and then his friend-turned-nemesis, Angela (Portia Doubleday), through an E Corp headquarters thick with skulduggery, rioting and panic, as each tried to outwit the other. (There were camouflaged edits throughout.) Long takes stress out viewers by withholding the cutaways our minds crave, making us feel the anxiety racking the characters. In “Mr. Robot,” this intensified the show’s radically subjective perspective at a spot in the story when Elliot and Angela were not only under the gun but were so in opposition to one another. The episode also functioned as a microcosm of the entire series, Elliot using the size and disconnected structure of E Corp against it as he expertly manipulates its networks and vulnerabilities. Rather than being a gimmick, in other words, the one-take gambit added new layers to a tense story of two characters moving in opposite directions. But while such ostentatious technique generally works best when it enhances the narrative, that’s not to say that story is all that matters. TV is a visual medium, after all, and its best works use aesthetic elements to convey a story’s visceral and emotional undertow along with the narrative details. Truly exceptional ones, however, make you reconsider the limits of the art form. In early June, I made my first visit to Washington since the 2016 election, just a few days after President Trump stood in the Rose Garden and, in the name of “Pittsburgh, not Paris,” abrogated a landmark climate agreement. Against that ecocidal nativism, the National Gallery’s sumptuous exhibition “America Collects Eighteenth-Century French Painting,” whose 68 Enlightenment-era pictures traveled from Arizona, Alabama, Kansas, Texas and Pittsburgh, too, offered a vital aide-mémoire of French and American virtues. One painting in particular, “Portrait of a Youth in an Embroidered Vest” — a half-length portrait of a young man lent from the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens in Jacksonville, Fla. — didn’t make it into my review of that show, but I haven’t forgotten it. Its subject stares just slightly off to the side, self-possessed but sad. He wears a floral vest under a luminous silver satin coat, whose wrinkles the artist Marie-Victoire Lemoine has rendered with care, and his stiff white collar stands out against skin of dark brown. The sitter is not identified. I had initially thought he was an African — the painting was identified as such until recently, and images of black French citizens, most famously Girodet’s sexed-up portrait of the slave-turned-parliamentarian Jean-Baptiste Belley, were a popular theme in the late 18th century. Lemoine’s subject, though, is more likely a young Bengali man named Zamor, who served before the revolution as the page of Madame du Barry, one of the most fashionable aristocrats in Versailles. As he grew older, Zamor devoured books by Rousseau and speeches by Robespierre, joined the Jacobins and eventually turned on his mistress. In 1793, on his testimony, the Committee of Public Safety sent Madame du Barry to the Place de la Révolution, where she fainted on the way to the guillotine. How tranquil he looked in his pearlescent frock coat. But beneath the satin beat the heart of a revolutionary, and like his American cousins a decade before, he could look past the corruption of the capital and imagine a new kind of government, constituted by and responsible to all people. A great portrait is a likeness of an individual that takes on universal meaning, and this one — whether it depicts Zamor or not — radiated virtues I needed to be reminded of: liberty, equality and, above all, fraternity. In March, Melina Duterte faced the crowd from the stage of the Brooklyn club Baby’s All Right and meekly asked everyone to sing along with her next song. “You say you don’t like the smell,” she began softly, and then, on cue, the room rocked with hundreds of voices shouting back, “But I like the bus!” Ms. Duterte, 23 and the daughter of Filipino immigrants, who performs and records as Jay Som, laughed and belted out the next line: “I can be whoever I want to be.” And the diverse crowd, dominated by young women, roared again in delight. It was a moment repeated at nearly at every stop on her cross-country tour, screamed as a rallying cry and an identity statement, even finding a secondary home as a minor meme online. And it was a five-second microcosm of a growing, ebullient force in rock, of nonwhite female songwriters who derive power from the small and mundane. One of their narrative elements is riding the bus, a motif that has curiously popped up on several female rock songs this year, from Vagabon’s “The Embers” to Palehound’s “Turning 21” to Allison Crutchfield’s “Expatriate.” The bus is a communal experience, a populist symbol and a nod to environment. And whereas in years past it might have been used as a symbol of humiliation and struggle, like when Eminem silently raged in the back seats in “8 Mile,” Jay Som romanticizes the shared space with glee, offering the chance for her followers to hop on board. At the final performance of the musical “War Paint” on Nov. 5, the sold-out audience was primed to play noisy homage to its two high-wattage stars, Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole, marking the end of what was their first (and perhaps last) appearance together in a Broadway show. Final Broadway performances are something of a personal obsession. I try to circle back one last time to see a show I have particularly liked and am often rewarded with unexpected sightings or surprisingly emotional moments: Edward Albee sneaking into a seat just as the house lights dimmed at the final performance of the 2012 revival of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf;” Stephen Sondheim being called up onstage by Bernadette Peters at the end of “A Little Night Music” in 2011. This performance of “War Paint” attracted many of the principals involved in its staging, among them the director Michael Greif and the book writer Doug Wright, as well as a sprinkling of theatrical colleagues who had worked with Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone in the past, giving the matinee a party atmosphere. But there was also a poignancy to the event: a few weeks earlier, it was announced that the show’s run was going to be cut short because Ms. LuPone had to have hip replacement surgery. (And, indeed, she visibly hobbled through much of her performance that day.) As the stars, swaddled in their glamorous Catherine Zuber-designed costumes, walked onstage and started their separate opening numbers, the audience went into overdrive, clapping and shouting for several minutes. Ms. Ebersole happily took in the tribute, grinning at the other actors in her scene and waiting until the applause eventually died down before uttering her first line. A few minutes later, however, Ms. LuPone was all business, taking her place onstage with just a brief pause and a slight smile — and quickly holding up her hand to silence the audience, as if to say, “Children, enough; I have a show to do.” And the two did so, thrillingly, one last time. Many aspects of Janet Jackson’s “State of the World Tour” could be called remarkable, starting with the fact that it happened: Her “Unbreakable World Tour” began in August 2015, paused four months later when Ms. Jackson, then 49, announced she was pregnant, and resumed in September 2017 after she had had a son and gotten divorced from her third husband, Wissam Al Mana. The set list the night I saw the concert in Newark included parts of 36 songs. Ms. Jackson, who looked to be in peak condition, performed the entire show in outfits that covered her arms and legs and wore flat boots. You cannot only count the number of pop stars performing at this level in their 50s on one hand, you can count them on two fingers: Ms. Jackson and Madonna. (Madonna, however, does it in heels.) But something else happened at the “State of the World Tour” I had never seen before at a major pop concert: One of Ms. Jackson’s backup dancers was getting an ecstatic reception. She was fierce, charismatic and curvy; I would call her normal size. The fashion industry would probably call her plus size. Her name is Allison Buczkowski, and she has been dancing with Ms. Jackson for two years. She was born in Haiti, and after her mother died during childbirth, a woman doing missionary work who helped with the delivery adopted her and raised her in upstate New York. She began dance classes at the age of 2. Watching her execute Ms. Jackson’s signature choreography, I kept thinking about something the singer Shawna Potter said during a round-table conversation about young women in rock earlier this year: “Representation really matters — you can’t be what you can’t see.” A lot of women saw themselves as Janet Jackson’s backup dancers, perhaps for the first time, in that arena. A bit of babble has been on my mind since I heard it more than 10 months ago. It’s part of a piece written in 2014, but the a cappella purity of the voices harkens back to the Renaissance. The words are simple: “I want you/I want to,” sung so quickly that “you” and “to” blur into each other. The mood is simultaneously anonymous and tense; it’s heated, yet cool. This is the start of Ted Hearne’s “Consent,” performed — and recorded — by an extraordinary Philadelphia choir, the Crossing. And if it felt full of emotion and meaning when it was composed — and yet more in February, when I heard it at National Sawdust in Williamsburg — it’s only gained in power and significance for me as the debate over sexual harassment and misconduct has grown in recent months to dominate the national conversation. The piece broadens from those initial seconds to encompass scattered fragments of love letters written by Mr. Hearne (in 2006) and his father (in 1962); Catholic and Jewish wedding rites; and text messages exchanged with one of the Steubenville High School students convicted of rape in 2013. The voices hover and slip past one another, find peace and then tumble into more eddies of perplexity. The rush of language, and the difficulty of establishing its source and legitimacy, captured for me so much about our contemporary predicament. Mr. Hearne is hardly sympathetic toward those who wrong women, but I hear “Consent” as compassionating all of us who have been bequeathed unequal, curdled social relations. Without judgment — this composer creates spaces of contemplation, not pat politics — his juxtapositions reveal how freely given consent (marriage, I’m looking at you) has ended up systematically wronging women, just as rape and assault have. The confusion between desiring people and desiring what they can do for you; the overarching anxiety about, simply, possessing; the difficulty, when confronted with the language of love and caring, of distinguishing whether it’s real or feigned — it’s all here, uncannily beautiful, in a form that sounds as old as time. I have a soft spot for the indie-rock band Okkervil River and its lead singer-songwriter, Will Sheff, and as an editor I felt fortunate to guide his personal essay into The New York Times in February. What I liked best was how not of the moment the piece felt: how earnest, how big-hearted. No cynicism, no sourness, no postelection fury. I mean, it was about a teacher who made a difference in his life. How utterly uncool. How wonderful. As a fan of the band’s literary, word-drunk output, I was excited to see them in the Lincoln Center Songbook series, touring behind the new album “Away.” We’d be able to sit and really listen to those private reveries and gnomic story songs, polished to dark shine, as we gazed through the oversize windows into the shadows of Central Park. The concert was all that. It brought alive songs that I hadn’t ever fully gotten on record (“The Silver Gymnasium” from 2013, still registers with me more immediately). But what I remember most was Will Sheff’s greeting to the audience as the band took the stage. He recalled growing up in rural New Hampshire in the ’80s, before the internet and all that cable TV. About how paging through The Times every Sunday gave him a sense of what it meant to be creative and sophisticated. About how so many of the events that seemed thrilling from afar happened at Lincoln Center. I could only wish, he said, that one day this world would make room for someone like me. And so it had. "

On “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee looked at Christians United for Israel, a small group of evangelicals whose leader, John Hagee, said he pushed President Trump to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. She showed footage of Steve Cioccolanti, the leader of Discover Ministries, saying, “Trump has truly signaled the End Times.” Then Ms. Bee played a clip of Mr. Hagee saying that he had told Mr. Trump, “This is the year to move the embassy and make that declaration, because it is a biblical timing of absolute precision.” After Congress passed the G.O.P.’s tax bill, Jimmy Fallon said Mr. Trump was probably overjoyed. But he pointed out that there may be reasons to be skeptical of the bill. The rapper Cardi B talked to Jimmy Fallon about coping with fame, going home for the holidays and her recent engagement. Samantha Bee spoke to A. R. Bernard, the only member of Mr. Trump’s evangelical advisory board to quit.

94,"We journalists like to boast about how many clicks our stories get, or how our columns go viral. Fair enough, but today let me show off my clunkers. These are pieces I wrote that nobody read. Well, not nobody. I read them. My mother did. And that’s about it. These weren’t necessarily my actual worst columns — that’s just a clickbait headline — but they were among my worst read. These had an audience that was about 3 percent that of my best-read columns, and one troubling conclusion evident from a cursory look at my most-read and least-read columns is this: Trump sells, and overseas news doesn’t. I’m not allowed to give raw numbers, which are proprietary, but I can say that on average my columns about President Trump had readership more than twice that of my columns about foreign topics. The news industry, especially television networks, understands that anything about Trump draws an audience, while pieces about overseas crises involve an unfortunate trifecta: They are expensive to cover, sometimes dangerous to report, and often do poorly with audiences. I’m grateful to my editors for letting me spend their money on these global stories, and to my readers for sticking with me as I cover them. And now, without further ado … here are some of my worst-read columns of 2017! Kevin Cooper is on death row in California, but even a federal judge argues that he is probably innocent and was framed by police. He’s black; if he were white, this travesty would be much less likely. Governor Jerry Brown should review the case. One gauge of how China has become more repressive was its brutal treatment of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo as he was dying. He was one of the people I admired most, and I wrote him this open letter; I don’t know if he was allowed to see it before he passed away. His brave widow, Liu Xia, remains in detention. "
95,"WASHINGTON — A new report concludes that a Department of Homeland Security pilot program improperly gathers data on Americans when it requires passengers embarking on foreign flights to undergo facial recognition scans to ensure they haven’t overstayed visas. The report, released on Thursday by researchers at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University’s law school, called the system an invasive surveillance tool that the department had installed at nearly a dozen airports without going through a required federal rule-making process. The report’s authors examined dozens of Department of Homeland Security documents and raised questions about the accuracy of facial recognition scans. They said the technology had high error rates and were subject to bias, because the scans often fail to properly identify women and African-Americans. “It’s telling that D.H.S. cannot identify a single benefit actually resulting from airport face scans at the departure gate,” said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the center and an author of the report. “D.H.S. doesn’t need a face-scanning system to catch travelers without a photo on file,” he added. “It’s alarming that D.H.S. still hasn’t supplied evidence for the necessity of this $1 billion program.” Homeland security officials said the program was necessary and fulfilled a decades-old congressional requirement to prevent foreign visitors from overstaying their visas. John Wagner, deputy executive assistant commissioner for field operations at Customs and Border Protection, said American travelers could ask to be inspected other than by a facial scan before boarding flights. He said that at least 90 percent of the scans had correctly identified faces, and that the agency had not encountered gender or racial bias problems with the technology. “Our job is to meet the mandate and build the system,” Mr. Wagner said. “The fact that Congress felt strong enough to set aside a billion dollars to get it done speaks to its need.” The report comes as homeland security officials begin to roll out a biometric exit system that uses facial recognition scanning in 2018 at all American airports with international flights. Customs and Border Protection has been testing a number of biometric programs, teaming up with several airlines in Atlanta, Boston, New York and Washington. It will cost up to $1 billion, raised from certain visa fee surcharges over the next decade. Customs officials say the biometric system has also produced some successes in the pilot testing and has helped catch people who have entered the United States illegally and are traveling on fake documents. They noted that facial scans and fingerprints — unlike travel documents — cannot be forged or altered and therefore give agents an additional tool to ensure border security. But Senators Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, expressed concerns about the report’s findings. In a letter to Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, the senators urged the department to delay rolling out the facial scans until it addressed the privacy and legal concerns identified in the report. In 1996, Congress ordered the federal government to develop a tracking system for people who overstayed their entry visas. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, an entry- and exit-tracking system was seen as a vital national security and counterterrorism tool. The 9/11 Commission recommended in 2004 that the newly-developed Department of Homeland Security complete a system “as soon as possible.” Congress has since passed seven separate laws requiring biometric entry-exit screening. But for years, officials have struggled to put a biometric exit system in place because the technology to collect the data was slow to take hold. And many American airports, unlike those in Europe and elsewhere, do not have designated international terminals, leaving little space for additional scanning equipment. The biometric system being tested by the Department of Homeland Security can be used either with a small portable hand-held device or a kiosk equipped with a camera. The system snaps a picture of a passenger leaving the United States and checks the person’s face with a gallery of photos maintained by Customs and Border Protection or the State Department. It also checks the person’s citizenship or immigration status against various homeland security and intelligence databases. For American citizens, the facial scans are checked against photos from State Department databases. While the system does take facial scans of American citizens, officials at Customs and Border Protection said, the information is used in a very limited way. The officials said scans of Americans were only used to verify identity — not to collect new information. Mr. Wagner said Customs and Border Protection would comply with a federal process to address concerns before the face scanning system was used at all international terminals at American airports. Laura Moy, who helped write the report, said the Customs and Border Protection assurances were not sufficient. “They can change their minds on how they use this data at any time, because they haven’t put policies in place that govern how it’s supposed to be used,” said Ms. Moy, the deputy director of the Privacy and Technology Center at Georgetown Law. “This invasive system needs more transparency, and homeland security officials need to address the legal and privacy concerns about this system, before they move forward.” An executive order signed in January by President Trump calls for homeland security officials to speed up the deployment of the biometric system to airports. The United States continues to trail other nations in adopting the technology to collect biometric information. Nearly three dozen countries, including in Europe, Asia and Africa, collect fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs that can be used for facial recognition of people leaving their countries. "

97,"Good morning on this sunny-but-nippy winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. Well, 2017 is coming to a close, and for many it’s been a tough year. Hurricanes have destroyed communities, politicians are a daily source of anxiety, and commuting in New York City has never been worse. But it wasn’t all gloomy in 2017, especially in our wonderful city. To brighten your outlook for the coming year, here are just a few of the nice, reaffirming things that happened here in the past 12 months. January. We got a new subway line. In the first major expansion to the system in more than 50 years, the Second Avenue line opened to smiles, selfies and tears of joy. February. We’re a city of “decent human beings.” When hate crimes spiked around the country following the election, our city wasn’t immune. But when someone scribbled anti-Semitic graffiti on an uptown 1 train, New Yorkers stepped in to clean it up. March. A moment of girl power. The “Fearless Girl” statue was installed on Wall Street on the eve of International Women’s Day, brining a touch of whimsy to the “Charging Bull” statue and inspiring debate. April. We got our money back. In a late-night budget deal, Congress allocated money to reimburse the city for security costs for protecting Trump Tower. May. A new ferry launched. The Rockaway line, the first of six new ferry routes, set off on its maiden voyage. With the subway in disarray, it was a bright spot for commuters, who pushed ferry ridership numbers above expectations. June. We live in a city of heroes. After a man fell onto the subway tracks on the Upper West Side, a ballet dancer leapt down to save him. The act of derring-do came less than a month after an illustrator jumped onto the tracks to save a fallen man on the Lower East Side. July. The “summer of hell” wasn’t so bad. Eight weeks of repairs around Penn Station were supposed to make this summer nightmarish for commuters. Then, it turned out pretty manageable — some good even came of it. August. For 157 minutes, the city paused and came together. Bathed in the yellow light from the solar eclipse, we stopped working, shared our glasses and participated in a communal experience. September. More bikes in more places. CitiBike began expanding to 140 new locations in Upper Manhattan, Central Brooklyn and Astoria and Long Island City, Queens. October. We’re now free to dance. The 91-year-old Cabaret Law, which had banned dancing in most venues, was repealed by the City Council. November. Our leaders promised a friendlier police force. Mayor Bill de Blasio began an effort to make police officers nicer through engagement and self-examination. December. Our city is safer, and fairer. The murder rate is likely to be below 300 this year, breaking the record low of 328 murders in 2014, while the number of people stop and frisked has dropped 98 percent since 2011. What is the best piece of good news you heard this year — personal or otherwise? Let us know in the comments. Here’s what else is happening: In weather news today, there’s both good and bad.

98,"Perfect last-minute choices for any person, inspired by Donald Trump, thinking about the history of the 25th Amendment. • Clarence G. Lasby, “Eisenhower’s Heart Attack” • Jeffrey Frank, “Ike and Dick: Portrait of a Strange Political Marriage” • Birch Bayh, “One Heartbeat Away: Presidential Disability and Succession” • Jane Mayer and Doyle McManus, “Landslide: The Unmaking of the President 1984-1988” Expecting continuity of government to depend on a gentleman’s agreement with Richard M. Nixon was neither legal nor, in retrospect, judicious. By the time President Dwight Eisenhower wrote a letter in 1958 to Vice President Nixon designating him “the individual explicitly and exclusively responsible for determining whether there is any inability of mine that makes it necessary for you to discharge the powers and duties of the presidency,” Eisenhower had already had a heart attack in 1955, abdominal surgery in 1956 and a stroke in 1957. After the stroke, Jeffrey Frank writes in “Ike and Dick,” Nixon “had heard the president say ‘window’ when he meant to say ‘mirror’ and say ‘ceiling’ when he meant to say ‘floor.’” That would be a worrisome development in any era but was especially vexing in the thermonuclear age. When the ailing but popular Eisenhower ran for re-election in ’56, his most significant opponent was not Adlai Stevenson but his own body. Clarence G. Lasby supposes in “Eisenhower’s Heart Attack” that “the only way to prove that he was not an invalid was to serve another term.” "
99,"The Trump administration’s increasingly bizarre war on abortion continues as immigration officials keep trying to block access to abortion for pregnant undocumented teenagers in their custody. The administration has no law on its side (leading career lawyers in the Justice Department to withhold their signatures from its legal pleadings) but still won’t stop exploiting the plight of these most vulnerable young women, for no apparent reason other than a commitment to saving the world one fetus at a time. But the administration’s war on birth control came to a grinding halt the other day. In a little-noticed ruling, a federal district judge in Philadelphia issued a temporary injunction against a new policy that lets employers refuse to cover contraception in their employees’ insurance plans if they have either religious objections to birth control or “sincerely held moral convictions” against it. (Note that since no one is forcing these employers to use birth control themselves, their moral objection has to be to their employees’ using it.) Marveling in her 44-page opinion at the “remarkable breadth” of these exemptions, Judge Wendy Beetlestone raised the obvious question: “Who determines whether the expressed moral reason is sincere or not or, for that matter, whether it falls within the bounds of morality or is merely a preference choice?” Her answer: The administration “has conjured up a world where a government entity is empowered to impose its own version of morality on each one of us.” “That cannot be right,” she wrote. I commented on the new policy when the administration announced it in October. While I thought it was preposterous, I didn’t expect either that the state of Pennsylvania (which has a Democratic governor, Tom Wolf) would bring a lawsuit or that a federal judge would be so forthright in calling the administration out. “It is difficult,” Judge Beetlestone wrote, “to comprehend a rule that does more to undermine the contraceptive mandate or that intrudes more into the lives of women.” The contraceptive mandate is the much-litigated Affordable Care Act requirement for employer-based insurance to cover “preventive care and screenings” for women, as further defined to include “the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods.” The open-ended religious and moral exemptions, Judge Beetlestone wrote, amounted to “the proverbial exception that swallows the rule.” Of course, this saga may well not end in Federal District Court. After the ruling came down last Friday, a Justice Department spokeswoman strongly hinted that an appeal would be forthcoming. “This administration is committed to defending the religious liberty of all Americans, and we look forward to doing so in court,” Lauren Ehrsam said. I found it interesting that the official statement emphasized “religious liberty” while making no mention of the “moral” opt out. Was the administration conflating religion and morality, refusing to recognize that limiting the size of one’s family can be, and for many people is, itself a deeply moral choice, surely of equivalent weight to an employer’s conviction that every sex act by its female employees should carry the prospect of procreation? Among the more delicious aspects of Judge Beetlestone’s opinion in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Trump is the judge’s treatment of the administration’s claim that Pennsylvania lacked standing to bring the lawsuit because it could not demonstrate the “injury in fact” that is necessary to pursue a claim in federal court. I don’t know Judge Beetlestone, who was a partner in a major Philadelphia law firm and general counsel to the Philadelphia school district before President Barack Obama named her to the district court in 2014. I can only imagine — and hope — that she took some satisfaction in pointing out that Pennsylvania’s claim to standing was at least as strong as that of Texas in its suit two years ago that succeeded in undoing the Obama administration’s plan to defer deportation for parents of the “dreamers” brought to this country as children. Republicans who characterized the challenged policy, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, as executive branch overreach cheered the Texas lawsuit’s outcome, which the Supreme Court failed on a 4-to-4 vote to set aside. “There is no daylight between the 2015 Texas suit against the federal government and the current Commonwealth suit against the federal government,” Judge Beetlestone observed.

101,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Even before a defiant Roy S. Moore stood at a lectern this month and refused to concede the Alabama Senate race, one political reality was clear: An extraordinary turnout among black voters had helped push Doug Jones to a rare Democratic victory in this state. That turnout, in which registered black voters appeared to cast ballots at a higher rate than white ones, has become the most recent reference point in the complicated picture about race and elections laws. At issue, at a time when minorities are becoming an increasingly powerful slice of the electorate, is how much rules like Alabama’s voter ID law serve as a brake on that happening. The turnout by black voters in Alabama raises a question: Did it come about because voting restrictions were not as powerful as critics claim or because voters showed up in spite of them? Whether blacks and other minorities vote has become an evermore crucial element in the national political calculus. Minority voters, who lean overwhelmingly Democratic, were 29 percent of eligible voters in 2012 and 31 percent in 2016; by 2020, the figure is expected to rise to nearly 34 percent. LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and a founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, which backed voter-mobilization efforts in the Senate contest, said the impact of voter suppression in Alabama was real, but that the policies were sometimes a motivating factor. “Historically and traditionally, there has been a strong voice of resistance to those that are undemocratic,” she said. “I don’t think that this is new; I think that has always been the role that black voters, particularly in the Deep South, have played.” But research, particularly of voter ID laws in Texas, Wisconsin and other states, provides an imprecise picture of how much similar laws suppress turnout. And Eitan Hersh, a Tufts University political scientist who contributed to the analysis of Texas’ strict voter ID law, said research indicated that voter ID laws could alter very close elections but might not be as influential as some critics claim. “These laws are complicated to assess,” Mr. Hersh said. “Alabama was a place where there was a lot of campaigning, and when campaigns liven up, you have a lot of mobilization efforts” that could offset the effect of an ID law on turnout. Alabama, where a bloody history of battling for the right to vote gave birth to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and a lawsuit led to the 2013 Supreme Court case that dramatically weakened the law, is seldom described as a model for voting rules. Like only 12 other states, Alabama does not permit early voting, which is disproportionately used by minorities and the poor. Its restrictions on voting by people with felony records were recently relaxed, but remain among the nation’s toughest and likely curb black turnout. The state’s voter ID law, which was challenged in federal court, threatened to disenfranchise at least 100,000 registered voters, many of them black or Hispanic, according to the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund. And a panel of federal judges ruled this year that 12 state legislative districts had been gerrymandered to dilute African-American voting power. The congressional map is also gerrymandered. Since 2010, 23 states, mostly under Republican control, have enacted laws requiring voters to show identification before casting ballots, all in the name of curbing a voter-fraud threat that almost all experts and election officials say is largely mythical. Six states have reduced early voting days or hours, seven have stiffened requirements to register and three states have made it harder for people with felony convictions to regain the right to vote. A lawsuit challenging aggressive purging of voter rolls in Ohio, where thousands of legitimate voters have been removed from the rolls, will next month go before the United States Supreme Court; the case could give similar plans a red or green light. The court is also considering arguments over the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering, which computer technology has turned into an evermore powerful tool. On the other hand, in many states, most of them divided or Democratic leaning, access to the franchise continues to expand: Since 2015, nine states have passed laws to automatically register new voters when they interact with government agencies. Colorado, Oregon and Washington have moved almost entirely to mail-in ballots and turnout has bumped upward as a result. Nearly three-quarters of states allow early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, or both. In the Alabama vote, there were reports of scattered troubles, including technology problems, voter ID disputes, issues with voters improperly classified as inactive and long lines at many polling places. But the gravest fears of Alabama’s critics were not realized. Some of that reflected years of advocacy by voting rights groups, including the concerted pushback that led the state, in 2015, to back away from a plan to close 31 driver’s license offices in rural areas, many of them predominantly black. Alabama’s secretary of state, John H. Merrill, said allegations of irregularities, from the left and right, in the Dec. 12 election were not borne out. “It’s just people making things up, and they think they can because of what they’ve observed that happened before or what our history has been,” said Mr. Merrill, a Republican. Still unclear is what role voting restrictions, including voter ID, are playing on turnout here and elsewhere. Exit polls are preliminary, but the ones available in Alabama suggest the share of blacks who cast ballots — roughly 41 percent of the African-Americans voters — exceeding the 35 or so percent of whites who turned out. The divide likely reflects a robust black turnout and modest participation from whites who were unenthusiastic about Mr. Moore, whose already-controversial candidacy was dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct. One recent academic study concluded that the historic turnout gap between white and minority voters increased sharply — as much as fivefold — in states with the strictest voter ID laws, producing a “clear partisan distortion” favoring Republicans. In Texas, where federal courts have invalidated parts of one of the nation’s toughest ID laws, a detailed analysis concluded that 3.6 percent of white registered voters in Texas lacked any legally acceptable ID — and 5.7 percent of Hispanic voters, and 7.5 percent of African-Americans. But among more likely voters who cast ballots in the 2010 and 2012 elections, only 1.4 percent lacked a valid ID. An estimated 600,000 registered voters lacked a photo ID that qualified them to vote under the law. Still other studies in Texas and Wisconsin concluded that confusion over voter ID laws meant that more people who actually had valid IDs but believed they did not stayed home on Election Day than did voters who actually lacked identification. The Wisconsin study suggested it was mathematically possible — though far from certain — that the number of voters who stayed home in the 2016 general election exceeded Donald J. Trump’s 22,748-vote margin of victory there. Some critics of voter restrictions took that as proof of the impact of such laws, but among scholars, caution is more the rule. “It depends on where, and it depends on who,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who also oversaw voting-rights issues in the Obama administration Justice Department. “There are real, live instances where positions are taken to keep eligible people from showing up at the polls or to make it needlessly harder to vote. But it’s not nationwide, and it’s not all the time.” Benard Simelton, the president of the Alabama branch of the N.A.A.C.P., said he believed that the voter ID law had led some people, many of them poor, to stop trying to participate in elections at all. “As long as that’s a requirement, what are people to do if they haven’t been able to obtain the required voter ID?” Mr. Simelton said. “My gut tells me that people who don’t have it have given up.” Some voting rights advocates stress that the relevant measure should be whether people were unable to vote, not whether particular policies determined the outcome of the election. “Voter suppression might not be attributable in every instance to changing an election outcome, but it’s significant to people who have barriers in front of them at the ballot box,” said Myrna Pérez, the deputy director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. She added: “The country is going to be poorer if we only care about voter suppression when it affects the outcome.” The outcome, however, is increasingly the standard by which voting-rights cases are decided. The Supreme Court’s Shelby County v. Holder decision, which dramatically scaled back the Voting Rights Act, relieved scores of states and local governments with a history of bias from the need to prove that new election rules did not discriminate. Since 2013, the burden of proving discrimination — and the cost of detecting and litigating it — has been shifted to minority voters and the groups that represent them. To many, that’s a standard that rankles. “I do think that very committed, focused people will find a way” to cast ballots, said Ms. Brown, the co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. ”But is that fair? If you put a rock on my foot and I beat you in the race, that still doesn’t make it O.K. that you put a rock on my foot.” "
102,"“You all just got a lot richer,” Trump reportedly told guests at Mar-a-Lago. But Republicans will nonetheless keep insisting that the corporate tax cut that is the main item in the tax bill is really for the benefit of workers. They will be aided in this claim by some recent corporate announcements of bonuses or wage hikes that they attribute to the tax cut. It’s nonsense, of course. Think of the motivation: lots of companies are raising wages at least a bit in the face of tight labor markets; pretending that it’s because of the tax cut is a cheap way to curry favor with an administration that has no hesitation about using regulatory and antitrust decisions to reward friends and punish enemies. It’s basically Carrier all over: make a Trump-friendly splash by declaring that he persuaded you to save jobs, then lay off lots of workers after the cameras have moved on. But there’s a larger point here: even if you believe economic analyses that suggest corporate tax cuts are good for wages, it shouldn’t happen right away. Any trickle-down should come about because the tax cuts lead to higher investment, which leads over time to a larger capital stock – and it’s the increase in the capital stock, which may take many years, that leads to the wage rise. I keep finding it helpful to use a diagram representing the economy corporate tax-cutters imagine we have: a one-sector economy with no monopoly power, open to inflows of foreign capital. (Adding the reality of monopoly rents, noncorporate capital, and nontraded goods all reduce the extent of trickle-down.) This stylized economy looks like Figure 1: The downward-sloping line is the marginal product of capital, which is equal (in this model) to the pre-tax rate of return r. The after-tax return is r(1-t), where t is the tax rate. "

105,"The Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president. The shift in the Medicare program’s penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry’s main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve. “It is critical that we have relief,” Mark Parkinson, the group’s president, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump in December 2016. Since 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes — four of every 10 — have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. Medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores. The new guidelines discourage regulators from levying fines in some situations, even when they have resulted in a resident’s death. The guidelines will also probably result in lower fines for many facilities. The change in policy aligns with Mr. Trump’s promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business. Dr. Kate Goodrich, director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials. “Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn’t increase the quality of care they provide,” Dr. Goodrich said. But advocates for nursing-home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient-safety tool. “They’ve pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak,” said Toby Edelman, a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Medicare has different ways of applying penalties. It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation. It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation. Or it can deny payments for new admissions. The average fine in recent years has been $33,453, but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above $100,000, records show. In 2016, Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously. The new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year. In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines, even in the most serious health violations, if the error was a “one-time mistake.” The centers said that intentional disregard for residents’ health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines. A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection, favoring one-time fines instead. Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major violations discovered during an inspection. David Gifford, the American Health Care Association’s senior vice president for quality, said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them. “What was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per-day basis retrospectively,” Mr. Gifford said. But the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per-instance fine of $20,965 even for egregious mistakes. In September 2016, for instance, health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor, a nursing home in Decatur, Ill., for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain-medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen. The patient died. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor $282,954, including $10,091 a day for 28 days, from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors. An administrative law judge called the penalties “quite modest” given the “appalling” care. The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect; if the agency had issued a one-time fine, the maximum would have been less than $21,000. Lincoln Manor closed in September. Its owner could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request. Advocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing. Janet Wells, a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said the changes come as “some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized — finally — at a level that gets the industry’s attention and isn’t just the cost of doing business.” In November, the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months. Homes must still follow the rules, which are intended, among other things, to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems. In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre-emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court. “We publish nearly 11,000 pages of regulation every year,” the agency’s administrator, Seema Verma, said in a speech in October. That paperwork is “taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.” Janine Finck-Boyle, director of health regulations and policy at LeadingAge, a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people, said the group’s members had been struggling to cope with regulations. “If you’re a 50-bed rural facility out West or in the Dakotas,” she said, “you don’t have the resources to get everything done from A to Z.” "
106,"After a year of high- and low-level attacks on the press and the First Amendment, there’s plenty to appreciate in Steven Spielberg’s new movie, “The Post,” which some people around here believe should be called “The Times.” With a focus on the as-yet-untested Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, played by Meryl Streep, “The Post” tells the story of how portions of a classified government study about the Vietnam War made their way into her newspaper. The Post began to run stories based on the top-secret study — which provided evidence that the Nixon, Johnson and Kennedy administrations had lied to the public about the war effort and its chances for success — only after The New York Times published articles quoting from it in summer 1971. The Nixon administration challenged The Times aggressively, accusing it of violating the Espionage Act and winning a temporary court order that blocked the newspaper from publishing more of what became known as the Pentagon Papers. As it casts a journalism era of analog technology and smoky newsrooms in an idealistic light, the movie makes the point that leaking to the news media can be a principled act — a concept that is certainly in order at a time when President Trump and his anti-press supporters equate it with treason. Daniel Ellsberg, a former Marine and military analyst, brought the Pentagon Papers to The Times, and later to The Post, motivated by an all-American notion that the nation’s citizens had the right to know more about what was going on half a world away in a war financed by their tax dollars and fought by so many of their children. Mr. Ellsberg saw it as his patriotic duty to take the documents, which he had painstakingly copied, to the press. As he has said, “Taking an oath as a public servant does not mean keeping secrets or obeying the president — it’s respecting the Constitution.” “The Post” is also a celebration of the keen judgment and courage of Ms. Graham. Her father granted control of the newspaper to her husband upon his death because “in those days, the only possible heir would have been male,” as she wrote in her Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, “Personal History.” But when Ms. Graham’s husband died, control fell to her. And, she wrote, “I did try — in some small ways, some larger — to do something about raising the visibility of women and increasing the sensitivity toward matters of particular concern to them.” That work continues. The women who have bravely shared stories of harassment and abuse at the hands of powerful men this year — whether on film sets or in newsrooms; on factory floors or in congressional offices — stand on Ms. Graham’s shoulders, as do the trailblazing female reporters who drew attention to their plight. Although occasionally apocryphal, “The Post” captures Ms. Graham’s transformation to towering from timid through her decision to publish the classified documents. As she inserted herself and her newspaper into a national controversy, Ms. Graham was in the process of taking The Washington Post Company public. A standoff with the federal government could have proved devastating. And, her legal advisers warned, President Nixon could pressure the Federal Communications Commission to strip The Post of its television-station licenses — a dubious stratagem that he went on to attempt during Watergate. The business dangers that The Times publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger faced were no less treacherous when he made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers. Being first, he “took on far more risk,” the paper’s in-house counsel at the time, James C. Goodale, now 84, wrote in The Daily Beast. “It’s as though Hollywood had made a movie about the Times’s triumphant role in Watergate,” Mr. Goodale added. It is an unfortunate irony that the makers of a film dedicated to the pursuit of truth took dramatic license with Mr. Sulzberger, who died in 2012, in their worthy elevation of Ms. Graham, who died in 2001. In a line from the movie referring to Mr. Sulzberger’s bold decision, the fictional stand-ins for the Times editor A. M. Rosenthal and his first wife, Ann Marie Burke, tell Ms. Graham that The Times’s publisher took the risk only after his Washington bureau chief, James B. Reston, threatened to print the Pentagon Papers in the Vineyard Gazette, the small Martha’s Vineyard paper he had bought a couple of years earlier. While Mr. Reston did make that remark, Mr. Goodale told me, “I don’t think anybody took him seriously.” Mr. Sulzberger, who was known as Punch, published the secret study after reading all of its 7,000 pages. He gave the go-ahead despite his very real assessment that it might land him “20 years to life,” as he put it himself, and over his outside counsel’s refusal to defend the paper if it proceeded. “Punch was absolutely heroic in publishing the Pentagon Papers,” The Times’s lead reporter on the project, Neil Sheehan, 81, told me in a statement. “He was all alone in making his decision. He had the backing of his senior editors like Abe Rosenthal, who was equally courageous. There was a precedent for Kay Graham. Punch had no precedent.” The more important lesson is that, in both cases, family-led newspapers placed their journalistic missions ahead of business imperatives. And they did so under intense governmental pressure, a reminder of the important role that principled family leadership plays in the news business. That has particular resonance in The New York Times Building as Arthur Gregg Sulzberger prepares to take the publisher’s reins from his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., on New Year’s Day, extending the Ochs-Sulzberger family’s stewardship of the paper to a fifth generation. The idea of steadfast news leadership should matter beyond The Times’s offices, given Mr. Trump’s threats against the tax status of Amazon, the company founded by Jeff Bezos, who bought The Post in 2013, and his denigration of the financial performance of The Times, whose subscriptions and stock price experienced double-digit growth in 2017. Both media properties have the protection of their owners — a family, in the case of The Times; and a billionaire, in the case of The Post — who are bulwarks against the blind market forces that would have them turn into clickbait-only versions of themselves. The leadership of the Sulzberger family and Mr. Bezos also provides protection against an executive branch that seems all too willing to punish news outlets that don’t adopt the standards of that Trump favorite, “Fox & Friends.” The president’s other frequent media target, CNN, has no family or billionaire protector at a time when it is at the center of AT&T’s proposed acquisition of its parent company, Time Warner, a deal that the Justice Department has moved to block even as Mr. Trump continues his attacks on the network. Given all this, “The Post” strikes a fitting end note to a tumultuous year for journalism and democracy. Even the debate over whether the movie unfairly credits The Post for one of The Times’s proudest achievements is fitting. The competition between the two news organizations — each now much more than a newspaper — has spurred both of them along. It happened in the 1970s and it happened again in 2017, a golden year for investigative reporting. In deciding in the favor of journalistic freedom in New York Times Co. v. United States, Justice Hugo L. Black wrote in 1971, “Far from deserving condemnation for their courageous reporting, The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly.” For good measure, he added, “Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.” "
107,"A box filled with manure and addressed to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, was left Saturday at his neighbor’s home in the upscale Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, the police told KNBC-TV. Helicopter footage from the station showed the manure spilling onto the ground after the authorities emptied the box, which was covered in Christmas wrapping paper. A Christmas card that referred to Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump was inside the package, which was labeled as coming from “the American people,” KABC-TV reported. The Los Angeles Police Department told the television station KTLA the package contained horse manure. The box raised suspicions and the bomb squad was called to investigate. A Police Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Mr. Mnuchin, who was home at the time, “was made aware of the situation” but was not in immediate danger, Rob Weise, a watch commander with the Police Department, told KNBC. A Secret Service spokesman told The Associated Press that the agency was aware of the episode but declined to comment further. Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager and Hollywood film financier, was confirmed in February as Treasury secretary and helped plan and pitch Mr. Trump’s tax plan. During his time in office, he has come under fire for flying at taxpayer expense on military aircraft for trips that cost more than $800,000. The Treasury Department’s Inspector General reviewed the air travel after Mr. Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, posted a photo on Instagram in August of the couple leaving a government airplane and highlighting  the high-end luxury brands she was wearing. "
108,"NASHVILLE — At least since Martin Luther nailed his theses to the church door in 1517, Christians have disagreed on what Jesus calls them to do in the name of faith. There are nearly 34,000 Christian denominations worldwide, a number that doesn’t account for American Christians — nearly one in six, according to a Gallup poll last summer — who belong to no denomination at all. But as lively as Christian debate can be, the special Senate election in Alabama has exposed how closely conservative Christianity is now in lock step with the Republican Party. I grew up in Alabama, and I don’t doubt the sincerity of my fellow believers on the other side of the political aisle, but when faithful Christians vote for a man credibly accused of child molesting, something is terribly wrong with Christianity. (With white Christianity, that is: Black Christians overwhelmingly supported the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones.) Eighty percent of white born-again Christians voting in Alabama backed Roy Moore, and there is no skirting the damage they’ve done to their own moral standing. The day of the election, the editor in chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli, identified the biggest loser in Alabama: Christian faith itself. From now on, Mr. Galli wrote, “When it comes to either matters of life and death or personal commitments of the human heart, no one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation.” Christianity presents a conundrum for evangelicals considering a monstrous political candidate who is also a Christian. The very foundation of our faith lies in the infinite mercy of a loving God, and it’s hard for an ordinary sinner to cast the first stone. Last year I asked an evangelical friend how she could bring herself to support a presidential candidate like Donald Trump, whose behavior is so at odds with her own. “He says he’s changed,” she said, “and I believe in God’s redemption. If I didn’t, how could I get out of bed in the morning?” I believe in redemption myself, though if I were in charge I think I’d be looking for evidence of repentance, too. And I’d be asking why people so deeply invested in redemption also tend to be so deeply invested in sending their fellow human beings to death row. But I’m trying to understand the country I’ve found myself in since last year’s election, and these days I look hard for common ground. It isn’t easy to find. In her new book “Moral Combat: How Sex Divided American Christians and Fractured American Politics,” R. Marie Griffith explains the divide between liberal and conservative Christians as a casualty of “the sex wars” — disagreements over women’s rights, birth control, abortion and L.G.B.T. issues. By the time the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, she writes, “the rupture between Christian antagonists in the sex wars felt irremediable: one could plausibly argue that Christianity had flat out split into two virtually nonoverlapping religions.” "
109,"Ten years ago, a family arrived in the Bronx from Yaoundé, Cameroon, not speaking a word of English. This Christmas, they are celebrating a feat that would be impressive for any family: Three of the family’s five daughters have been accepted to Ivy League universities. In a year in which our nativist president would have you believe that immigrants are, at best, a job-stealing drain and at worst, criminals, rapists and people with AIDS, these three remarkable sisters are worth paying attention to. Not just because they are inspiring — they are — but because they are far better ambassadors for this country and exponents of its ideals than the 45th president. “We brought the girls to this country because there are better opportunities here,” says Flore Kengmeni, their mother, who works as a nurse. “I don’t know of another country where you can try hard, work hard and get somewhere. Where you are given the opportunity to fulfill your potential.” “This country is built on immigrants,” Francois de Paul Silatchom, their father, a professor of economics at SUNY, starts to say, before his middle daughter, Ella, a sophomore at Yale, interjects: “Our experience as a family is what America is.” That experience is marked by hard work, optimism, resilience and a persistent sense of gratitude even to have the opportunity. All three girls admit it wasn’t easy. They recall sitting in class during their first year in America and not understanding what their teachers and classmates were saying. They remember being made fun of, but not really knowing why. "
110,"MEXICO CITY — Guatemala will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, its president announced on Sunday, becoming the first nation to follow President Trump’s lead in ordering the change, which has been widely criticized around the world. President Jimmy Morales announced the decision in a post on his official Facebook account, saying he had decided to move the embassy after speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. “We spoke of the excellent relations we have had since Guatemala supported the creation of the state of Israel,” Mr. Morales wrote. “One of the most important issues was the return of the Guatemalan Embassy to Jerusalem.” No other country has its embassy for Israel in Jerusalem, although the Czech Republic and Romania are said to be contemplating such a move. Mr. Trump upended decades of American policy with his decision on Jerusalem, aggravating an emotional issue that has festered since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when the Israelis occupied the entire city. The consensus of international law is that Jerusalem’s status is unresolved, that claims of sovereignty by Israel are invalid and that the issue must be settled in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

111,"To the Editor: Stephen Mihm is entirely accurate in his assessment of P. T. Barnum and in his rejection of the common comparison with Donald Trump (“No, Trump Is Not P. T. Barnum,” Op-Ed, Dec. 20). As a showman Barnum was willing to stretch the truth for a public that loved what used to be called “bunk.” But as an original trustee of Tufts University he also endowed its Barnum Museum of Natural History, which opened in 1884. Later additions and more support from Barnum would add biological laboratories and classrooms to what became a center of scientific study on campus. Barnum knew the difference between bunk and science, and he did his best to sustain both. (And, yes, there was room for what remained of Jumbo the elephant in the museum.)

112,"The Israeli intelligence service asked the great psychologist Daniel Kahneman for help in the 1970s, and Kahneman came back with a suggestion: Get rid of the classic intelligence report. It allows leaders to justify any conclusion they want, Kahneman said. In its place, he suggested giving the leaders estimated probabilities of events. The intelligence service did so, and an early report concluded that one scenario would increase the chance of full-scale war with Syria by 10 percent. Seeing the number, a top official was relieved. “Ten percent increase?” he said. “That is a small difference.” Kahneman was horrified (as Michael Lewis recounts in his book “The Undoing Project”). A 10 percent increase in the chance of catastrophic war was serious. Yet the official decided that 10 wasn’t so different from zero. Looking back years later, Kahneman said: “No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” His change of heart is good way to introduce my ritual self-criticism. There is a burgeoning tradition in which columnists devote a year-end column to the errors of our ways. The journalist Dave Weigel calls it “pundit accountability.” I’ll start with some back story: Like the pre-1970s Israeli Army, the news business of old didn’t have much use for probabilities, outside of the weather report. These days, though, probabilities pop up all over. At 10 p.m. on Alabama’s recent election night, The Times said that Doug Jones had roughly a 70 percent chance of winning, based on counted votes. (That scoreboard drew 13 million views.) Likewise, the financial media reports recession odds, and sports websites publish real-time win probabilities. I’m a probability advocate. In previous jobs, I have helped create election scoreboards. Probabilities are more meaningful than safe “anything can happen” platitudes, vague “it’s likely” analyses or artificially confident guarantees. But I’ve come to realize that I was wrong about a major aspect of probabilities. They are inherently hard to grasp. That’s especially true for an individual event, like a war or election. People understand that if they roll a die 100 times, they will get some 1’s. But when they see a probability for one event, they tend to think: Is this going to happen or not? They then effectively round to 0 or to 100 percent. That’s what the Israeli official did. It’s also what many Americans did when they heard Hillary Clinton had a 72 percent or 85 percent chance of winning. It’s what football fans did in the Super Bowl when the Atlanta Falcons had a 99 percent chance of victory. And when the unlikely happens, people scream: The probabilities were wrong! Usually, they were not wrong. The screamers were wrong. I used to believe that the best response was explanation and context. After all, people understand that many outcomes with long odds do happen. “Just because it’s rare,” says the medical expert H. Gilbert Welch, “doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.” You draw an ace (8 percent). A random baby girl grows up to be at least 5’9” (6 percent). New York has a white Christmas (11 percent). In my computer, I’ve got a long list of these unlikely events. But I now think explanation is doomed to fail. For an individual event, people can’t resist saying that a probability was “right” if it was above 50 percent and “wrong” if it was below 50 percent. When this happens, those of us who believe in probabilities can’t just shake our heads and mutter about white Christmases. We have to communicate more effectively. I think part of the answer lies with Kahneman’s insight: Human beings need a story. It’s not enough to say an event has a 10 percent probability. People need a story that forces them to visualize the unlikely event — so they don’t round 10 to zero. Imagine that a forecast giving Candidate X a 10 percent chance included a prominent link, “How X wins.” It would explain how the polling could be off and include a winning map for X. It would all but shout: This really may happen. Welch, a Dartmouth professor, pointed me to an online pictograph about breast-cancer risk. It shows 1,000 stick figures, of which 973 are gray (no cancer), 22 are yellow (future survivor) and five are red (die in next 10 years). You can see the most likely outcome without ignoring the others. Yes, I understand that ideas like this won’t eliminate confusion. But even modest progress would be worthwhile. The rise of big data means that probabilities are becoming a larger part of life. And our misunderstandings have real costs. Obama administration officials, to take one example, might have treated Russian interference more seriously if they hadn’t rounded Trump’s victory odds down to almost zero. Alas, unlike a dice roll, the election is not an event we get to try again. "
113,"WARSAW — It is 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday and the sun is already setting over Warsaw. The hours of daylight here are dictated by the tilt of the Earth, Poland’s position in the Northern Hemisphere and the time of year. But the early time of the sunset is the result of something else. Poland’s fierce desire to be part of Europe after breaking through the Soviet Iron Curtain. For decades, the Soviet Union was on permanent daylight saving time, its clock constantly racing ahead of the sun. The Poles did not want to be told by the Russians when the day would end. Even if it meant putting up with darkness in the afternoon, they would rather be on European time because it meant being part of the European Union. But last week, Poland challenged the very notion of what it means to be part of the bloc when the country pushed ahead with controversial measures to overhaul its judicial system and essentially put the courts under the control of the governing party. The action set off unprecedented censure from the European Union. For the first time, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, used the most powerful threat in its arsenal to try to stop the measure, invoking Article 7 of the European Union treaty, which could strip Poland of its voting rights. It accused the government of trying to undermine core democratic values. President Andrzej Duda signed the measures into law anyway. This is still a nation, however, that wants to stand with the West. Even though the governing party has denounced the European Union’s officials in Brussels as elitist and condescending, it relies on the financial support that membership brings and continues to deepen its military ties with other NATO nations. But not only did the defiance put the direction of Polish democracy at stake, critics of the laws said, it also challenged the very notion of how effectively the bloc can deal with countries that step out of line. If Brussels fails to curb what it sees as behavior that undermines democratic values in Poland, other nations with their own populist leaders, like the Czech Republic and Romania, will be emboldened to chart their own course. Poland is not Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban frequently antagonizes European Union leaders and cozies up to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The dispute with the European Union is a more complex, and uniquely Polish, affair. The crisis has its roots in 1989, when the country became the first Eastern bloc nation to hold partly free elections after decades of bitter and often-deadly struggle. It would take eight more years to create a constitution, one that Marcin Matczak, a professor of constitutional law at Warsaw University, said was “enacted within a post-totalitarian trauma.” “There was a great fear that the government may be too strong and that we could return to the old times,” he said. “Even the preamble of our Constitution says so. We remember the time when our human rights were infringed upon.” Important among its provisions was a clear separation of powers between the courts and the politicians. But when the Constitution was enacted in 1997, no right-wing party was represented, including Center Agreement, a Christian democratic party and the predecessor to Law and Justice, the current ruling party. “They refused to give this Constitution legitimacy,” Mr. Matcza said. Mr. Matczak, a fierce opponent of the legislation signed by Mr. Duda, acknowledged that this lack of inclusion led to a bitterness that still fuels the governing party and its powerful leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Igor Janke, a former journalist who now runs a think tank, Freedom Institute, informally advises members of the government. Mr. Janke, who says he is sympathetic to the governing party, points to these early years of Polish democracy as being at the heart of today’s problems. “When someone tells me we are destroying the judiciary, I say, ‘What judiciary?’” he said. In the 1990s, he contends, many of those guilty of committing crimes against the Polish people escaped justice. He calls them “the red spiders.” Red spiders breed more red spiders, and even though only two of the 80-odd justices on the Supreme Court have ties dating to the Soviet era, their influence is still felt, he said, echoing the party line. Mr. Matczak says he believes something more sinister is at work. When Law and Justice briefly held power before, from 2005 to 2007, its leader, Mr. Kaczynski, found himself stymied by the courts at every turn. He coined a term for what he viewed as obstructionism: prawny imposybilizm, or legal impossibilism. When the party won power again, he said, Mr. Kaczynski “came back wiser and not willing to make the same mistakes.” He added, “They started their actions with removing the legal impossibilism.” The first move was to dismantle the Constitutional Tribunal, which is empowered to review Poland’s laws. They removed unfriendly justices and ensured the once-powerful body was little more than a rubber stamp for the party, Mr. Matczak said. “The mechanics of this attack on the Supreme Court are very similar,” he said. “First, you have an attack on judges.” Mr. Matczak said a close reading of the new laws shows their true intent. “The whole idea behind these two bills is to have full control over the national judiciary council, which has control over appointing judges,” he said. “And if you have control over the selecting committee, you need vacancies.” Age limits create those vacancies on the Supreme Court. He said he feared that the next step for the government would be to use a subservient judicial system to go after both old enemies and political rivals. He pointed to a new provision that allows for something known as a special extraordinary appeal, which would essentially allow any case over the past 20 years to be reopened. “The result of this new legal tool will be over one million cases reopened over three years,” he speculated. Mr. Matczak said he also fears that Mr. Kaczynski and his party plan to create a “fourth republic” — one based on conservative values and purged of pernicious enemies dating back to the Communist era. “He wants to create a new country with new rules,” he said of Mr. Kaczynski. So far, outside the European Union, the reaction has been muted. Just one day after the legislation became law, Poland’s new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, stood side by side in Warsaw with Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, to announce a new defense agreement and a commitment to protecting the rights of the one million Poles in Britain after it leaves the bloc. Mrs. May danced around a question about the battle over the courts. “These constitutional issues are normally, and should be primarily, a matter for the individual country concerned,” she said, expressing the hope that negotiations with Brussels would resolve any outstanding issues. Likewise, the United States has avoided criticizing Poland, and the government here continues to seek the favor of the Trump administration. When the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn Washington’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Poland was among a number of American allies to abstain. That leaves the European Union to wrestle with the consequences of the current crisis. Mr. Matczak, for one, says he sees dark days ahead. “I am ashamed now,” he said. “We were a paragon of transformation of the rule of law. That has all changed.” "
114,"Many of us came into 2017 expecting the worst. And in many ways, the worst is what we got. Donald Trump has been every bit as horrible as one might have expected; he continues, day after day, to prove himself utterly unfit for office, morally and intellectually. And the Republican Party — including so-called moderates — turns out, if anything, to be even worse than one might have expected. At this point it’s evidently composed entirely of cynical apparatchiks, willing to sell out every principle — and every shred of their own dignity — as long as their donors get big tax cuts. Meanwhile, conservative media have given up even the pretense of doing real reporting, and become blatant organs of ruling-party propaganda. Yet I’m ending this year with a feeling of hope, because tens of millions of Americans have risen to the occasion. The U.S. may yet become another Turkey or Hungary — a state that preserves the forms of democracy but has become an authoritarian regime in practice. But it won’t happen as easily or as quickly as many of us had feared. Early this year the commentator David Frum warned that the slide into authoritarianism would be unstoppable “if people retreat into private life, if critics grow quieter, if cynicism becomes endemic.” But so far that hasn’t happened. What we’ve seen instead is the emergence of a highly energized resistance. That resistance made itself visible literally the day after Trump took office, with the huge women’s marches that took place on Jan. 21, dwarfing the thin crowds at the inauguration. If American democracy survives this terrible episode, I vote that we make pink pussy hats the symbol of our delivery from evil. The resistance continued with the town hall crowds that confronted Republican legislators as they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And in case anyone wondered whether the vocal anti-Trump crowds and Trump’s hugely negative polling would translate into political action, a string of special elections — capped by a giant Democratic wave in Virginia and a stunning upset in Alabama — has put such doubts to rest. "
115,"On Tuesday night CBS will air the Kennedy Center Honors, and President Trump will not be on the screen, because he declined to attend the event when it was held on Dec. 3 in Washington. What does it mean that Mr. Trump didn’t have the nerve, for a single night, to be in a room with artists who have criticized him? The president’s team claimed that he did not attend so that the artists could celebrate in peace rather than having a political distraction. But the president votes, as we all do, with his feet. Though the arts have never been neutral politically, the honoring of artists is a bipartisan ritual. The Kennedy Center was a place where the left and the right could agree that the arts occupy a central place in our culture, worthy of our attention and respect. Artists chosen for the Kennedy Center awards generally have fans on the left and the right and everywhere in between. The checkbooks of art patrons are not marked with their party affiliations. I came of age in the culture wars of the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan planned to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, and, instead, ended up whittling down its budget by a small percentage. Still, in 1984, before putting medals on Arthur Miller and Lena Horne among other luminaries, he reflected on the way Americans had developed “a culture that was as fertile as this new land” and had continued to innovate in arts and entertainment. “And today our nation has crowned her greatness with grace, and we gather this evening to honor five artists who have helped her to do so,” he said. I never thought I would be quoting Ronald Reagan to make an argument for the centrality of the arts in American life — but his phrase struck me, during the bizarre cultural moment we are living through: “Our nation has crowned her greatness with grace.” Mr. Trump wants “to make America great again” without dissent and without the arts; but can one truly have greatness without grace? "
116,"At least four times in the past week, the Trump administration has linked financial support for the United Nations to compliance with American demands. First President Trump and his ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, fumed that all countries with seats on the Security Council except the United States had opposed American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and his decision to put the United States Embassy there. Then Mr. Trump dared the General Assembly to follow the Security Council’s example. “Let them vote against us,” he said. “We will save a lot.” When the General Assembly voted 128 to 9 against the Americans, Ms. Haley said she would take names and remember them the next time the United States was asked for financial help from members who disagreed with its stance on Jerusalem. The vote against the United States, she said, would make a difference “on how we look at countries who disrespect us at the U.N.” Then on Sunday, when United Nations members reached agreement on a 2018-2019 budget of $5.4 billion, Ms. Haley issued a statement emphasizing the American role in achieving more than $285 million in cuts, along with hints of more reductions to come. “We will no longer let the generosity of the American people be taken advantage of or remain unchecked,” Ms. Haley said. In future negotiations, she said, “you can be sure we’ll continue to look at ways to increase the U.N.’s efficiency while protecting our interests.” It was certainly not the first time Ms. Haley had hinted at using America’s financial leverage to get its way at the United Nations. When she first took the job last January, she warned that “you’re going to see a change in the way we do business.” And Secretary General António Guterres has said that some parts of the organization must become more efficient. But the link between American largess and political sympathies at the United Nations has been a recurring theme for Mr. Trump, who once described the 72-year-old organization created after World War II as a sad social club that had squandered its potential. Many among Mr. Trump’s base of supporters regard the organization as suspiciously anti-American. When the $285 million budget cut was reported on Monday in Breitbart News, a media group that supports Mr. Trump, reader responses were ebullient, with some arguing that America’s entire contribution should be rescinded. Critics of Mr. Trump’s approach to the United Nations argue that American coercion can work against the United States, by subverting respect for the agreed-upon protocol for financial contributions. They say Mr. Trump should not expect others to follow his lead just because the United States wields the biggest monetary cudgel. “The hallmark of this administration is not paying attention to the benefits that the United States actually gets in a rule-bound system with international institutions,” Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said after the Jerusalem vote last Thursday. “This is not something we can treat in a purely transactional way.” Under a formula tied to economic size and other measurements established under an article of the United Nations Charter, the United States is responsible for 22 percent of the United Nations operating budget, the largest contribution. It paid about $1.2 billion of the 2016-2017 budget of $5.4 billion. The United States also is the largest single financial contributor, at 28.5 percent, to a separate budget for United Nations peacekeeping operations, which totals $6.8 billion in the 2017-2018 budget finalized in June. Then, as now, Ms. Haley took credit for cuts to that budget, which she said had exceeded $500 million. “We’re only getting started,” she said at the time. According to the United States Mission, the reductions in the budget reached on Sunday included across-the-board cuts in expenses for travel, consultants and other operating expenses. It also included tightened rules on compensation and new ways to maximize the use of United Nations headquarters in New York to reduce the need for expensive leased space. Human rights groups reached on Monday reserved judgment on the new budget, saying they needed to see more details on how it might affect the United Nations’ ability to monitor abuses or respond to emergencies — major parts of its work. They also did not necessarily disagree with Ms. Haley’s appraisal of the cuts. But some worried about the potential impact of future reductions. “There’s nothing wrong with increasing efficiency and eliminating waste at the U.N.,” said Louis Charbonneau, the United Nations director at Human Rights Watch. “But it’s crucial that we don’t curtail the U.N.’s ability to monitor, investigate and expose human rights abuses or its ability to save the lives of men, women and children worldwide.” "
117,"NASHVILLE — Tim Vogus, a professor at Vanderbilt University’s business school, was stoking the debate in his classroom one day this fall, asking first-year M.B.A. students about one of the most successful, and controversial, companies of the day. On the syllabus was Uber, a case study in both sensational business success and rampant corporate misbehavior. “A toxic culture might be obvious when you think about Uber,” Professor Vogus said. “But I’m an old person. What is this whole ‘bro’ thing?” There were some awkward chuckles, and then hands started popping up. “It’s carrying fraternity culture with you into adult life,” said one student, Nick Glennon. Another student, Jonathon Brangan, said, “It’s arrogance mixed with the feeling of invincibility.” “You basically have these 20-year-olds who are in charge of these companies that are worth billions of dollars,” said Monroe Stadler, 26. “And they fly too close to the sun.” An M.B.A. education is no longer just about finance, marketing, accounting and economics. As topics like sexual harassment dominate the national conversation and chief executives weigh in on the ethical and social issues of the day, business schools around the country are hastily reshaping their curriculums with case studies ripped straight from the headlines. At Vanderbilt, there are classes on Uber and “bro” culture. At Stanford, students are studying sexual harassment in the workplace. And at Harvard, the debate encompasses sexism and free speech. "
118,"MISSISSAUGA, Ontario — Don Cherry, who can be as loud as the jackets he wears during his weekly “Coach’s Corner” segments on “Hockey Night in Canada,” was worried a year ago that he was losing his edge. He was at risk of becoming a dinosaur, droning on about hockey’s best pugilists when the N.H.L. was turning toward more skill and speed. After careful introspection, and inspiration from his wife, Cherry, 83, has roared back to being Canada’s Lion in Winter and hockey’s most outspoken voice, well into his fourth decade as a broadcaster. “Everyone on television knows more about hockey than me,” Cherry said. “But they don’t know hockey. There’s a difference. They know all the stats, they know all the players, the whole deal. But I can pick out things no one else picks out.” Cherry put himself in precarious positions as a player and as a broadcaster for his uncompromising opinions, making it a practice to thumb his nose at authority. CBC tried several times to fire him, but Cherry came back stronger. And after it was announced in 2013 that Rogers Communications would take over “Hockey Night in Canada” and his detractors predicted his demise, Cherry had another act in him. He has maintained a following of mostly male, hard-core hockey fans even amid the chorus of critics who say he is out of touch with the times. "
119,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • North Korea called the latest United Nations sanctions an “act of war,” and warned that it would continue efforts “aimed at fundamentally eradicating the U.S. nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves.” The sanctions, proposed by the U.S. and adopted on Friday by a vote of 15 to 0, were the third round this year in a continuing effort to force the North to halt its weapons program and resume negotiations. Under the new sanctions, fuel supplies will be drastically cut, and about 100,000 North Koreans working abroad will be expelled within two years. _____ • The Myanmar military’s latest campaign of sexual violence against Rohingya women has been so brutal, a United Nations official said, it amounted to “a calculated tool of terror.” "

121,"President Trump called it proof of the need to build a wall; Senator Ted Cruz said it was a “stark reminder” of insecurity along the border. To everyone, it seemed like a horrendous example of the dangers that border patrol officers face as they cover vast, remote and unforgiving territories. But a month after a middle-of-the-night incident in which one border patrol agent was killed and another, who is said to have no memory of what happened, was severely injured, no one seems to know how the men came into harm’s way off an interstate in West Texas. It was initially thought to be an attack, perhaps by migrants or drug smugglers. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation says it also was possible the men were hurt accidentally. The Culberson County Sheriff, Oscar Carrillo, who is helping with the investigation, seemed to favor that theory when he told The Dallas Morning News that the men could have been hit by a truck driving along the interstate next to where they were found. “If this was an assault, believe me, as sheriff, I’d be the first one out there emphasizing safety in our community and with our deputies, pairing them up,” he told the newspaper. “But from what I know and see, that was not the case here.” That hypothesis has angered the border agents’ union, The National Border Patrol Council, whose leadership fiercely insists that the men were attacked. Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the organization, went as far as to call Sheriff Carrillo a “dingbat” on his weekly podcast. "
122,"In the months leading to the November election, the Working Families Party spent thousands of dollars aiding left-leaning Democratic candidates in dozens of races across the state, often with relatively small amounts in contests for obscure offices. There was the $663 spent on a race for trustee in the Westchester County village of Croton-on-Hudson, or the $1,549 for a candidate running for Monroe County legislator. In taking a hyper-local view of politics, the party, which considers itself to be the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, is trying to lay the groundwork for bigger things. Party officials are focusing on small local races in the hopes of grooming politicians for more high-profile offices, like state legislator or a seat in Congress, while at the same time pushing the Democratic Party to the left. They might take inspiration from the recent house of delegates election in Virginia where a Democratic candidate, Shelly Simonds, gained headlines when she appeared to have won in a recount by a single vote; ultimately, a court declared the race a tie, which will have to be decided by drawing lots. Ms. Simonds’s previous elected position? She is a member of a local school board. Closer to home, Laura Curran, a Democrat who was elected the Nassau County executive in November, in part with support from the Working Families Party, was a county legislator and before that a school board member. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has often worked with the party, also started out as a school board member in Brooklyn. “If you want to build a progressive pipeline of candidates you’ve got to give people some steppingstones,” said Bill Lipton, the party’s New York State director. “They have to learn how to govern. They have to develop a track record.” "
123,"Jimmy Kimmel’s heartfelt monologue about health care; Louis C.K.’s apology for sexual misconduct; Kathy Griffin’s faint at the end of a two-hour-plus set after describing how a Trump joke gone awry put her on the no-fly list. The most memorable moments of the year in comedy were not funny, which is only one of the seeming paradoxes of 2017. Comedians loomed large in popular culture, the tip of the spear in the daily response to the first year of a new presidency, and yet there were strong signs that the boom is on the verge of busting. Netflix reinvigorated the stand-up special, but I’m skeptical that the streaming service’s output produced more classics than in previous years. It’s been a contradictory and uneasy 12 months, and this pointedly idiosyncratic list covers a few of the highlights. BEST COMEBACK SPECIAL This is the year Netflix threw so much money around that star comedians who hadn’t released a special in ages returned. Jerry Seinfeld released his first in 19 years. Dave Chappelle put out two new hours after a 13 year-hiatus, and he unveils two more on New Year’s Eve — that’s four specials in a single year. But no one was funnier than Norm Macdonald, whose verbally dexterous “Hitler’s Dog, Gossip & Trickery,” his first special in six years, cemented his reputation as one of the best stand-ups alive. BEST LIVE SET As soon as Leslie Jones stormed onstage at the Comedy Cellar in July, the room shrunk, her raucous energy and ferocious crowd work making you aware of the low ceilings and echoing acoustics. She ranted about sex, dished about her “Saturday Night Live” co-stars and insulted the patrons in the front row, staring them down during long dramatic pauses, ramping up the tension only to explode it with punch lines. She told some good jokes, but the best parts of this roughly 10-minute set were the riffing and the swagger that make live stand-up the most exciting art in the city. MOST HEARTBREAKING COMEDY For the last four seasons, “Nathan for You” has essentially been an inspired prank show with a mild-mannered consultant giving terrible advice to small businesses. Its star, Nathan Fielder, displayed hints of melancholy, but nothing prepared fans for his wrenching season finale, “Finding Frances.” It centered on a character from an earlier season, a Bill Gates impersonator named Bill Heath, whose lost love from childhood provides the central mystery. What went wrong? Could he get a second chance? Mr. Fielder traveled with Mr. Heath to Arkansas to track her down, while a parallel story involving Mr. Fielder and an escort he falls for, becomes an unlikely romance. The documentarian Errol Morris called it “my new favorite love story.” "
124,"ROME — Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day address on Monday to make clear his concern that serenity is sorely lacking at a time when the “winds of war” and an “outdated model of development” are taking a toll on humanity, society and the environment. Addressing a crowd from a balcony at St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, the pope delivered his Urbi et Orbi — Latin for “to the city and the world” — benediction, which read like a litany of global conflicts and problems. But it was also an opportunity to pray for a positive turn of events, for a resuscitation of a two-state solution in the Middle East to the healing of war-torn Syria and Ukraine, for the easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula to a return to dialogue in Venezuela. In recent days, the pope said on Twitter that a true celebration of Christmas would free the holiday from consumerism and the “worldliness that has taken it hostage!” He has urged the faithful to instead focus on the “fragile simplicity of a new-born baby. That’s where God is.” "
125,"It was a newsy year across the country, filled with hurricanes, shootings, wildfires, marches and more. National correspondents for The New York Times wrote about these events as well as other stories about families and communities grappling with opioid addiction, the federal government’s crackdown on illegal immigration, and on teenagers celebrating prom night. As 2017 nears its close, we checked back in with some of the people we talked to over the past year who stuck with us long after the stories ran: _____ After two of his adult children died of drug overdoses, Roger Winemiller turned back to his land. He sowed another season’s crop of soybeans on his southern Ohio farm, repaired machinery and raced to get the harvest done amid weeks of punishing rainstorms. But grief has shadowed him at every furrow and turn, he said, still as sharp and raw as when his daughter, Heather Himes, and his son Eugene died several months apart after long struggles with heroin addiction. “There’s no medicines that can cure this,” Mr. Winemiller, 61, said. “You just find ways to cope with it and go on with life. There’s no other choice.” He has tried to balance caring for himself and looking after his sole surviving son, Roger Winemiller Jr., who is battling the addictions that killed his siblings. "
126,"There is a popular narrative these days that President Trump is undermining America’s standing in the world and ceding the mantle of global leadership to China. By insisting that America should act like any other country and put its own interests first, these declinists say, Mr. Trump is demoting America to the status of any other country and straining its postwar alliances to the breaking point. Global polls show that Mr. Trump is far less trusted than President Barack Obama was and Mr. Trump’s America is viewed far less favorably than Mr. Obama’s was. A provocateur like Mr. Trump will trigger strong opinions, but opinions are flighty. A president’s character is indeed likely to affect America’s soft power — its cultural and diplomatic influence — while he is in office. It is less clear, however, that any erosion of soft power under Mr. Trump represents a permanent threat to America’s hard power, including its measurable economic and financial strength. Even before Mr. Trump, the declinists cited data showing China gaining a greater share of the global economy at America’s expense, a trend that is easy to exaggerate. America’s current 24 percent share looks much diminished compared with 30 percent in 2000 but about the same as the 26 percent share in 1980. It’s simple to cherry-pick a start date that makes American decline look bad, but the reality is that China is gaining global economic share at the expense mainly of Europe and Japan. America is a tested economic superpower, having survived 21 recessions and a Great Depression since 1900. China remains untested, having suffered not one outright recession since its modern renaissance began around 1980. It has yet to be seen just how well China will weather such a test, which is inevitable for any large economy. China’s rise has already slowed sharply. When the Chinese economy grew at a double-digit pace last decade and its currency appreciated strongly, many forecasters thought it would match the size of the American economy by now. Instead, following a significant slowdown, China is on pace to catch up to the United States by 2030 — and then only if it experiences no major disruptions or further slowdown. Both things are highly possible. At a time when finance increasingly dominates the global economy, America’s influence as a financial superpower is as great as ever. Central banks around the world are always looking for a safe place to park their money, and they usually buy United States assets, typically Treasury bills, which show up as dollars in their foreign exchange reserves. Since 1980, the dollar’s share of foreign exchange reserves has held roughly steady at around 66 percent. This is in part the world’s way of saying it not only trusts the United States to pay its debts but also trusts it more than Europe, Japan and especially China. "
127,"As Nicki Minaj wrote recently in a since-deleted Instagram post: “It’s a great time to be a white rapper in America, huh?” The Billboard chart this week speaks to her point: Eminem, the white rapper against whom all other white rappers are judged, is at No. 1 with “Revival”; at No. 3 is G-Eazy, a West Coast variant who has seamlessly crossed over into pop with “The Beautiful & Damned.” Both debuted with six-figure sales in their first week. Eminem, a stubbornly consistent artist in the musical sense, is also something of a throwback commercially: He can still sell a lot of albums, streaming aside. “Revival” (Interscope), his eighth major-label LP, had 197,000 in traditional album sales (including physical copies and downloads) and added a robust 82 million streams in its first week for a total of 267,000 album equivalent units, according to Nielsen. The album, a self-lacerating work that also takes aim at President Trump, is Eminem’s eighth in a row to debut at No. 1, a Billboard record. G-Eazy went a route more common in hip-hop today, relying heavily on digital streams: “The Beautiful & Damned,” with its hit singles “No Limit” and “Him & I,” sold 68,000 copies and tallied 70 million streams for a total of 122,000 units by the industry’s math. Sandwiched between the rappers at No. 2 is Taylor Swift, whose new album, “Reputation,” spent three weeks at No. 1 but has been kept from landing there more by high-profile releases from U2, Luke Bryan and now Eminem. Ahead of Christmas, Ms. Swift’s album sold another 105,000 copies and had 35 million streams for an equivalent of 133,000 units. Her album remains the only one of the year to top one million copies in pure sales. Two stalwarts round out the Top 5: Ed Sheeran’s “÷” is No. 4 in its 42nd week on the chart, and Pentatonix’s “A Pentatonix Christmas,” initially released last holiday season, is No. 5. Last week’s No. 1, Mr. Bryan’s “What Makes You Country,” fell to No. 8. "

Here’s what you need to know: • Russian election officials barred the opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, above center, from running in the presidential election scheduled for March. The decision was no surprise. “We won’t have an election because Vladimir Putin is horribly afraid,” Mr. Navalny said, calling for a boycott and street protests. Mr. Putin is widely expected to win. _____ • Our correspondents have the exclusive back story on the bizarre November resignation of Saad Hariri, Lebanon’s prime minister. The episode sheds light on the brash style of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. His gamble backfired: It failed to weaken Hezbollah, backed by Iran, and Mr. Hariri remains in office with new popularity. Meanwhile in Syria, the last phase of the U.S. campaign against the Islamic State is relying heavily on warplanes that are focused on an area half the size of Manhattan. _____ • President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has been conducting a vigorous purge within his governing party, pledging a “serious renewal.” Most of those who were pushed out had failed to deliver a yes vote during the April referendum that approved constitutional changes that would give Mr. Erdogan expanded powers if he is re-elected. (Political rivals suggest that Mr. Erdogan may even be preparing to call early elections in July, if it appears that his popularity is slipping.) _____ • Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day address to warn that the “winds of war” and an “outdated model of development” were taking a toll on humanity and the environment. Felipe VI of Spain in his Christmas message sought to calm the Catalan crisis, which, our correspondent writes, is there to stay. And 60 years after her first televised Christmas message, Queen Elizabeth II of Britain offered solace to victims of terrorist attacks this year.

Here are our editors’ favorites. It’s a mystery that endures in Australia. Fifty years ago this month, Prime Minister Harold Holt went swimming at a beach near Melbourne. Mr. Holt, 59, was undeterred by high surf and a minor shoulder injury. He told friends, “I know this beach like the back of my hand.” A friend later said the water around Mr. Holt “appeared to boil” and conditions seemed to “swamp on him.” He was never seen again, and his body was never recovered. A police inquiry the next year determined that it was nothing more than an accident. An inquest in 2005 officially ruled Mr. Holt’s death an accidental drowning. But his disappearance spurred a wealth of conspiracy theories, including that the prime minister had committed suicide or was assassinated by the C.I.A. One even claimed that Mr. Holt was a lifelong spy for China and had faked his death by boarding a Chinese submarine. Those close to him say the sensational manner of his disappearance has overshadowed his legacy. Mr. Holt strengthened Australia’s alliance with the U.S., among others, and he is credited with being the country’s “first 20th-century prime minister.” His legacy also lives on in another, if slightly macabre, way: at the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Center in Melbourne.

131,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea will keep improving its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile capabilities next year to gain leverage to force Washington to make concessions, like the easing of sanctions, government and private analysts in South Korea said on Tuesday. The isolated North has made major strides this year in its nuclear weapons program but has also faced increasingly tough sanctions from the United Nations. On Sept. 3, it detonated what it called a hydrogen bomb in its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. It has also launched three intercontinental ballistic missiles this year, demonstrating rockets powerful enough to deliver warheads to all of the continental United States. After its last ICBM test, conducted Nov. 29, North Korea claimed to have completed building its nuclear force. But the country has yet to clear a key technological hurdle: proving that its warheads can survive re-entry into the atmosphere after flying through space, according to Western officials and analysts. Forecasting North Korea’s nuclear weapons program for the new year, the Unification Ministry in South Korea said on Tuesday that the North “will continue to advance its nuclear and missile capabilities” in 2018 despite its claims about completing its nuclear force. North Korea will conduct at least one more missile test to master the re-entry technology for its warheads, analysts said. But the North also was racing against time to secure full ICBM capabilities before new United Nations sanctions begin squeezing its economy, they said. “Re-entry is a question North Korea must solve to boost its negotiating leverage and for its military and technological purposes,” Shin Beom-chul, a security analyst, said in a report published over the weekend by the government-run Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. “For North Korea, there is a big difference between entering negotiations with the United States after acquiring full ICBM capabilities and starting such talks without them.” North Korea wants Washington to recognize it as a nuclear weapons state. With that status, analysts said, the North would seek arms-reduction talks in hopes of gaining concessions from Washington, such as easing sanctions and reducing the American military presence around the Korean Peninsula. In return, Pyongyang could offer to freeze or give up its ICBMs while retaining the rest of its nuclear capabilities, analysts said. So far, all the North’s three ICBM tests have taken place in the sea between North Korea and Japan. Though the missiles soared to extremely high altitudes, demonstrating their power, they never flew beyond Japan. Analysts warned that in its next long-range missile test, the North could launch a missile on a full ICBM trajectory and even carry a live nuclear warhead to demonstrate its mastery of warhead re-entry technology. “The North’s seventh nuclear test could take place not underground but over the Pacific,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst, in a report published by the independent Sejong Institute of South Korea. In September, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, vowed to take the “highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history” after President Trump threatened to “totally destroy North Korea” if it continued to threaten the United States and its allies. The North’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, later said Mr. Kim might be considering an atmospheric hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific Ocean. The United Nations Security Council has slapped North Korea with four rounds of sanctions this year alone, seeking to deprive the country of key sources of hard currency by banning its exports of coal, iron ore and sea products and phasing out the use of North Korean workers abroad. It also tried to squeeze the North’s fuel supplies by demanding that member nations drastically reduce exports of refined oil to North Korea. From January to November, North Korea’s trade with China, its only major remaining trading partner, declined to $4.7 billion, a drop of more than 10 percent, the Unification Ministry said on Tuesday. Its exports to China plummeted nearly 32 percent in the same period, the ministry said. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two senior North Korean officials for their work on the country’s ballistic missile program. One of the officials, Kim Jong-sik, was reportedly crucial to North Korea’s efforts to develop solid fuel rockets, which are more difficult to defend against because they can be launched quickly. Liquid fuel rockets can take hours to fuel. The other official, Ri Pyong-chol, is said to have played a key role in developing North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, the Treasury Department reported. The sanctions mean that the Treasury Department could, among other things, seize any assets held by the men in the United States. Although it is unlikely that either official owns property or has bank accounts in the United States or other Western countries, the sanctions are intended to increase pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile weapons programs, a campaign that has so far shown no signs of working. American officials say they still favor a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. But top aides to Mr. Trump, including Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser, have indicated that Washington was also considering a military action against the North. Increasingly anxious over possible military conflict, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea proposed this month that his country and the United States postpone their joint military exercises, which were originally expected to start in late February. Mr. Moon said the annual exercises, which North Korea has denounced as rehearsals for an invasion, could be postponed until after South Korea hosted the Winter Olympics in February and the Paralympics in March. Whether the allies will eventually delay the drills depends on whether North Korea conducts any weapons tests in the weeks leading up to the Games, South Korean officials said. Mr. Moon hopes to create a lull in the nuclear standoff during the Olympics and use it as momentum to start talks with North Korea. When North Korea said it completed its nuclear force following its ICBM test in November, some analysts said the North might now be open to stopping its program there and to start negotiating. Reacting to the United Nations’ latest sanctions resolution, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the country “will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence.” But it did not specify any missile or nuclear tests. Instead, North Korea might be preparing for a satellite launch, the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo said on Tuesday, citing an anonymous government source. South Korea saw “nothing out of ordinary at this moment” while it and the United States were closely monitoring for possible provocations from the North, Noh Jae-chon, a South Korean military spokesman, said on Tuesday. North Korea launched a rocket to put a satellite into orbit in 2012 and again in February last year. The United Nations bans North Korea from launching satellites, fearing that the country was using the program as a cover for developing long-range ballistic missiles. "

133,"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. WEST FRANKFORT, Ill. — The first time I came to this small Southern Illinois city, in February, the person I was here to write about — Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco — was nowhere to be found. He was locked up in a Missouri detention facility. Mr. Hernandez had been arrested for being undocumented, amid a national conversation over President Trump’s promises to crack down on illegal immigration. So everything I learned during that visit about Mr. Hernandez — just Carlos to the 8,000 residents of West Frankfort — came from his neighbors here, in a community that had voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump. Their views on Mr. Hernandez felt like a rare chance to look at the complicated, unexpected ways that federal policy was playing out inside one town. In letters to the immigration court that could decide whether he will be deported, influential residents raved about Mr. Hernandez, someone most people in this mostly white coal-mining crossroads had not realized had been living here without papers for about 20 years. West Frankfort’s mayor, Tom Jordan, called him a “great asset” to the city who “doesn’t ask for anything in return.” The fire chief described him as “a man of great character.” The recommendation that may have stuck with me most came from a resident who confided that he really did not like having many people in his life at all but Mr. Hernandez was the rare exception, someone who was welcome at his home for dinner. This month, I returned to West Frankfort. I wanted to know what community leaders like Mayor Jordan were thinking now. And I wanted to meet Mr. Hernandez after hearing all those stories — about how he always asked after peoples’ family members by their names at the Mexican restaurant he managed; how he donated scholarships to the local high school; how he hosted fund-raisers to support local police officers. Mr. Hernandez, who was released on a $3,000 bond in March on the promise he would return to court at a later date, sat at his kitchen table the other day in the trim house he shares with his wife, Elizabeth, and their three young sons. No, he told me, he had not read all those glowing letters about him. He was grateful and humbled when he emerged from several weeks in detention to find out about the avalanche of support. But he was also a little uncomfortable knowing that people had been ticking off stories about acts of charity that he had never meant to be public. He was stunned, he recalled, when he turned on his phone the day he was released from the detention facility. “It was like, ‘Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!’” Emails flooded in from around the world. Supporters wrote to say that Mr. Hernandez’s acts of civic responsibility over two decades should matter more than how he got here from Mexico. Plenty of critics wrote, too: Some said laws were laws and noted that Mr. Hernandez also had two drunken-driving convictions from 2007; some fellow Latinos viewed him as betraying or rejecting Mexico. But in West Frankfort, feelings about Mr. Hernandez seem not to have changed much, and life has moved on. At a panel I moderated inside the city’s old firehouse, I heard from both community leaders and longtime residents that questions about the economy tend to eclipse matters like immigration around here. People seemed more worried about the future of coal, on which the area has depended; about hopes for some new major employer; about whether young people, dreaming of decent jobs, will stay put; about the strain that state fiscal woes have placed on this part of Illinois; and about the flood of drugs that the local sheriff, Don Jones, said had some role in the lives of nearly all 114 inmates in his jail. “I love the coal industry,” said Jim Muir, the county’s circuit court clerk, who spent almost two decades working at a coal mine, starting when he turned 18. “But I don’t think it will ever be back to where it was.” Mayor Jordan said West Frankfort was “built on coal,” and recognized people in the audience who had worked in the mines or were children of those who had. The region’s challenge, most believe, is finding a thriving economic path forward. “We don’t really get involved in a lot of immigration issues in West Frankfort,” Mr. Jordan said. For Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco, though, those questions are far from answered. His next court date has been set for April 19, 2021. It is a date he says he thinks about endlessly. He swerves from miserable (if he is deported, his family will remain here) to hopeful (maybe a judge will allow him to stay). On the one hand, he’s counting down to what he sees as the equivalent of an execution date; on the other, he feels he has been granted precious time.

134,"Home for the holidays after passing the eighth-largest tax cut in United States history, Republicans could be forgiven for reveling in the warm embrace of nostalgia. Who among them won’t raise a glass to Ronald Reagan, a welcome ghost of administrations past, the revered Republican president whose first State of the Union address promised the biggest tax cut ever to “expand our national prosperity, enlarge national incomes and increase opportunities for all Americans”? Speaker Paul D. Ryan might chuckle fondly at Reagan’s tale of woe from a worker in the Midwest — a precursor to Mr. Ryan’s “Cindy”— who made the everyman’s case for a tax cut by complaining, “I’m bringing home more dollars than I ever believed I could possibly earn, but I seem to be getting worse off.” For all the backslapping over a job well done, however, Republicans are proving notably more reluctant to acknowledge the true impact of the tax changes that Reagan wrought. That’s because Reagan’s cuts didn’t quite work as advertised. Gross domestic product grew quickly during his two terms, averaging about 3.5 percent a year, pretty decent compared with the current measly pace. For one in two Americans, though — those in the bottom half of the income pile — income actually shrank on Reagan’s watch. In 1980, the year he was elected, they earned $16,371 a year on average, in today’s dollars, according to the World Wealth and Income Database. By 1988, Reagan’s last year in office, they had to make do with $16,268. Reagan promised to “continue to fulfill the obligations that spring from our national conscience,” to help those who legitimately could not help themselves. But even throwing in the impact of taxes and transfers from all government programs, Americans on the bottom half of the income scale did not fare much better. By 1988, they were taking in $21,614, on average, $8 more than in 1980, after inflation. The sliver of America that did get ahead was, you guessed it, the one at the tippy top: the richest Americans, those in the highest 1 percent of the income distribution. Their earnings grew by about 6 percent a year. Whatever gains that Republican tax cuts have bestowed on the economy in the years since Reagan promised voters a city on a hill, they have all shared the same distributional peculiarities. President George W. Bush passed two rounds of tax cuts, in 2001 and 2003, arguing that the United States had a budget surplus “because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs.” To make his case, in 2001 Mr. Bush deployed the Ramos family of Pennsylvania, which he said would save $2,000 from his first round of cuts. “If we had the money,” Steven Ramos, a school administrator, told somebody on the president’s staff, “it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years’ time.” And yet, during Mr. Bush’s two terms, the average income of the bottom half of Americans slid from $17,827 to $17,473, accounting for inflation. After factoring in taxes and transfers, that sum did increase — 3.5 percent, or about 0.4 percent a year. The bottom half of Americans fared better under President Bill Clinton, who actually raised taxes. On average, their incomes rose by a fifth over his two terms, after taxes and transfers, a gain of over 2 percent per year, after accounting for inflation. Their lot also improved during President Barack Obama’s administration, census data shows. (The series from the World Wealth and Income Database ends in 2014.) Over a 34-year stretch starting in 1980, a period during which the nation’s top income tax rate plunged from 70 percent to as low as 28 percent, settling at just under 40 percent today, the grand Republican promise of faster growth has proved to be, if not necessarily false, at least irrelevant for the very segment of the electorate for which it was directed. In 2014, the economy was 2.5 times larger than it was in 1980, but the bottom half of the population made only 21 percent more, on average, even after including government benefits. America’s middle — families earning more than the bottom 30 percent but less than the top 30 percent — gained only 50 percent in those 34 years. By contrast, the after-tax incomes of Americans in the top 1 percent — families like President Trump’s or Senator Bob Corker’s — tripled. That is less surprising when one realizes that for all the stories about harried workers in the Midwest shouldering an unbearable tax burden, tax relief since Reagan’s fateful State of the Union speech has mostly been aimed at benefiting the well-to-do: The average tax rate for Americans in the bottom half of the income pile was higher in 2014 than it was in 1980. The rate at the top declined. After multiple repetitions, the Republican promise that the road to paradise is paved with tax cuts may have finally lost its power. Only about a third of voters seem to support the current Republican strategy — a much smaller proportion than the one that favored the tax cuts passed in 1981, under Reagan, and 2001, under Mr. Bush. Still, Republicans are having a hard time letting go of Reagan’s message. Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers claimed that the corporate tax cuts proposed by the president would give households in the middle of the income scale a boost of $3,000 to $7,000 a year. Mr. Ryan offered a single mother named Cindy, an assistant manager at a local restaurant who was created by Republican staff members of the House Ways and Means Committee. She makes $30,000 a year, according to Mr. Ryan, and will be mighty pleased with the extra $700 a year she will get from the Republican tax cuts. The question now is whether the actual harried working-class voters who helped deliver Mr. Trump to office buy the story. The president they voted into power did not campaign on a platform of tax cuts for the rich. His latter-day embrace of Reagan’s tax-cutting agenda might strike them as a betrayal. It has been going on for a very long time. "
135,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The fires that ripped across California have produced a round of commentary about the perils that come with living in this state. It is nothing new. California has inspired a whole genre of literature and film over the years: dark and apocalyptic, with a disaster lurking behind every stunning sunset illuminating those late-afternoon winter surfers on the Pacific. “Wildfires are the price Angelenos pay to live in a city that straddles mountains, builds housing into hillsides, and threads communities through brush-filled canyons,” The Atlantic wrote this month. “We pick this poison, in place of living with tornadoes or hurricanes or winter storms where ice falls from the sky and blankets whole regions.” Over the decades, California — in films and books — has been pummeled by earthquakes, tidal waves and fires. It has been invaded by aliens. Film noir has flourished, particularly in Los Angeles, a city that seems perfect for setting dark, creepy and pessimistic films. Why are people picking on California? Well, for one thing, there is some truth here: This state is a place of wildfires, mudslides, catastrophic flooding and earthquakes. “When people come to California and they see the hills decked with poppies — everything is beautiful — they expect this is the norm,” said Mike Davis, a Southern California historian who recently wrote about the fires in a New Yorker essay. “The promotion of California as this paradise is a fundamental misrecognition of the nature of the environment that people live in.” But could there also be a whisper of East Coast resentment — or shall we say schadenfreude — from out-of-state commentators who, understandably, might be irritated by, to use a seasonal example, the cheery “Merry Christmas from the Santa Monica beach!” Instagram posts that pop up this time of year. Some people, as Mr. Davis noted, just don’t love California. "
136,"Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas drew a swift and intense response with a provocative claim on Tuesday: President Trump, he wrote, is similar to Winston Churchill, one of history’s most iconic leaders. Mr. Huckabee had just watched “Darkest Hour,” a film about Churchill. It was, he wrote on Twitter, a reminder of “what real leadership looks like.” “Churchill was hated by his own party, opposition party, and press,” he tweeted. “Feared by King as reckless, and despised for his bluntness. But unlike Neville Chamberlain, he didn’t retreat. We had a Chamberlain for 8 yrs; in @realDonaldTrump we have a Churchill.” Likening modern leaders to Chamberlain and Churchill — something Mr. Huckabee has done before — is always a loaded proposition. Chamberlain, who preceded Churchill as prime minister of Britain, tried to appease Hitler by conceding Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland region to Nazi Germany in the 1938 Munich Agreement, and his name has come to be synonymous with weakness in the face of evil. Churchill, by contrast, was an officer in the British Army during World War I; led Britain through World War II as prime minister from 1940 to 1945; and handled several foreign policy crises in a second term as prime minister from 1951 to 1955. He was known for his skill as an orator and writer, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. So it was unsurprising that the comments by Mr. Huckabee, whose daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is the White House press secretary, stirred up Twitter. “Sure. Churchill served his country 55 years in parliament, 31 years as a minister and 9 as pm,” Kristian Tonning Riise, a member of Norway’s Parliament, wrote in a tweet liked more than 19,000 times. “He was present in 15 battles and received 14 medals of bravery. He was one of history’s most gifted orators and won the Nobel Literature Prize for his writing. Totally same thing.” Mr. Huckabee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday evening. Historians said that while Churchill and Mr. Trump shared certain characteristics, the broader comparison was unsupported. It is true that Churchill made many political enemies before World War II, said Susan Pedersen, a professor of British history at Columbia University. He was also “more self-regarding and less inclined to compromise than most successful British politicians,” she said, and “had a hard-right view of British national and imperial interest.” “He was basically in the wilderness in 1939, and had world history and circumstance not found him, that would have been the end of the story,” Dr. Pedersen wrote in an email. “Luckily for him, and for many of us, his peculiar attributes and the needs of the time came together. But that happened partly because, for all his idiosyncrasy, he had real intellectual and political strengths: He was intelligent, literate, well-versed in history, had long experience in government, and knew what he stood for.” The comparison to Mr. Trump, she wrote, is “ridiculous” — the same adjective David Del Testa, a historian at Bucknell University, used to describe the accompanying comparison of President Barack Obama to Neville Chamberlain. Timothy Riley, director and chief curator of the National Churchill Museum at Westminster College in Missouri, said that Churchill “was bold and passionate about his beliefs” and, much like Mr. Trump, “was not afraid to speak his own mind and ruffle a few feathers along the way.” But for Churchill, Mr. Riley said, “the greatest task, his ‘supreme task,’ was to bring countries together to support peace and prosperity and, during the Second World War, to defeat tyranny.” And Dr. Del Testa said that after World War I, Churchill’s “self-celebratory style” was tempered by a newfound humility. “He was trying to keep Britain strong and create a world order that was strong for Britain, but he was also conscious increasingly in the 1920s and 1930s of a world order that could be destroyed by populist dictators,” he said. “His own tendency toward self-celebration softened when he became aware of the larger world around him, that it really wasn’t a game, but it was humanly important.” Perhaps more significant than any of these specific contrasts, Mr. Riley said, is the timing of Mr. Huckabee’s comparison. It is much too early, he said, to try to draw a comparison between Churchill — whose career in public service spanned more than half a century and two world wars — and Mr. Trump, who has been in office for less than a year. Among the qualities Churchill is known for are “his perseverance, his resilience and his long-term view of history,” Mr. Riley said, and “all of those qualities, I think, are best judged after some time.” "

139,"GOLDSBORO, N.C. — Among President Trump’s worrisome nominees to the judiciary, perhaps none is as alarming as Thomas Alvin Farr, a protégé of Jesse Helms, the former North Carolina senator, and a product of the modern white supremacist machine that Mr. Helms pioneered. Mr. Farr, nominated to serve on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, began his career as counsel for Mr. Helms’s Senate campaigns, where he participated in racist tactics to intimidate African-American voters. This alone is reason to reject his nomination, as is his apparent lying on the topic to the Senate Judiciary Committee. But Mr. Farr’s connections to Mr. Helms’s white supremacist causes and political network go much deeper. Having lived in North Carolina since childhood, I know Mr. Helms’s racist legacy and I hold no doubts that Mr. Farr perpetuates it. An unabashed segregationist, Mr. Helms was affiliated with the Council of Conservative Citizens, an outgrowth of the White Citizens’ Councils that promoted white supremacy. Mr. Helms, who served in the Senate for 30 years, used his honorable seat to support the apartheid regime in South Africa while opposing desegregation, civil rights legislation and the creation of the Martin Luther King’s Birthday holiday in this country. Mr. Helms also belittled Carol Moseley Braun, the only black senator at the time, by singing “Dixie” to her in the Senate elevator. Mr. Farr’s former law partner, Thomas Ellis, was Mr. Helms’s top deputy for decades. He also served as a director of the Nazi-inspired, pro-eugenics Pioneer Fund and used funding from that organization to create and bankroll a network of interlocking organizations to support Mr. Helms and other political candidates who espoused the notion of a superior white race and opposed civil rights. Together, Mr. Helms, Mr. Ellis, and their protégé Mr. Farr unleashed a huge propaganda machine that incited hostility toward African-Americans. Mr. Farr served as a lead counsel to Mr. Helms’s 1990 Senate campaign, which ran the now-infamous “White Hands” TV television ad, designed to inflame white voter anxiety over Mr. Helms’s black opponent, Harvey Gantt. It showed a pair of white hands balling up a rejection letter while a voice said: “You needed that job and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota.” The same campaign also sent more than 100,000 intimidating postcards to North Carolinians, most of whom were blacks eligible to vote, wrongly suggesting they were ineligible and warning that they could be prosecuted for fraud if they tried to cast ballots. Mr. Farr represented the Helms campaign in 1984, when it circulated photos of his opponent, Gov. Jim Hunt, with African-American leaders in an attempt to foster white resentment. The racist nature of that campaign was so pronounced that a federal court cited it as an example of how bigotry in elections continued to flourish in North Carolina politics. A straight line runs from the racial polarization inflamed for decades by Mr. Helms and his political machine to the re-emergence of violent white supremacists in the past year in places like Charlottesville, Va. When Mr. Farr graduated from law school, Mr. Helms and Mr. Ellis brought him into their fold. Mr. Farr joined the small law firm of Maupin, Taylor & Ellis, where all of the named partners were openly hostile to civil rights. Mr. Farr followed those lawyers to other firms and maintained a close collaboration with Mr. Ellis for at least 34 years. Mr. Farr disclosed on his Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire that he spoke “in honor of” Mr. Ellis as recently as 2007. And over decades of association with Mr. Helms and Mr. Ellis, he never publicly denounced or even faintly criticized their notorious racism and belief in white superiority. To the contrary, Mr. Farr worked closely with Mr. Ellis to represent Mr. Helms’s agenda in court. Significantly, he represented several of the Helms entities that received large donations from the Pioneer Fund, including the Coalition for Freedom. Most recently, Mr. Farr has carried on Mr. Helms’s legacy by helping North Carolina’s Republican-led Legislature create and defend in court discriminatory voting restrictions and electoral districts, which were eventually struck down by numerous federal courts that found them to be motivated by intentional racism. In fact, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that the state’s 2013 voter suppression law was aimed at blacks with “almost surgical precision.” African-Americans seeking to have their rights protected under federal law have much to fear if Mr. Farr takes the bench. This is particularly the case in the Eastern District of North Carolina, which covers an area where about half of the state’s African-American residents live and is often referred to as its Black Belt. The Eastern District has not had a black judge in its 145-year history. President Barack Obama’s attempts to desegregate this federal bench were obstructed by Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, who blocked the vote on two highly qualified female African-American nominees and who now supports Mr. Farr’s nomination to the Eastern District. Senators from both sides of the aisle must condemn the experience Mr. Farr brings with him. Having practiced white supremacy for decades, Mr. Farr is not likely to withdraw. Every senator who condemned the racism on display in Charlottesville must vote to prevent it from having power in the federal judiciary. "

142,"To travel the liberal byways of social media over recent weeks was to learn that Donald Trump was on the precipice of axing Robert Mueller and was likely to use the days just before Christmas, when we were distracted by eggnog and mistletoe, to lower the blade. Christmas has come. Christmas has gone. Mueller has not. To listen to Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, the tax overhaul that Trump just signed into law is no mere plutocratic folly. It’s “Armageddon” (Pelosi’s actual word). Their opposition is righteous, but how will millions of voters who notice smaller withholdings from their paychecks and more money in their pockets square that seemingly good fortune with such prophecies of doom on a biblical scale? Some of these Americans may decide that the prophets aren’t to be trusted — and that the president isn’t quite the pestilence they make him out to be. I’m not minimizing Trump’s capriciousness or cupidity. He could yet fire Mueller, the special counsel. Some conservatives’ intensifying attacks on the counsel and the F.B.I. are clearly grist for that. And the tax bill is indeed a messy, fiscally reckless means for Republican lawmakers to please their donors and crow that they are getting big things done. But the end of the world? Come on. That’s not par-for-the-course hyperbole. It’s peculiar-to-Trump hyperventilation, an understandable response to such an indecent president but quite possibly a tactical mistake. It could weaken the odds of hobbling him next fall, in the midterm elections, and of putting him far behind us in November 2020. And that’s where I, for one, want him: in the rearview mirror, growing tinier and tinier as we zoom, pedal to the metal, toward a saner, more dignified horizon. "

That’s when I’m home, which is not much. At night, I hear the foghorn, a reassuring sound, fading slowly like memories. On the road, in yet another hotel room where my hand can’t locate by instinct the light switch, I imagine that sound sometimes. It makes me smile. Home is little things, the clunk of the door closing on your world. There’s a lot going on out my window: joggers on the promenade, barges plowing the East River, choppers landing on the prow of Manhattan, planes nosing down into Newark Airport, cars on the first traffic-free stretch of F.D.R. Drive where hope surges only to collide with reality at a bottleneck. The view always reminds me of a children’s picture book. Yes, my love, that’s a helicopter. I don’t look out on all that enough. Water is life, a mirror one day, a maelstrom the next. Do I live in New York or camp in it? Sometimes I wonder. I resent the inevitable question: How long are you in town for? Forever, I feel like saying. That’s right, the farthest I’m going for the next six months is the convenience store on Montague. Home’s important. Belonging is important, right there behind love in terms of human needs. Watching an old movie on your couch is important. That’s what holidays are for. I watched “Shampoo,” a minor Hal Ashby masterpiece. “You never stop moving,” Jill (Goldie Hawn) tells her feckless hairdresser boyfriend, George (Warren Beatty). “You never go anywhere.” The movie’s set on the eve of Nixon’s 1968 election. A TV blares in the background. There’s Nixon. He says the American flag won’t be “a doormat.” He says “the great objective” of his administration will be to “bring the American people together.” "

Fest’s father, Johannes, was the quintessential ‘good German’ — an educated Prussian Catholic with a rightward political bent — who nevertheless refused to bend a knee (or raise a salute) to Hitler. The result was the loss of his job, social ostracism and penury. Fest, who died in 2006, captured his father’s struggles to preserve the family’s moral integrity and political decency in the face of a regime determined to strip it of both. At one point, in 1936, Fest’s mother pleads with Johannes to join the Nazi Party, despite his hatred of it, just to save her and their children from further hardship. Characterizing his mother’s argument, Fest writes, ‘Untruth has always been the weapon of the little people against the powerful.’ Johannes’s unforgettable rejoinder: ‘We are not little people. Not when it comes to such questions!’ Words to live by for anyone living in politically dark times.” — Bret Stephens, columnist "
145,Good morning. Here’s what you need to know:       
146,"ABOARD A P-3 ORION, over the Pacific Ocean — The Department of Homeland Security is increasingly going global. An estimated 2,000 Homeland Security employees — from Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents to Transportation Security Administration officials — now are deployed to more than 70 countries around the world. Hundreds more are either at sea for weeks at a time aboard Coast Guard ships, or patrolling the skies in surveillance planes above the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The expansion has created tensions with some European countries who say that the United States is trying to export its immigration laws to their territory. But other allies agree with the United States’ argument that its longer reach strengthens international security while preventing a terrorist attack, drug shipment, or human smuggling ring from reaching American soil. “Many threats to the homeland begin overseas, and that’s where we need to be,” said James Nealon, the department’s assistant secretary for international engagement. A surveillance mission earlier this month with Homeland Security agents in drug transit zones near South America highlights the department’s efforts to push out the border. Just after takeoff from a Costa Rican airfield, a crew of agents aboard a Customs and Border Protection surveillance plane began tracking a low-flying aircraft that appeared to be headed south toward Ecuador. The aircraft, which intelligence reports reviewed by agents indicated had no flight plan, flew just a few hundred feet above the ocean — an apparent attempt to avoid detection by radar. “When they are flying that low, they’re probably up to no good,” said Timothy Flynn, a senior detection agent, watching the plane on a radar screen. An hour later, and hiding in the cloud cover to stay out of sight, the American P-3 pulled up behind the plane. An agent with a long-lens digital camera snapped a string of photos of the plane’s tail number and other identifying details. Mr. Flynn radioed the information to authorities in Ecuador who were waiting when the plane landed, arresting seven people and seizing more than 800 pounds of cocaine aboard. Ecuador may embrace the Homeland Security agents, but other allies say the department’s foreign reach is a stretch. In Germany, some lawmakers have questioned the department’s counterterrorism Immigration Advisory Program, where travelers at foreign airports are investigated and sometimes interviewed by plainclothes Customs and Border Protection officers before they are allowed to board flights to the United States. Those American officers can recommend that airlines deny boarding to foreign passengers. A Government Accountability Office report found that the customs officers stopped 8,100 known or suspected terrorists, or individuals with connections to terrorist groups, from traveling to the United States in 2015, the most recent year that data is available. But Andrej Hunko, a member of the Germany’s Left Party, said the actions amount to an extrajudicial travel ban and accused the United States of moving its “immigration controls to European countries.” Canadians flooded their prime minister’s office in August with letters and emails protesting legislation to allow American customs officers stationed at Canadian airports and train stations to question, search and detain Canadian citizens. Unnamed government officials told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the volume of mail received was “unprecedented” and took officials by surprise. The measure passed two weeks ago after Ralph Goodale, Canada’s public safety minister, assured Parliament that the American officers would rarely use their authority to question or detain Canadian citizens. More than 400 Homeland Security employees are stationed in Canada — the most of any foreign country — which Mr. Goodale called a benefit to both nations. “We face shared threats from drug smugglers, terrorists and human traffickers, and we could do things over the phone,” Mr. Goodale said in an interview. “But there are real advantages to being able to meet and talk to people face to face as you deal with these security threats.” In Tanzania, Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators were accused in May of using “Mafia-style” tactics for helping to extradite suspects accused of drug smuggling to the United States before their appeal to block the transfer was concluded. The costs of the Homeland Security operations abroad also have raised questions by critics in the United States. One congressional report found that the cost of stationing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent overseas is about four times as expensive as a domestic post. And in September testimony to the House Homeland Security Committee, the National Treasury Employees Union raised concerns about plans to deploy additional customs officers abroad amid “critical staffing shortages at the nation’s ports of entry.” The union represents 25,000 Customs and Border Protection employees. Lawmakers have asked Homeland Security officials to evaluate the costs and benefits of deploying thousands of employees overseas while the department is looking to hire 15,000 new ICE and border patrol agents in the United States as part of President Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said nearly 1,000 agency employees are stationed abroad, more than from any other a branch of the Department of Homeland Security. They screen passengers at airports, inspect cargo being loaded on ships bound for the United States and train other nations’ customs and border officials. Additionally, a special tactical unit of border patrol agents, known as BORTAC, has worked in nearly 30 countries to train in counterterrorism and counternarcotics missions. Kevin Martinson, the Customs and Border Protection attaché at the United States Embassy in Nairobi, said a training program for Kenyan customs officials and its Rural Border Patrol has led to record seizures of narcotics and other smuggled goods. Mr. Martinson, who coordinates the agency’s efforts in nine African countries, said the training has also helped Kenya secure its borders and guard against groups like the Shabab, a militant organization based in neighboring Somalia. He said the American-trained Rural Border Patrol recently repelled an attack by the extremists and captured one of its assailants. In South Africa, Homeland Security Investigations special agents who are stationed at the United States Embassy in Pretoria have targeted drug smugglers, wildlife traffickers and Nigerian scammers. The agents, who work for a division of ICE, are among 300 investigators in nearly 50 countries worldwide. Steve R. Martin, the special agent in charge in Pretoria, said the unit’s role in a recent operation to arrest Tanzanian drug smuggler Ali Khatib Haji Hassan is a case in point. Investigators first began looking into Mr. Hassan in 2012, after a member of his drug smuggling group was arrested at a Houston airport. Mr. Hassan, who is also known as “Shkuba” and had operated out of South Africa, was designated a major international drug kingpin last year by the Treasury Department. According to court documents and interviews with Homeland Security agents in Pretoria, Mr. Hassan ran a global drug smuggling organization that obtained large quantities of heroin from sources in Pakistan and Iran, and cocaine from South American suppliers. Some of the drugs ultimately ended up on the streets in American cities and were traced back to Mr. Hassan’s organization. He and two associates were arrested by Tanzanian authorities; all three men were extradited to the United States in May and are awaiting trial. “You have to be on the ground and have the relationships with local law enforcement for this kind of case,” Mr. Martin said. “You can’t just parachute in.” Mr. Hassan’s attorney, Hudson Ndusyepo, has said the men were illegally transferred to the United States because their appeal to block the extradition was still pending in front of a Tanzanian court. Mr. Ndusyepo did not respond to requests for comment but told a local newspaper in Dar es Salaam that his client had “not committed any offence in USA.” Operations like the South African drug smuggling case have led the Department of Homeland Security to push to hire more Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents and analysts in embassy attaché offices in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — countries that serve as transit points for drugs and illegal migrants. Customs and Border Protection is also seeking to expand its presence at airports abroad. For all of its foreign-based programs and far-flung employees, the mission of the P-3 surveillance plane may be the Department of Homeland Security program with the longest international reach. The plane patrols more than 42 million square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean — an area almost 14 times the size of the continental United States. Customs and Border Protection maintains a fleet of 14 such surveillance aircraft; they are sometimes airborne for as long as 12 hours in drug transit zones. Last year, the P-3 aircrews contributed to 145 drug seizures, helping American and foreign authorities capture a combined 34,108 pounds of marijuana and 193,197 pounds of cocaine, according to Customs and Border Protection records. On its most recent mission out of Costa Rica, the surveillance crew tracked a small boat off the coast of Colombia. The boat sat low in the water, with three men aboard. William J. Schneider, a P-3 pilot, said the boat was most likely carrying a large load of cocaine as it made its way north toward Mexico, and ultimately to the United States. The Homeland Security agents notified the Colombian navy of its location, but flew on, unable to stop it alone. Mr. Schneider said these missions help in “catching drug loads at their largest.” He continued: “If they make it to the border and get broken down into small packages, it’s much harder to stop.” "

149,"Senator Orrin G. Hatch was named The Salt Lake Tribune’s “Utahn of the Year” on Monday, but the title was not intended as a compliment. The scathing editorial not only called for Mr. Hatch to step down — or for voters to oust him in 2018 — but also stated that he had an “utter lack of integrity that rises from his unquenchable thirst for power.” Mr. Hatch, a Republican, said on Twitter that he was “grateful for this great Christmas honor from the Salt Lake Tribune.” His reaction led many to think that he had not read past the headline, and inspired ridicule online.

150,"It was supposed to be a tax cut for manufacturers. Then it got out of control. World Wrestling Entertainment took it for producing wrestling videos. Regional gas stations claimed it because they mix ethanol with base fuel. Grocery stores asked for it because they spray their fruit so that it ripens. Pharmacies could take it because they have booths that print photos. Republicans in Congress passed that deduction more than a decade ago, and they repealed it in the tax bill signed on Friday by President Trump. It is a lesson in the abundant creativity of American business in interpreting the tax code. The latest overhaul could play out the same way. Already, lawyers and accountants are eyeing several provisions that investors and companies could potentially exploit. The bill, for example, lowers the taxes on so-called pass-through income, which is earned by partnerships and other types of businesses. Congress sold the provision as a way to help smaller companies. But lawmakers added language that allowed big real estate developers to benefit. The result could be a tax break for any company that buys and operates a building for its business. The new law is also supposed to encourage companies to make investments in the United States. But the rules were written in such a way that they could give businesses an incentive to keep their money in foreign countries and build factories abroad. The wildly popular manufacturing break, passed in 2004, is a case study in the unforeseen consequences of changing the tax code — how companies take advantage of gaping holes and force the government to play catch-up. "
151,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump insists that the Affordable Care Act is “essentially” being repealed. But what remains of it appears relatively stable and looks more and more like government-run health care. Tech companies are angling to get a bigger share of the $3 trillion spent on health care each year in the U.S. They’re racing to introduce new tracking apps, sensors and other tools. _____ 2. Small farmers say they’re drowning in federal rules and regulations. We visited Indian Ladder Farms, an orchard in upstate New York that, by our count, is subject to about 5,000 of them. The Ten Eyck family, which has run the orchard for five generations, is hoping for relief from Washington soon. It’s not that they’re anti-rules, they say. They just want them applied in a simpler and smarter way. Above, a worker making cider. _____ 3. New York City’s crime rate is set to hit a record low as 2017 draws to a close. If the trend holds until Sunday night, crime will have declined for 27 straight years. But there’s one area of concern: an uptick in reports of rape and sexual misconduct. The increase coincided with the start of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged victims to come forward. Officials said that an unusually high number of reports were about older incidents. _____ 4. A powerful Israeli official wants to thank President Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital by naming a new train station in the Old City after him. Building the station would require digging beneath some of the most sensitive acreage on earth and would surely draw international criticism. Most of the world does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Old City, which Israel captured in 1967. And in Tel Aviv, the world’s tallest Lego tower is being constructed. _____ 5. Turkey’s leader abandoned a softened approach toward President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, describing him as a mass murderer with no place in the country’s future. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, above right, may have intended his remarks as a message to Mr. Assad’s most powerful ally, Russia. A day earlier, Russia said that Kurdish groups would be included in talks that it’s hosting next month, a move Turkey strongly opposes. _____ 6. In Russia, the Kremlin barred Aleksei Navalny, an anticorruption activist, above, from running for president and warned him against organizing a boycott of the election in March. Mr. Navalny’s exclusion “casts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia and the prospect of democratic elections next year,” the European Union’s foreign service said in a statement. While the Kremlin is clearly afraid of Mr. Navalny, it is unclear exactly what it fears, our correspondent writes. _____ 7. In an interview with Prince Harry for the BBC, former President Barack Obama said he was adjusting to life outside the White House and expressed concern about social media. Here are highlights from the interview. And Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, drew intense response with his claim that President Trump is similar to Winston Churchill. Historians took issue with the comparison. _____ 8. Most chefs vie for a coveted Michelin star. It’s like the Nobel or an Oscar — a lifetime achievement. So why did Jérôme Brochot, a renowned French chef, give his back? He couldn’t afford it, he said. Running a high-end establishment in a modest town made it difficult to draw diners. But now that he’s cut prices and added more down-to-earth dishes, the tables seem to have filled up again. _____ 9. We sat down with Anderson Cooper, left, and Andy Cohen, who will replace the comedian Kathy Griffin during CNN’s New Year’s Eve coverage. We learned that they almost went on a blind date years ago. Now, their bond has become a commodity: They talk about whatever they like before a paying audience on the “AC²” tour. Read excerpts from the conversation. Ms. Griffin was fired in May after she posed for a photo with a fake severed head of President Trump. _____ 10. Finally, in the first year of President Trump’s administration, the role of late-night TV comedians has changed drastically.

154,"The Internal Revenue Service has a message for the homeowners rushing to prepay their property taxes before new rules take effect on New Year’s Day: Not so fast. The tax bill that President Trump signed into law last week sharply limited the itemized deductions for state and local taxes while raising the standard deduction for individuals and couples. Those rules do not take effect until 2018, however. That has led some homeowners, particularly in high-tax, affluent areas, to try to prepay their 2018 property taxes before the deduction disappears. In an advisory notice posted to its website on Wednesday, the I.R.S. said that maneuver could work, but only under limited circumstances. To qualify for the deduction, property taxes not only need to be paid in 2017, they must also be assessed in 2017 — meaning that homeowners who prepaid their taxes based on estimated assessments, or who tried to pay several years’ worth of taxes at once, will probably be out of luck. “Those individuals now are not getting the benefits of those prepayments,” Nicole Kaeding, an economist at the Tax Foundation, said of people who paid taxes that had not yet been assessed. “All that you’ve done is provided an interest-free loan to your municipal government.” It is not clear how many people have tried to prepay their taxes. In Fairfax, Va., hundreds of people lined up to prepay taxes on Tuesday, according to local media reports, and communities in New York, New Jersey and other states have likewise reported a rush of prepayments. Some states have encouraged residents to try to skirt the new cap on state and local tax deductions. Last week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed an executive order paving the way for residents to prepay their property taxes. "
155,"A pop singer filed a police report this week accusing Corey Lewandowski, President Trump’s former campaign manager, of slapping her twice on the buttocks at a party in Washington in November. In a phone interview on Wednesday, the singer, Joy Villa, 31, said she met Mr. Lewandowski for the first time at a party at the Trump International Hotel on Nov. 28 celebrating Mr. Trump’s election the previous year, and the two took a photograph together. After that, Mr. Lewandowski slapped her “violently hard, enough to hurt me,” she said, adding that she told him to stop, and that she could report him for sexual harassment. “He says, ‘Go ahead, I work in the private sector,’” Ms. Villa said. “He laughs at me and then he does it again, extra hard this time, just to show me that he wasn’t afraid. At that point I was so paralyzed by fear. I was very shocked, and my friend grabbed me and pulled me away from him.” Citing her respect for Mr. Lewandowski’s work on the Trump campaign and her fear of bringing shame to his family, Ms. Villa said she did not decide to file a report with the Metropolitan Police Department until she was approached by a reporter at Politico this month. Then, she said, she decided to speak publicly about the episode with the support of her friends and family. "
156,"When Mayor Bill de Blasio is sworn in for a second term on Monday, the oath will be administered by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont — a choice that perhaps reflects the shifting political winds in the Democratic Party. Four years ago, the former president Bill Clinton administered the oath, with Hillary Clinton looking on. At the time, Mrs. Clinton was the smart-money pick to become the next president. That didn’t work out. Along the way, Mr. de Blasio was late to endorse Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, as other progressive Democrats were flocking to Mr. Sanders. After Mrs. Clinton lost to Donald J. Trump last November, Mr. de Blasio consummated his embrace of Mr. Sanders and the Democratic Party’s left wing. Mr. Sanders’s presence may further speculation that Mr. de Blasio has his gaze on goals beyond New York City. Despite criticism, Mr. de Blasio has persisted in seeking a national political role for himself. He has made himself a liberal foil for President Trump, taking him on over issues like immigration and tax policy. Earlier this month Mr. de Blasio traveled to Iowa, where he spoke before Progress Iowa, a group that, like the mayor, wants to steer Democratic politics to the left. He has denied that he plans to run for president, but paying visits to Iowa — the state that traditionally holds the first presidential nominating contest — is a common gambit for presidential hopefuls. “Senator Sanders’ progressive leadership has helped reshape the American political debate in favor of men and women long left out of our city and nation’s prosperity,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement released on Wednesday.

158,"WASHINGTON — Over the past year, the United States has faced immense challenges in its dealings with North Korea, China and Russia, and in its efforts to defeat international terrorism. But Americans should be encouraged by the progress the State Department and United States Agency for International Development have made in pushing for global peace and stability. When President Trump took office, he identified North Korea as the United States’ greatest security threat. He abandoned the failed policy of strategic patience. In its place we carried out a policy of pressure through diplomatic and economic sanctions. This year, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted three of the strongest sanctions resolutions in history, including bans on a wide array of North Korean exports such as coal, iron, seafood and textiles. The United States has asked allies and partners to exert unilateral pressure against North Korea in order to force the regime to change its behavior. Many have responded with positive steps like shutting down trade, severing diplomatic ties and expelling North Korean laborers. Our peaceful pressure campaign has cut off roughly 90 percent of North Korea’s export revenue, much of which is used to fund illegal weapons development. We hope that this international isolation will pressure the regime into serious negotiations on the abandonment of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. A door to dialogue remains open, but we have made it clear that the regime must earn its way back to the negotiating table. Until denuclearization occurs, the pressure will continue. A central component of our North Korea strategy is persuading China to exert its decisive economic leverage on Pyongyang. China has applied certain import bans and sanctions, but it could and should do more. We will also continue to pursue American interests in other areas of our relationship, including trade imbalances, intellectual property theft and China’s troubling military activities in the South China Sea and elsewhere. China’s rise as an economic and military power requires Washington and Beijing to consider carefully how to manage our relationship for the next 50 years. Defeating terrorism remains one of the president’s highest priorities. The administration’s aggressive strategy to counter the Islamic State delegates greater authority to American military commanders on the battlefield, giving our forces more freedom and speed to do what they do best, in partnership with indigenous fighting forces. As a result, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS has accelerated operations and has recaptured virtually all of previously held Islamic State territory in Iraq and Syria. While our military was helping clear Iraq and Syria of Islamic State forces, our diplomats were following up with humanitarian aid and assistance, such as clearing land mines, restoring water and power, and getting children back in school. A commitment to stopping Islamist terrorism and extremism also motivated the administration’s decision to adopt a new South Asia strategy, which focuses on Afghanistan. That country cannot become a safe haven for terrorists, as it was in the days before the Sept. 11 attacks. Pakistan must contribute by combating terrorist groups on its own soil. We are prepared to partner with Pakistan to defeat terrorist organizations seeking safe havens, but Pakistan must demonstrate its desire to partner with us. On Russia, we have no illusions about the regime we are dealing with. The United States today has a poor relationship with a resurgent Russia that has invaded its neighbors Georgia and Ukraine in the last decade and undermined the sovereignty of Western nations by meddling in our election and others’. The appointment of Kurt Volker, a former NATO ambassador, as special representative for Ukraine reflects our commitment to restoring the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Absent a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine situation, which must begin with Russia’s adherence to the Minsk agreements, there cannot be business as usual with Russia. While we are on guard against Russian aggression, we recognize the need to work with Russia where mutual interests intersect. Nowhere is that more evident than in Syria. Now that President Vladimir Putin has committed to the United Nations-backed Geneva political process for providing a new future for Syria, we expect Russia to follow through. We are confident that the fulfillment of these talks will produce a Syria that is free of Bashar al-Assad and his family. Lastly, the flawed Iran nuclear deal is no longer the focal point of our policy toward Iran. We are now confronting the totality of Iranian threats. Part of this strategy entails rebuilding alliances with our partners in the Middle East, and in November we helped re-establish diplomatic ties between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. We will continue to work with our allies and with Congress to explore options for addressing the nuclear deal’s many flaws, while building a like-minded effort to punish Iran for its violations of ballistic missile commitments and its destabilizing activities in the region. I am proud of what our State Department and Agency for International Development teams around the world have accomplished this year, and our progress will continue in 2018 and beyond. To that end, we have undertaken a redesign of the State Department to strengthen our teams’ ability to deliver on our mission. Our redesign doesn’t involve simply shifting boxes on an organizational chart. Our changes must address root problems that lead to inefficiencies and frustrations. By making changes like streamlining our human resources and information technology systems, better aligning personnel and resources with America’s strategic priorities, and reforming duplicative processes, we are giving our people more opportunities to flourish professionally and spend more time confronting the global problems they have dedicated their careers to solving. When I wake up each morning, my first thought is, “How can I and my colleagues at the State Department use diplomacy to prevent people around the world from being killed, wounded or deprived of their rights?” In spite of the challenges, I remain optimistic about the power of diplomacy to resolve conflicts and advance American interests. My confidence comes from the knowledge that our efforts are carried out daily by patriotic and dedicated State Department employees who make sacrifices to serve with patience and persistence and who, by advancing democratic values the world over, are protecting our citizens’ rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. "
159,"George Wayne has a theory about why his celebrity column was a hit at Vanity Fair for more than two decades: sex. “When you read my interviews, I want you to have a good laugh and I want you to learn something you didn’t know about these people before,” he said as he dipped his spoon into a bowl of butternut squash soup over lunch in Chelsea recently. “So, of course, I am always going to ask about sex. That’s my No. 1.” Mr. Wayne, 54, was born in Jamaica and earned a degree in journalism from the University of Georgia before moving to New York. In 1984 he started his own magazine, R.O.M.E., a do-it-yourself collection of interviews he photocopied on paper and bound together with tape. He met Andy Warhol and, after the artist died, became an associate editor at Mr. Warhol’s Interview. Later, Mr. Wayne caught the eye of the media scion S. I. Newhouse Jr. and was named one of the first contributing editors at Allure magazine. But it was at Vanity Fair that Mr. Wayne (who calls himself G. W.) found his niche as a celebrity chronicler. “I interviewed Fabio,” he said. “He was my very first interview at Vanity Fair.” His interviews are sass with a dose of shock and often a bit raunchy. (He once asked the comedian Milton Berle if he still had orgasms.) Mr. Wayne described a 1993 encounter when he was invited to attend the opening of the first Western club in Moscow. “They flew over a motley crew of fabulous New Yorkers,” he recalled. “It was me, André Balazs, Martha Stewart and Gael Greene.” Mr. Wayne met a man in Pushkin Square — a boxer in training, he said — who he invited to his hotel. The writer decided to stay a few extra days. “Martha Stewart’s jaw dropped,” Mr. Wayne said. “She said, ‘Why are you staying? Are you kidding me?’” She had a point. Violence erupted in Moscow after Boris Yeltsin, the president, sought to disband the Russian parliament and seize control. “I turned on CNN after having the best sex with this Russian boxer and there is a coup taking place in the country,” Mr. Wayne said. "
160,"PARAMUS, N.J. — On a back wall in Gurbir Grewal’s office, three portraits of Japanese-Americans detained at the Manzanar internment camp in California hang above his desk, a reminder for Mr. Grewal of when the power of domestic law went horribly awry. Though the portraits are from decades ago, Mr. Grewal sees alarming parallels to the current political environment, where patriotism is sometimes measured by race, faith or political affiliation. The notion to combat this type of injustice has helped inspire Mr. Grewal, a Sikh, throughout his career, an arc that has seen him rise through the ranks of the federal justice system and now has him poised to become New Jersey’s top law enforcement official. If, as expected, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature approves his appointment by the governor-elect, Philip D. Murphy, Mr. Grewal, 44, would become the first Sikh in the United States to hold the position of statewide attorney general. “It’s important for someone like me to do this job that’s front-line law enforcement, to show people that you don’t have to look a particular way to love this country,” he said in an interview. Mr. Grewal made his mark in criminal justice with significant federal convictions in financial and cybersecurity crimes, including a case involving two Russian hackers named Drinkman and Smilianets, who oversaw a network that stole more than 160 million credit card numbers. But in today’s political climate, attorneys general in Democratic states are increasingly being viewed as checks on Trump administration policies. Just across the Hudson River, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, has been an aggressive challenger to many of the policies coming out of Washington. Mr. Grewal said that he received a congratulatory call from Mr. Schneiderman this month, and that he looked forward to a “collaborative relationship,” though he refrained from saying whether he would join in any pending cases, only allowing that he would make such decisions when he takes office. While Mr. Murphy promised to not pressure or interfere with Mr. Grewal, partisan entrenchments have largely transformed the position of statewide attorney general, ostensibly an apolitical position, into an inherently political one. Mr. Grewal, the current Bergen County prosecutor, said he wasn’t concerned about politics. “Yeah, I mean, but so what?” Mr. Grewal said when asked about whether taking action contrary to Washington could be construed as political. “Because you’re seeing people today, it’s just unconscionable, that their loyalty and their patriotism is being questioned because of what they look like, where they come from, what they believe. And, you know, that’s the same thing we did in 1942. That’s why I have those pictures on the wall.” For Mr. Grewal, the appointment, which would place him in charge of the state police force and the state’s prosecutors, also fulfills a local-boy-makes-good tale: He is a New Jersey native, born and raised in Essex County. He understands the state’s problems, aside from the policies coming out of Washington; Mr. Grewal has laid out key areas that he wants to focus the might of New Jersey’s authority on: addiction, violent crime, police-community relations and social justice issues. He plans to put in place methods he honed in Bergen County, such as partnering with high schools to address hate crimes and addiction. Concerned about a surge in bias and hate crimes among teenagers, especially racist bullying on social media apps like Snapchat, his office has tried to work with children and teenagers. He noted that the training and partnering with schools and programs for youth was a bit unconventional for a prosecutor’s office, but he pointed to its preventive intention. “We’ve gone outside of our lane as a law enforcement agency to address that because we know where that leads,” he said of hate and bias. “We don’t want that to lead to some sort of criminal conduct, as we’ve seen that in this county — we’ve seen attacks on synagogues, arsons and things of that nature and so we’re trying to get in there early.” Mr. Grewal was hired by Paul J. Fishman, then the United States attorney in New Jersey, as an assistant United States attorney in 2010. He had previously spent about four years in a similar position in Brooklyn. While he began in New Jersey in the smaller general crimes unit, he quickly progressed to take on some high-profile cases. He prosecuted a first-of-its-kind case against Aleksandr Milrud, who was accused of manipulating stocks through high-speed trading, and he helped secure the conviction of Eliyahu Weinstein, who led a $200 million real estate fraud. In 2016, Mr. Grewal, a Democrat, was appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, to officially take over the prosecutor’s office in Bergen County, the most populous in New Jersey. His rise to the state attorney general’s office also reflects the growing Asian Indian population in New Jersey. The state has the highest percentage of people with Asian Indian backgrounds in the country, according to the Census Bureau’s 2015 American Community Survey. In 2017, Hoboken elected Ravi Bhalla as the first Sikh mayor of a major city in New Jersey, and Vin Gopal became the first Indian-American to be elected to the State Senate. Nonetheless, despite the expanding population, national Sikh groups were surprised by the sudden representation in public offices in New Jersey. “There hasn’t been that many Sikhs in politics, particularly ones with turbans and beard,” said Gurwin Singh Ahuja, executive director of the National Sikh Campaign, but he added that this was beginning to change. “New Jersey is certainly leading the pack, but there have been Sikhs being elected across the country,” such as a city councilwoman in Kent, Wash., where in March a turbaned Sikh man was wounded by a masked gunman. Mr. Grewal said he had also been on the receiving end of prejudice and injustice. “Growing up, I was called so many variations of the N-word that it just confused me,” he said. His ethnicity does not define him, he said, but he is acutely aware that his presence in the courtroom — suit and tie, turban and beard — is freighted with meaning in a world where emerging acceptance still vies with underlying racism. It was just after the Sept. 11 attacks when Mr. Grewal, then a lawyer in private practice, was constantly harassed by a man who would wait outside the office to shout, “I’ve found him, I’ve found bin Laden!” Enraged but also embarrassed, he said he began to develop creative ways to leave the office, slinking out back doors and leaving at odd hours. But this eventually grew both tiresome and unacceptable. He decided it was time to do something. “As a lawyer, you know, the options in front of me at that point were to become a prosecutor,” he said. “So I made it my sort of goal to get into U.S. attorney’s office just so I can get up in front of a jury looking the way I do and say, ‘I represent the United States.’” "
161,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to revise its nearly 17-year-old standard for dangerous levels of lead in paint and dust within one year, a rare legal move that amounts to a sharp rebuff of President Trump and Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator. The decision also called attention to the persistent threat of lead paint to children in millions of American homes, four decades after the federal government banned it from households. “This is going to protect the brains of thousands of children across the country,” said Eve C. Gartner, a staff attorney for Earthjustice who helped argue the case on behalf of groups pushing for tougher standards. “It’s going to mean that children that otherwise would have developed very elevated blood lead levels will be protected from the damage associated with that, assuming E.P.A. follows the court order,” she said. The 2-to-1 decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, means the E.P.A. must propose a new rule within 90 days, instead of the six years the Trump administration had requested to reconsider what levels of lead exposure are acceptable for children. That request was on top of a six-year delay under former President Barack Obama, a holdup the court said was unreasonable, particularly in the face of new research on the hazards of lead paint. “Indeed E.P.A. itself has acknowledged that ‘lead poisoning is the number one environmental health threat in the U.S. for children ages 6 and younger,’ and that the current standards are insufficient,” the ruling said, adding, “The children exposed to lead poisoning due to the failure of E.P.A. to act are severely prejudiced by E.P.A.’s delay.” A spokesman for the E.P.A. said the agency was reviewing the court’s decision, and declined to say if the agency planned to appeal or seek review in the Supreme Court. The ruling is the latest legal setback to efforts by the Trump administration to delay or roll back Obama-era regulations it maintains are overly burdensome. In July, a federal appeals court ruled that the E.P.A. must enforce the implementation of methane emissions rules that the agency had sought to delay. A month later the agency reversed a decision to delay putting into effect a rule requiring more stringent air quality standards. Activists hailed Wednesday’s court ruling and called it long overdue. Zakia Rafiqa Shabazz of Richmond, Va., who founded United Parents Against Lead, an advocacy group, called the ruling “a win for children.” But Ms. Shabazz said her 23-year-old son still suffered from the effects of elevated lead levels found in his blood as a young child in 1996, and said the lack of action through two administrations to strengthen lead standards had been frustrating. “That’s the hurtful thing, how many children could have been prevented from suffering the pains of lead poisoning,” she said. The E.P.A. set standards in 2001 for lead contamination levels in dust and soil in homes. Environmental and health groups including United Parents Against Lead and Earthjustice petitioned the agency in 2009 to tighten standards on lead in dust and soil as well as paint to “more adequately protect” children. The E.P.A., then under Mr. Obama, acknowledged the need for stricter rules in 2011 and agreed to take action, but never did so and set no timelines for developing a new rule. Ms. Gartner said the Obama administration never gave a good reason for its delays. “They never contested that the standard needed to be updated,” she said. “They just didn’t prioritize protecting kids from lead.” Petitioners in August 2016 asked the appeals court to find that the E.P.A. had unreasonably delayed a new rule. Then, the Trump administration told the court it expected to take another six years to issue a new regulation. “They already had six years,” Ms. Gartner said. “It’s taken more than a decade to update the standard for how much lead can be in dust before it’s considered a hazard and needs to be cleaned up.” The judges on Wednesday issued a writ of mandamus, an unusual court order that requires an official or agency to perform a certain duty, in this case for the E.P.A. to issue a proposed rule within 90 days and finalize it within a year after that. The judges said in doing so they were mindful of the agency’s arguments that officials needed more time to deliberate a complex new standard. “We must observe, however, that E.P.A. has already taken eight years, wants to delay at least six more, and has disavowed any interest in working with petitioners to develop an appropriate timeline through mediation,” the ruling said. Meanwhile, the court said, the risks to children from lead poisoning under standards the E.P.A. has already called insufficient are “severe.” Judge Mary M. Schroeder, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, wrote the opinion for the three-judge panel, and was joined by Judge Lawrence L. Piersol, a Bill Clinton appointee who was filling in on the court. Judge N. Randy Smith, appointed by George W. Bush, dissented. “I do not understand why the E.P.A. has not acted,” he wrote, but he argued that only Congress, not the courts, could mandate that the agency do so. The judges noted that the court had issued a similar order in 2015 to force the E.P.A. to take action one way or another on a pesticide, chlorpyrifos, after the agency had taken eight years to consider a petition from environmental groups to ban the substance. Mr. Pruitt wound up denying that petition in March, an action the court said complied with its order. Something similar could happen in the lead case, environmental activists acknowledged. But they said they hoped the E.P.A. would finally toughen the standards. “It is time that the E.P.A. stop stalling and taking prolonged amounts of time to do the right thing,” said Ms. Shabazz. A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics in 2016 found that — despite decades of work to reduce lead in paint, dust and water — about 3 percent of children around the country exhibit high levels of the metal in their blood. The problem is particularly acute in parts of the Northeast: The regions with the largest proportions of blood specimens with the highest lead levels were in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to the study. The E.P.A. said in a statement that lead exposure remained a significant health threat to children. “EPA will continue to work diligently on a number of fronts to address issues surrounding childhood lead exposure from multiple sources,” the agency said. "
162,"JERUSALEM — In the uneasy days after President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, some Israelis who cheered the move paid homage — and taunted outraged Palestinians — by posting doctored photos of the Dome of the Rock with the president’s surname plastered across it, as if one of Islam’s holiest shrines had been reduced to the latest gold-plated Trump property. Now, a powerful Israeli cabinet minister is offering to express his gratitude by putting Mr. Trump’s name on a proposed new train station in the Old City, one that would bring thousands of tourists directly into the Jewish Quarter just a few hundred yards from the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. The minister, Yisrael Katz, who has responsibility for both transportation and intelligence, has built a can-do reputation for seeing through a wide range of infrastructure projects; he also has designs on the prime minister’s office. Although he has been promoting the idea of a railroad stop in the Old City for over a year, he said on Wednesday that it was now a priority, calling it the “most important national project being advanced today at the ministry of transport.” Mr. Katz said he planned to name it for Mr. Trump “for his courageous and historic decision” and his “contribution in the strengthening of the status of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people and the state of Israel.” But the plan, which would require digging beneath some of the most sensitive acreage on earth, is sure to invite more international criticism, not to mention further antagonize Palestinians. Despite Mr. Trump’s change in United States policy, announced this month, most of the world does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Old City, which Israel captured along with the rest of East Jerusalem in 1967. The United Nations General Assembly voted 128 to 9 last week to condemn Mr. Trump’s decision. Ahmad Tibi, a leading Arab member of the Knesset, called Mr. Katz’s proposal “part of the chain reaction to the Trump speech,” which he said had set off “a competition among ministers over who will be more extreme regarding the matter of Jerusalem.” "
163,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’re looking back on our climate coverage from 2017. We started the New York Times climate team this year and we want to thank you for being a part of our extended family. We traveled to Antarctica, Iceland and Alaska, and to Mexico City, Jakarta and Houston. We wrote about melting ice, hotter summers and water crises. We covered a new president, international climate talks and natural disasters. We collected our biggest stories of the year in a feature called “2017: The Year in Climate.” But we also asked five of our reporters and editors to pick one of their favorite things they worked on, large or small. Here are five memorable stories from Henry, Claire, Brad, Nadja and Hiroko. Some of my favorite stories this year involved traveling to exotic places like Iceland and the Alaskan tundra. But there’s one story that really stands out because it was so different. I was in Florida in early September, helping with coverage of Hurricane Irma. Two days before the storm was forecast to hit, I got a call from John Broder, one of my editors. There had been a strong earthquake in Mexico overnight, and between that, the string of hurricanes and the wildfires blazing in the West, some of the top editors at the paper wanted a story that asked: What the heck is going on with the world? My first thought was that it would be interesting to be the person who writes the story for The New York Times that says the apocalypse has arrived. So I hopped in my rental pickup and drove until I found a shady spot with good cell reception, and spent the next couple of hours in the truck calling scientists, sociologists, religious environmentalists and others. And with the help of Benedict Carey from the science department and with deft editing from John, we produced this story. Which then led to this video. (And no, it wasn’t the End Times — yet.) This one-question “quiz” by Lisa Friedman was one of the first things I helped edit when I started at The Times this year. I can’t take credit for the concept, but I think it’s a fun (to the extent that the “apocalypse beat” can be) way to play with assumption versus reality. It also sparked in me a slight obsession with this problem and its possible solutions. Take the quiz and join me in losing sleep over it. Here’s an overlooked bit of research that stuck with me this year: To help various species fend off extinction, scientists in Brazil are trying to stitch together fragments of rain forest that have been carved up by roads and logging. I liked the idea of helping endangered golden lion tamarins find love in the jungle in order to keep the species going. And it was a good reminder that, as neat as solar panels and electric cars are, not all solutions to environmental crises involve fancy new technology. It may be hard to remember now, especially if you’re enjoying a snowy holiday season, but last summer was a scorcher across much of the world. In Europe, a heat wave grew so intense it was dubbed “Lucifer.”  In Arizona, planes were grounded because of extreme heat. In Pakistan, temperatures approached 130 degrees Fahrenheit. A question that comes up often is whether such events are “normal” or influenced by climate change. While we couldn’t say much at that time about those specific events, this project provided a broader context. Using data from Columbia University, my colleague Adam Pearce and I showed how summer temperatures considered “extreme” in the middle of the 20th century have become much more common. You can see the shift toward hotter temperatures as the orange and dark-red areas expand on the right side of the bell curve. The visualization highlights how even modest changes in average temperatures, brought about by global warming, can have big consequences in the extremes. As Todd Sanford, director of research at Climate Central told me, it also provides “a glimpse to what’s in our future.” I loved reporting on this story about “no till” farmers in Kansas who may not talk about climate change but who are thinking deeply about sustainable farming methods nevertheless. I later heard from Doug Palen, the farmer featured in this story, that he’d received letters from readers from across the political divide, thanking him for his efforts and even apologizing for assuming that farmers don’t care about the environment. It seemed to raise hope that there’s room for constructive dialogue on specific climate change issues, even in an age when conversations around the subject have become highly partisan.

164,"To the Editor: “An Honor For Artists, Trump-Free,” by Sarah Ruhl (Op-Ed, Dec. 26), about this year’s Kennedy Center honors (sans Potus), struck me as particularly poignant. Few things represent the best of America, or are as well loved internationally, as our artists. Even during the divisive years of the Reagan and Bush II administrations, politics could be laid aside to celebrate the best of our creative geniuses. As I enjoy the peacefulness that a rare Christmas snowfall has brought to the Pacific Northwest lowlands, I think about the state of our country and how the current occupant of the White House cannot even bring himself to lay down partisanship for an evening to celebrate these exemplars of America’s greatness. MARY ANN KAE, SEATTLE "
165,"Like many Jewish journalists who reported on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, I spent the 2016 election being harassed by a motley crew of internet racists who coalesced around the future president. They sent me threats, photoshopped me into gas chambers and hurled an uncreative array of anti-Semitic slurs my way. A study by the Anti-Defamation League found that I’d received the second-most abuse of any Jewish journalist on Twitter during the campaign cycle. My parents didn’t raise me to be No. 2; fortunately, there’s always 2020. As a result, I’ve become something of an unintentional expert on alt-right trolls and their tactics. For the most part, these characters are largely laughable — sad, angry men hiding behind images of cartoon frogs, deathly afraid that their employers will uncover their online antics. But there are also more insidious individuals, whose digital skulduggery can be more consequential than the occasional bigoted bromide. And so last November, in the wake of Trump’s victory, I decided to turn the tables on them. My target? Impersonator trolls. You probably haven’t heard of these trolls, but that is precisely why they are so pernicious. These bigots are not content to harass Jews and other minorities on Twitter; they seek to assume their identities and then defame them. The con goes like this: The impersonator lifts an online photo of a Jew, Muslim, African-American or other minority — typically one with clear identifying markers, like a yarmulke-clad Hasid or a woman in hijab. Using that picture as a Twitter avatar, the bigot then adds ethnic and progressive descriptors to the bio: “Jewish,” “Zionist,” “Muslim,” “enemy of the alt-right.” False identity forged, the trolls then insert themselves into conversations with high-profile Twitter users — conversations that are often seen by tens of thousands of followers — and proceed to say horrifically racist things. In this manner, unsuspecting readers glancing through their feed are given the impression that someone who looks like, say, a religious Jew or Muslim is outlandishly bigoted. Thus, an entire community is defamed. This deception is relatively simple, but it is disturbingly effective. Most casual users aren’t likely to reverse image-search a troll’s avatar to see if it was stolen from someone else or peruse the account’s other tweets and realize that it only shares racist material. Twitter lacks the cultural competency to police such impersonators, even if it were interested in doing so. So I set out to unmask them. I asked my own Twitter followers whether it might be possible to create a bot that would reply to these impostors and expose their true nature to any users they tried to fool. Neal Chandra, a talented developer in San Francisco whom I’ve never met, replied, “I can try to throw something together this evening.” And so, after a week of testing, Impostor Buster was born. Using a crowdsourced database of impersonator accounts, carefully curated by us to avoid any false positives, the bot patrolled Twitter and interjected whenever impostors tried to insinuate themselves into a discussion. Within days, our golem for the digital age had become a runaway success, garnering thousands of followers and numerous press write-ups. Most important, we received countless thank-yous from alerted would-be victims. The impersonator trolls seethed. Some tried changing their user names to evade the bot (it didn’t work). Others simply reverted to their openly neo-Nazi personas. A few even tried to impersonate the bot, which was vastly preferable from our perspective and rather amusing. Then the problems began — but not from where you might expect. The Nazis realized they couldn’t beat the bot, so they started mass-reporting it to Twitter for “harassment.” Just as they duplicitously cast themselves as minorities, they disingenuously recast our response to their ongoing abuse as harassment. Twitter sided with the Nazis. In April, the service suspended Impostor Buster without explanation and reinstated it only after being contacted by the ADL’s cyber-hate team. Over the next few months, we fine-tuned the bot to reduce its tweets and avoid tripping any of Twitter’s alarms. As the trolls continued to report the bot to no avail, we thought the problem was resolved. But we were wrong. This month, Twitter suspended the bot again, and this time refused to revive it. The company’s justifications were both entirely accurate and utterly absurd. “A large number of people have blocked you in response to high volumes of untargeted, unsolicited, or duplicative content or engagements from your account,” we were informed. This was true; Impostor Buster had been blocked by many neo-Nazis. “A large number of spam complaints have been filed against you.” Yes, by neo-Nazis. “You send large numbers of unsolicited replies or mentions.” Yes, to neo-Nazis. The real threat, apparently, was not these trolls — who today continue to roam the platform unchallenged — but our effort to combat them. The great irony of this whole affair is that Impostor Buster was doing Twitter’s job for it. The platform has been notoriously prone to abuse since its inception and has struggled to curb it. Rather than asking Twitter to provide a top-down solution, however, we created a bottom-up one. We used Twitter’s tools to police itself — until Twitter fired the sheriff. If the platform is going to rescue itself from the trolls, it will need to foster these efforts, not fight them. Given the terabytes of data uploaded daily to platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, it is simply unfeasible to expect them to effectively regulate their content. It is also unwise, because we should not trust giant corporations governed by profit motives rather than the public interest to decide what we can and cannot say on the internet. But perhaps more important, the top-down approach is wrong because it assumes that the problem of bigotry and abuse is something we can simply sweep under the rug through better censorship, rather than by building a better online community that actively sidelines bigots and abusers through self-policing and collective norms. Ultimately, the only way to fix social media is through nurturing a healthier culture below, not imposing diktats from above. The vast majority of users are not racists and can be mobilized through communal projects like Impostor Buster — a bot built by two people on different coasts using a database compiled by users around the world — to marginalize those who are. The problem with Twitter, in other words, wasn’t too much Impostor Buster. It was too little. The sooner companies like Twitter understand this, the better off we’ll be. "
166,"To the Editor: Re “The Looting of America’s Public Lands” (editorial, Dec. 10): To the shockingly long list of assaults on public lands and the environment by President Trump and his administration, add the effort by Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, to repeal and replace the Clean Water Rule. The rule protects small streams and wetlands, which contribute to the drinking water supply of one in three Americans. In the past, efforts to undermine protection of the environment have been rejected by the American public. Exploitation of public lands in the late 19th century helped usher in the Progressive conservation era of Theodore Roosevelt. Americans rejected the extremism of Interior Secretary James Watt and the E.P.A. administrator, Anne Gorsuch, in the Reagan administration. The Trump administration poses an even graver threat. Once again, Americans must rise to defend our rivers, our cherished public lands and the environmental heritage we owe our children and grandchildren. WM. ROBERT IRVIN, WASHINGTON The writer is president and chief executive of American Rivers. "
167,"Hurry, you have just a few more days to ensure a spot for your tweets in the collections of the Library of Congress. After archiving every single public message posted on Twitter since the social media platform was introduced in March 2006, the institution will soon scale back its approach to collecting them. Starting on Jan. 1, 2018, the library will apply the same selective discretion to tweets that it uses for other documents, collecting and archiving material around themes or events of consequence. The move, announced in a Tuesday blog post, brings to an end an ambitious effort, which began in 2010 when Twitter donated its full archive of public tweets to the library. “The Twitter Archive may prove to be one of this generation’s most significant legacies,” the library said in a document detailing the decision. “Future generations will learn much about this rich period in our history, the information flows, and social and political forces that help define the current generation.” Twitter has come a long way since one of its founders, Jack Dorsey, posted the first tweet on March 21, 2006. Today, many organizations, celebrities and politicians, including President Trump, view it as a crucial tool for reaching their audiences. The service has also shrunk the distance between the anonymous and the famous, the frivolous and the serious. The most-liked tweet of 2017 was a quotation about unity posted by former President Obama in the wake of the white supremacist violence this summer in Charlottesville, Va. And the most retweeted message was a plea from a teenager on a quest for a year’s worth of free chicken nuggets. Make of that what you will. The library’s decision, the result of a continuing evaluation of its practices, was driven by a number of factors, from the difficulty of maintaining the collection to the waning need for a comprehensive archive, the library said. Now that it has nearly 12 years’ worth of tweets in the collection, the library suggested that it had largely fulfilled its original goal of documenting the rise and evolution of Twitter. “With social media now established, the Library is bringing its collecting practice more in line with its collection policies,” it said in the document. The move was also driven by practical concerns, including both the difficulty in archiving the huge amount of data on Twitter and the fact that the library has only ever collected the text of tweets even as they have become increasingly visual. Twitter has also grown exponentially in the years since the library started its collection. That year, 2010, about half a billion tweets were posted every two weeks. In November, that many were sent each day. The messages are now longer: The company recently doubled its limit for tweets to 280 from 140 characters. Such complications have plagued public access to the archive, too, which is limited while the library works to find a cost-effective and sustainable way to open the archive to the public. "
168,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Apple, Google, Microsoft and other tech giants have transformed the way billions of us communicate, shop, socialize and work. Now they’re going after health care, too. Tech companies are scrambling to make tracking apps, sensors and other tools. It’s part of an effort to get a bigger share of the $3 trillion spent each year on health care in the United States. Separately, the Affordable Care Act — the U.S. health law that has been under attack by Republicans — appears to be relatively stable and increasingly government-funded. _____ "
169,"LONDON — It was a case of the famous interviewing the famous. The BBC aired an interview on Wednesday that was unusual in at least a couple of respects: The man answering the questions was former President Barack Obama, and the man asking them was his friend Prince Harry. The prince took the seat as a guest editor for BBC Radio 4’s flagship program, “Today,” and broadcast a long-awaited interview in which he questioned the former president about the day he left the White House, his work since leaving office and his plans for the future. Neither party mentioned President Trump by name, but Mr. Obama’s successor was never far from the conversation. The two men discussed the risks of using social media and the corrosion of civil discourse. The interview was recorded in Toronto in September, when Prince Harry and Mr. Obama met during the Invictus Games, a sporting competition for injured military members and veterans. The highlights of the interview: Since leaving office in January, Mr. Obama has more time on his hands. He gets to wake up later, spend more time with his family and take control of his day, something he says he couldn’t do as president. But the things that are important to him have not changed. Now that he no longer has the authority that came with being president, Mr. Obama said he relies on persuasion rather than legislation. “A lot of the things that still motivate me and move me continue to this day,” he added. While neither man mentioned Mr. Trump directly, they discussed the role of social media in leadership, a conversation that brought to mind Mr. Trump’s blunt, unvarnished posts on Twitter. "
170,"The Trump administration has long applied a double standard to the violence in Yemen, the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It fiercely condemns Iran for supporting the indigenous Houthi insurgents and allegedly supplying them with short-range ballistic missiles and other weapons. At the same time, it has nothing bad to say about (and is indeed enabling) Saudi Arabia’s savage bombing in support of Yemen’s government — an air campaign that is worsening a civilian death toll among a population already suffering from a famine and cholera. That Iran is providing the Houthis with missiles and other weapons has not been proved. If the charge is true, Iran could be in violation of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution barring it from selling or transferring certain weapons outside the country without Security Council approval. It would also deserve condemnation for escalating a crisis that could elevate what is already a proxy war between two of the region’s major powers — Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim nation, and Shiite Muslim-led Iran — into direct conflict. For the moment, however, Saudi Arabia’s bombing campaign and its blockade of Yemen’s major ports and airports are the main drivers of the crisis. The United States has provided the Saudi-led coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates and other Persian Gulf states, with precision-guided munitions, intelligence and refueling capability. At a recent press conference at a military base near Washington, Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, conspicuously ignored America’s involvement. Among the props displayed were pieces of what Pentagon officials claimed were Iranian-made Qiam missiles, including one allegedly fired by Houthi militants at an airport in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, last month. Not a word was said about Saudi-American cooperation in the war, and officials, in response to basic questions from reporters, were unable to prove their charges about the source of the missiles. The purpose of this dog-and-pony show — the Pentagon declassified the weaponry for the occasion — was to reinforce the administration’s campaign to rally international support for punishing (and perhaps, someday going to war against) Iran on grounds that Tehran is largely responsible for destabilizing activities in the region. The whole performance was eerily reminiscent of Colin Powell’s presentation to the Security Council as secretary of state in 2003 (which he later came to regret) of the case for war against Iraq, in which he accused Iraq of hiding weapons of mass destruction. Iran, though sympathetic to the Houthis, provided limited support for the war effort until 2015, when Saudi Arabia, determined to do whatever was necessary to check Tehran’s influence, began the first of more than 15,000 airstrikes, killing thousands of civilians and turning the Yemen fighting into a proxy war. With Yemen dependent on imports for most basic needs, Saudi Arabia tightened the siege further last month by imposing a land, sea and air blockade after a missile allegedly fired by the Houthis came close to Riyadh. Despite all this, the Saudi-led coalition has failed to defeat the Houthis, who now control the capital, Sana. Meanwhile, the toll on Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East, is mounting: Some 10,000 people have died, eight million are at risk from famine and nearly one million have contracted cholera. President Trump, eager for close ties with the new Saudi leadership, has largely turned a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis. The administration has been under mounting pressure from members of the Senate who have threatened to cut aid to Saudi Arabia and who delayed until Dec. 19 the confirmation of Mr. Trump’s pick for State Department legal adviser, Jennifer Newstead. It also is being pushed by international aid and human rights groups to persuade Riyadh to stop the carnage. There are other pressures as well. Ms. Newstead told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Saudi Arabia could be violating American and international law by restricting the flow of humanitarian aid to Yemen. Human rights advocates have called for imposing United Nations sanctions on Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, and other coalition officials directing the Yemen war. There are signs the administration is beginning to listen and even exert a constructive influence on the Saudis, who last week said they would open the main port of Hudaydah for 30 days so humanitarian aid can flow. Even so, a long-term solution to the war will take far more than that. For starters, the Saudis could fully lift the blockade and challenge the Houthis and the Iranians to join in an immediate unconditional cease-fire. This is just the sort of opening Mr. Trump could be urging; if he has the kind of relationship with the Saudis that he boasts about, he might get them to listen — and save countless Yemini lives in the bargain.

172,"The warning bell is ringing on China’s global effort to suppress Western values and undermine the freedoms enjoyed in the world’s democracies. Beijing has baited some of America’s leading corporations with offers of access to its giant consumer market. In return, the likes of Apple and LinkedIn have agreed to play by China’s rules and submit to what amounts to censorship. On American college campuses, accepting money from the Beijing-backed Confucius Institute has come at the price of academic freedom: There are mounting concerns that the language and cultural centers financed by the institute prohibit discussion on issues that place China in a critical light. Elsewhere, Beijing has been accused of pulling the strings of Western democracies. In Australia, Chinese businessmen with ties to the Chinese Communist Party have donated millions of dollars to the country’s two leading political parties in an effort to shape domestic and foreign policy. A rising political star, Sam Dastyari of the opposition Labor Party, announced his resignation from the Senate in the face of allegations that he was peddling Beijing’s positions for financial support. But what might first appear to be signs of Beijing’s rising power are proving to be strategic missteps for China. Beijing is overreaching and starting to burn bridges across the West and in the developing world. "
173,"It’s hard to be out with Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen. Neither blends in. They are hugely recognizable, both appearing on television five nights a week, and when they’re spotted together, people stop in their tracks. Throughout a recent lunch at Cafe Cluny, they were approached by fans of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen,” his talk show on Bravo; the actress Julianne Moore; and a woman thanking Mr. Cooper for a hurricane relief segment on “Anderson Cooper 360,” his CNN show. “I paid her to do that,” Mr. Cooper said. “We’ve produced this entire afternoon.” In their less famous days, a high school friend of Mr. Cooper’s tried to set them up on a blind date. It was 1995, and Mr. Cooper had recently moved from Los Angeles back to New York for a job at ABC News, and Mr. Cohen was a producer at “CBS This Morning.” The date never happened, but a friendship eventually did. Their bond has now become a commodity. Their “AC2” tour, in which they talk about whatever they like before a paying audience, continues at the Beacon Theater in New York on Jan. 26 and 27. And on New Year’s Eve, Mr. Cohen will join Mr. Cooper to host CNN’s telecast from Times Square — replacing the comedian Kathy Griffin, who was fired in May after posing for a photograph while holding a Donald Trump mask bloodied with ketchup. “I hope she gets back to doing what she does best,” Mr. Cooper said. “We wish her the best.” Over tea with milk for Mr. Cohen, 49, and scrambled eggs with toast for Mr. Cooper, 50, the pair discussed first impressions, dancing at the Roxy nightclub, lost luggage and Panda Express. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. ANDERSON COOPER We had a phone call to set up the date. I was in my office at ABC News. ANDY COHEN I remember being home when I made the call, on Horatio Street. I was excited. COOPER Within 45 seconds, he said, “Your mom is Gloria Vanderbilt.” COHEN So bad. I wanted to date the Vanderbilt boy. COOPER I imagined him on a Bluetooth headset, walking around, gesticulating a lot. COHEN By the way, you weren’t exactly Mr. Personality on that call, either. COOPER No, I wasn’t. I was very depressed. It was a bleak time. I was trying to figure out my way at ABC. I started as a one-man band; a guy I worked with when I was a fact-checker made a fake press pass for me, and I borrowed a camera and started going to wars. I’d been working at Channel One for three years. I’d never worked at a network. I didn’t know what I was doing. We never had the date. COHEN We started running into each other at the Roxy. He would be dancing around. COOPER I wouldn’t be dancing around. I was like, that’s the guy who said, “your mom is Gloria Vanderbilt.” COHEN We both knew Barry Diller, and we wound up in this group that would travel together, him and his friends. COOPER DVF — Diane [von Furstenberg]. Billie Lourd, she was very young. Sandy Gallin. COHEN We went to Turkey. COOPER I remember going up some waterway in a slow-moving boat, talking to you, sort of entranced. Andy, even before he was on TV, was the life of the party. COHEN I thought he was a little standoffish. But I liked making him laugh. That was my goal: Maybe I can crack this guy up, and that’s where we can come together. COOPER He did this whole “Maniac” dance. COHEN Oh, yes, from “Flashdance.” We were on the boat, it’s a very fast dance, and I was barefoot. Didn’t I cut my foot? COOPER It made me giggle uncontrollably. That’s the first time I remember being like, “You’re funny.” COHEN Then we would have dinner occasionally, or be at the same party. We went to Croatia in 2005. I was at Bravo then. COOPER I started working later at night, so our chances for hanging out were limited. COHEN Our shows are so different, but we have commonalities because we’re both on every night. I worked in news —— why are you laughing? Excuse me, I worked at CBS News for 10 years. COOPER You absolutely did, but the advice you would give me was not —— I was in Croatia with him when I got the call about Hurricane Katrina. I turned to Andy and said, “I gotta go,” and, Andy, as a newsman, what was it you said? COHEN I said: “This is ridiculous. They just want you outside at some rainstorm so they can get ratings.” COOPER Needless to say, I was on the next flight out. But one of the things I don’t think Andy has gotten enough credit for is he’s been an openly gay man in this industry from the very beginning. I was out at work —— COHEN He was out to everybody. Everyone at CNN knew your partner. COOPER And I was out at the Roxy. COHEN Yeah, with your flaming-white hair, like Katniss Everdeen. COOPER It was more about not discussing it publicly. But I told you I was going to be making a statement. COHEN He never asked me for advice, but we did talk about it. COOPER I don’t think there’s anything I’ve not discussed with him. It’s nice to have someone who pokes fun at you. If I’m in a dangerous place, he’ll text me something funny. COHEN I do get worried when he’s like, “I’m on my way to Egypt.” I’m like: “Are you kidding me? When are you coming home?” You’re not eating your eggs. Do you not like them? COOPER No, I like them. COHEN Are you going to eat your toast? COOPER I’m going to nibble. COHEN Do you want some jelly? COOPER No. COHEN He is a very fussy eater. We were in the Dallas airport two weeks ago. Tell what you were eating for breakfast. COOPER Panda Express. COHEN He was eating orange chicken at 9 a.m. It was so gross. COOPER We took a trip to Brazil five years ago. It was me; my partner, Benjamin [Maisani]; a friend of ours; and Andy. I brought them to Trancoso, this town I’d always heard about. I booked the hotels, I booked the flights — the one thing I asked Andy to do was check the bags in. COHEN I lost Anderson’s luggage. It was terrible. COOPER That was the first time I’ve ever gotten angry at Andy. And when I get angry, I get silent. COHEN Prickly ice-cold monster. You have to navigate his moods. I know exactly when to stop talking to him. COOPER We’re both sensitive in reading other people’s emotions. I know instantly when he’s lost interest in a conversation on the phone. We work all the —— see, he’s checking —— COHEN I’m rolling my sleeve up. COOPER I think he was secretly about to check his watch. COHEN No, I wasn’t. Look, you know people when you travel with them. It’s intimate. COOPER When his second book came out, he asked me to do an interview with him at the 92nd Street Y. My agent was in the crowd, and she was like, “You guys should take this on the road.” COHEN We looked at each other, and, immediately, were like, “Oh, my God, we can travel the country together.” COOPER We’ve done 30-something shows. COHEN New Year’s will be a good continuation. It’s going to be really fun. Amy Sedaris is coming by. We’re going to play games. COOPER We want people to feel like they’re hanging out with us for a night. COHEN I’m going to bring alcohol. COOPER I would expect nothing less. COHEN Just so you know. COOPER I’d rather not know the details. "
174,"ALTAMONT, N.Y. — For eight weeks every fall, Indian Ladder Farms, a fifth-generation family operation near Albany, kicks into peak season. The farm sells homemade apple pies, fresh cider and warm doughnuts. Schoolchildren arrive by the busload to learn about growing apples. And as customers pick fruit from trees, workers fill bins with apples, destined for the farm’s shop and grocery stores. This fall, amid the rush of commerce — the apple harvest season accounts for about half of Indian Ladder’s annual revenue — federal investigators showed up. They wanted to check the farm’s compliance with migrant labor rules and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets pay and other requirements for workers. Suddenly, the small office staff turned its focus away from making money to placating a government regulator. The investigators arrived on a Friday in late September and interviewed the farm’s management and a group of laborers from Jamaica, who have special work visas. The investigators hand delivered a notice and said they would be back the following week, when they asked to have 22 types of records available. The request included vehicle registrations, insurance documents and time sheets — reams of paper in all. Over the next several days, the Ten Eyck family, which owns the farm, along with the staff devoted about 40 hours to serving the investigators, who visited three times before closing the books. "

177,"MOSCOW — After a sharp escalation in fighting this month between the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists, the two sides took an unusual break from shelling each other on Wednesday to carry out their biggest exchange of prisoners since the conflict began in 2014. The prisoner swap — involving 73 Ukrainians held captive by the rebels, and more than 200 separatists captured by Ukraine — was carried out without serious incident just days after the Trump administration agreed to provide weapons to Ukraine. That move, Russia says, will only escalate a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people. The prompt release of all prisoners was a key part of a 2015 peace agreement brokered by France, Germany and Russia in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. But like many other parts of the Minsk deal, it has gotten bogged down in accusations on each side that the other was not fulfilling its obligations. The two sides have swapped prisoners on numerous prior occasions, but Wednesday’s exchange was the biggest transfer of captives on a single day, Ukrainian officials said. The Ukrainian security agency, known as the S.B.U., said on Wednesday that a total of 3,215 Ukrainians captured by the rebels since 2014 had now been released and that 103 remained in captivity in rebel-held territory, with dozens more held prisoner in Russia.

180,"It would be easy to end 2017 with the impression that, whatever its afflictions, it was at least a game-changing year for feminism. “The Female Revolution Is Here” and could “Smash Patriarchy at Its Core,” social and mainstream media headlines declared. “We are blowing the whistle on the prime directive of the master/slave relationship between women and men.” “This is the end of patriarchy” — this from Forbes! — “the male domination of humanity.” Twitter, the newsstand and the street concur: This year witnessed a transformational moment in American sexual politics. Surely the results of the #MeToo phenomenon are worthy. It’s a seriously good thing Harvey Weinstein is gone and that the potential Harvey Weinsteins will think twice or thrice or a thousand times before harassing women whose fortunes they control. But “the end of patriarchy”? Look around. This month, President Trump signed into law a tax bill that throws a bomb at women. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act systematically guts benefits that support women who need support the most: It means an end to personal and dependent exemptions (a disaster for minimum-wage workers, nearly two-thirds of whom are women). An expiration date for child-care tax credits and a denial of such credits for immigrant children without Social Security cards. An end to the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. And, barely avoided, thanks to Democrats’ objections: an enshrinement of “fetal personhood” in the form of college savings accounts for unborn children, a sly grenade lobbed at legal abortion. Not to mention that Republican congressmen plan to pay down the enormous federal deficit the bill will incur by slashing entitlements that, again, are critical to women: Medicaid (covering nearly half the births in the nation and 75 percent of family planning), Medicare (more than half of beneficiaries 65 and older — and two-thirds of those 85 and older — are women) and so on. And that’s on top of all the other Trump administration insults: reviving the global gag rule on abortion, suspending tracking of the gender wage gap, deep-sixing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order and much more.

182,"WASHINGTON — President Trump was already revved up when he emerged from his limousine to visit NATO’s new headquarters in Brussels last May. He had just met France’s recently elected president, Emmanuel Macron, whom he greeted with a white-knuckle handshake and a complaint that Europeans do not pay their fair share of the alliance’s costs. On the long walk through the NATO building’s cathedral-like atrium, the president’s anger grew. He looked at the polished floors and shimmering glass walls with a property developer’s eye. (“It’s all glass,” he said later. “One bomb could take it out.”) By the time he reached an outdoor plaza where he was to speak to the other NATO leaders, Mr. Trump was fuming, according to two aides who were with him that day. He was there to dedicate the building, but instead he took a shot at it. “I never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost,” Mr. Trump told the leaders, his voice thick with sarcasm. “I refuse to do that. But it is beautiful.” His visceral reaction to the $1.2 billion building, more than anything else, colored his first encounter with the alliance, aides said. Nearly a year into his presidency, Mr. Trump remains an erratic, idiosyncratic leader on the global stage, an insurgent who attacks allies the United States has nurtured since World War II and who can seem more at home with America’s adversaries. His Twitter posts, delivered without warning or consultation, often make a mockery of his administration’s policies and subvert the messages his emissaries are trying to deliver abroad. Mr. Trump has pulled out of trade and climate change agreements and denounced the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. He has broken with decades of American policy in the Middle East by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. And he has taunted Kim Jong-un of North Korea as “short and fat,” fanning fears of war on the peninsula. He has assiduously cultivated President Xi Jinping of China and avoided criticizing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — leaders of the two countries that his own national security strategy calls the greatest geopolitical threats to America. "
183,"New York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation. Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much. There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend. The corrosive culture of money in big-time college sports — more than $8 billion a year among the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Division I sports programs — was painfully obvious recently with the indictments of college coaches and an Adidas executive charged with paying bribes to recruit basketball players and steer them to agents. It was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.” The tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency. "
184,"To the Editor: Bret Stephens (“Tax Bill Hysteria,” column, Dec. 22) argues that the Democrats won’t do well attacking the new tax bill because “in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center, 91 percent of middle-income filers will get a tax cut, averaging close to $1,100. That’s real money.” But Mr. Stephens overlooks the debit side of the bill. The money may be real, but it’s entirely inadequate to cover the losses many of those middle-income earners will incur. How much health care will $1,100 buy them when they find that, with the individual mandate repealed, the new premiums become unaffordable? How many credit hours at college will it buy their children if colleges reduce financial aid to cover the cost of endowment taxation? Just how secure will Social Security and Medicare remain as the government makes cuts to reduce the skyrocketing deficit? If Democrats clarify the high and painful costs of the new bill, I think that their attacks can be very effective indeed. GAIL POOL, SANIBEL, FLA. To the Editor: As Bret Stephens and the Republicans crow about lowering corporate tax rates to get them in line with other developed countries, they don’t mention that all of those countries have a higher personal income tax rate that helps guarantee the public a variety of benefits. These include health care, a comfortable retirement and a general sense that the individual’s health and welfare are indeed a shared responsibility administered by the government. "
185,"To the Editor: There has been much discussion about the word of the year. I believe that word should be “diminished.” In 2017 we witnessed President Trump’s destructive comments on North Korea, on Israel, on NATO, on Nafta, on the United Nations, on the Paris climate accord, on the nuclear deal with Iran, on the very idea of immigration. In 2017 we watched as Mr. Trump filled the seat rightfully that of Judge Merrick Garland with Neil Gorsuch, and stacked the federal bench with those most willing to do his bidding. In 2017 we saw the gutting of our State Department, leaving it woefully understaffed, our diplomatic capabilities in tatters. In 2017 we recoiled as our environmental laws were overturned, and we forced each state to be the protector of our lands and the air we breathe. In 2017 we were informed that our rich are not rich enough, our poor can get still poorer and the sick ever sicker. In 2017 we learned how tenuous our hold was on the truth, how unrepentant the president is for his mountain of baldfaced lies. In 2017 we were horrified as the party in power shut its eyes and genuflected before the most pernicious, immoral excuse for a leader this country has ever witnessed. In 2017 we were outmaneuvered and outplayed by China and Russia as they watched and waited for the next inevitable opening. In 2017 we have been, in so many arenas and on so many levels, in our eyes and in the eyes of those around the world, diminished. ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM, FORT LEE, N.J. "

187,Good morning. Here’s what you need to know:        
188,"RICHMOND, Va. — It was the electoral nightmare Virginia never wanted to experience: being host to a high-profile mess like the 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, with officials obsessing over questionable ballots as political power hangs in the balance. So 17 years ago, the state began writing a guidebook on how to handle such situations. The latest edition includes pictographs of ballots marked in unconventional ways — names crossed out, several boxes checked, “My guy” scrawled over a candidate’s name. Despite the best intentions to avoid a Florida-style snafu, that is where Virginia now finds itself, with lawyers fighting over how to interpret one questionable ballot. And at stake is possible control of the Legislature. “This is right up there with Bush v. Gore in my opinion in terms of the unbelievable sequence of events that have led us to where we are,” said Rebecca Green, co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary School of Law in Williamsburg. Professor Green called the Virginia predicament “the son of hanging chad,” a reference to Florida’s failed punch-card ballots from 2000. The Supreme Court stopped the recounting of contested ballots, declaring George W. Bush the next White House occupant. On Tuesday, a court filing halted a previously scheduled name-drawing from a silver pitcher to break a tie between David Yancy, a Republican, and Shelly Simonds, a Democrat, in House District 94. If a three-judge panel affirms the questionable ballot is a vote for Mr. Yancey — as it did once before — the race would be deadlocked at 11,608 votes each, and a drawing of lots would be back on, as state law requires. If the ballot is thrown out, Ms. Simonds would be the winner by a single vote, and 17 years of Republican control of the House of Delegates would end. Court administrators in Newport News, where Ms. Simonds asked the judges to reverse their decision on the ballot, said a hearing was unlikely before Friday. Lawyers for Mr. Yancey had yet to respond to the Simonds challenge as of Thursday morning. It was the painful constitutional reckoning of Bush v. Gore that prompted Virginia to write its guide to interpreting ambiguous ballots. “We sat around a table in a law firm in Washington, D.C., and actually agreed to what ballots looked like by drawing them,” said Jack Young, who helped write the guide after serving as Mr. Gore’s chief recount lawyer in 2000. Also at the table, he said, was Cameron Quinn, a Republican who was then secretary of the State Elections Board and is now an official in the Trump administration. The intent was to avoid a repeat of the situation in Florida, where there were no guidelines for interpreting problematic ballots, including punch cards where a voter’s light touch left a “hanging chad” of paper rather than a clean hole. “In Palm Beach in 2000 the folks for both parties, Bush and Gore, got into fights about what a punch card was supposed to look like, arguing that a punch for my candidate would count but the identical punch for your candidate didn’t,” Mr. Young said. Fifteen pages long in its latest edition, Virginia’s booklet is titled “Ballot Examples: Hand Counting Printed Ballots for Virginia Elections or Recounts.” It is a detailed guide to sussing out a voter’s intention. Despite the best bipartisan effort to bring rationality to the process, however, Virginia finds itself in a mess. The challenged ballot shows bubbles for both Ms. Simonds and Mr. Yancey filled in, with a slash through the Simonds vote. Mr. Yancey’s lawyers argued in court last week that the voter intended to cross out the Simonds vote. The state handbook reads, “If there are identical marks for two or more candidates, clarified by an additional mark or marks that appear to indicate support, the ballot shall be counted as a vote for the candidate with the additional, clarifying marks.” As further evidence of intent, Mr. Yancey’s lawyers pointed out the voter selected all the named Republicans on the ballot. But in a motion this week, Ms. Simonds’s lawyers noted the bubble for the Republican candidate for governor, Ed Gillespie, was both blacked in and also marked with an X. Could an extraneous mark be both a sign of opposition to Ms. Simonds and of support for Mr. Gillespie? “Nothing in the ‘Ballot Examples’ authorized this Court to presume that the slash mark in question should be read as a mark of opposition to Ms. Simonds,” the Democrat’s lawyers argued in their motion. The ballot should be thrown out as an “overvote,” they said. To a layman, a ballot may be “like a Rorschach Test,” open to interpretation, Ms. Simonds’s team argued. But that is not the way it is, they said. Election officials must follow specific examples in the guidebook. A Republican elections lawyer unconnected with the case, Jason Torchinsky, predicted the three-judge panel was unlikely to be persuaded to throw out the ballot. “It seems the Democrats in Virginia are now asking a court to deny a decision to count a vote,” he said by email. “Quite a change in position from their usual argument that every vote be counted.” Ms. Simonds’s legal team further argued that the judges should never have agreed to consider the questionable ballot on Dec. 20, when it was brought to them one day after the official recount. The time to question the ballot was during the recount proper on Dec. 19, presided over by lawyers and observers for both candidates. A spokesman for the Republican House caucus, Parker Slaybaugh, said Democrats were trying to have it both ways. In another disputed House race this year, in District 28 including part of Fredericksburg, the Democratic candidate challenged a ballot after a recount took place. The court agreed to review the ballot and to count it for the Democrat. “This is exactly analogous to our actions in House District 94 and demonstrates unequivocally that the actions of the Court in Newport News were appropriate and equitable,” Mr. Slaybaugh said in a statement. Professor Green, the election law expert, said she was not surprised. “What’s so interesting to me about elections is that the same attorneys will use the same arguments on the other side, Democrat or Republican,” she said. “Depending on their stance in the recount, the lawyers will say literally the same things.” She was only sorry that law school was on break. Her students would eat up this case in class, she said. "

193,"THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE
Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner
By Daniel Ellsberg
420 pp. Bloomsbury. $30. Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un trading threats with words like “fire and fury”; Pakistan deploying tactical nuclear weapons to counter Indian conventional threats; Russia enunciating an Orwellian doctrine of “escalate-to-de-escalate” that calls for early use of battlefield nuclear weapons; and major nuclear-weapons states modernizing their arsenals — nukes are back. The cruel irony: This is happening after eight years of a president who won the Nobel Peace Prize largely for his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. When the Cold War ended in 1991, nuclear weapons vanished from the minds of most Americans. Together with the Soviet Union, they were supposedly consigned to the dustbin of history. But the emergence of 21st-century nuclear threats — including the fear that terrorist groups will obtain this ultimate W.M.D. — has revived discussion about these devices of destruction. Among professionals, this debate can be found in government documents like the Defense Department’s Nuclear Matters Handbook and journals like the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Popular books like Eric Schlosser’s “Command and Control” and David E. Hoffman’s “The Dead Hand” have exposed a wider audience to these topics. Daniel Ellsberg’s new memoir, “The Doomsday Machine,” is the latest in this genre. Its title reminds us of a Big Idea captured by the legendary strategist Herman Kahn in “On Thermonuclear War.” To illustrate the problem posed by nuclear arsenals that many embraced as the best way to prevent war and aggression, Kahn imagined a “doomsday machine.” This multimegaton nuclear weapon would be buried deep underground. When detonated, it would split the Earth, killing all inhabitants. But since an enemy would never believe that a rational leader would press the button to set off such a device, the weapon would be connected to a network of sensors. If these sensors detected a nuclear attack upon the United States, the machine would explode and the Earth would be destroyed. Since other states would know that any attack would be suicidal, they would assuredly be deterred. But what if the sensors malfunctioned? Could sane, responsible leaders bet the planet on weapons that could be activated by an accident, misperception or mistake? Of course not, Kahn explained, but the “mutually assured destruction” capabilities that emerged as a consequence of the United States-Soviet competition were becoming functionally equivalent to a doomsday machine. Ellsberg, best known for his role in leaking the Pentagon Papers, sounds an impassioned alarm about nuclear dangers and reminds us that the risks Kahn vivified still exist. Despite an 80 percent reduction since the Cold War, American and Russian nuclear arsenals still number in the thousands. Many remain on “hair trigger” alert, posing serious risks of an accidental launch. If all were used in a full-scale war, especially given the possibility of “nuclear winter,” life on Earth could be extinguished. There have been repeated close calls and near accidents, including as recently as 2007 when an American B-52, mistakenly armed with six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, flew across the United States. In sum, while the doomsday machine has not yet exploded, we may be living on borrowed time. "
194,"Throughout 2017, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey seemed to go out of his way to thumb his nose at onetime friends and allies. Early this year, he described the Dutch government as “Nazi remnants,” accused German politicians of “Nazi practices” and called the entire European continent “racist, fascist and cruel.” Relations with the United States were not much better, as both countries tightened visa requirements in a crisis ignited by Turkey’s arrest of two of its citizens who worked for the State Department in Turkey. With just days left before the end of the year, however, Mr. Erdogan appears to have had a change of heart. On Thursday, his government announced an end to the visa dispute with the United States, with both the Turkish Embassy in Washington and the American Embassy in Ankara lifting visa restrictions. On Wednesday night, Mr. Erdogan signaled a rapprochement with European leaders in an interview with Turkish reporters aboard a plane to Tunisia. “I always say this: We are obliged to lessen the number of foes and increase the number of friends,” Mr. Erdogan said in comments reported by several Turkish news outlets and translated into English by Hurriyet Daily News, an English-language Turkish newspaper. “We have no problems with Germany, the Netherlands or Belgium,” Mr. Erdogan said. “To the contrary, those who are in the governments of these countries are my old friends.” He also said he hoped to visit Paris to meet with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and to travel to the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis. By now, the crosswinds of Mr. Erdogan’s public statements have sealed his reputation as a leader of changeable temperament who seems to shift Turkey’s policies along with his moods. Analysts of Turkish politics were divided on the reasons behind the Turkish president’s about-face, but some took it as a sign of his desperation at ending the year ostracized internationally. Traditionally, Turkey, a fulcrum between Europe and the Middle East, has tried to maintain good relations with its many neighbors. Mr. Erdogan’s comments on Wednesday were the result of “diplomatic isolation, period,” said Marc Pierini, the European Union’s former ambassador to Ankara, and now a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, a think tank. “Look at where the recent trips of the Turkish president have been,” Mr. Pierini added. “He’s gone to Greece, made a terrible commotion there for domestic purposes, burned another bridge; went to Poland, a semi-rogue state in the E.U.; then went to Sudan, Chad and Tunisia. This is diplomatic isolation.” Indeed, Mr. Erdogan’s sudden attempt at making nice with European nations came as a particular surprise, since his relationship with the continent seemed to have permanently soured this year. Many of his most inflammatory comments came in the spring, when Mr. Erdogan sought to energize his nationalist base in the run-up to an April referendum that he badly wanted to win to expand the powers of the presidency. Bashing Europe serves a domestic purpose: By demonizing the West, he hopes to win over voters disappointed with Turkey’s struggling economy or ambivalent about the extent of the crackdown. But the baiting did not cease even after he won. In June, his government refused to allow German lawmakers to visit German troops stationed on Turkish soil. In July, it leaked the secret locations of French and American troops stationed in Syria. In September, Mr. Erdogan returned to a theme by accusing German politicians of Nazism for questioning whether Turkey should join the European Union. Much damage has been done, analysts said, even if Turkey is a member of NATO and viewed in Europe as a key partner in stemming migration flows to Europe. Mr. Erdogan has been shunned by several European leaders since February and March, when he lashed out at their refusal to allow his ministers to campaign on European soil during the lead-up to his referendum. European politicians are also uncomfortable with Turkey’s descent into autocracy. Tens of thousands of Turks, some of them with European passports, have been arrested, fired or suspended in a crackdown on dissent that accelerated after a botched coup in July 2016. For his part, Mr. Erdogan is furious that other European countries offer sanctuary to Turkish Kurds campaigning for greater autonomy in southeastern Turkey, as well as to those he accuses of complicity in the failed putsch. But there is also little doubt that Mr. Erdogan is in need of allies, even if they are issue-specific. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Erdogan attributed his peace offering to the fact that Germany and Holland had supported his opposition to President Trump’s decision to move the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, in contravention of international law. “I asked for their support on Jerusalem,” Mr. Erdogan said. “We are all on the same page.” Mr. Erdogan may have been sincerely appreciative of European support for a cause close to his heart, said Soner Cagaptay, the author of “The New Sultan,” a recent biography of Mr. Erdogan. “The centrality of Jerusalem for Erdogan and his administration — you can’t underestimate that,” Mr. Cagaptay said. But relations soured this year even with formerly staunch partners, like the United States, even before Mr. Trump’s decision to move the United States Embassy in Israel. Mr. Erdogan’s bodyguards attacked protesters in Washington in April; American forces continued to work with Syrian Kurdish troops, whom Mr. Erdogan views as terrorists; and United States prosecutors charged a Turkish gold trader who later alleged Mr. Erdogan’s involvement in a criminal scheme. Though Turkey has improved its ties with Russia, particularly since the failed coup, the two governments disagree on the role of Kurdish militias in northern Syria and even, it seems, on the future role of President Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Erdogan’s turnabouts this week also included a return to condemning Mr. Assad, after months of muting his criticism while working with Russia to find an end to the war. Mr. Erdogan’s attempts at a rapprochement are unlikely to substantially improve European ties, since he has passed the point of no return with many European leaders, said Mr. Pierini, the former European Union ambassador. Mr. Erdogan has made “a complete misreading of the mood in Europe,” Mr. Pierini said. “After the incidents last March and September, there is a broken bridge.” Turkey’s assistance in the battle against the Islamic State, particularly as large numbers of European fighters try to return to Europe via Turkey, may persuade some European leaders to re-establish good relations with Ankara, Mr. Cagaptay said. But Mr. Erdogan, who has so often reaped domestic rewards from stoking arguments with Europe, may himself be unwilling to commit to a long-term thaw in the European-Turkish relationship. “If Erdogan sees his poll numbers are still not great,” Mr. Cagaptay said, “he won’t think for a minute before creating another crisis with European countries.” "
195,"Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions retracted an Obama-era guidance to state courts that was meant to end debtors’ prisons, where people who are too poor to pay fines are sent. This practice is blatantly unconstitutional, and the guidance had helped jump-start reform around the country. Its withdrawal is the latest sign that the federal government is retreating from protecting civil rights for the most vulnerable among us. The Justice Department helped shine a light on the harms of fine and fees when it investigated Ferguson, Mo., three years ago after the killing of the teenager Michael Brown by a police officer. As one of the lawyers on that case, I saw firsthand the damage that the city had wrought on its black community. Ferguson used its criminal justice system as a for-profit enterprise, extracting millions from its poorest citizens. Internal emails revealed the head of finance directing policing strategy to maximize revenue rather than ensure public safety. Officers told us they were pressured to issue as many tickets as possible. Even the local judge was in on it, imposing penalties of $302 for jaywalking and $531 for allowing weeds to grow in one’s yard. He issued arrest warrants for residents who fell behind on payments — including a 67-year-old woman who had been fined for a trash-removal violation — without inquiring whether they even had the ability to pay the exorbitant amounts. The arrests resulted in new charges, more fees and the suspension of driver’s licenses. These burdens fell disproportionately on African-Americans. At the time of our investigation, over 16,000 people had outstanding arrest warrants from Ferguson, a city of 21,000. Untold numbers found themselves perpetually in debt to the city and periodically confined to its jail. These problems were not unique to Ferguson. A Georgia woman served eight months in custody past her sentence because she couldn’t pay a $705 fine. A veteran battling homelessness in Michigan lost his job when a judge jailed him for bringing only $25 rather than the required $50 first payment to court. A judge in Alabama told people too poor to pay that they could either give blood or go to jail. "
196,"Good morning on this bone-chilling Thursday. This month, we asked readers to nominate candidates for New York Today’s New Yorkers of the Year series, our annual celebration of citizens who have made a difference in the city over the last 12 months. We received more than 100 submissions, and this week we are highlighting a few of our exemplary neighbors. Tony Ruiz ran away from violence. Literally. “Running essentially saved me from the streets of Brooklyn,” said Mr. Ruiz, who grew up in the projects of East New York and Brighton Beach. “I was raised in neighborhoods that were pretty tough at the time — there were a lot of gangs — and one of the big things growing up for me was, if you don’t join these gangs or you’re not involved in certain things, people don’t like you,” Mr. Ruiz said. “You have to be in with certain groups.” Running allowed Mr. Ruiz to stay out of trouble through his teenage years. And some four decades later, Mr. Ruiz, now the head road coach for the Central Park Track Club, is using it to help others. During his coaching career, Mr. Ruiz, 56, has trained elementary school students and septuagenarians, first-time joggers and professionals, friends and strangers. And when Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico this fall, Mr. Ruiz — who used to live in the city of Mayagüez and still has family there — laced up to help. "
197,"BEIJING — China said on Thursday that it would temporarily exempt foreign companies from paying tax on their earnings, a bid to keep American businesses from taking their profits out of China following Washington’s overhaul of the United States tax code. There is, however, a catch: To be eligible, foreign companies must invest those earnings in sectors encouraged by China’s government — including railways, mining, technology and agriculture — according to a statement from the Finance Ministry. The measure is retroactive from Jan. 1 this year, the ministry said. The move would “promote the growth of foreign investment, improve the quality of foreign investment and encourage overseas investors to continuously expand their investment in China,” the ministry said. It did not elaborate. Despite its appeal as a manufacturing hub, one where companies from around the world have set up operations to tap into a highly skilled work force and strong infrastructure, China charges high taxes. On top of a standard corporate rate of 25 percent, companies are required to make social security contributions and other payments that push their tax burden higher than it is in many other countries. The newly approved tax incentives in the United States could appeal to companies that are frustrated by China’s rising labor costs, ambitious local competitors and tangled legal systems, or those that would rather spend their money at home or elsewhere. And officials in Beijing have worried that the overhaul could prove to be a challenge to Chinese laws that aim to keep money from leaving the country’s borders. While Thursday’s announcement did not explicitly refer to the tax overhaul in the United States, analysts have said that it is almost certain that the policy was in response to it. This month, China’s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, pledged to “take proactive measures” in response to the overhaul, according to Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency. He noted that the impact of the changes overseas “cannot be overlooked.” The American tax overhaul has been promoted by President Trump and other Republican leaders as a move to make the United States more competitive globally. In particular, the new corporate tax rate is sharply lower, moving the country from having among the highest corporate tax rates to among the lowest. Under the plan, the rate will go to 21 percent from 35 percent. But ministers, officials and analysts in much of the rest of the world have said it could create an uneven playing field and set off a race among countries to cut corporate taxes. Because the United States already offers a large and wealthy domestic market, relatively light workplace regulation and large amounts of venture capital, lower tax rates had been one lever that other countries had used in an effort to lure companies. Asian and European officials have speculated that some of the measures in the revamped tax code could help encourage United States companies produce goods domestically for exporting. European leaders, for their part, have raised the specter of a trade battle and implied they may challenge the overhaul before the World Trade Organization. China, meanwhile, has had its own concerns. Many American and European companies have complained in recent years that the country is becoming an increasingly difficult place to do business. Firms say they have had to navigate tricky new laws, been subject to forced technology transfers, and have complained that the authorities curtail their access to Chinese consumers. China sets tight rules on how much money flows out of the country, as a way of controlling the value of its currency and keeping its financial system stable. A significant repatriation of foreign earnings could set off a broader capital flight, and weaken the country’s currency, the renminbi. And a sharp fall in the renminbi could spark a vicious cycle with even more companies — and possibly individuals — looking to minimize losses by moving their money out of China. The currency controls, which were tightened last year as Beijing tried to stem a tide of money leaving the country, have led to complaints from foreign companies doing business there. It is, for the moment, unclear how much money American companies actually keep in China, or how much they would seek to bring home. Many businesses use complex accounting techniques to book profits overseas, and firms with major investment plans in China could elect to keep their money here regardless. Regardless, business lobbying groups here said it was unlikely that the Chinese government’s latest measures would be significant enough to keep many American companies from repatriating profits. Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said some of his member companies had already said that they would seek to repatriate China earnings to the United States with the tax code change, and were considering doing so quickly to minimize the risk of being subject to capital controls. “Some are concerned that China may impose foreign exchange controls if these repatriations mount up and lead to capital outflow pressures, like we saw early this year and last year,” Mr. Parker said. "
198,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama officials on Thursday unhesitatingly pushed aside a legal challenge from Roy S. Moore and certified Doug Jones as the winner of this month’s Senate election. The action, during a brief meeting at the State Capitol, was essentially the state’s final step before the seating of the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Alabama in a quarter century. It was also a swift rejection, by some of the state’s most powerful Republicans, of Mr. Moore’s complaint that he was the victim of “systematic voter fraud.” Mr. Jones’s margin of victory was 21,924 votes, with more than 1.3 million ballots cast. The certification leaves Mr. Moore, 70, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court whose campaign faltered partly because of allegations of sexual misconduct against teenage girls, with almost no avenues to derail Mr. Jones’s ascension to the Senate. The election aftermath followed a familiar pattern for Mr. Moore, who in the past has been eager to declare victories and pronounce grievances — but unwilling to concede defeats. To this day, Republicans note, Mr. Moore has not conceded his losses in the 2006 or 2010 Republican primaries for governor, and there is already speculation in Montgomery that he might run for governor or attorney general next year. “You win with class, you lose with class, and he just can’t do it,” Angi Horn Stalnaker, a Republican strategist who ran campaigns, with mixed success, against Mr. Moore, said acidly. On Thursday, Mr. Moore seemed to come close to acknowledging his loss. “I have stood for the truth about God and the Constitution for the people of Alabama,” he said in a statement. “I have no regrets. To God be the glory.” Before the results of the Dec. 12 special election were certified, and in the candidate’s statement afterward, Mr. Moore and his campaign left little doubt about their assessment of the vote. In a lawsuit filed in a state court late Wednesday, Mr. Moore, who denied the allegations of sexual impropriety, complained that pervasive fraud had tainted the election, and that the Alabama authorities had inadequately investigated potential misconduct. But Mr. Moore found himself aligned against Democrats and Republicans alike. Secretary of State John H. Merrill, a Republican who voted for Mr. Moore, said he had found no evidence of endemic fraud and refused to postpone the certification. Judge Johnny Hardwick of Montgomery County Circuit Court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, dismissed Mr. Moore’s complaint minutes before the vote was certified. Mr. Jones, whose transition team had called the lawsuit “a desperate attempt by Roy Moore to subvert the will of the people,” said in a statement that his victory “marks a new chapter for our state and the nation.” Although the state ultimately certified the results, Mr. Moore’s litigation infused a strain of drama into a day that Alabama officials had hoped would be procedural and perfunctory. Mr. Moore’s lawsuit was late in coming: His lawyers filed their lawsuit at 10:33 p.m. on Wednesday. Yet the complaint by Mr. Moore, a figure with a penchant for last-minute legal theatrics, was not altogether surprising. He and his allies have spent the last several weeks signaling their unease with the voting process, and, while saying little else publicly, Mr. Moore solicited contributions for an “election integrity fund.” Until Wednesday night, it was not clear what would come of his efforts. Then, in a court filing that ran for dozens of pages, Mr. Moore argued that returns in the state’s most populous county “confirmed election fraud.” It also said that turnout in the county was suspiciously high; it suggested that Mr. Jones had benefited from voter intimidation; and it argued that Mr. Moore’s opponents had spread “lies and fraudulent misrepresentations.” To support his arguments, Mr. Moore included affidavits from several people his campaign described as experts in elections; one has claimed to have “mathematically proved a conspiracy to assassinate” President John F. Kennedy. (Mr. Moore has himself indulged in conspiracy theories, including that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.) Experts unaffiliated with either the Jones or Moore campaigns quickly said the lawsuit’s arguments appeared meritless. “It seems to boil down to: I should have won under the exit poll and all of this voting by African-Americans must show fraud,” Richard L. Hasen, an elections law expert at the University of California, Irvine, wrote on his blog. Although the Alabama Republican Party, and many elected officials, stood behind Mr. Moore during his campaign, he had few influential allies by the time the certification meeting began at the Capitol. Party leaders, including President Trump, who endorsed Mr. Moore, had called for him to concede. Mr. Moore could conceivably ask the Senate, which has the constitutional authority to serve as “judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members,” not to seat Mr. Jones. Republican leaders in Washington are unlikely to heed any such call. But the final tally reflects Mr. Moore’s enduring appeal to many Republicans here, and Mr. Moore’s strength, diminished as it is, has fueled speculation about whether he will unsettle the state’s politics next year. A campaign for either governor or attorney general would involve challenging a Republican incumbent and would test just how weary and wary the party is of Mr. Moore. “On paper, he would be competitive in a Republican primary,” said State Auditor Jim Zeigler, a Republican who supported Mr. Moore in the Senate election and is himself considering a run for governor. “But the campaign is not won or lost on paper, just like a football game. On paper, Alabama was going to beat Auburn, and it didn’t happen.” The political math for Mr. Moore is certainly more complicated than ever before. He was twice elected — and effectively twice removed — as chief justice, and he would enter any 2018 race with some of the advantages that can come with decades in public life: name recognition and, likely, the sustained fealty of the devoted supporters who helped him earn more than 650,000 votes on Dec. 12. But before the Senate race, many of Mr. Moore’s critics regarded him as bigot and a demagogue who cheered discrimination against gay people and Muslims. After the campaign, some of his critics also saw him as a predator toward younger women. And the coalition that sunk Mr. Moore’s campaign — young people, women and black voters in major cities and rural counties — has not gone away. If Mr. Moore harbors any ambitions of moving into the neoclassical Governor’s Mansion, he will have to act on them quickly: The deadline for declaring a statewide candidacy is Feb. 9. Several of Mr. Moore’s advisers, including his campaign’s chairman and treasurer, did not respond to messages this week. But a former chief of staff to Mr. Moore, Ben Dupré, said that Mr. Moore is “a guy that does not compromise.” “He doesn’t take his orders from the Republican Party or the Democrat Party,” said Mr. Dupré, who sometimes spoke for Mr. Moore during the campaign but ended his role soon after the election. “He really believes in following the Constitution and in following God and in following what he believes is his duty to God and to the country.” Mr. Dupré added, “If he has a reason not to concede, he’s not going to concede. He’s got no friends in D.C. — we know that, we knew that going into this — and he’s not trying to play their game of, ‘Oh, we smeared your reputation, so you should roll over and go away.’” Mr. Dupré, who spoke hours before Mr. Moore brought his lawsuit, may have a point. After Mr. Moore faltered in 2006, a political scientist predicted to an Alabama newspaper that it would be “very hard for him to come back and be a major force in Alabama politics.” Less than seven years later, Mr. Moore, already ousted once from the Supreme Court, was elected chief justice — again. "
199,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking a day after an explosion in St. Petersburg, said on Thursday that he had ordered security agents to “take no prisoners” during terrorist attacks, and authorized the police to “liquidate the bandits on the spot.” Mr. Putin has long burnished his image as tough on terrorism, and the comments were noteworthy not so much for signifying a change in policy — Russian counterterrorism forces have shot and killed dozens of terrorism suspects over the years — as for displaying the antiterrorism swagger he was known for early in his tenure. He is now running for  a fourth term as president, and analysts expected the campaign to focus on his decision to annex Crimea from Ukraine, a move that has been popular in Russia. The election is scheduled for March 18, the fourth anniversary of the annexation. But a series of attacks and thwarted plots have recently brought terrorism back into the limelight. Mr. Putin’s comments came a day after a bomb exploded in a grocery store in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, wounding about a dozen people. And earlier this month, Mr. Putin thanked President Trump after the Central Intelligence Agency passed to Russian security services information about an Islamic State plot to detonate bombs in a cathedral and other sites, also in St. Petersburg. At first, the police did not refer to the grocery store explosion as terrorism, but Mr. Putin said on Thursday that it was, in fact, a terrorist attack. The explosive device had a power equivalent to about 200 grams, or seven ounces, of TNT, the Russian authorities said, and it was laced with bolts to act as shrapnel. A man the authorities described as having a non-Slavic appearance had placed a backpack containing the bomb in a locker at the supermarket, then fled. "
