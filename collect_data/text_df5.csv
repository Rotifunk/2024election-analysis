1,"Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier described as a Nazi by the Illinois Republican Party, won the Republican primary on Tuesday in the state’s Third Congressional District, a heavily Democratic district that includes part of Chicago and its suburbs, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Jones, 70, unsuccessfully sought the nomination five times before, and his victory on Tuesday was a foregone conclusion after the Republican Party failed to draft another candidate to enter the race against him.

2,"Many years ago, the Israeli Bedouin expert Clinton Bailey told me a story about a Bedouin chief who discovered one day that his favorite turkey had been stolen. He called his sons together and told them: “Boys, we are in great danger now. My turkey’s been stolen. Find my turkey.” His boys just laughed and said, “Father, what do you need that turkey for?” and they ignored him. A few weeks later the Bedouin chief’s camel was stolen. His sons went to him and said, “Father, your camel has been stolen. What should we do?” And the chief answered, “Find my turkey.” A few weeks later the chief’s horse was stolen, and again his sons asked what they should do. “Find my turkey,” the chief said. Finally, a few weeks later his daughter was abducted, at which point he gathered his sons and told them: “It’s all because of the turkey! When they saw that they could take my turkey, we lost everything.” I retell that story today because it’s helpful in understanding how and why we failed to contain the egregious behavior of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. They each started by — metaphorically speaking — stealing a turkey. And when we didn’t respond, they kept ratcheting up their wretched behavior to the point where Trump thinks he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and Putin thinks he could poison a wayward spy in London, and get away with it.

3,"BRUSSELS — European authorities on Wednesday proposed revamping the way many technology companies in the region are taxed, outlining wide-ranging changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the European Union. The system would tax a company’s revenues in the countries where they are generated, rather than its profits. Regulators say so-called profit-shifting allows some businesses to use regional offices in low-tax countries to reduce payments. The plan pits the European Union against the United States as both sides battle to retain corporate tax revenue. It is one of a number of issues on which Brussels and Washington have clashed, from the broader regulation of the technology industry to a dispute over American steel and aluminum tariffs. The proposals unveiled on Wednesday also support the argument that Europe is the world’s most prominent regulator of technology and digital services. The 28-nation European Union has outsize impact not just for its market of about 500 million customers, but because officials around the world increasingly take their cue from Brussels on how to regulate the tech industry. “The digital revolution has turned our economies upside down,” said Pierre Moscovici, the European Union’s tax commissioner. “When you ‘like’ a picture, when you post a video on social media,” he said, “your click sets in motion a chain of business transactions and thus creates considerable profits.” “But under today’s rules, those profits are not taxed,” Mr. Moscovici said. “The current legal vacuum is creating a substantial shortfall in the budgetary revenues of our member states.” It also creates an uneven playing field between digital and traditional businesses, he argued. "
4,"As a real estate executive and reality TV star, Donald J. Trump tightly controlled his image by insisting that everyone around him sign nondisclosure agreements threatening steep monetary penalties if they revealed anything about him or his company. A few months into his presidency, Mr. Trump — infuriated by leaks about everything from staff rivalries to his bathrobe-wearing, TV-viewing habits — ordered Reince Priebus, then his chief of staff, to do the same thing in the West Wing. To calm Mr. Trump, Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, drew up a broad document barring White House officials from publicly disclosing what they heard and saw at work. But he privately told senior aides that it was mainly meant to placate an agitated president, who was convinced that the people around him had to be pressured into keeping his secrets. Mr. McGahn made it clear the agreement could not ultimately be enforced, according to several people who signed. The nondisclosure agreement, presented by Mr. Priebus to the senior staff last April, did not specify any penalties — financial or otherwise — for breaking it. But it was an early indication that Mr. Trump, who spent decades using pressure tactics and secrecy in his private life, wanted to do the same thing at the White House, breaking with tradition. He would push the obsession of many of his predecessors with damaging leaks to a new level. And if the potential for punishment seemed remote to his top aides, the message from the president was clear: keep quiet. The White House declined to provide a copy of the two- to three-page document, which was described by several current and former White House officials who signed it and insisted on anonymity to discuss it. A spokesman would not say whether senior officials were required to sign such an agreement. "
5,"The novelist Mary Gordon, known for books like 1981’s “The Company of Women,” about a girl who escapes her sheltered upbringing to embrace rebellion in 1960s America, considers her lifelong admiration of British actor-politician Glenda Jackson a “romance.” Gordon was 16 when she first saw Jackson onstage, in the 1965 Broadway production of “Marat/Sade,” a philosophical investigation of the meaning of protest set during and after the French Revolution. In the ’70s, Gordon, now 68, graduated from college to a life in letters, and she memorized lines from “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” a 1971 film directed by John Schlesinger and starring Jackson as Alex, a woman competing with a doctor, played by Peter Finch, for the love of a young male sculptor and coming to terms with free love. As Gordon’s novels and nonfiction — including an important 1978 essay on abortion rights published in the New York Review of Books — won her increasing acclaim, she watched Jackson, now a two-time Oscar winner, make a turn to a surprising second career as a liberal member of Parliament beginning in 1992. Finally, and just as surprisingly, Jackson returned to acting. Just after turning 80 two years ago, she won raves in London as a gender-blind King Lear. This spring brings Jackson back to Broadway, starring in the revival of Edward Albee’s 1991 play “Three Tall Women,” which opens March 29, about a woman recalling her life’s great triumphs and regrets. One morning in January in Manhattan, Gordon finally met her idol for a long conversation, which covered poetry, film and theater, but most significantly the state of feminism today. MARY GORDON: My life was based on you during the ’70s, but the first time I saw you, I sneaked out of my house to see “Marat/Sade.” I knew that if I was going to be the kind of person I wanted to be, I had to go see it. And it’s still deeply disturbing. GLENDA JACKSON: It doesn’t have that effect on me at all. As a play to be in, it was extraordinary. We’d played it in London to totally silent audiences, but in New York, they applauded the songs; they shouted, “Encore!” MG: Yes, I remember it. Do you see a through line from that to your interpretation of Lear? Both touch on madness. GJ: Well, when I worked with Peter Brook it was like coming across an oasis in the desert. Like all great directors, he creates the kind of world in which everyone’s responsible for the whole play. That sense of the total being greater than the sum of the parts is very, very strong in “Lear.” Now, I wasn’t interested in the gender-bender aspect, but what I did find interesting is how age begins to fracture those absolutes which tell you what women are and what men are. MG: “Sunday Bloody Sunday” is one of my favorite movies in the world. Why do you think it hasn’t been shown more often? "
6,"HARTFORD — Andrew J. McDonald had been overwhelmingly approved by lawmakers five years ago when he joined the Connecticut Supreme Court. Now he has returned to the State Legislature — this time nominated to be chief justice with the backing of much of the state’s legal establishment. He was put up for the job by a Democratic governor in a state where the party has dominated for years. Still, his confirmation is anything but guaranteed and has devolved into a contentious partisan fight. Justice McDonald is not the first Supreme Court nominee in Connecticut to face significant resistance in the State Legislature. But his nomination has become marked by an unusual level of acrimony. Stiff opposition from Republicans has imperiled his confirmation, while his supporters have mounted a robust effort that borrows from the tactics of political campaigns, even using robocalls and television advertisements to pressure lawmakers. (One commercial featured an image of President Trump and urged residents to call their legislator, saying, “You can stop this smear campaign now.”) The battle, which has drawn widespread attention to what can often be a rather subdued process, has been described by legal experts as further evidence of politics seeping into the selection of judges across the country. The situation also reflects a fractured political climate in Connecticut, as Republicans, and even some Democrats, have become emboldened in challenging an unpopular governor, Dannel P. Malloy, who is in his last year in office. Justice McDonald’s critics have sought to portray him as beholden to the governor and the Democratic Party, and they have argued that he has used the court to advance political interests. Much of the opposition has been driven by his role in a Supreme Court decision over the repeal of the death penalty. Among those who voted against his nomination were Representative William A. Petit Jr., whose wife and daughters were killed in a grisly 2007 home invasion. “I do not believe he has the experience nor temperament to be the C.E.O. of the judicial branch,” Dr. Petit, who was elected to the Legislature as a Republican in 2016, said on the House floor. But his supporters have suggested that at least some of the opposition has been motivated by Justice McDonald’s sexual orientation — he would become the first openly gay chief justice in the country. They also contend that the intensity of the questioning he has faced and the rancor surrounding his confirmation suggests dubious motivations. "
7,"On Sept. 20, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, turning my life upside down. At the time, my two daughters and I were living in Carolina, a town on the northeastern side of the island. In just a day, my clothes were turned to rags, my home was destroyed, and I lost the few belongings I had. My mother lived in the same town but her house was still standing. For two months, we slept on a couch in her living room. But we couldn’t stay there forever. In December, the Federal Emergency Management Agency moved us to New York City. Since then, we’ve been staying in hotels provided by FEMA in the Bronx and Brooklyn, like hundreds of other families who were moved to New York after the storm. But this experience can hardly be called “living.” We’re barely surviving. Congress and the Trump administration have failed to truly address the crisis, leaving survivors stranded months after the storm. In Puerto Rico, we were told by FEMA that we were going to be welcomed in New York with open arms. But that hasn’t been our experience. When we arrived in New York, we were placed in a hotel in the Bronx. There, we had no kitchen and thus couldn’t cook. We didn’t have enough money to eat out, so I fed my children microwaved meals for nearly three months. "
8,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we ask auto companies for their climate positions, we talk with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle, and we look forward to spring (during a snowstorm here in New York). At auto shows and on dealership floors, automakers are quick to talk about the latest green technology — electric vehicles, hybrids, even hydrogen cars. But in Washington, the industry is sending a different message. Last month, one of the largest lobbying groups argued in a regulatory filing that the basic science behind climate change is not to be trusted. In the same filing, the lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, also cast doubt on the negative effects of tailpipe pollution on human health. "
9,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A new Communist takeover, Boris Johnson’s Hitler comment, and Mark Zuckerberg’s highly anticipated moment. Here’s what you need to know: • Party power. China issued a blueprint for shaking up its bureaucracy that vastly increases the Communist Party’s control over government and culture. The plan empowers party panels to shape policy on reform, cybersecurity, economics, finance and foreign affairs. And it merges state-run radio and television broadcasters into a “Voice of China” conglomerate answering to the party’s Department of Propaganda, which will also control film, books and magazines. This week, Shanghai briefly detained and then returned a Chinese-born Australian, John Hugh, who has been sharply critical of the party’s efforts to influence Australian politics. _____ • A three-way summit meeting? President Moon Jae-in of South Korea floated the possibility of joining the planned meeting of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump in May, which he said would be “a momentous event in world history.” Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim are planning to meet in late April at Panmunjom, the “truce village” that straddles the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas. "
10,"MILAN — In the prelude to the Italian elections this month, the far-right League party did not distinguish itself for rhetorical subtlety. Its leader, Matteo Salvini, called Islam “incompatible with our values, rights and freedoms.” He characterized the single European currency as a “crime against humanity.” And the senior League politician Attilio Fontana, after deploring that the “white race” could be “wiped out” in Italy, went on to win the presidency of Lombardy, the wealthy northern region that includes this fashionable city, in a landslide. But pull up the League’s campaign manifesto, dig past the strident anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric, and suddenly the tone turns more poetic. “Italy and its thousand cultures should be the Silicon Valley of cultural heritage,” it sings, one of many flourishes among the party’s proposals for art institutions, churches and heritage sites. Unlike the League’s American cousins — Mr. Salvini is an avowed fan of President Trump — these Italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions, and their “Make Italy Great Again” vision highlights museums as much as migration policy. For Mr. Salvini’s party, the nationalist project goes right through the history of art. They are not the first right-wingers to make promises about Italian high culture. A few days after the March 4 elections, as the papers here weighed the likelihood of a populist governing coalition or a new poll, I visited two major exhibitions examining how art and politics informed each other at previous turning points in Italy’s history: in the 1920s and ’30s, on view at Fondazione Prada in Milan; and in the ’50s and ’60s, at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. Both reaffirmed that questions of culture — who defines what it is, and who administers it — have never been far from the surface of Italian political life. The better of the two shows — a landmark, really — is at Fondazione Prada, where the immense, scholarly “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum. Art Life Politics: Italia 1918-1943” opened last month. Get past the car crash of a title (it’s a riff on an early poem by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the godfather of Futurism) and you will discover more than 600 paintings, sculptures and design objects from Italy’s Fascist era, by the likes of Giorgio di Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, Gino Severini and dozens of unknowns, displayed amid countless historical documents that map the rise and fall of the interwar art world. It is a resounding achievement in exhibition making, blending rigorous scholarship, political engagement and immaculate design. "
11,"Less than two days before the Trump administration plans to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, its chief trade representative said Wednesday that several of the nation’s top trading partners were in line for potential exemptions. The trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee that the administration was talking with Australia, Argentina and the European Union about excluding them from the 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent charge on aluminum. He added that there were plans to talk with Brazil about possible exemptions, and raised the possibility that South Korea could be excluded as the United States continues to hold talks with Seoul over a bilateral trade agreement. Mr. Lighthizer said he favored sparing those countries from the tariffs while talks continue, though he said that decision would be “up to the president.” Mr. Lighthizer said he expected the conversations over exclusions to conclude by the end of April. The administration has already temporarily shielded Canada and Mexico from the tariffs during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Lighthizer’s testimony came a day after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was warned by global economic leaders at a meeting in Buenos Aires that the United States was risking a trade war by initiating the tariffs. President Trump declared earlier in the month that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” "
12,"BERKELEY, Calif. — A few months ago, the composer Jimmy López came to the University of California, Berkeley, to hear firsthand the experiences of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. He was hoping to talk to students as he prepared to create “Dreamer,” an oratorio designed to reflect the inspiration that fuels the experience of immigrants, and the challenges they face. No one showed up that day. The morning of his visit, word spread that a parked U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle had been spotted on campus. It may have been the first time that the composition of an oratorio — the kind of grand choral work Bach, Handel and Haydn are all famous for — was interrupted by an appearance of the border patrol. But this is no ordinary oratorio. The world has changed, and the immigration issue has become more urgent since the piece, with music by Mr. López and a libretto by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz, was first conceived a couple of years ago by Cal Performances, the university’s performing arts presenter. After President Trump was elected, he moved to end the Obama-era program that shields nearly 700,000 young immigrants, often called “Dreamers,” from deportation, leaving them in limbo while his administration, Congress and the courts debate their fates. “There was nothing on the horizon when we began that would indicate what we were going to be facing,” Mr. López said in an interview, explaining that the rapidly changing immigration landscape had forced him to reconsider his concept for the piece. As it turned out, the immigration officials who had come to campus that day earlier this year were there to discuss a program that speeds security checks at airports. But the fears their vehicle sparked underscored how anxious a time this is for undocumented students. "
13,"The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that the central bank is on track to raise rates twice more in 2018. ■ The Fed said it would raise its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, marking the sixth time since the financial crisis that it has raised rates. ■ The Fed said at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting that the economy continues to strengthen and that it expects to increase rates another two times this year as it pursues a return to more normal interest rate levels. Officials also increased their expectations for economic growth this year in the United States, declaring that “the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.” They said they expect to raise interest rates three times next year, an increase from the two increases in 2019 that they forecast in December. ■ Jerome H. Powell, the new Fed chairman, expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. “We’re trying to take that middle ground,” he said in a news conference following his first policy meeting as head of the central bank. Mr. Powell, a former Fed governor, succeeded Janet L. Yellen last month. The Fed, under Ms. Yellen, pursued gradual rate increases and a highly choreographed sell-off of the portfolio of bonds it bought to help prop up the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell was among the governors who voted for that approach, and the announcement on Wednesday signaled he will maintain it, particularly if economic growth continues to accelerate and unemployment remains at or below the 4.1 percent level it reached in February. The announcement underscores the Fed’s gathering confidence in the economy as well as its focus on the potential for inflation, which has remained persistently muted throughout the expansion. Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. They raised their estimate for growth in 2019 to 2.4 percent, up from 2.1 percent. They now expect the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, a low level by historical standards. In December, officials said they expected unemployment to be 3.9 percent both this year and next. "

15,"WASHINGTON — With government funding set to run out this weekend, congressional leaders agreed on a voluminous $1.3 trillion spending bill on Wednesday that would beef up domestic and military programs and keep the government open through September. “Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, “but at the end of the day, we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included.” The House and Senate have until midnight Friday to pass the spending bill to avoid what would be the third government shutdown of the year. As part of the spending talks, congressional leaders worked in recent days to resolve disputes over issues like immigration, a wall on the southern border with Mexico, health care and a planned rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey that has drawn the ire of President Trump. As the negotiations wrapped up on Capitol Hill, the president himself emerged as a potential obstacle, waffling on Wednesday about whether he could support the final package in part because it lacked sufficient funding for his wall. To salvage the agreement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan went to the White House residence to meet with Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs chief, with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, joining by telephone. A White House official said the group smoothed over differences over a number of items, including the wall and other border issues, as well as transportation and military funding. Afterward, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, issued an upbeat statement making it clear that Mr. Trump had overcome his reservations, saying that he and the congressional leaders had “discussed their support for the bill.” "
16,"To the Editor: Frank Bruni argues that President Trump’s reluctance to attack Stormy Daniels is an extraordinary, if not unique, aberration for a man who so readily denigrates, bullies, insults and threatens others (“The Calm Before the Stormy,” column, March 21). Rather, as Mr. Bruni observes, he is the “tempered pacifist,” perhaps fearful of what will be publicly revealed. More blatant and infinitely more consequential is his treatment of Vladimir Putin. As reported in “President’s Call to Putin Dodges Talk of Foul Play” (front page, March 21), Mr. Trump made a congratulatory call to Mr. Putin for his lopsided and undemocratic victory while withholding any criticism of Russia for its interference in our political process, its cyberattacks or its alleged role in the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England. We have a right, and a responsibility, to question Mr. Trump’s motivation. Mr. Trump’s treatment of Mr. Putin serves no clear political purpose and, in fact, runs counter to all the advice he has been given by his advisers. A logical speculation — and one can only speculate — is that just as the president may be fearful of what Stormy Daniels may reveal, he fears the same with Mr. Putin. For this reason, Congress should take a clear and proactive step to ensure that the Mueller investigation is not undermined. LARRY S. SANDBERG, NEW YORK "
17,"When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company’s chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation. When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, released a statement that said “we fell short.” And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote a letter to the public. “I messed up,” he said. “I owe everyone an explanation.” But in the past week, as Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg, the social network’s chief executive, said, well, nothing. Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, has made any public appearances this week. Mr. Zuckerberg’s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim; Ms. Sandberg’s most recent post was a four-day-old photo from her child’s debate competition. "
18,"During the administration of President Barack Obama, attorneys general from Republican states developed a powerful tool: They teamed up dozens of times to sue the federal government to block environmental initiatives. Now, Democrats are using the same playbook to fight the Trump administration. Blue-state attorneys general have filed more than two dozen environmental lawsuits against the Trump administration since January 2017, and the victories are piling up. This month, a court said the Environmental Protection Agency had broken the law by delaying smog protections. In February, states forced the Department of Energy to enact efficiency standards for household appliances. And in two different decisions in the past year, courts thwarted the administration’s attempts to delay regulations on emissions by the oil and gas industry. The rise of state attorneys general as partisan warriors against presidential administrations is a relatively new phenomenon, according to some who served in more amicable days. “Up until 1999, the attorneys general were very nonpartisan,” said Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general and a Republican. For instance, Republicans and Democrats in the 1990s teamed up to sue the tobacco industry over the health effects of its products and the burdens cigarette smoking placed on state Medicaid budgets. Mr. Woods recalled that, when pursuing such cases with fellow state attorneys general, he was not even sure of some colleagues’ party affiliations. “Today everyone has it branded on their forehead, like a scarlet letter,” he said. The attorneys general fighting the Trump administration have a backer in Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York. Mr. Bloomberg has contributed $6 million to cover the salaries of university law fellows willing to work for states on lawsuits, investigations, public records requests and other measures to oppose the administration’s environmental policies. Republicans also got a helping hand when fighting environmental rules during the Obama administration. Republican attorneys general who challenged Mr. Obama’s policies together took in about $16 million in campaign contributions from energy companies in 2014. And Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of Murray Energy, coordinated a lawsuit with 29 mostly Republican-led states against the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Obama’s signature effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. "
19,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — A State Department official on Wednesday reasserted America’s commitment to Taiwan’s defense at a dinner attended by its president, a day after China’s leader issued a stern warning against any challenges to China’s claim to the island. “The aim of U.S. policy is to ensure that Taiwan’s people can continue along their chosen path, free from coercion,” the official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong, said at the banquet in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, as President Tsai Ing-wen looked on. Speaking to 700 people, including representatives of top American companies and senior Taiwanese officials, at an American Chamber of Commerce function, Mr. Wong said the United States wanted “to strengthen our ties with the Taiwan people and to bolster Taiwan’s ability to defend its democracy.” “Our commitment to those goals has never been stronger,” added Mr. Wong, whose remarks came less than week after President Trump, over China’s objection, signed the Taiwan Travel Act, a measure encouraging official, high-level visits between the United States and Taiwan. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping of China issued a thinly veiled threat to Washington and Taipei during a speech to the National People’s Congress in Beijing. “Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure,” Mr. Xi said in a stridently nationalistic speech, “and will meet with the people’s condemnation and punishment of history.” The National People’s Congress this month removed term limits on Mr. Xi’s presidency, setting up the possibility he may hold the top posts of China’s government, military and the Communist Party for life. "
20,"When President Trump met on Tuesday with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, a year after he first hosted the prince at the White House, something was missing. Women. Photos from Tuesday’s meeting show that the dynamics at the table remained relatively unchanged since the last meeting, and persistently male. After years of American foreign policy that has pushed for human rights, such a stark absence of women — and minorities — could send a symbolic message to the ultraconservative country known for its oppression of women and religious minorities. Some in attendance on the American side: Vice President Mike Pence; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser; and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser,  joined an all-male Saudi delegation for a second consecutive year. John F. Kelly, the chief of staff; Rick Perry, the energy secretary; and Gary D. Cohn, the departing top economic adviser, also joined the president. Saudi leaders have loosened some restrictions on women in the country, including undoing a longtime ban on allowing women to drive. But the country is still considered to be heavily oppressive toward women. The foreign policy delegations for most United States administrations have been predominately male, though in recent years women including Madeleine K. Albright, Condoleezza Rice, Susan E. Rice and Hillary Clinton have played key roles in diplomatic relations as top cabinet officials. Ivanka Trump, the president’s oldest daughter and senior adviser, has represented her father at meetings with Saudi royals before, but was not in attendance this time. "
21,"VIENNA — As they gathered last week, perhaps for the last time, diplomats from countries that brokered the Iran nuclear accord publicly and uniformly declared it was working — despite a death watch over the deal in Washington. But behind the closed doors of the chandeliered room, complaints spilled forth about President Trump’s threats to tear up the agreement. Iranian envoys said the warnings from Washington had scared away investors who had been expected to bolster the country’s economy after the deal was negotiated in 2015, according to participants. The American delegation countered that though the deal had effectively limited Tehran’s nuclear program, it had failed to curb Iran’s support for regional terrorism. And when he emerged from the meeting, Brian H. Hook, the chief American representative to the talks, called the nuclear issue “important — but it is just one aspect of the threats from the Iranian regime.” That has been the mantra of the Trump administration as it threatens to withdraw the United States from the accord, which the Obama administration and other world powers negotiated with Iran. Without new restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile programs and nuclear fuel production by May 12, Mr. Trump has warned that the United States will impose harsh sanctions against the country — and, in doing so, scuttle the agreement for other powers that still support it. Hoping to avoid that, European diplomats have signaled that they might support an addendum to the 2015 agreement to enforce new limits on Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing. "
22,"WASHINGTON — The House, spurred on by President Trump, passed a bill on Wednesday that would give patients with terminal illnesses a right to try unproven experimental treatments. The measure, which was approved by a vote of 267 to 149, appears to have a good chance of becoming law. The Senate approved a similar proposal last year. Supporters said the bill would give dying patients a chance to obtain potentially helpful prescription drugs without waiting for the completion of clinical trials or going through a process established by the Food and Drug Administration to allow the use of “investigational drugs” outside clinical trials. The debate took on partisan overtones. Republicans, joined by the libertarian Goldwater Institute, said the “right to try” would give patients more control over their care and their own lives. “I’m a physician and scientist with over 40 years’ experience treating patients, some of whom had the dreaded diagnosis of cancer,” said Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee. “Six months ago, I was operated on for cancer, and I — to this day — am a cancer survivor. If needed, I would like to have the right to try. A little over three years ago my beloved wife, Pam Roe, nurse and friend, died of Stage 4 colon cancer. She would have liked to have the right to try.” But many Democrats said the bill would weaken the ability of the F.D.A. to protect patients. “If you eliminate F.D.A. review, as this bill does, you are putting patients at risk,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee. “This is an unprecedented attempt to roll back F.D.A.’s oversight of investigational treatments.” "

24,"WASHINGTON — John O. Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Wednesday that he thought Russia may have some kind of compromising information on President Trump, setting off furious speculation about whether the former spy chief was basing that assertion on inside information. In an appearance on Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Mr. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director from 2013 to 2017, speculated that Russians “may have something on him personally” when he was asked if he thought Mr. Trump was afraid of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “The Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump, and may have things that they could expose,” he added. Mr. Brennan was running the C.I.A. when a salacious dossier surfaced in 2016 that claimed the Russians had compromising information on Mr. Trump. If there were any current or former American officials who might know if there was truth behind the allegations in the dossier, Mr. Brennan would most likely be one of them. And his comments came the day after a phone call Mr. Trump made to Mr. Putin congratulating him for winning an election raised new questions about the president’s relationship with Russia. As C.I.A. director, Mr. Brennan was never known as particularly chatty around the news media or in public. And since leaving office, Mr. Brennan has taken to starting conversations with journalists by telling them, “I’m not going to be an anonymous source for any stories.” But last weekend, Mr. Brennan — in response to Mr. Trump’s praise for the firing of the former deputy director of the F.B.I., Andrew G. McCabe — issued a remarkable condemnation of the president. “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter.

25,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday plans to announce at least $50 billion worth of annual tariffs and other penalties on China for its theft of technology and trade secrets, which administration officials say has robbed American companies of billions of dollars in revenue and killed thousands of jobs. The measures would mark Mr. Trump’s most aggressive move yet against a fast-rising economic rival that he has accused of preying on the United States. The measures will be targeted at imported Chinese goods in as many as 100 categories — hitting everything from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics — and will impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, people briefed on the measures said. Mr. Trump will instruct the Treasury Department to pursue restrictions on certain types of Chinese investments to counter China’s ambitious industrial policy, which aims to dominate cutting-edge sectors like artificial intelligence and mobile technology, officials said. For Mr. Trump, the steps fulfill a frequent campaign pledge to crack down on China, which he has characterized as an “economic enemy” that has “taken advantage of us like nobody in history.” But the actions will only ratchet up tensions with the Chinese government at a moment when Mr. Trump needs its support for his campaign to curb North Korea’s nuclear program. The announcement comes hard on the heels of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which are scheduled to go into effect on Friday and are aimed at combating a flood of cheap metals into the United States, including Chinese steel.

26,"As Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism, even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries. Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week, as a creator of one of Facebook’s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant. “It is time. #deletefacebook,” wrote Brian Acton, one of the founders of WhatsApp, wrote on Twitter. His company was bought by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014. The deal made him a billionaire. Mr. Acton’s anti-Facebook message, retweeted more than 10,000 times, captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best-known people are publicly calling for change. The chorus has grown louder this week, as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain data on 50 million users. “The question is, ‘What are you loyal to?’” said Tristan Harris, a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology, an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture. He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions. “Are you more loyal to your company,” Mr. Harris said. “Or are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society?” "
27,"After having to back a man accused of being a child molester, who then lost to a Democrat in crimson-red Alabama, the Republican Party leadership is having agita because a rich former coal executive, Don Blankenship, might win the party’s primary in the West Virginia Senate race. Mr. Blankenship, you see, spent a year in prison on charges of conspiring to violate mine safety standards, after an inquiry into a mine collapse that killed 29 men. One can see how these pols might be afraid they will be saddled with a convicted criminal as a Republican nominee. Mr. Blankenship has a lot of money to spend on the campaign, and is spending it, so he could beat his two mainstream opponents in the May 8 primary. In deeply conservative West Virginia, he’s attacked one opponent for being a former Democrat and another for his wife’s ties to Planned Parenthood. Party leaders fear that the broader electorate would be less forgiving of Mr. Blankenship and vote for the otherwise beatable Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin. If that happens, it would be karma for the G.O.P. One of the powerful cons that helped the party win the 2016 election was Donald Trump’s promise that he would restore coal miners’ jobs. Since coming to office, though, he has done little to increase employment in an increasingly mechanized industry losing the competition against cheaper natural gas. But Mr. Trump has done a world of good for coal mine owners, like those of Massey Energy, the company Mr. Blankenship used to run, by gutting regulations on environmental protection and worker safety and health. Now a man with so little regard for regulation that he was convicted of violating federal mine safety standards might be the Republican standard-bearer in West Virginia — a state where miners, former miners, their relatives, friends and survivors make up much of the population. While Mr. Blankenship says his conviction is a result of a federal witch hunt, and he was not accused of direct responsibility for the April 5, 2010, explosion at Massey’s Upper Big Branch mine, state investigators blamed the company’s “culture in which wrongdoing became acceptable.” Mr. Manchin has said Mr. Blankenship “has blood on his hands,” but the Republican could win the nomination and the election. West Virginia is no longer the hotbed of labor radicalism that it was once, despite a strikingly successful statewide teachers strike, and Mr. Trump had a 61 percent approval rating there — the highest in the nation — as recently as January. There is hope, though, that this race will be another example of what’s been happening around the country, in the election of Doug Jones of Alabama to the Senate, of Ralph Northam as governor of Virginia and Conor Lamb in a special Pennsylvania House race — voters seeing through the con and demanding that candidates work in their interests, voters rejecting demagogy and demanding character. "
28,"WASHINGTON — President Trump defended on Wednesday his decision to disregard the advice of his national security team and congratulate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on his re-election, lashing out at the news media for reporting on how he diverged from his script and attacking his predecessors for failing to improve relations with Moscow. Mr. Trump, enraged after officials leaked the contents of confidential notes he was given for the private phone call on Tuesday that exhorted him “DO NOT CONGRATULATE” Mr. Putin, argued in a pair of tweets on Wednesday afternoon that the conversation was part of his effort to foster better relations with Russia. He said such engagement could help the United States confront a host of national security challenges. “I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to President Barack Obama’s call to Mr. Putin in 2012. “The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong!” But Mr. Trump’s handling of the call and his defense of it also pointed up his aversion to confronting Mr. Putin about Moscow’s misdeeds, which has become a theme of his presidency even as a special counsel investigates Russia’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in his favor. Mr. Trump’s own advisers had warned him against congratulating Mr. Putin and, in briefing cards prepared before the call, told him to raise Moscow’s role in a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter living in Britain, an instruction he also ignored. The Washington Post first reported on the briefing cards, a leak that stunned some senior officials at the White House, where aides said on Wednesday that John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, had been deeply disappointed and frustrated by the disclosure. One senior White House official said Mr. Trump had never seen the briefing cards. Another said the president had been determined not to antagonize Mr. Putin, believing that his rapport with the Russian leader was the key to better relations between the countries. "
29,"“We will be greeted as liberators” upon invading Iraq, Vice President Dick Cheney counseled in 2003 on the eve of the war. He had already relayed a prediction that the streets in Basra and Baghdad are “sure to erupt in joy.” President George W. Bush declared that there was “no doubt” that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that an invasion would be largely self-financing and that it would last “five days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn’t going to last any longer.” So 15 years ago this week, the United States careered into one of the most cataclysmic, expensive and idiotic blunders of the last half-century: We invaded Iraq. The financial cost alone to the United States will top $3 trillion, according to the estimates of the economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, or about $24,000 per American household. Some 4,400 American soldiers died in Iraq, along with approximately 500,000 Iraqis, according to a survey and academic study. The war helped trigger the Syria war, the genocide against the Yazidi and Middle East Christians, the rise of the Islamic State, the strengthening of Iran and a broader Sunni-Shiite conflict in the Middle East that will claim lives for years to come. We should try to learn from these calamitous misjudgments, but I have a grim feeling in my belly, a bit like I had in the run-up to the Iraq war, that we have a president who is leading us toward reckless, catastrophic conflict. "
30,"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Wednesday publicly addressed for the first time the misuse of data belonging to 50 million users of the social network and described the steps the company would take to safeguard the information of its more than two billion monthly users. Although his statement addressing a chorus of criticism fell short of a full-throated apology, Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook would contact users whose data had been harvested through a personality quiz app and passed along to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica. “We have a responsibility to protect your data,” Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a Facebook post, “and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, was trying to quell the crisis over the disclosure last weekend that Cambridge Analytica had used data that had been improperly obtained from Facebook as the firm worked on behalf of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. “Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there?” Mr. Zuckerberg said later in an interview with The New York Times. He added, “Were there apps which could have gotten access to more information and potentially sold it without us knowing or done something that violated people’s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control.” Mr. Zuckerberg said the company would investigate apps like the third-party quiz app that had previously obtained access to “large amounts of information” from the social network. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers’ access. "
31,"HOUSTON — In a setback to Trump administration efforts to increase offshore oil production, the industry responded with only modest interest on Wednesday in a federal auction covering a record 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Companies bid on only 1 percent of the acreage, and the winning bids yielded a mere $125 million for the government. The results reflected broad uncertainty among oil executives that global oil prices can remain at current levels over $60 a barrel, as well as a general preference for drilling in onshore shale fields that require smaller investments and are less risky. Administration officials characterized the auction as a success since major oil companies — Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron and Total — had placed over 150 bids, and the yield tally was $3 million above a regional lease sale in August. But independent analysts said the results were modest. “Operators appear to still be in a ‘wait and see’ mentality when it comes to exploration, looking for stability in oil prices,” said William Turner, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy influential in the oil patch. Winning bids averaged just over $150 an acre, a bargain compared with what oil companies paid in recent years. The administration has been trying to revive exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico, which have been hurt by the slide in oil prices over the last four years from levels over $100 a barrel. Washington has lowered the royalty rates for deepwater oil activities and has offered larger tracts for bidding than the Obama administration did. Drilling in the gulf, and in other deep waters, slowed considerably after the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010, which killed 11 workers and soiled water and beaches with oil. But interest is slowly picking up again, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Hess starting major oil and gas projects off the coasts of Guyana, Brazil and Mexico; around Africa; and in the Mediterranean. In a recent interview, the Royal Dutch Shell chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said deepwater exploration “is back absolutely.” He said lower oil prices had served as a catalyst for advances in technology and project planning that have reduced the break-even price for deepwater development from $70 a barrel to close to $30. “You see the industry has gone through a tremendous amount of adjustment,” he added. Still, in recent years, more American investment has gone into shale fields in Texas and North Dakota, and it is mostly that production that is driving United States oil output to records levels and produced major exports for the first time in decades.

32,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. He blew himself up as the police closed in. Mark Anthony Conditt, 23, a suspect in the series of bombings that have terrorized the city of Austin, Tex., died early this morning by detonating an explosive in the red vehicle above. Officials said Mr. Conditt’s motive was not immediately clear, but a picture of his life was beginning to emerge. He described himself on a blog as “not that politically inclined” but expressed conservative views on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty. Friends and neighbors described him as a loner. Here’s what we know about him. ____ 2. “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, above, responded publicly (via Facebook) to the growing crisis over reports that outside companies harvested data from 50 million accounts. He said the company would crack down on outside apps and bolster privacy. Facebook has lost about $50 billion in market value since the reports were published, and a growing numbers of users are considering deleting their accounts. "
33,"A cooperating witness in the special counsel investigation worked for more than a year to turn a top Trump fund-raiser into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to interviews and previously undisclosed documents. Hundreds of pages of correspondence between the two men reveal an active effort to cultivate President Trump on behalf of the two oil-rich Arab monarchies, both close American allies. High on the agenda of the two men — George Nader, a political adviser to the de facto ruler of the U.A.E., and Elliott Broidy, the deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee — was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, backing confrontational approaches to Iran and Qatar and repeatedly pressing the president to meet privately outside the White House with the leader of the U.A.E. Mr. Tillerson was fired last week, and the president has adopted tough approaches toward both Iran and Qatar. Mr. Nader tempted the fund-raiser, Mr. Broidy, with the prospect of more than $1 billion in contracts for his private security company, Circinus, and he helped deliver deals worth more than $200 million with the United Arab Emirates. He also flattered Mr. Broidy about “how well you handle Chairman,” a reference to Mr. Trump, and repeated to his well-connected friend that he told the effective rulers of both Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. about “the Pivotal Indispensable Magical Role you are playing to help them.” Mr. Nader’s cultivation of Mr. Broidy, laid out in documents provided to The New York Times, provides a case study in the way two Persian Gulf monarchies have sought to gain influence inside the Trump White House. Mr. Nader has been granted immunity in a deal for his cooperation with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to people familiar with the matter, and his relationship with Mr. Broidy may also offer clues to the direction of that inquiry. "
34,"The man who oversees the Gateway rail tunnel project says a major infrastructure venture tends to be a series of near-death experiences — and Gateway appears to have survived one of those brushes with extinction this week. Despite efforts by President Trump to block federal funding for Gateway, a new link for trains under the Hudson River, the project could receive as much as $540 million from a spending bill Congress was hammering out on Wednesday, congressional aides said. That would be much less than the $900 million that previously had been intended for Gateway, but not the shutout that Mr. Trump had been pushing. A leading regional infrastructure expert expressed relief. “The idea that there’s something like half a billion dollars in there for Gateway is a bright story about bipartisan leadership,” said Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, which has advocated for Gateway as a critical bolster for the economy of the Northeast. “If they missed this, it would be at least a year and I’ve heard more like three years added to the project, which translates to billions in additional costs.” A senior administration official disputed the Democrats’ assessment, saying that most of the money they were counting toward Gateway was a result of increased spending and might not go to that project. He emphasized that the $900 million once intended for Gateway was not in the bill, fulfilling Mr. Trump’s demand. Gateway had built bipartisan support among representatives of New York and New Jersey and received the blessing of former President Barack Obama. The two states had pledged to cover half of the cost of the most critical parts of the project — the tunnel and improvements along Amtrak’s rail line between New York City and Newark. Those segments have an estimated cost of more than $11 billion. But the Trump administration reversed course late last year and declared that there was no agreement for the federal government to provide the other half of the funding. Mr. Trump pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, to leave any money for Gateway out of the spending bill that Congress is completing this week, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. "
35,"Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years. But the news that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10,000 times on Twitter within a two-hour period on Wednesday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. On Tuesday, it was mentioned 40,398 times, according to the analytics service Digimind. Cher was one such deserter, writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook, although “very hard,” was necessary because she loves the United States. Brian Acton, a co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service, told his tens of thousands of followers on Tuesday to delete Facebook. The social network acquired WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal in 2014. For people who aren’t celebrities or billionaires, the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly, because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives, friends and professional opportunities. Here, some newly Facebook-free users of social media discuss why they left. ______ Richard H. Perry A filmmaker in Los Angeles For a long time now, Mr. Perry had wanted to leave Facebook. He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information. In the months before the 2016 presidential election, he watched the social network become what he called “a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists.” [Read more on how to delete Facebook and Instagram.] But Facebook was also where Mr. Perry promoted his films, where he posted ads seeking help on the set, and where he communicated with colleagues and a “massive number” of his friends and relatives. Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica. “I suspected this stuff was going on, but this is the first time it’s been plainly exposed,” he said. “It seems so malicious, and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down, like it doesn’t care about its users.” Mr. Perry, 39, has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs. “It was an easy decision,” he said. “It’s not going to be the end of the world.” ______ Dan Clark A retired Navy veteran in Maine Mr. Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide. This week, he deleted both. “Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them, and it was a difficult decision to give it up,” he said. “But you have to stand for something, so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough.” Mr. Clark, 57, said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts, which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were “never evil or putting anybody down.” He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent. Before cutting the cord, Mr. Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number. More than 100 people reached out within three days. “There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact: phones, email, instant message, Gab, which is a social network that doesn’t censor anything,” he said. “Facebook is more obsolete than people would think.” ______ Alexandra Kleeman A writer on Staten Island Her first experience with fake news — a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump’s candidacy — altered the way Ms. Kleeman looked at Facebook. “It changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me,” she said. “I don’t have a great feeling when I log in.” The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone. “I’m not going to give them my engagement clicks,” Ms. Kleeman, 32, said. But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram. She doesn’t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public — she used to have a blog, she said. “But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don’t want, that freaks me out.” ______ Paul Musgrave An assistant professor in Amherst, Mass. Twitter makes Mr. Musgrave feel depressed about the world, but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon. As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Mr. Musgrave, 36, feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets. Facebook was more valuable to him as a “low-key, offstage networking tool,” a “replacement for end-of-year family newsletters” that allowed him to “passively keep up with people,” he said. He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster, a precursor to Facebook. But in 2016, while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana, Mr. Musgrave discovered a “poisonous swamp” of content on the site. The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing, he said. ""This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us, truly Big Brother-level, but it’s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication,” he said. ""That’s what’s really been scary.” Having deactivated his Facebook account, with plans to delete it, he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication. “I’m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches,” he said. “I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones, and even they don’t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces.” ______ Ben Greenzweig An entrepreneur in Westchester, N.Y. Once Mr. Greenzweig confirms that the 1,195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded, he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade. Mr. Greenzweig, 40, said the Cambridge Analytica news was “the last straw.” “We have surpassed the tipping point, where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost,” he said. “But I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be — a way to connect to community in a very global and local context.” A year ago, Mr. Greenzweig was an “extraordinarily active” Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends, managed several groups, took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts. But on Tuesday night, in his final post, he asked his network to connect with him through email, LinkedIn, Twitter or phone. “See everyone in the real world,” he wrote. "
36,"Since the Meredith Corporation announced its $2.8 billion deal for Time Inc. in November, the company has hinted that it might not hold on to Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money. Those titles, heavy with news, clashed with the company’s portfolio of lifestyle publications like Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle and Allrecipes. On Wednesday, Meredith made it official: In meetings with employees and a news release, the company said it planned to sell those four former Time Inc. titles, dealing yet another blow to the once-mighty magazine empire. “We love these brands and think they have great audiences,” Tom Harty, Meredith’s chief executive, said in an interview. But, he continued, “Our main portfolio that we built over time at Meredith has been focused on a different audience type.” The four magazines, he said, “will get more investment sooner and more management time with other potential owners.” Meredith also said on Wednesday that it was immediately laying off roughly 200 employees and that it would eliminate about 1,000 more positions over the next 10 months. The layoffs are part of the company’s plan to cut between $400 million and $500 million in costs over the next two years. The company has also said it planned to move some noneditorial Time Inc. functions to Des Moines, where Meredith is headquartered. The decision to sell Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money was widely expected. Still, the sale of what were some of Time Inc.’s most celebrated titles further signals the decline of the magazine industry. Though it had once helped shape American culture, Time Inc. has not just been swallowed up; it will soon be spit out in pieces. Mr. Harty said that multiple parties — the majority of which he called “nontraditional wealthy individuals” — had expressed interest in buying the magazines. He said that he expected to announce deals by the end of June. Meredith’s deal for Time Inc. was made possible by a $650 million infusion from Koch Equity Development, the private equity arm of the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The brothers, Mr. Harty said, “have expressed no interest” in acquiring any of the four titles. He also said the company did not plan to sell the titles to another possible suitor: David J. Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc., who is close with President Trump. Like many other magazines, Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money have battled vanishing advertising revenue and declining circulation. Sports Illustrated, once published weekly, has been reduced to every two weeks. Meredith scheduled an employee meeting in New York for March 28 and another in Des Moines on April 11, during which the company said it planned to unveil a reorganization of its sales business. In a memo, Mr. Harty and Jon Werther, the president of Meredith’s national media group, wrote, “We look forward to sharing our vision for the future and hearing what’s on your mind.” "
37,"WASHINGTON — The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web. The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites. The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government’s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election. With passage of the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Silicon Valley’s ability to stay out of the government’s reach suffered a rare setback. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law. “The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote. “It’s a wake-up call,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. “This is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it’s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.” "

39,"A leading AIDS researcher and proponent of medication-assisted therapy for addiction was appointed Wednesday to oversee the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Alex M. Azar II, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, announced that the agency’s new director would be Dr. Robert R. Redfield, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and co-founder of the Institute for Human Virology. “Dr. Redfield has dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients,” Mr. Azar said. “We are proud to welcome him as director of the world’s premier epidemiological agency.” Dr. Redfield, 66, will replace Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, who resigned in January after just six months on the job. Dr. Fitzgerald left amid criticism of her investments with her husband in tobacco and health care companies that posed potential conflicts of interest. Dr. Redfield oversees clinical care and research at the virology institute, which provides H.I.V. treatment to more than 6,000 patients in the Baltimore-Washington area and more than 1 million people in Africa and the Caribbean. The institute, with an annual budget of more than $105 million, also studies other chronic viral illnesses and cancer. In his statement, Dr. Azar called Dr. Redfield’s decades of science and clinical work — especially in the field of H.I.V./AIDS — “peerless.” He added that the treatment network Dr. Redfield operates in Baltimore for patients with H.I.V. and hepatitis C would help him “hit the ground running” on a top priority, “combating the opioid epidemic.” "
40,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year over congressional testimony in which he said he had no contacts with Russians, according to three people familiar with the case. In fact, Mr. Sessions later acknowledged, he had personally met the Russian ambassador to the United States during the campaign and was aware that George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser, had developed Russian ties, too. F.B.I. agents were aware of both inaccuracies in real time. And last March, when Congress asked the F.B.I. to investigate the attorney general, agents began doing so, two of the people said. Andrew G. McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director at the time, authorized the investigation, the two people said. Mr. McCabe himself was recently fired for showing “lack of candor” in an internal investigation. Mr. Sessions rejected Mr. McCabe’s appeal and fired him hours before his retirement was to take effect, jeopardizing his pension. The investigation into Mr. Sessions began before Robert S. Mueller III was appointed special counsel to investigate Russia-related matters. Mr. Sessions’s lawyer, Chuck Cooper, said no investigation is being conducted now. “The special counsel’s office has informed me that after interviewing the attorney general and conducting additional investigation, the attorney general is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress,” Mr. Cooper said in a statement. The investigation was first reported by ABC News. Perjury investigations based on congressional referrals are common, and the F.B.I. frequently investigates but seldom charges. But the fact that the attorney general himself was a focus of the Russia investigation, even if only peripherally and temporarily, shows how entangled the Trump administration has become in the case. Mr. Sessions is recused from any aspect of the investigation. "
41,"For much of the past week, Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users. On Wednesday, following widespread questions about his whereabouts, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, spoke with two New York Times reporters, Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose, about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse. Below is a transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. Sheera Frenkel: Did it come as a surprise to you, the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data? Mark Zuckerberg: Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data. If you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it’s a photo or a video or a text message — whether it’s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram — and you’re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with. Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar. Frenkel: It took quite a few days for your response to come out. Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post? Zuckerberg: The first thing is, I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened. I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner, but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate. The second thing is, the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don’t happen again. It’s not like there aren’t going to be other different kind of things we’ll also have to fix. But when there’s a certain problem, we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem. So the actions here that we’re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can’t do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too. So we’re going ahead and doing that. Even if you solve the problem going forward, there’s still this issue of: Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there, or other Kogans who, when the platform worked a certain way in the past, were there apps which could have gotten access to more information, and potentially sold it without us knowing, or done something that violated people’s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control. That’s why we spent a lot of time figuring out, O.K. here’s what it’s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had. For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity, we’re going to go do a full forensic audit, and make sure we have the capacity to do that, to make sure that other developers aren’t doing what Kogan did here. The third thing is, it’s really important that people know what apps they’ve authorized. A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we’re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven’t used them for three months. But it’s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of, here are all the apps you’ve connected to and authorized, here’s an easy way to deauthorize them, to revoke their permission to get access to your activity. Kevin Roose: Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica? Zuckerberg: Yes. We’re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared. Now, there’s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago, so we’re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected, even if we don’t know for certain that they were. It’s likely that we’ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation, that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this. Roose: Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you’ll be investigating? Zuckerberg: It will be in the thousands. Frenkel: Were those app developers notified that you’ll be investigating this yet? Zuckerberg: Just when I posted. And we’ll be reaching out in the near term. Frenkel: Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations? Zuckerberg: Yes, I would imagine we’re going to have to grow the team to work on this. Roose: You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information. What will be the terms of that contract, and what will be the penalties for violating it? Zuckerberg: So, the important thing there is that it’s a high-touch process. The specific point we were trying to make is that it’s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something. I guess technically, that would be a contract as well. The point of what we’re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person-to-person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data. That doesn’t mean that — if you’re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website, you can do that. If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation, or their sexual orientation, for data that could be very sensitive, we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people. Frenkel: We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered. Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in? Zuckerberg: The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm, that they don’t have any people’s data from our community and that they’ve deleted anything, including derivative data, that they might have. We’re working with the regulator in the U.K. on this, so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation. We’re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there’s no wrongdoing here. Roose: There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set. Why didn’t you suspend them then? Zuckerberg: So, we actually heard, I think it was at the end of 2015 — some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said. And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica, it was about this developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who had shared data with them. We took action immediately at that point. We banned Kogan’s app from the platform, we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn’t have the data, and weren’t using it in any of their operations. They gave us that formal certification. At the time, they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data, so we made that decision. Frenkel: In retrospect, do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted? Zuckerberg: Yes. They gave us a formal and legal certification, and it seems at this point that that was false. Again, we haven’t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can’t say definitively that they actually have data. I’ve just read all the same reports that you have, including in The New York Times, that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data, which is a strong enough signal for us to go on, and take action here. That’s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014. Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly, I think, does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data. Frenkel: Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently, that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data? Zuckerberg: Yes, we’re investigating that too. Roose: Are you worried about the #DeleteFacebook campaign that’s been going around? Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts, and are you worried that will be a trend? Zuckerberg: I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it’s not good. I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don’t feel good about using Facebook, that’s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify. Frenkel: We’re now heading into the 2018 midterms. Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won’t be used this way again? Zuckerberg: This is an incredibly important point. There’s no doubt that in 2016, there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community. Now, the good news here is that these problems aren’t necessarily rocket science. They’re hard, but they’re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they’re trying to do, you can really reduce the amount of false news, make it harder for foreign governments to interfere. One of the things that gives me confidence is that we’ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better. In the months after the 2016 election, there was the French election. The new A.I. tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France. In last year, in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new A.I. tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those. And that, actually, is something I haven’t talked about publicly before, so you’re the first people I’m telling about that. I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we’re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important. Frenkel: The Times reported that [Facebook chief security officer Alex] Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year. Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections? Zuckerberg: Sure. One of the important things we’ve done is, we want to unify all of our security efforts. And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos, and I’ll say something about him in a second. He’s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia. And I think he has done very good work, and I’m hopeful he’ll be engaged for a while here on that. One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It’s not all A.I., right? There’s certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we’re going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We’ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now. So it’s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal. The last thing I’d add on this. Take things like false news. You know, a lot of it is really spam, if you think about it. It’s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the ’90s, now they’re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads. There are some pretty basic policy decisions we’ve made, like O.K., if you’re anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can’t put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else. Roose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users — do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks? Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that — our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can’t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned. Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That’s certainly something we’ve thought about over time. But I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free. Roose: Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s head of News Feed, recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook’s role in the violence in Myanmar. You’ve said you’re “outraged” about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world, are you losing any sleep? Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world? Zuckerberg: That’s a good question. I think, you know, we’re doing something here which is unprecedented, in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them, and connect across boundaries. I think what we’re seeing is, there are new challenges that I don’t think anyone had anticipated before. If you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I’d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other’s elections, there’s no way I thought that’s what I’d be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room. I don’t know that it’s possible to know every issue that you’re going to face down the road. But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up, and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them, and do a good job for our community. It’s certainly true that, over the course of Facebook, I’ve made all kinds of different mistakes, whether that’s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes. We’ve launched product after product that didn’t work. I spend most of my time looking forward, trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today, because I think that’s what people in our community would want. "
42,"This column has been updated to reflect news developments. Gee, we’ve been hearing a ton about the turmoil in the president’s legal team. You probably have questions. Is this something else I have to think about in the middle of the night when I’m staring at the ceiling? Because really, I’ve got enough. We’re talking about chaos and turnover among the people defending Donald Trump in his multitudinous legal battles. If that’s the kind of thing that keeps you awake at night, it’s time to prioritize. Have a drink and relax. I need to know immediately if I am paying to protect the president from Stormy Daniels. No, the people getting taxpayer salaries work in the White House Counsel’s Office, and their job is to advise the president about what’s legal. Like, whether or not he could sign a bill banning imported scallops. Or, say, sabotage the Russia probe. The current counsel, Don McGahn, reportedly threatened to resign when Trump wanted to can Robert Mueller. I’ve been looking for somebody to admire in the White House. Should it be Don McGahn? Up to you. He was formerly a member of the Federal Election Commission who hated campaign-finance reform so much he once tore up the F.E.C. rule book at a meeting and threw the shredded chunks at a Democrat. He lobbied Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. He was an enabler on that immigrant travel ban. On the other hand, he used to be a guitarist in a rock band. Everybody used to be a guitarist in a rock band. But about the president’s team: I know a lot of recent law school graduates who are desperate for jobs. They’re cleaning tables at Arby’s. Should I tell them there’s a lot of turnover and they ought to send in a résumé? "
43,"WASHINGTON — President Trump indirectly criticized Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, on Wednesday for the continuing investigation into Russia’s 2016 campaign meddling, even as a former C.I.A. director said during a morning news show that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may have compromising information on Mr. Trump. After a weekend of attacking Mr. Mueller — against the advice of his own lawyers — Mr. Trump picked up again in early morning tweets when he said he was quoting a former Harvard professor stating that Mr. Mueller should never have been appointed to be the special counsel to investigate Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. That investigation has expanded into inquiries into Mr. Trump’s aides and his own business dealings. “I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council,” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post that he attributed to a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, Alan M. Dershowitz. It was not immediately clear on Wednesday which remarks of Mr. Dershowitz’s the president was quoting. An interview with Mr. Dershowitz on Fox News on Tuesday and an opinion piece by Mr. Dershowitz published on Wednesday did not include the exact phrasing that Mr. Trump used in his tweets. And the language was not found in a search of Mr. Dershowitz’s cable news appearances over the past week. "
44,"WASHINGTON — Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee pressured Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, on Wednesday to speed up key election security measures, even as she trumpeted the adoption of important improvements ahead of November’s midterm elections. Ms. Nielsen told the senators, who are investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, that the department made significant strides in recent months working with state and local election officials to improve communication about threats and share cybersecurity resources. Those efforts include comprehensive risk assessments and cyberscans meant to identify vulnerabilities in election systems. But under questioning, Ms. Nielsen signaled that one of those undertakings, to grant full security clearances to state election officials so they could receive classified information on cybersecurity threats in a timely way, had been slow going. Of the up to 150 state election officials designated to receive clearances, only about 20 have them, she said. In the meantime, Ms. Nielsen said, the department would share necessary threat information with relevant state officials regardless of their clearance. Republicans and Democrats on the committee made clear that they expected more. “When I listen to your testimony, I hear no sense of urgency to really get on top of this issue,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Wednesday’s session was the secretive committee’s first public hearing designed to scrutinize findings from its year-old investigation into Russia’s interference campaign. It followed the committee’s release  on Tuesday of a set of recommendations for state and federal officials to shore up the ballot box. "

46,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said on Wednesday that he and President Trump could sit down for a three-way summit meeting with Kim Jong-un if their individual meetings with the North Korean leader on denuclearizing his country proceed well in the coming weeks. Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim are planning an inter-Korean summit in late April at Peace House, a South Korean conference hall inside Panmunjom, the so-called truce village that straddles the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, separating the two Koreas. That meeting is expected to be followed by a planned Trump-Kim summit meeting by May. If that meeting takes place, Mr. Trump will be the first-ever sitting American president to meet a North Korean leader; Washington and Pyongyang are still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War was halted with a truce, rather than a peace treaty. While presiding over a meeting Wednesday of government officials preparing for the inter-Korean summit, Mr. Moon attached great significance to the venue for his coming meeting with Mr. Kim. “The North Korea-United States summit, which will follow the inter-Korean summit, will itself be a momentous event in world history,” Mr. Moon said. “Depending on where the meeting takes place, it will look even more dramatic, and depending on progress, there can be a three-way summit among South and North Korea and the United States.” Panmunjom and the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ were created in the Korean War armistice of 1953 and remain symbols of the unending hostilities on the divided Korean Peninsula. Peace House is south of the border inside the DMZ, and a visit there by Mr. Kim would make him the first North Korean leader to step across the border since the war. "
47,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate increase of 2018 at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday as the United States economy continues to strengthen. ■ Wall Street analysts surveyed by CNBC unanimously expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. ■ Fed watchers are divided over how many increases to expect in 2018 as the Fed continues its steady march back toward more historically normal interest rates. Some analysts believe that Fed officials will signal they are on course for a total of three rate increases in 2018, as they did at the Fed’s December meeting. Others expect a turn toward the hawkish, with an indication of four increases. ■ This will be Jerome H. Powell’s first policy meeting and news conference as Fed chairman. Mr. Powell, a former Fed governor, succeeded Janet L. Yellen last month. Analysts do not expect him to deviate from Ms. Yellen’s preferred path of slow and steady rate increases, nor to wade too deeply into controversial topics, such as the tariffs announced by President Trump. The Fed, under Ms. Yellen, pursued gradual rate increases and a highly choreographed sell-off of the portfolio of bonds it bought to help prop up the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell was among the governors who voted for that approach, and he is expected to reaffirm it, particularly if economic growth continues to accelerate and unemployment remains at or below the 4.1 percent level it reached in February. "
48,"MENLO PARK, Calif. — John Tenanes, Facebook’s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company’s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook’s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about. He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. “There will be housing there,” he points. “There will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.” In just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life. Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: “We want to balance our growth with the community’s needs.” Willow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley’s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office. The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers. "
49,"LONDON — The German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans has had a decades-long love affair with printed media. Since making his name in the 1990s taking pictures of night life in Hamburg, Germany, for the British counterculture magazine i-D, his work has appeared in countless publications — from fashion titles to newspaper supplements — as well as in galleries and museums. Mr. Tillmans has long been concerned with how his work appears on the printed page. The artist, the first photographer to win the Turner Prize, in 2000, had a large, midcareer retrospective at Tate Modern in London last year. Titled “Wolfgang Tillmans: 2017,” the exhibition delved into the photographer’s longstanding interest in the representation of truth in media and politics. Mr. Tillmans’s latest project put him in the editor’s chair. He is the guest editor of “Jahresring”, a collection of essays about art and culture published annually in Germany since 1954. This year’s edition, “What Is Different?”, explores the increasing rejection of facts in today’s political and social discourse, with a series of essays and interviews with activists, academics and politicians, interspersed with photographs by Mr. Tillmans. In an interview, Mr. Tillmans explained why he embarked on the project and spoke about the role of art in a post-truth world. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. "
50,"Let’s get one thing straight: I am not a fan of Facebook. I’m confident that social media is a cancer on our private lives and a source of derangement in our politics. I take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections, and that they’ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data. I take a certain mordant pleasure in watching Mark Zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late-Obama-era liberalism. But the liberal establishment’s fixation on Facebook’s 2016 sins — first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the Trump campaign or its appendages — still feels like a classic example of blaming something new because it’s new when it’s the old thing that mattered more. Or of blaming something new because you thought that “new” meant “good,” that the use of social-media data by campaigns would always help tech-savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals — and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the Trump era a reality. No doubt all the activity on Facebook and the apparent use of Facebook’s data had some impact, somewhere, on Trump’s surprise victory. But the media format that really made him president, the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited, wasn’t Zuckerberg’s unreal kingdom; it wasn’t even the Twitter platform where Trump struts and frets and rages daily. It was that old pre-internet standby, broadcast and cable television, and especially TV news. Start with the fake news that laid the foundation for Trump’s presidential campaign — not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your Facebook feed, but the sort broadcast in prime time by NBC, under the label of reality TV. Yes, as media sophisticates we’re all supposed to know that “reality” means “fake,” but in the beginning nobody marketed “The Apprentice” that way; across most of its run you saw a much-bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed, week after week and season after season, as a titan of industry, the for-serious greatest businessman in the world. Where did so many people originally get the idea that Trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government? Not from Russian bots or targeted social media ad buys, but from a prime-time show that sold itself as real, and sold him as a business genius. Forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders; forget white nationalists and birthers: The core Trump demographic might just have been Republicans who watched “The Apprentice,” who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them. That was step one in the Trump hack of television media. Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign. Yes, his fame also boosted him on social media, but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds; with television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump’s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.

Here’s what you need to know: • Against aides’ advice, President Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin on Tuesday for his victory in the Russian presidential election. The White House said the call, made five days after the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russia, had focused on “shared interests.” They did not include election meddling or the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. Other leaders, foreign and American, have also congratulated Mr. Putin. But not the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell: “When I look at a Russian election, what I see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results. Calling him wouldn’t have been high on my list.” • Separately, Mr. Trump reinforced his commitment to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on Tuesday. "

54,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The election of Donald Trump was so shocking — and damaging to the country — that many people went looking for a scapegoat. There was a long list of candidates. Hillary’s flawed campaign. Bernie’s long campaign. The Electoral College. The media. Sexist voters. Racist voters. Economically anxious voters. Nonvoters. James Comey. Anthony Weiner. Vladimir Putin. Twitter. And Facebook. By spreading false news stories and giving a megaphone to Russian trolls, Facebook — a vastly larger social network than Twitter — played a meaningful role in the presidential campaign. Of course, so did many other suspects on the list. There was no single factor that allowed Trump to win. It was a confluence. If anything, the role of Facebook and its executives has sometimes been exaggerated. “Whatever role they played surely pales in relative importance to a whole host of other factors,” Ben Thompson, the author of the Stratechery blog, pointed out yesterday (in his subscriber-only newsletter), “and it makes sense that Facebook executives would feel persecuted on that front.” But, as Thompson explains, “The problem comes when arguing about details results in missing the big picture: fake news on Facebook may not have been the deciding factor many think it was, but Facebook’s effect on the news surely mattered.” And Facebook’s executives have indeed missed this big picture, claiming that their company played no significant role in Trump’s victory.

56,"Arranged marriages. Whispered warnings. Outright theft. For years, American companies have complained that the Chinese government finds ways to get them to hand over their most valuable trade secrets. Those companies — which usually complain anonymously, fearing Chinese retribution — have found a sympathetic ear in the Trump administration. American trade officials on Thursday cited those practices as a major motivation for their plans to levy tariffs and penalties on $60 billion in Chinese imports and to take a tougher stance on the vast and lucrative trade relationship between the two countries. The report outlines in blunt terms how intellectual property — everything from product designs and sensitive data to general know-how — has become a point of contention in global trade relations, joining longstanding areas of dispute like steel. The landscape is more complex than the Trump administration’s complaint suggests. American companies sometimes willingly strike deals with Chinese partners because they feel China is too profitable to miss out on. And in some cases, Chinese companies have shown they still have much to learn, even after cozying up to American partners. In some industries, like car production, China has long required foreign companies to team up with local partners. Auto giants like General Motors and Ford, for example, make cars in Chinese factories that are jointly owned by Chinese partners. Foreign companies have long complained that they are simply training future rivals. Japanese and European businesses say  Chinese rail companies used technology from joint ventures to become giants in high-speed rail. Trade rules limit how much technology the Chinese partner can get from a joint venture. But some American businesses and the Trump administration say Chinese officials often demand technology under the table. "
57,"WASHINGTON — The much-watched antitrust trial between the Justice Department and AT&T began on Thursday, with opening statements that presented starkly different visions for how the company’s blockbuster merger with Time Warner would fit into a media industry upturned by the internet. Before a packed courtroom with some of the industry’s leading figures, the two sides zeroed in on the case’s central question: Whether the deal would force consumers to pay more to watch their favorite shows on Time Warner cable channels like CNN and TNT. The Justice Department, which is suing to block the $85 billion deal, argued that AT&T, with its nationwide wireless and satellite TV business, could use Time Warner’s content as a “weapon” by raising the licensing fees those channels command. The government said that the merged company could charge rival cable and streaming companies more for popular channels. Those increases, the agency argued, would be passed on to consumers. “If the merger goes forward, consumers all across America will be worse off as a result,” said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department’s lead lawyer. AT&T and Time Warner said they would disprove the notion that the deal would raise prices. And they said that the combined company could compete with the giants of Silicon Valley: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google. Those companies now produce their own shows and distribute them on their popular websites. They also dominate the market for the advertisements that run with videos streamed over the internet. "
58,"WASHINGTON — President Trump named John R. Bolton, a hard-line former American ambassador to the United Nations, as his third national security adviser on Thursday, continuing a shake-up that creates one of the most hawkish national security teams of any White House in recent history. Mr. Bolton will replace Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the battle-tested Army officer who was tapped last year to stabilize a turbulent foreign policy operation but who never developed a comfortable relationship with the president. The move, which was sudden but not unexpected, signals a more confrontational approach in American foreign policy at a time when Mr. Trump faces mounting challenges, including from Iran and North Korea. The president replaced Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson last week with the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, a former Army officer and Tea Party congressman who has spoken about regime change in Pyongyang and about ripping up the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Bolton, an outspoken advocate of military action who served in the George W. Bush administration, has called for action against Iran and North Korea. In an interview on Thursday on Fox News, soon after his appointment was announced in a presidential tweet, he declined to say whether Mr. Trump should go through with a planned meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.  "
59,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson bade farewell to the State Department on Thursday in a brief and barbed speech that called for an era of respect and kindness after he was dismissed by presidential tweet. “This can be a very mean-spirited town,” Mr. Tillerson said, a remark that generated a rare burst of applause from employees in a department that never embraced his distant and disorganized leadership. “But you don’t have to choose to participate in that,” he continued as the clapping crescendoed in the formal, flag-draped entrance of the State Department’s headquarters. “Each of us gets to choose the person we want to be, and the way we want to be treated, and the way we want to treat others.” President Trump fired Mr. Tillerson last week and announced in a post on Twitter that the nation’s top diplomat would be replaced by Mike Pompeo, director of the C.I.A. Mr. Tillerson had just returned from a weeklong trip to Africa, where he contracted an intestinal illness, and was surprised by the decision, said his spokesman, Steve Goldstein. The first Mr. Tillerson knew of his firing was when an aide showed him the president’s tweet, Mr. Goldstein said. Later that day, Mr. Goldstein and several other aides who were close to Mr. Tillerson also were fired by the White House. Officials said John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, had tried to warn Mr. Tillerson in a phone call days earlier by saying, cryptically, “you may get a tweet.” White House officials also added that Mr. Tillerson had been on the toilet at the time of the call. "
60,"Last week, after more than 12 years of marriage, Vanessa Trump filed for an uncontested divorce in Manhattan from Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president. In a joint statement, the couple said: “We have decided to go our separate ways.” “An uncontested divorce is the much saner and healthier way of doing things, which makes it unusual for the Trump family,” said Kenneth Burrows, a New York matrimonial lawyer who is not involved in the case. Precisely because of the Trump family’s reputation for chaos — not to mention that the Trump Organization, which is being run by Mr. Trump and his brother Eric, has been subpoenaed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III — the divorce announcement only served to foster curiosity about Ms. Trump, who has been something of a lesser-known member of the family. One detail that has been closely scrutinized is Ms. Trump’s selection of a lawyer, David Feureisen, who has a background in civil, criminal and divorce cases but is not a boldface name. He works in Westchester County, N.Y., and has a low profile in the media. (He did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment.) In addition to handling Ms. Trump’s divorce, Mr. Feureisen also represented Ms. Trump’s mother, Bonnie Kay Haydon, in a recent real estate transaction. "

62,"To the Editor: Re “Facebook’s Chief Admits Mistakes in Guarding Data” (front page, March 22): Bravo to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, for apologizing for his mistake. “But that’s the least we can expect,” one might argue. Yes, it is, but it’s still a rare occurrence in business and elsewhere. “They’re still just words,” goes another objection. “He needs to back up his apology with a strategy for correcting his company’s mistakes.” Yes, he does. Nevertheless, it behooves us all to acknowledge Mr. Zuckerberg’s willingness to take responsibility for Facebook’s grave errors and to make sure they don’t happen again. The more we recognize a leader’s courage in being accountable, the more likely it is that accountability will be valued and cultivated. BRUCE WEINSTEIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Facebook claims “it’s free and always will be.” Recent events once again prove that if you don’t have to pay for a product, you are the product. Perhaps people might be willing to pay a small monthly fee for a more secure social network service that protects their data from companies like Cambridge Analytica. KAREN SMITH, BROOKLYN To the Editor: Various Times articles over the past several days rightly focus on the misuse of private Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign. However, a key point is not being mentioned: The formulas developed by Cambridge Analytica to explain and predict people’s personality traits and behaviors are most likely hogwash. For over 40 years I have worked for academic and public and private sector organizations as a specialist in personality assessment for the purpose of explaining and predicting behaviors. "
63,"WASHINGTON — House Intelligence Committee Republicans said Thursday that opposition to Donald J. Trump by the party’s national security establishment had opened the door for two foreign policy advisers whose interactions with Russian intelligence prompted F.B.I. scrutiny. The Republicans said they had found no evidence that either man, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, had colluded with the Russians, despite the F.B.I.’s interest in the men. Nor did campaign advisers and aides provide evidence that any member of the Trump campaign had colluded either, according to summaries of 44 findings and more than two dozen recommendations the committee voted to release Thursday. “When asked directly, none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government,” one of the findings read. First previewed last week, the findings are the culmination of a year-old investigation by the committee. Democrats say the Republicans hurried the investigation, ignored crucial evidence and failed to follow obvious leads in an effort to clear Mr. Trump. Other findings were less controversial and reflected the consensus position of American intelligence agencies and both parties on Capitol Hill. Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, who led the inquiry, said that the committee had found “a pattern of Russian active measures in the United States, both through cyberattacks and their use of social media to sow discord.” “This poses a serious threat to future U.S. elections, including the primary elections that are already underway,” he said in a statement. “It’s critical to release this information now to protect our country and our elections from foreign interference.” "
64,"HONG KONG — A brewing trade war between China and the United States sent markets reeling across Asia on Friday, following a sell-off on Wall Street overnight. Investors drove stocks into red territory from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Tokyo and Seoul as they digested news that the Trump administration would impose stiff tariffs on Chinese goods. Markets fell further as Beijing announced retaliatory tariffs on more than 100 items, including American pork and wine. By the close of trading on Friday, shares had fallen 3.4 percent in Shanghai and 4 percent in Shenzhen. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the market. South Korean stocks fell 3.1 percent. “This can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,” Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients. Europe looked poised for a similar sell-off, with futures flashing red for major markets. Markets were following the lead of stocks in the United States, which fell for a second straight day on Thursday, as President Trump announced $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports. After wobbling throughout the day, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index turned decisively lower in the last hour of trading, closing down by 2.5 percent. That put the index into negative territory for the year. "
65,"WASHINGTON — Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, took responsibility on Thursday for buying a $31,000 dining room set for his office, two days after saying his wife and assistant oversaw a purchase that has jeopardized his place in President Trump’s cabinet. Mr. Carson faced withering criticism from Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the Department of Housing and Urban Development. One senator, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, suggested that he regretted being one of the few Democrats to support the secretary’s nomination a year ago. “I voted to confirm you,” said Mr. Brown, who is up for re-election this year. “Four other Democrats on this committee voted to confirm you. I’m not sure I made the right decision.” In recent days, Mr. Carson’s aides have repeatedly advised him to apologize for the purchase, arguing that doing so was the only way to move on, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. But Mr. Carson, who has privately fumed about what he regards as the unfairness of being singled out for criticism, resisted doing so until Thursday’s hearing, when one of the panel’s Republicans, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, gently prodded him to be more contrite. “I take responsibility,” Mr. Carson said. Later, he suggested the episode had been a personal ordeal, saying that he modeled his reaction to the criticism on advice that Jesus gave in the Sermon on the Mount, which he summarized as “don’t worry about what people are saying about you, and do the right thing.” Mr. Carson’s tone was markedly different on Tuesday, when he told a House subcommittee that he had dealt himself out of the decision-making chain on the dining room set, despite internal department emails showing that he had participated in the selection of specific pieces of furniture last summer.

Glance at the current TV listings, and you may think you’ve time-traveled back to the ’90s, with “Full House,” “The X-Files” and “Will & Grace” all airing new episodes in the past year. On Tuesday, ABC’s era-defining family sitcom “Roseanne” joins the nostalgia fest with a two-episode premiere of its first new season since 1997. True to form, the revival looks to be very much of its time: Its acerbic matriarch, played by Roseanne Barr, is a Trump supporter; her grandson is gender-fluid. “Roseanne” cranked out 222 episodes during its original nine-season run. So, the prospect of revisiting Roseanne and her clan in advance of their comeback can seem daunting. Luckily, it only takes a few episodes to understand what made this love letter to the working-class American family so special. This selection of highlights represents “Roseanne” at its smartest, funniest, and most poignant, and you should easily be able to get through these 22-minute episodes before the show returns at 8 p.m. on Tuesday. All the original episodes are available to stream on Amazon Prime Video. “Life and Stuff” Great sitcoms don’t always start with great pilots.

The premiere also features a young George Clooney, in his first appearance as Roseanne’s boss at the plastics factory. "
70,"Only a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions — the election of its leaders — would have seemed even more absurd. Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it. “Data drives all that we do.” That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users. The heart of Cambridge Analytica’s power is an enormous information warehouse — as many as 5,000 data points on each of more than 230 million Americans, according to recent reporting, a fact the company proudly confirms on its website. Its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies a vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms, and by an expanding data-mining culture operating without restrictions. That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one. An adequate ethics of data for today would include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms. It would also establish cultural expectations, fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges, requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them, not after they have already profiled, categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people. Students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science would also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash. "

72,"ALBANY — On the day that Cynthia Nixon officially entered New York’s race for governor, the state Republican Party did not exactly keep its poker face. Up on Twitter went a photograph of Ed Cox, its chairman, in the famed V-for-victory pose of Richard Nixon, with his slogan: “Nixon’s the One.” (That Mr. Cox is the former president’s son-in-law made the joke even more piquant.) Ms. Nixon's candidacy — presenting a Democratic primary challenge for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo — has been a rare jolt of good news for the Republicans. “When you see people from every end of the political spectrum thinking it’s time for a change, that’s extremely important,” said State Senator John A. DeFrancisco, 71, a Syracuse-area Republican running for that party’s nomination. “And it does not bode well for Governor Cuomo, no matter who the candidate is.” Democrats hold enormous advantages in general elections in New York, with a more than 2-to-1 edge in registered voters, and a nearly two-decade-long winning streak. The last Republican to win a statewide race was Gov. George E. Pataki in 2002. "
73,"The $1.3 trillion spending plan passed early Friday by Congress delivered a broad rebuke to President Trump’s vision for shaking up government, ignoring many of his ideas for cutting domestic programs and, in some cases, expressly barring him from accomplishing his goals. Last year, in his first budget request for fiscal 2018, Mr. Trump envisioned a drastic reordering of government priorities, in which a large increase in military spending would be matched by deep cuts to foreign aid, the diplomatic corps, education, environmental cleanup and other domestic programs — many of which he would eliminate. The bill now heads to the president’s desk. Here’s a breakdown of what’s in it and what it means. The package that will arrive on Mr. Trump’s desk this week for what he has conceded will be a grudging signature contains a sizable increase for the military but few of the reductions he had sought. It reflects the triumph of politically palatable bipartisan deals for lawmakers who are preparing to face voters in midterm elections over the audacious promises of a president who has styled himself as a change agent, but has been unable to persuade a Congress controlled by his own party. The “big, beautiful wall”? Not this year. Deep cuts to environmental programs, clean energy initiatives and biomedical research? Congress said no, thanks. Zeroing out federal arts programs? Lawmakers gave them a modest increase. “Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter this week, venting his frustration about the bill, which he briefly threatened to torpedo on Wednesday in the final hours before it was unveiled. The administration sought to put the best face on the measure on Thursday, highlighting the large military funding increase and spending on the president’s priorities — immigration enforcement, school safety, infrastructure and combating opioid abuse — even as his top advisers conceded it fell short of what they had sought.

75,"PARIS — When people used to ask me what I missed about America, I would say, “The optimism.” I grew up in the land of hope, then moved to one whose catchphrases are “It’s not possible” and “Hell is other people.” I walked around Paris feeling conspicuously chipper. But lately I’ve had a kind of emotional whiplash. France is starting to seem like an upbeat, can-do country, while Americans are less sure that everything will be O.K. Cynicism has deep roots in France. In the 18th century, Voltaire mocked optimists for their naïveté and celebrated pessimists for their lucidity. He’s still part of the national curriculum for French eighth-graders, and the râleur — the dissatisfied, grumpy whiner — remains a national archetype. Among intellectuals, if you say that everything is going badly, “everyone says, ‘Look how intelligent he is,’” explained Frédéric Lenoir, author of “Happiness: A Philosopher’s Guide.” Since I’ve lived here, polls have regularly shown that the French are more pessimistic about their country’s future than people in Afghanistan and Iraq. The French haven’t become magically cheerful, but there’s a creeping sense that hope isn’t idiotic, and life can actually improve. As is common with a new president, there was a jump in optimism after Emmanuel Macron was elected last year. But this time, optimism has remained strong, and in January it hit an eight-year high. It helps that France’s economy is finally growing more and that Mr. Macron has made good on promises ranging from overhauling the labor laws to shrinking class sizes at kindergartens in disadvantaged areas. For those still mourning France’s lost glory as a global power, he has taken the rhetorical lead on climate change and the European Union. And they feel lucky by comparison, as they watch Britain march off a plank with Brexit, and read about American children being killed at school. Voters here still have grievances, and many are reserving judgment. But in the French context, that’s practically euphoria. “The France of the optimists has won, and is dragging the other part of France toward its own side,” said Claudia Senik, an economist who heads the Well-Being Observatory, an academic think tank here.

Within the last month, two of these financial-service providers were accused of deceiving retirement account customers, while Wells Fargo revealed that it was the subject of an investigation exploring whether it made questionable recommendations to 401(k) customers, among other things. It isn’t easy for consumers to figure out what kind of professional they can trust with their money, especially when any annuity salesperson with a business card can masquerade as a bona fide financial adviser. For a while, it seemed like a new consumer protection that took partial effect last June would provide some clarity: It requires financial professionals, including brokers and insurance agents, to act in their customers’ best interests when handling their retirement money. The goal of the rule, which was implemented by the Obama administration despite strong opposition from the financial services industry, was to make it easier for retirement savers to trust that their financial advisers were looking out for them — and not profiting at their expense. Before the rule, brokers only had to ensure that their recommendations were suitable, which is a lower standard. But the future of the rule remains uncertain and is likely to become even more contested in the months ahead. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that the Labor Department, which oversees retirement accounts and created the so-called fiduciary rule, overstepped its authority and struck it down. "
78,"LONDON — In recent history as narrated by President Trump, the United States has been fleeced and humiliated by savvier nations unrestrained by naïve notions like global trading rules. Predatory powers have exploited American weakness to steal factory jobs, sowing despair. The primary villain in this narrative is China, the country that Mr. Trump has placed at the center of the combative trade policy he is advancing. Steep tariffs on steel and aluminum set to take effect this week are portrayed as targeting China, even as they mostly hit other powers. In a broadening of the battle to electronics and clothing, the Trump administration is readying at least $50 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on imported Chinese goods. If these demonstrations of muscle are intended to strengthen the American position in grappling with China, trade experts increasingly fret that Mr. Trump’s policies are doing the opposite: They potentially diminish the place of the United States in the world by alienating allies, undermining the potential for collective action among countries nursing shared grievances with China. “It’s going to be far more effective if they go together,” said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. “The fact that the United States is doing all of this alone, it does seem to be weakening the U.S. position.” China’s staggering economic development has indeed been propelled by trading practices that exploit gaps in international rules or breach them outright. The Communist Party government still subsidizes key industries, lavishes credit on state-owned companies and imposes barriers against foreign competitors. In many major economies, steel makers are contending with a glut of low-cost product, much of it made in China. Western businesses must acquiesce to Beijing’s wishes, sharing cutting-edge technology as a condition of entry to the Chinese marketplace. Frequently, the incoming technology is folded into Chinese goods that land on world markets, forcing innovators to compete against their own creations. "
79,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has called for a wall along the border with Mexico to stop undocumented immigrants and drugs from entering the United States. But Border Patrol agents on the front lines say they need more technology and additional personnel to curb the illegal traffic, according to a report released on Thursday by Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The report was based on internal Customs and Border Protection documents from the 2017 fiscal year. It concluded that less than one half of 1 percent of the agents’ suggestions to secure the Southwest border mentioned the need for a wall. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the committee’s top Democrat, said the report reinforced what she had previously heard from border agents and leaders at Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol. “We can’t let politics get in the way of our efforts to strengthen border security and protect our country,” said Ms. McCaskill, referring to Mr. Trump’s promises to build a border wall. Officials at Customs and Border Protection called the report inaccurate, saying it confused how agents’ feedback about security vulnerabilities is used to develop programs to counter threats. The documents show that the Border Patrol identified what it called 902 “capability gaps,” or vulnerabilities, on the Southwest border. The word “wall” was suggested as a possible solution for just three of those gaps. "
80,"Over the next six months, Democratic voters will be asked again and again whether their party’s candidates should hew to the center or move to the left. How voters answer that question will help shape the strategic plans of the dozen or more Democrats jockeying to beat President Trump in 2020. The intraparty tension has been simmering for months. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, goaded party centrists last May when he declared abortion a Democratic litmus test: “Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health,” Perez said in a statement. “That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.” Perez later backed off. But in July, Ben Ray Luján, a congressman from New Mexico who is the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, declared that not only would the D.C.C.C. support anti-abortion Democrats, he was already working closely with the Blue Dog caucus — the party’s 18-member conservative House faction, which includes several members who oppose abortion rights — to recruit candidates for 2018. “There is not a litmus test for Democratic candidates,” Luján told The Hill. “You need to make sure you have candidates that fit the district, that can win in these districts across America.” “The Democratic Party cannot give an inch in their opposition to this Administration,” Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, countered. That is “especially true when it comes to abortion rights. The Democratic Party cannot and will not win if it turns its back on women and our fundamental rights.” "

83,"President Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and, against the advice of national security advisers, congratulated the Russian president on his re-election to a fourth term. The New York Times has obtained a transcript of the call, published below: The President: Pozdravlyayu! President Putin: Spasibo, Donald. The President: What’s your secret? President Putin: No secret, Donald. My people love me. I win 77 percent of vote. The President: You know, I also won 77 percent of the vote, if you don’t count all the illegal Mexicans who voted for Hillary. Plus the gays and blacks. How’d you do it? President Putin: I arranged for my only serious political adversary, Aleksei Navalny, to be convicted on trumped-up charges of embezzlement so he would be banned from running against me. The President: Love that. It’s like, “Lock her up,” Russia-style. President Putin: Yes, though you should be careful to disguise your most outrageous acts in clothing of scrupulous legality and strict bureaucratic procedure. That way masses think everything is correct and nothing is political. Like you did with this man, McCabe. Very well played, if I may say. The President: What a loser! I went after him because he was Comey’s boy and his wife’s in Hillary’s pocket. Next thing I know, it turns out he isn’t such an angel and maybe he did lie to the investigators. I didn’t see it coming but like I always say, I’ve got great instincts. President Putin: You must continue this, Donald. After Comey and McCabe it is essential to gain total control of security services. "

87,"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday, saying in a tweet that Mr. Biden “would go down fast and hard” if the two men ever physically fought. Mr. Trump was responding to Mr. Biden’s comments on Tuesday about how, if he was in high school, Mr. Biden would “beat the hell” out of Mr. Trump for disrespecting women. Mr. Biden, speaking at a University of Miami rally to combat sexual assault, said, “A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, ‘I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it,’ ” referring to an Access Hollywood audio recording in which Mr. Trump is heard boasting about kissing and groping women without their consent. Mr. Biden said when he was asked if he would like to debate Mr. Trump, he said, “If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” The back-and-forth blustering between two men in their 70s comes a day after Mr. Trump criticized two of his predecessors, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, for not being able to improve relations with Russia. And Mr. Trump is facing revived sexual misconduct accusations after a New York state judge ruled that a defamation lawsuit from a woman who has said Mr. Trump made unwanted sexual advances could go forward. Mr. Biden, who has been a longtime advocate for anti-sexual assault policies, has been on the road lately, campaigning for Democrats. Earlier this month, he campaigned for a Democrat in western Pennsylvania who won a special congressional election in a district that had previously been considered Trump country. Mr. Trump campaigned for the Republican candidate who lost. Democrats see the loss as an indicator of a potential wave of Democratic wins in the upcoming midterm elections. There has been talk of a possible 2020 presidential run, which could pit Mr. Biden, 75, directly against Mr. Trump, 71. Mr. Biden considered running in 2016, but decided not to because of the death of his son. At the time, Mr. Trump said he thought Mr. Biden made the right choice for his family and that he would rather run against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump has previously tweeted about Mr. Biden while he was vice president, commenting on Mr. Biden’s gaffes. In 2012, Mr. Trump said he felt sorry for Mr. Biden’s communications team. "
88,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration began imposing stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum early on Friday morning. But it granted a brief exemption to some allies, and in a twist, said it might impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States. The White House detailed the decision in a pair of presidential proclamations late Thursday night. They gave allies that won exemptions a May 1 deadline to negotiate “satisfactory alternative means” to address what the administration calls the threat to United States national security resulting from its current levels of steel and aluminum imports. The exempted group includes Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. President Trump also said in the proclamation that he would “consider” directing Customs and Border Protection to put in place a quota on imports from the exempted countries before the May 1 deadline, “if necessary and appropriate.” Mr. Trump wrote that he would “take into account all steel articles imports since Jan. 1, 2018, in setting the amount of such quota.” The announcement also left the door open for other allies that did not win exemptions, most notably Japan, to negotiate with the administration over tariffs. “Any country not listed in this proclamation with which we have a security relationship remains welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports of steel articles from that country,” Mr. Trump wrote. The shift in strategy reflects a few chaotic weeks in which foreign governments lobbied, cajoled and  threatened Washington to win exemptions from the 25 percent tariffs on steel and the 10 percent tariffs on aluminum. Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump, said Thursday in a television appearance that the White House would impose quotas. "
89,"LOS ANGELES — In the nearly two decades since the original lineup of the Smashing Pumpkins succumbed to rock-star clichés, crumbling under the weight of drugs, expectations and egos, the band’s lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Billy Corgan has kept himself plenty busy. A confident mastermind with omnivorous ambitions, Mr. Corgan, 51, became a published poet; a professional wrestling executive and owner; a prolific Myspace and LiveJournal user; a curator of vintage photographs; an amateur talking head and recurring guest on Alex Jones’s Infowars programming; the proprietor of a Chicago-area tea shop; and a cat magazine cover star, among other side-hustles. There was no shortage of music either, including two solo albums and one with Zwan, as well as various iterations of the Smashing Pumpkins that Mr. Corgan has kept afloat since declaring in a 2005 full-page newspaper ad: “I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams.” Yet despite reviving the Pumpkins brand with additional albums and regular touring over the years, Mr. Corgan, as the only constant member, has never again sniffed the creative or commercial success of the band’s heyday. Amid four consecutive platinum albums in the 1990s, the grunge-adjacent group peaked by selling more than 10 million copies of “Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,” a 28-track opus with no fewer than four era-defining hits, including “Tonight, Tonight” and “Bullet With Butterfly Wings.” Looking back at the aftermath of those accomplishments, Mr. Corgan can admit now that he was a bit like Don Quixote, “wrestling with the ghost of the thing” and carrying on “a war that was very much my own war,” he said this month. “I was in denial about what I’d given up.” "

91,"WASHINGTON — John Dowd resigned on Thursday as President Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation as Mr. Trump signaled that he was prepared to ignore his advice and wanted a sit-down with investigators. After days of uncertainty among the president’s lawyers about their status, Mr. Dowd ultimately broke with Mr. Trump over whether he should agree to be questioned in the inquiry, a person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Dowd viewed an interview as too risky; the president reiterated shortly after Mr. Dowd resigned that he wanted to clear his name. “I would like to,” the president told reporters at the White House when asked about meeting with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. “I would like to.” Mr. Dowd’s departure cleared the way for the president to embrace a more aggressive posture toward the investigation and marked another reshuffling of personnel for Mr. Trump. In the most politically consequential investigation in decades, the president has refashioned his legal team several times, a revolving door that mirrors the high turnover among senior White House and campaign aides. “I love the president,” Mr. Dowd said in a telephone interview. “I wish him the best of luck. I think he has a really good case.” Now, as he weighs whether to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller, the president will be advised by a cadre of lawyers better known for their television and advocacy work than their courtroom triumphs.

92,"New York City’s population reached a record high last year of over 8.6 million and has climbed 5.5 percent since 2010, according to a Department of City Planning analysis of new Census Bureau population estimates. There were 8,622,698 people in the city last year, 447,565 more than were counted in the 2010 census. City demographers said the new total was the culmination of an average annual gain not seen since the first half of the 20th century, when the city became dominant in everything from finance to culture and communications — and also had strong manufacturing and shipping sectors with thousands of jobs. Joseph J. Salvo, the chief demographer at the planning agency, said that, in effect, New York City added as many people as in all of New Rochelle, a city in Westchester County, each year from 2010 to 2017. The 2010 census put New Rochelle’s total at just over 77,000. He attributed some of the city’s jump to housing units planned before the 2010 census that were deferred in the recession and have been completed in the last few years. “It’s a remarkable growth story,” Dr. Salvo said. From 2010 to 2017, New York City led the rest of the state in population growth, with the Bronx emerging as the fastest-growing county in the state. The Bronx surged 6.21 percent, with 86,052 new residents. But Brooklyn, with a population of 2,648,771, took in more people — 144,071 — to achieve the highest growth of any county in the state by absolute numbers. Its 5.75 percent jump from 2010 to 2017 was second as a percentage gain. "
93,"President Trump put China squarely in his cross hairs on Thursday, imposing tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods to combat the rising threat from a nation that the White House has called “an economic enemy.” The measures are Mr. Trump’s strongest trade action yet against a country that he says is responsible for thousands of lost American jobs and billions in lost revenues. Financial markets plunged on fears of a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropping by 2.5 percent. The White House said it was taking action in retaliation for China’s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets. The measures include a significant change in Mr. Trump’s looming steel and aluminum tariffs that would aim them primarily at China. After Mr. Trump announced the moves, China’s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on 128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion. China urged the Trump administration to resolve differences through dialogue to “avoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.” The president’s actions fulfill his frequent campaign pledge to demand fairer trade deals with nations around the globe and to retaliate against trading partners if the United States does not secure better agreements.

Senior Editor, Books THE SPARSHOLT AFFAIR, by Alan Hollinghurst. (Knopf, $28.95.) Hollinghurst’s sixth novel plays out across nearly a century of gay life in England, as a hazy sex scandal reverberates through the lives of the characters. “When Hollinghurst picks up an aspect of human experience, however banal — riding a bus, sitting for a portrait, being on a sailboat — he is so exacting that it’s as if no one has described these things before,” our critic Dwight Garner said. “Hollinghurst is a cerebral sensualist. His characters work themselves into each other’s hearts and minds as devotedly as they work themselves into each other’s underpants.” DOING HARM: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick, by Maya Dusenbery. (HarperOne/HarperCollins, $27.99.) Through an orderly blizzard of studies and statistics, Dusenbery examines sexism at every level in medicine from medical school admissions on up. Her book, which our critic Parul Sehgal calls well researched and “wonderfully truculent,” argues that women are regarded as unreliable narrators who can’t even testify to their own pain. “This cultural distrust of women — ancient and ingrained — is shown to govern quality of care at every stage of treatment,” Sehgal writes, to sometimes shocking effect, as when a breast-cancer patient opts for a mastectomy only for her doctor to object: “But you aren’t married.” THE PEOPLE VS. DEMOCRACY: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger & How to Save It, by Yascha Mounk. (Harvard University, $29.95.) The title of this book makes clever use of what looks like a glaring oxymoron: After all, what is democracy if not rule by the people? But Mounk, who lectures on political theory at Harvard, shows how populist insurgencies can undermine democracy in the long run. “One of the many things to recommend this clarifying book is its international scope,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “As much as Donald J. Trump might fancy himself one of a kind, Mounk argues that the American president is part of a global wave.” IMPEACHMENT: A Citizen’s Guide, by Cass R. Sunstein. (Harvard University, paper, $7.95.) Sunstein’s topic has obvious contemporary resonance, as Andrew Sullivan notes in his review, and though this short book does not take up the Trump presidency directly it does tease out “various hypotheticals with some similarities to our current concerns,” concluding that “each of these is an impeachable offense.” Yet Sunstein also cautions that the Constitution was written to ensure that a clear national consensus was necessary if a president was to be judged to be gravely violating his oath of office, or betraying the country. “This is why in well over two centuries the impeachment power has been invoked against sitting presidents only four times,” Sullivan writes, “and never actually pursued to conviction.” "
95,"WASHINGTON — Congress gave swift approval to a $1.3 trillion spending bill that will keep the federal government open through September but broadly defies the Trump administration’s wishes to reshape it. The House voted 256 to 167 to approve the bill early Thursday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the spending plan, which stretched 2,232 pages, had been unveiled. After a scare over whether a fiscally conservative senator might force a brief government shutdown this weekend, along with an unexpected grievance from another senator over the renaming of an Idaho wilderness area, the Senate voted 65 to 32 to approve the bill around 12:30 Friday morning. Government funding was set to expire Friday night, but by approving the bill, lawmakers moved to avert what would have been the third shutdown of the year. The spending bill, which congressional leaders agreed to on Wednesday and President Trump seemed to grudgingly endorse on Twitter, provides big increases to the military and to domestic programs — and clearly rebuffs the Trump administration’s efforts to sharply scale back the reach and scope of the federal government. The bill funds the government for the 2018 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1 and is already almost halfway over. Congress paved the way for this week’s legislation with a two-year budget deal last month that raised strict limits on military and domestic spending by about $140 billion this year. "

97,"To the Editor: Re “The Calm Before the Stormy,” by Frank Bruni (column, March 21): We have a former porn star, a former Playboy model and a former “Apprentice” contestant all credibly accusing a president of the United States of sexual predation. President Trump and his lawyers have denied any past improper sexual conduct with these women, who are among at least 19 women who have made accusations. I know one of these 19 women personally, and she told me years ago of Mr. Trump’s advances, long before he was ever a candidate for the presidency. Mr. Trump has bragged about his exploits with women on many occasions, publicly and privately, and as we have now learned, large sums of money have been paid to keep some of these women from speaking out. I believe the reason that Mr. Trump has not ranted and raged about Stormy Daniels is that she has the goods on the president, including her 2011 polygraph test results, and possibly photographs and tapes of their encounters, and Mr. Trump is beyond scared of what the reaction will be if these get released. Mr. Trump’s payment to Ms. Daniels may have been in violation of campaign finance laws, and were certainly in violation of his marital vows to Melania. I for one cannot wait for Sunday’s broadcast of the Stormy Daniels interview on “60 Minutes”! HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN, NEW YORK "
98,"“Trade wars are good, and easy to win.” So declared Donald Trump a few weeks ago, after announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Actually, trade wars are rarely good, and not at all easy to win — especially if you have no idea what you’re doing. And boy, do these people not know what they’re doing. It’s odd, in a way. After all, trade is clearly an issue about which Trump is truly passionate. He tried to kill Obamacare, but to all appearances his main concern was tarnishing his predecessor’s legacy. He wanted a tax cut, but more to score a “win” than because he cared about what was in it. But reducing the trade deficit has been a long-term Trump obsession, so you might expect him to learn something about how world trade works, or at least surround himself with people who do understand the subject. But he hasn’t. And what he doesn’t know can and will hurt you. In the case of steel, here’s what happened: First came the splashy announcement of big tariffs, ostensibly in the name of national security — infuriating U.S. allies, which are the main source of our steel imports. Then came what looks like a climb-down: The administration has exempted Canada, Mexico, the European Union and others from those tariffs. Was this climb-down a reaction to threats of retaliation, or did the administration not at first realize that the tariffs would mainly hit our allies? Either way, Trump may have gotten the worst of both worlds: angering countries that should be our friends and establishing a reputation as an untrustworthy ally and trading partner, without even doing much for the industry he was supposedly trying to help. Now comes Trumptrade II, the China Syndrome. On Thursday the administration announced that it would levy tariffs on a number of Chinese goods, with the specifics to be detailed later. How will this one work out? Let’s be clear: When it comes to the global economic order, China is in fact a bad citizen. In particular, it plays fast and loose on intellectual property, in effect ripping off technologies and ideas developed elsewhere. It also subsidizes some industries, including steel, contributing to world excess capacity. "
99,"On Saturday, Rebecca Schneid plans to pull on her sneakers, sling a camera over her shoulder and march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington with thousands of other students demanding an end to the gun violence that has cut through so many American communities. But to Ms. Schneid, a survivor of the school shooting that killed 17 people last month in Parkland, Fla., the march is just the beginning — a moment of political awakening, she hopes, that will put the nation on notice that young people plan to be a greater, more organized force than teenagers and college students in the past. “It’s going to look like millions and millions of people,” said Ms. Schneid, 16, who is the editor of the newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “And it’s going to look scary to politicians.” With more than 800 student-led demonstrations planned in the United States and internationally, the organizers of the March for Our Lives are aiming for a generational show of strength by a diverse movement united in a conviction that adults have failed them. Still, for all their fierce energy, these liberal-leaning activists have yet to be tested in the arena of electoral politics. They face a political system that is historically resistant to major change, and a Republican president and Congress with a strong base of support among much older voters, many of whom have more conservative views on guns. A major moment will come in the 2018 midterm elections: Some students will be eligible to vote in November, and have vowed to make gun laws a central issue. Many more hope to organize networks and lay groundwork to vent their frustration — about pervasive school violence, and an unjust political system they view as enabling it — in the next vote for president in 2020. "
100,"Update: The United States and South Korea formally announced the trade agreement in a joint statement on Wednesday, and said that it “represents important progress in improving U.S.-Korea trade and economic relations.” WASHINGTON — President Trump scored his first significant trade deal this week, securing a pact with South Korea that represents the type of one-on-one agreement that Mr. Trump says makes the best sense for American companies and workers. The deal, which is expected to be formally announced on Wednesday, opens the South’s market to American autos by lifting existing limits on manufacturers like Ford Motor and General Motors, extends tariffs for South Korean truck exports and restricts, by nearly a third, the amount of steel that the South can export to the United States. Mr. Trump used his threat of stiff steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to extract the concessions he wanted, helping produce an agreement that had stalled amid disagreements this year. But winning the deal may have had more to do with the geopolitical realities confronting the United States and South Korea as America embarks on tricky nuclear discussions with North Korea. The United States cannot afford a protracted trade standoff at a moment when it needs the South as an ally. The trade deal came as the Chinese state news media reported that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, made an unannounced visit to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping weeks before planned summit meetings with American and South Korean leaders. The political success of the trade agreement — and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations — is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington’s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president’s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests. "
101,"BEIJING — North Korea’s enigmatic young leader, Kim Jong-un, made an unannounced visit to Beijing, meeting with President Xi Jinping weeks before planned summit meetings with American and South Korean leaders, Chinese and North Korean state news media reported on Wednesday. The visit amounted to Mr. Kim’s international debut: It was the 34-year-old leader’s first trip outside North Korea since he took power in 2011, and his first meeting with another head of state. The surprise discussions added another layer of complexity to the rush of global diplomacy around North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Mr. Kim told the Chinese leader that he was open to dialogue with the United States, including a potential summit meeting with President Trump, and was committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, according to an account published by China’s news agency Xinhua. “If South Korea and the United States respond with good will to our efforts and create an atmosphere of peace and stability, and take phased, synchronized measures to achieve peace, the issue of the denuclearization of the peninsula can reach resolution,” Mr. Kim said, according to Xinhua’s summary of his meeting with Mr. Xi. Hours after the meeting was announced, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he looked forward to meeting Mr. Kim, and that there was “a good chance” that the North Korean leader would “do what is right for his people and for humanity.” "
102,"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, recently warned dozens of foreign diplomats — including the Russian ambassador — that the United States would retaliate if adversaries abroad meddled in its coming elections. “To those who would try to attack our democracy, to affect our elections, to affect the elections of other countries, to undermine national sovereignty, I have a word of warning: Don’t,” Ms. Nielsen told an estimated 80 foreign envoys and other officials during a speech last week, according to a person in attendance. Two other people with knowledge of the event confirmed the comments. All three spoke on the condition of anonymity because the remarks were given at a closed-door meeting. It was an unusually stern warning by Ms. Nielsen, and was among the harshest threats of retaliation by a member of President Trump’s cabinet. Ms. Nielsen is one of the most outspoken advocates of the administration’s policies, and has resisted being drawn into the controversy over Russian meddling during the 2016 election that put Mr. Trump in office. Ms. Nielsen told the dignitaries gathered at Blair House, the presidential guesthouse, that election tampering would be detected and meddling states would suffer consequences, according to the person in attendance. The New York Times obtained a list of people who attended, including ambassadors from across the world. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman confirmed the speech at Blair House but declined to provide details. "
103,"In a last-minute move that would give Republicans an advantage in maintaining control of the House of Representatives, the Trump administration is reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Coming from an administration that has been hostile toward immigrants, the change was not surprising, but it’s galling nonetheless. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the decision Monday, less than a week before the Census Bureau, which his department oversees, is supposed to send final questions for the 2020 census to Congress. If his decision stands — the attorney general of California has filed a lawsuit to block it, and other elected officials are preparing to do so — it would be the first time in 70 years that the federal government has asked people to specify their citizenship status on the census form sent to every household. This is important because the census count determines how many House seats each state gets. The census is also used to determine the allocation of more than $600 billion in federal spending, including Medicaid, food stamps and grants to schools. Asking about citizenship would reduce responses from immigrant families, which are already less likely than others to answer government surveys and are terrified by President Trump’s anti-immigrant policies and statements. An inaccurate count is likely to provide more representation to states with fewer immigrants and higher response rates and take seats away from states like California where response rates would be lower. Given the geography of American politics, that would probably lead to more power for Republicans, and less for Democrats. Experts say even citizens and permanent residents would be less likely to respond if they have relatives who are undocumented immigrants. Mr. Ross’s decision was based on the disingenuous argument that the Department of Justice needs to know the citizenship status of residents in each census tract so it can better protect the rights of minority voters under the Voting Rights Act. Even putting aside the laughable notion that this administration cares about minority voting rights, this argument is bunkum — the Justice Department has been enforcing that law without access to such data for decades. The last census that asked people to report their citizenship status was conducted in 1950, 15 years before the Voting Rights Act became law. What’s more, the Justice Department already has access to citizenship data through the American Community Survey, which is conducted every year. The timing of this change is highly suspect. It comes too late to be included in a field test of the 2020 census the government is conducting right now with 275,000 households in Providence County, R.I. In his memo, Mr. Ross sought to play down concerns that the citizenship question would reduce response rates by claiming there was no “empirical evidence” to back up that argument. Yet, by seeking to insert the question so late in the process, he has prevented officials from empirically testing how people will react to it. "
104,
105,"WASHINGTON — At least 12 states signaled Tuesday that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, arguing that the change would cause fewer Americans to be counted and violate the Constitution. The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said he was leading a multistate lawsuit to stop the move, and officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington said they would join the effort. The State of California filed a separate lawsuit late Monday night. “The census is supposed to count everyone,” said Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts. “This is a blatant and illegal attempt by the Trump administration to undermine that goal, which will result in an undercount of the population and threaten federal funding for our state and cities.” The Constitution requires that every resident of the United States be counted in a decennial census, whether or not they are citizens. The results are used not just to redraw political boundaries from school boards to House seats, but to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and subsidies to where they are needed most. Census data provide the baseline for planning decisions made by corporations and governments alike. Opponents of the added citizenship question said it was certain to depress response to the census from noncitizens and even legal immigrants. Critics accused the administration of adding the question to reduce the population count in the predominantly Democratic areas where more immigrants reside, in advance of state and national redistricting in 2021. The Trump administration defended the citizenship question by saying it was needed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, which relies on accurate estimates of voting-eligible populations. "
106,"As a start-up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014, the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies, a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon. It was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge’s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app — a mobile-phone-based personality quiz — to gain access to Facebook users’ friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach. By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app. The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users — and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so-called psychometric profiles of American voters, setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain.

107,"BUDAPEST — Billboards. TV campaigns. Radio programs. The anti-immigrant government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban uses different levers to influence public opinion, particularly on the subject of the European refugee crisis. Even school textbooks. On Page 155 of the latest eighth-grade history textbook, students are told that Mr. Orban thinks refugees are a threat to Hungary — and then encouraged to believe he is right. “It can be problematic,” the book concludes, “for different cultures to coexist.” It is a testament to the scope of Mr. Orban’s program for remaking Hungary that part of the far-right leader’s message is now woven into the school curriculum. For the past eight years, Mr. Orban has waged a systemic assault on the hardware of Hungary’s democracy — rewriting the national Constitution, reshaping the judiciary and tweaking the electoral system to favor his Fidesz party. Less conspicuously, Mr. Orban is also trying to recode the software of Hungary’s democracy — its cultural sphere, civil society and education system. His party’s appointees or supporters dominate many artistic institutions and universities. A growing number of plays and exhibitions have had nationalist or anti-Western undertones. Religious groups and nongovernment organizations critical of Fidesz have seen funding dry up. He has especially vilified pro-democracy organizations funded by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros. National opinion surveys are used to steer public opinion as much as collect it, while history is also up for grabs. The government has jousted with educators over textbooks while promoting a narrative of Hungarian victimhood and ethnocentrism. "
108,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Outrage in Russia, a secret visit to Beijing and an abortion debate in Germany. Here’s the latest: • Pressure is building in Russia. President Vladimir Putin declared a nationwide day of mourning over the mall fire in Kemerovo that killed at least 64 people, including many children. As Mr. Putin blamed “criminal negligence” for the fire, thousands of people, above, protested nearby to demand transparency and accountability. “I no longer have a family,” one demonstrator said. “The ruling regime is guilty.” And after the mass expulsions of Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy on British soil, some in the Kremlin say tensions with the West could become more volatile than during the Cold War. _____ • A surprise international debut. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, met secretly with China’s president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing. The clandestine discussions came weeks before planned summit meetings with American and South Korean leaders. "
109,"LONDON — The whistle-blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday, like a pink-haired, nose-ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data. In testimony to the House of Commons’ select committee on culture, Mr. Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, described the inner workings of SCL, a political consultancy that gave its clients access to a vast collection of personal information harvested from Facebook. In one of the longest sessions in recent memory, Mr. Wylie made a number of jaw-dropping assertions, most significantly that the company’s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain’s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered. But mostly, Mr. Wylie tried to explain data-mining. He looked like a cerebral skate-rat, which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility, but in this case it seemed to help. He was polite. He resembled, as one journalist put it, “a patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran.” His message was clear: If you aren’t already worried about how your personal data is being used, now would be a good time to start. “The way I like to think of it, data is the electricity of our new economy, and electricity can be quite dangerous,” he said. “We enjoy the benefits of electricity, despite the fact that it can literally kill you.” Cambridge Analytica released a statement describing Mr. Wylie as “a part-time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since then.” It said Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary of the SCL political consultancy, did not use its cache of data in Donald J. Trump’s 2016 campaign, and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal, or Brexit, from the bloc. "
110,"WASHINGTON — President Trump kept a relatively low profile and did not make any public appearances on Tuesday, but emerged for a rare evening trip outside the White House to meet with deep-pocketed donors at a real estate developer’s home in Virginia. Mr. Trump, who usually prefers a steak served at his own hotel if he leaves the confines of the White House at night, traveled to the McLean, Va., home of Giuseppe Cecchi, according to a person with knowledge of the president’s plans. Mr. Cecchi is a loyalist who previously hosted Mr. Trump for a $10,000-a-couple fund-raising dinner in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Since arriving back in Washington on Sunday from his Florida estate, Mr. Trump’s schedule showed no public appearances and he kept his usual tweeting to a minimum. He has opted instead to leave it to his aides to field questions about a continuing investigation into his campaign’s contact with Russia, allegations by a pornographic actress that his lawyer paid her to stay silent about an affair, a move to expel 60 Russian diplomats and his administration’s support for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The White House declined to offer additional information about the dinner, but stressed that it was not a fund-raiser. “Tonight, the president will be having dinner with a group of supporters at a private residence in Virginia,” said Lindsay Walters, a deputy White House press secretary. “This dinner is not a fund-raiser. No funds have been solicited.” "

Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested. Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally. Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we’ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith. "
112,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Don’t write an obituary for the Orange Curtain just yet. For years, it seemed that the demographic change in Orange County might push the suburban enclave to shed its image as a conservative island. And in 2016, voters chose a Democrat candidate for president for the first time since the Great Depression. But now, political leaders there seem poised to reclaim their role as a counterpoint to much of the rest of California. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors took two significant votes: One scrapped a previously approved plan to open temporary shelters for the homeless in the wealthy towns of Huntington Beach, Irvine and Laguna Niguel. In the other, the board voted to join a lawsuit from the Trump administration against California’s so-called sanctuary state law. Both votes from the all-Republican board were unanimous, though one member was not present. Thousands of people had shown up to voice their views on the divisive policies. The vote to join the federal government’s lawsuit against the state came just days after the Los Alamitos City Council adopted a measure to exempt itself from the new state law that strictly limits communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. “We cannot let the state begin cherry-picking which federal laws it decides to follow,” Supervisor Michelle Steel said in a statement after the meeting. Immigrant rights advocates called the vote “shameful” and said they were “scapegoating our own communities.” Other opponents reminded the jurors that Orange County was a leader in backing Proposition 187, an anti-illegal immigrant measure that was later struck down by the courts. The votes are not the only sign of backlash. Earlier this week, the Orange County Sheriff’s office said it would begin listing everyone scheduled to be released from jail on a public website, as a way to get around the state law restricting communication with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. It is unclear how the county will now deal with the hundreds of people it forced out of a homeless encampment along the Santa Ana River earlier this year, but county leaders say they expect local leaders to discuss options at a court hearing on Tuesday. "
113,"An advertising trade group that gave an award to Cambridge Analytica last year for its “big data” work during the 2016 presidential election is now urging marketers to reconsider the ethics of how consumer information is collected and used. The trade group, the Advertising Research Foundation, said it was waiting for more information before formally rescinding the award given to Cambridge Analytica, the British political consulting firm that was recently reported to have improperly harvested the data of 50 million Facebook users. The revelations have brought intense criticism of Facebook, which is facing inquiries from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic around how it handles user information, and have many people taking a closer look at the role of data in online advertising. ""We’ve tended to assume that because you can do something, you should,” Scott McDonald, chief executive of the ad group, said in an interview on Tuesday. He added that advertisers had been more concerned with the accuracy and validity of data they received from technology companies than with asking whether they should be collecting that data and using it to target consumers in the first place. Mr. McDonald addressed the Cambridge Analytica situation and the need for new guidelines during a speech on Wednesday morning at the group’s annual convention in New York. Things were much different last year, when Cambridge Analytica won a gold prize at the foundation’s David Ogilvy Awards, which have been given annually since 1994. The firm was honored for its work for the Trump campaign, in which it identified and advertised to undecided voters. The selection, made by a jury of ad industry leaders, was “very controversial because of the nature of the campaign,” Mr. McDonald said. But the ad group viewed itself as “Switzerland,” he said, and was simply conducting “a scientific evaluation of the quality of work.” “Nobody had any idea the data might have been pilfered,” he said. Mr. McDonald said he planned to potentially poll the jury again and “see if the accusations are sustained” before officially stripping Cambridge Analytica of the award. The existence of the award highlights the enthusiasm with which marketers have approached the reams of consumer data generated by digital devices and their belief that people are happy to share whatever information technology may be collecting from them. The Advertising Research Foundation, which acknowledged that the United States may adopt new regulations on how consumer data is collected, said it planned to work with other industry groups to form new guidelines for collecting and protecting that information. Mr. McDonald said advertising had gone too far in viewing consumers as prey, noting that even the industry’s vocabulary had become militarylike. “We talk about ad campaigns, consumers we target. We talk about subway takeovers, pop-ups,” he said. “These are fairly aggressive, and I don’t think we even think about it — they’re just embedded in the metaphors of advertising.” "
114,"WASHINGTON — A top Trump campaign official had repeated communications during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential race with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence, according to a document released on Tuesday by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election. The campaign official, Rick Gates, had frequent phone calls in September and October 2016 with a person the F.B.I. believes had active links to Russian spy services at the time, the document said. Mr. Gates also told an associate the person “was a former Russian Intelligence Officer with the G.R.U.,” the Russian military intelligence agency. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating numerous contacts between President Trump’s advisers and Russia-linked individuals and entities leading up to and after the November 2016 election. The document, filed in Mr. Mueller’s name, stated that the communications between Mr. Gates and the individual were “pertinent to the investigation.” The individual is identified only as “Person A,” and the document describes him as someone who worked for Mr. Gates and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, as part of their earlier representation of Russia-aligned parties and politicians in Ukraine, including the former president of Ukraine. A person with knowledge of the matter identified Person A as Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who for years was Mr. Manafort’s right-hand man in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort has told associates that he does not believe that Mr. Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, but the document released on Tuesday shows that Mr. Gates told others of his history in the intelligence services. That history was widely discussed for years among people who worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates in Ukraine. "
115,"Ricky Gervais, the British comedian, does not care what you say about him on Twitter. He does not care if you are offended. He does not care if you hate the latest joke he told about rape, or the Bible, or Caitlyn Jenner, or Hitler or your child’s fatal peanut allergy. And just to make sure you’re crystal clear on all of the tweets he does not remotely care about, he has built his new Netflix stand-up special, “Ricky Gervais: Humanity,” around them — these negligible tweets, the droning of gnats, several years of which he appears to have accidentally screen-grabbed and saved to his phone. (Ricky Gervais: Butterfingers!) Similarly, I don’t care about Formula One racing, which is why I’m working on a tight 75-minute act about the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Gervais seems to care quite intensely, of course, which is natural. It would be grotesque, inhuman, not to care. Absorbing critique on a scale as vast as Gervais’s Twitter feed (13.1 million followers), whether the specific critiques are warranted or not, is objectively grueling. Stand-up comedy is vulnerable and hard. Twitter is awful. Devoid of context, Gervais’s bravado might be sympathetic, a relatable if tedious coping mechanism. As Gervais himself helpfully points out in “Humanity,” however, nothing can truly be divorced from context. So here’s some context for you: Last week, the secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, testified in front of a House subcommittee that trans women in homeless shelters make cisgender women “not comfortable.” According to a 2016 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 20 percent of trans people report having been homeless at some point because of their gender identity, 55 percent report being harassed by homeless shelter residents and staff, and 29 percent have been turned away from shelters for being trans. Meanwhile, on Netflix, Gervais graphically speculated about Caitlyn Jenner’s gender confirmation surgery, repeatedly referred to her as a big strong man, relentlessly called her by her pre-transition name and compared gender dysphoria to a human choosing to identify as a chimpanzee. That is the context within which Gervais insists he doesn’t care about critiques of his work — critiques pointing out that describing trans women as goofy, freaky, delusional men who’ve just “popped on a dress” isn’t edgy or cheeky, it’s dangerous. Giggling at the “weirdness” of trans people — presenting your spasms of discomfort as something relatable — makes it harder for trans people to find a safe place to sleep. Transphobia is not a pet issue of the hypersensitive but a continuing international emergency. And sure, some critiques are silly or bad. Public opinion is a numbers game: Distribute your work to a large enough sample and you’ll accrue people who love you, which is intoxicating, but also people who don’t, which is painful. You’ll find some who get the jokes but hate them anyway and some who hate you without even bothering to watch. This doesn’t actually say much about humanity except that it is vast and varied. Yet, out of this data set, some comedians and their fans seem determined to gerrymander an epidemic of bowdlerization. "

117,"UNION CITY, N.J. — Senator Robert Menendez officially announced his intention to run for re-election at a raucous rally on Wednesday, a remarkable turn two months after federal prosecutors dismissed corruption charges against the New Jersey Democrat. With nearly every state Democratic luminary inside a packed high school gymnasium here, it was an unusual show of force for a candidate who already enjoys a considerable lead in early polling. In his kickoff speech, sometimes delivered in Spanish, Mr. Menendez vowed that he would continue to fight against President Trump’s agenda. “There is a president in Washington who spends his days dividing us and distracting us, but never delivering for us,” Mr. Menendez said, drawing some of his loudest cheers. In January, it was far from assured that Mr. Menendez would even be on the stage. For 11 weeks last year, the senator was a defendant in a federal corruption trial with headlines tracing the prosecution’s case, which accused him of abusing his office to help his friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor and political benefactor from Florida. But after jurors could not reach a verdict, the judge declared a mistrial and Mr. Menendez pronounced himself vindicated. Then the situation quickly changed. First, the Department of Justice announced that it would retry Mr. Menendez. Then the federal judge who oversaw the trial acquitted Mr. Menendez of several charges, severely hampering the retrial effort. Within days, the Department of Justice had dropped the case. "
118,"WASHINGTON — A lawyer for President Trump broached the idea of Mr. Trump’s pardoning two of his former top advisers, Michael T. Flynn and Paul Manafort, with their lawyers last year, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The discussions came as the special counsel was building cases against both men, and they raise questions about whether the lawyer, John Dowd, who resigned last week, was offering pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation. The talks suggest that Mr. Trump’s lawyers were concerned about what Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort might reveal were they to cut a deal with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in exchange for leniency. Mr. Mueller’s team could investigate the prospect that Mr. Dowd made pardon offers to thwart the inquiry, although legal experts are divided about whether such offers might constitute obstruction of justice. Mr. Dowd’s conversation with Mr. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, occurred sometime after Mr. Dowd took over last summer as the president’s personal lawyer, at a time when a grand jury was hearing evidence against Mr. Flynn on a range of potential crimes. Mr. Flynn, who served as Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, agreed in late November to cooperate with the special counsel’s investigation. He pleaded guilty in December to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and received favorable sentencing terms. Mr. Dowd has said privately that he did not know why Mr. Flynn had accepted a plea, according to one of the people. He said he had told Mr. Kelner that the president had long believed that the case against Mr. Flynn was flimsy and was prepared to pardon him, the person said. The pardon discussion with Mr. Manafort’s attorney, Reginald J. Brown, came before his client was indicted in October on charges of money laundering and other financial crimes. Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, has pleaded not guilty and has told others he is not interested in a pardon because he believes he has done nothing wrong and the government overstepped its authority. Mr. Brown is no longer his lawyer. "
119,"BEIJING — With a dose of mystery and the flair of a showman, North Korea’s young leader, Kim Jong-un, used his debut as an international statesman on Wednesday to present himself as confident, reasonable — and willing to bargain. Mr. Kim’s surprise two-day visit to Beijing, his first known trip abroad since taking power, was effectively a reminder of how much he has set the agenda in the crisis over his nation’s nuclear arsenal — and of what a strong hand he has going into talks, first with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea next month and later with President Trump. Mr. Kim has yet to say what concessions he is willing to make, or what he may demand from the United States in return. But he continued to dominate the diplomatic process, reaffirming his willingness to meet with Mr. Trump and repeating his vague commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in talks with President Xi Jinping of China, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency. During Mr. Trump’s first year in office, Mr. Kim raced ahead with breakthrough tests of missiles capable of hitting the United States mainland and what he claimed was a missile-ready hydrogen bomb. Then he abruptly changed course and used the Winter Olympics to seize the initiative, surprising the world with a rapprochement with the South and then an offer to meet with Mr. Trump. Through it all, the Trump administration has been largely relegated to reacting and catching up to Mr. Kim. And so it was again this week, when Mr. Kim suddenly showed up in China on an armored train and was shown beaming next to Mr. Xi, whose cooperation has been critical to Mr. Trump’s strategy of “maximum pressure” on the North. The state media in China and North Korea announced the meeting on Wednesday, after two days of secrecy. In images and in words, Mr. Kim and Mr. Xi signaled that they had repaired the relationship between their countries, which had soured as Mr. Kim had accelerated his nuclear program and Mr. Xi had responded by endorsing — and enforcing — more punishing sanctions proposed by the United States. "
120,"BEIJING — Kim Jong-un’s surprise visit to Beijing this week to meet President Xi Jinping added an element of intrigue to talks over North Korea’s nuclear program. It was also a propaganda opportunity for both men. For Mr. Xi, the meeting was a chance to cultivate an image as a peacemaker on the global stage. For Mr. Kim, it was an opportunity to signal membership in the club of world leaders. Here’s a look at how the Chinese and North Korean news media portrayed the meeting. In North Korea, Mr. Kim is often pictured alongside throngs of admirers who hang on and record his every word. But it was Mr. Kim who was taking notes during his meeting with Mr. Xi, at least in the Chinese news media coverage on Wednesday. Mr. Kim, 34, was shown scribbling on a piece of paper as Mr. Xi, 64, spoke of the need for close ties between their two countries. The images gave Mr. Xi the appearance of an elder statesman at a time when he has sought to expand China’s influence over global affairs. Ryan Hass, a former director for China at the National Security Council who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the coverage signaled that Beijing is “in control of a complex security challenge, serving as the center of international efforts to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula.” "
121,"SINGAPORE — Days before winning the election in 2016, Donald Trump stood on a stage and directed an accusation at a tiny country halfway across the world: Singapore, he said, was stealing American jobs. Singapore is now on the tip of Mr. Trump’s tongue again — but this time, he’s expressing admiration for its death penalty for drug trafficking. He has reportedly invited government representatives to brief the White House on their approach to drug trafficking, including their use of capital punishment. Mr. Trump seems to believe he can learn a thing or two from Singapore. This is convenient for the Singapore government, which has been using the global opioid crisis as an argument for the retention of capital punishment. While the American media reported Mr. Trump’s praise for Singapore’s “zero tolerance” stance, the country hanged a 39-year-old Ghanaian named Billy Agbozo on March 9, and a 56-year-old Singaporean, Hishamrudin bin Mohd, on March 16. Both had been convicted of drug trafficking. These are the first two executions of 2018, as far as we know; information about imminent executions is not made available, and the prison service announces the number of hangings only in its annual report. But the borrowing of ideas hasn’t been a one-way street: the government here has taken a page out of Mr. Trump’s book. The new Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods is holding public hearings to explore measures for tackling “fake news.” The committee is meant to examine a range of options, but there are strong hints that new restrictions on the media are on the way, not least because the law minister, who is also a member of the committee, has already said that legislation is a “no-brainer.” Mr. Trump constantly proclaims that his “America First” policy will prevent the United States from being taken for a ride by other countries, while Singapore denounces foreign interference in its domestic politics. Yet when the occasion suits, both are more than happy to borrow ideas from elsewhere to control their populations. Such opportunism is the hallmark of authoritarians constantly on the lookout for ways to consolidate or expand their power. Both governments claim they’re solving urgent problems: to get the opioid crisis in the United States under control, to pre-empt disinformation campaigns that might threaten Singapore’s stability. But neither proposed solution is likely to solve the problem, and might even make things worse. "

123,"Fifty years later, the 1968 presidential election and the Vietnam War still shadow American politics. But the war actually had little effect on the vote that November — even though surveys showed that Vietnam was by far the most important issue on voters’ minds, they saw little difference between the Republican nominee, Richard Nixon, and his Democratic opponent, Hubert H. Humphrey, both of whom they scored “slightly conservative” on the University of Michigan’s seven-point “Vietnam scale.” The real consequences of the election and the war were on the Democratic Party, with collateral effects on the Republicans. The Democrats’ united, confident and longstanding commitment to the spread of liberal values throughout the world eroded in the aftermath. Fragmented by internal divisions over the war, the party also overhauled its process for choosing presidential candidates in ways that upended its previous domination by Southerners, unions and big-city bosses. The decade had begun with the election of John F. Kennedy, whose main issue in the 1960 presidential campaign was the Cold War, which he believed America was losing to the Soviet Union. Kennedy pledged in his Inaugural Address to do whatever was necessary “to assure the survival and success of liberty,” a declaration that placed him squarely in the tradition of his party. Ever since Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt led the United States onto the world stage as a promoter of liberal values during the first half of the 20th century, most Democrats had been comfortable with this role. Indeed, an animating premise of Democratic liberalism was that the federal government has the ability to solve virtually any problem it chooses to take on, domestic or foreign. Soon after taking office, Kennedy began escalating American military involvement in Vietnam. In June 1961, following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, he told James Reston of The New York Times that “we have a problem in making our power credible” and “Vietnam is the place.” By November 1963, Kennedy had dispatched 16,300 military advisers to South Vietnam. As late as the morning of Nov. 22, he said, “Without the United States, South Vietnam would collapse overnight.” Assuming the presidency when Kennedy was assassinated a few hours later, Lyndon B. Johnson felt bound to continue his predecessor’s course. Less confident about Vietnam than he was about domestic matters, Johnson regularly asked the foreign policy advisers he inherited from Kennedy — chiefly Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, and his national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy — what Kennedy would have done, and then he did it. Their confident recommendation was that the American commitment to victory in Vietnam must be maintained. "
124,"Since the Parkland shootings in Florida, Senator Marco Rubio has done many of the things liberals say they are desperate, desperate for decent Republicans to do. He has changed his position on gun control, expressing support for new restrictions: age limits on gun purchases, new background check rules, possibly magazine restrictions. He has co-sponsored legislation encouraging states to issue restraining orders that temporarily would strip people deemed dangerous of their guns. Some of these measures have conservative support, but in other cases the Florida Republican has effectively bucked the N.R.A. But over the same period Rubio, more than any other prominent Republican, has been vigorously and sometimes virulently attacked by the student-led movement that filled D.C. with protesters last weekend. When he showed up for the CNN town hall he met boos and heckles; one of the shooting survivors told him that just looking at him was like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle. Notwithstanding his subsequent policy concessions, at the March for Our Lives the students wore price tags around their neck, $1.05 each — the amount of money Rubio’s campaigns have received from the N.R.A. divided by the number of students in Florida schools. David Hogg, one of their leaders, began his speech with the price tag line, and told a CNN interviewer that if anything he feels that their attacks on the Florida senator haven’t been provocative enough. There was a time, not so many years ago, when Rubio was attacked and his efforts at bipartisanship regarded skeptically because liberals perceived him as a threat — a plausible and eloquent leader for a less bunkered G.O.P., a bridge between the party’s old white base and a more multicultural America. That time has passed, at least for now: After Rubio was defeated and partially undone by Donald Trump, and especially after he turned in his #NeverTrump card and filmed a hostage-video endorsement, the official media consensus on the Florida senator flipped from “Great Republican Hope” to “Liddle Marco,” and anti-Rubio sentiment became dominated less by anxiety than by contempt. That contempt seems to inform some of the reaction to his every public utterance since Parkland. But I think that in their anti-Rubio zeal the student activists are also picking up on a general approach to politics that the Trump era has encouraged among liberals — a view that since the current Republican majorities were forged by anger and a kind of smash-mouth politics, it’s incumbent upon liberals to give no quarter in return, and to treat any sudden conciliation from a prominent figure like the Florida senator not as an opportunity for deal making but as a welcome sign of weakness that should inspire further fierce attack. This theory has a certain logic to it. Yes, if anti-gun activists spent less time screaming at him, Rubio’s efforts might open up a little more common ground on gun policy. But Rubio is only one senator, previous pushes for gun regulation have had Republican senatorial sponsors before dying by filibuster, and in 2013, when liberals were broadly favorable to his efforts, Rubio couldn’t deliver immigration reform because the Republican House wasn’t having it. The problem, then, is relying on the bipartisan impulses of few Republican politicians when what you need is a broader climate change. The path to that change requires first putting the fear of God (or, if you prefer, the fear of the Arc of History) into vulnerable Republican lawmakers, and then making them unpopular enough that you can simply beat them. "
125,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, made a surprise trip this week to meet with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Kim’s first trip abroad since taking power in 2011. Mr. Kim is preparing for summit meetings with U.S. and South Korean leaders, and the visit suggests that he values or needs China’s approval — and possibly advice — before the talks. New satellite images suggest that North Korea is expanding its nuclear production capabilities, which could complicate President Trump’s efforts to persuade Pyongyang to give up its weapons. • The U.S. and South Korea are to announce a bilateral trade agreement today. It’s the type of deal that Mr. Trump says benefits American workers, but it may have more to do with geopolitical realities. • Fearing an undercount, at least a dozen states signaled on Tuesday that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Opponents say the question would dissuade noncitizens, and even legal immigrants, from answering. The Trump administration says it’s needed for accurate estimates of voter numbers. "

127,"WASHINGTON — In the final months of the Obama administration, the Justice Department announced a new approach to preparing prisoners for life beyond their cells. Officials created a prison school system, pledged money for technology training and promised to help prevent former inmates from returning to prison. Almost immediately after taking office, Trump administration officials began undoing their work. Budgets were slashed, the school system was scrapped and studies were shelved as Attorney General Jeff Sessions brought to bear his tough-on-crime philosophy and deep skepticism of Obama-era crime-fighting policies. Now, nearly a year and a half later, the White House has declared that reducing recidivism and improving prisoner education is a top priority — echoing some of the very policies it helped dismantle. This whiplash approach to federal prison policy reflects the tension between Jared Kushner, the president’s reform-minded son-in-law and senior adviser, and Mr. Sessions, a hard-liner whose views on criminal justice were forged at the height of the drug war. It has left both Democratic and Republican lawmakers confused and has contributed to skepticism that the Trump administration is serious about its own proposals. On Capitol Hill, a wholesale reconsideration of American sentencing laws and prison policies has bipartisan support. Dozens of senators have sponsored a bill to change mandatory-minimum sentences and ease drug laws that have been used to seek lengthy sentences for nonviolent offenders. The bill also includes provisions to expand education, worker training and drug rehabilitation programs in prison. Mr. Kushner, administration officials say, supports such sweeping change. Mr. Sessions is adamantly opposed. The two men reached a compromise in recent months: Mr. Kushner could push for the prison changes, but Mr. Sessions would position the administration strongly against a broader overhaul. "
128,"PELHAM, N.Y. — Dr. Andrew Mutnick closely follows national politics, and has even gone door-knocking for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. But he admits he was caught off guard by the political landscape of his own backyard. It was not until Donald J. Trump won the presidency that Dr. Mutnick, a pediatrician with offices in Manhattan and Westchester County, learned that his own Democratic state senator, Jeffrey D. Klein, had been empowering Republicans in Albany. “I’m like, ‘Jeez, what? Really? Where have I been?’” he recalled thinking after discovering Mr. Klein’s leadership of a group of eight Democrats who have a power-sharing arrangement with Republicans in the State Senate. “I thought that if I didn’t know about this, I bet a lot of people don’t know,” Dr. Mutnick said. “It’s an incredibly insidious arrangement that is very difficult to untangle and understand.” Across the nation, a backlash to the Trump agenda is underway, especially among angry suburban voters like Dr. Mutnick. The latest example surfaced earlier this month in a Pennsylvania congressional special election, where Conor Lamb, a Democrat, defeated his Republican opponent in a district outside Pittsburgh that Mr. Trump had won by 20 percentage points. In New York, Democrats are mostly focused on unseating six Republican members of the congressional delegation. But for some, merely targeting Republicans is not enough; Mr. Klein’s group, the Independent Democratic Conference, is now fair game because it is viewed as an enabler to Republican rule — helping them control the State Senate even though Democrats hold a numerical majority.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Trevor Noah is not impressed by John R. Bolton, President Trump’s new pick for national security adviser. Bolton is known for his hard-line right-wing views, and he’s one of the few prominent members of the foreign-policy intelligentsia who still vociferously defend the United States’ 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2015, Bolton criticized President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran in an opinion article for The New York Times suggesting that the United States should launch pre-emptive strikes against Iran. On “The Daily Show” on Tuesday, Noah quoted from an interview Bolton gave to Fox News shortly after writing that article. Meanwhile, Stephen Colbert poked fun at Bolton’s prodigious facial hair and implied that Trump was probably expecting Bolton to play the role of a yes-man. Colbert sat down with Samantha Bee, who had traveled to Washington over the weekend to attend the March for Our Lives. Bee said she was stirred by the young people she met protesting, adding that when she was young, her hobbies were a bit more unsavory than theirs. “I was stealing cars when I was 15, 16 years old,” she admitted. “I was terrible.” Colbert was stupefied to hear that.

131,"BEIJING — China accused the deal maker who bought the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York of bilking investors of more than $10 billion. The vast amount of money that officials said the deal maker, Wu Xiaohui, had obtained illegally raised the stakes in a prosecution meant to show Beijing’s resolve to crack down on the titanic borrowing binge of recent years. The Chinese government last month seized Mr. Wu’s company, Anbang Insurance Group, in a move seen as making an example of a firm that piled on too much debt too fast and added risks to the country’s already creaky financial system. The $10.3 billion that prosecutors allege that Mr. Wu and Anbang raised illegally would make the case one of China’s biggest financial crimes trials. Mr. Wu pleaded guilty to the charges and asked the court for a light sentence, according to an account of the proceedings posted late Wednesday on the official social media account of the court in Shanghai where he is standing trial. He is almost certain to be found guilty, as Chinese courts convict nearly everyone prosecutors accuse. His plea was a turnabout from what the court had earlier described as a more defiant stance. Earlier on Wednesday, the court had said Mr. Wu had told the court that he did not know whether what he did constituted a crime, suggesting he would fight the charges. Mr. Wu had also denied charges that he had instructed his employees to escape abroad, to change their computers and mobile phones and to delete emails, financial data and corporate records once officials began investigating Anbang in March 2017, according to the court. Lawyers for the tycoon could not be reached for comment. The court in Shanghai released only a partial accounting of the proceedings online, and an independent description of them was not available. In China, such proceedings are typically closed to foreign news media. "
132,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that the Second Amendment — the right to keep and bear arms — “will never be repealed,” responding to an opinion piece written by a retired Supreme Court justice who called for just that. Mr. Trump’s declaration in an early morning tweet came after days of silence on the subject, despite student-organized  marches around the country over the weekend calling for more gun control. On Tuesday, the retired Justice John Paul Stevens wrote an Op-Ed  in The New York Times calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. “Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday,” Mr. Stevens wrote. “These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.” Repealing the Second Amendment would have to be approved by Congress, and there are no signs that such a move is underway. "
133,"At least for a night, America said it really did want more “Roseanne.” The revival of the vintage ABC sitcom got off to an enormously strong start on Tuesday night, drawing 18.2 million viewers and a 5.1 rating among adults under 50, according to Nielsen. The “Roseanne” numbers rank as the highest total of any comedy on the broadcast networks since the 2014 season premiere of “The Big Bang Theory.” For comparison’s sake, NBC’s reboot of “Will & Grace” in September drew a little over 10 million viewers and a 3.0 rating among 18- to 49-year-olds. Earlier this month, ABC’s revival of “American Idol” reached an audience of 10.3 million viewers and scored a 2.3 rating in the prize demographic. Both debuts were cause for celebration at both broadcast networks. The “Roseanne” numbers, however, are in an entirely different category and stand to grow when delayed viewing is factored in. Many TV industry executives were divided on whether or not a new version of “Roseanne” would take off. Though the industry has been in a reboot craze for the last two years (series like “Full House,” “Twin Peaks,” “The X-Files,” “One Day at a Time” and “Murphy Brown,” have all been brought back to life), the results have ranged from “meh” to solid. Unlike those shows, “Roseanne” has seemingly appealed to viewers for reasons having nothing to do with nostalgia: In interviews leading up to the sitcom’s premiere, the show’s Emmy-winning star, Roseanne Barr, made it clear that she was a supporter of President Trump and let it be known that her program would grapple with a hot political moment that has divided some American families.

134,"You may be reeling from revelations that the private Facebook data of millions unwittingly got in the hands of a voter-profiling firm with ties to President Trump. And you may be weighing the pros and cons of deleting your social media accounts altogether. But before you go there, ask yourself a simpler question: Why do you hoard so much data on social networks in the first place? For many of us, our timeline of posts has piled up since we signed up for Facebook and Twitter. While the social networks portray their products as time capsules of your fondest memories and conversations, the experience of poring through past posts is more like rummaging through a digital junk drawer of good, bad and ugly moments. And the hoarded data is just sitting out there for others to see, including potential employers who are doing background checks and any enemies who may be trying to dig up something against us. So why keep eternal timelines? I posed my question to Zizi Papacharissi, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Chicago who teaches courses on social media. She said many of us leave up our timeline of posts because Facebook and Twitter don’t make it simple to clean them up. There’s no button to set ablaze a large swath of content, like a year’s worth or even a month’s worth of posts. So we leave everything, including silly comments from our college years and rants we made when we were angry about politics or other matters. “If you say something online, it has a different kind of permanence,” Ms. Papacharissi cautioned. “It’s always there to haunt you.” So over the last two months, I decided to do something different by trying to erase that permanence. Specifically, I used web tools to eradicate the vast majority of my Facebook and Twitter posts. Those turned out to be impractical and tedious to use — though automated, the programs were flawed and missed many posts after several attempts. The chore took about five hours, spread out over weeks. "
135,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. • Confident, reasonable — willing to bargain. That’s how North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, came across in his debut as a global statesman — and he did so with a dash of mystery. Here’s how the Chinese and North Korean news media portrayed the meeting with President Xi Jinping. Mr. Kim’s two-day visit — his first trip abroad since taking power — was a reminder of how much he has set the agenda in the North Korean nuclear crisis and, our correspondent writes, what a strong hand he has going into negotiations. President Trump was quick to chime in. He posted on Twitter that Mr. Xi told him that the meeting went “very well” and that Mr. Kim “looks forward to his meeting with me.” _____ • Beijing  adjusted the optics in other areas, too. One of China’s biggest financial crimes trials intensified when the founder of Anbang Insurance, Wu Xiaohui, pleaded not guilty to bilking investors out of more than $10 billion. The surprise plea raises the stakes in a prosecution meant to show Beijing’s determination to crack down on a recent borrowing binge. "
136,"It has been my greatest professional honor to serve our country’s more than 20 million veterans. Almost three years ago, I left my private sector job running hospitals and came to Washington to repay my gratitude to the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country. I believe strongly in the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and nothing about my political experience in Washington could ever change that. I also believe that maintaining a strong V.A. is an essential piece of the puzzle that is the United States’ national security system: We can only expect our sons and daughters to risk their lives and fight for our freedom if we can keep our promise to care for them when they return home broken, injured or traumatized. There is no excuse for not holding up our end of the bargain. The mission set forth by President Abraham Lincoln to care for those who have “borne the battle” is a sacred duty that I will remain committed to always. During my tenure at the department, we have accomplished a tremendous amount. We passed critical legislation that improved the appeals process for veterans seeking disability benefits, enacted a new G.I. Bill and helped ensure that we employ the right people to work at the department. We have expanded access to health care by reducing wait times, increasing productivity and working more closely with the private sector. We have put in place more and better mental health services for those suffering from the invisible wounds of war. We are now processing more disability claims and appeals than ever before and, for the first time, allowing veterans to see the status of their appeals by simply logging on to their accounts. Unemployment among veterans is near its lowest level in years, at 3.5 percent, and the percent of veterans who have regained trust in V.A. services has risen to 70 percent, from 46 percent four years ago. It seems that these successes within the department have intensified the ambitions of people who want to put V.A. health care in the hands of the private sector. I believe differences in philosophy deserve robust debate, and solutions should be determined based on the merits of the arguments. The advocates within the administration for privatizing V.A. health services, however, reject this approach. They saw me as an obstacle to privatization who had to be removed. That is because I am convinced that privatization is a political issue aimed at rewarding select people and companies with profits, even if it undermines care for veterans. Until the past few months, veteran issues were dealt with in a largely bipartisan way. (My 100-0 Senate confirmation was perhaps the best evidence that the V.A. has been the exception to Washington’s political polarization.) Unfortunately, the department has become entangled in a brutal power struggle, with some political appointees choosing to promote their agendas instead of what’s best for veterans. These individuals, who seek to privatize veteran health care as an alternative to government-run V.A. care, unfortunately fail to engage in realistic plans regarding who will care for the more than 9 million veterans who rely on the department for life-sustaining care. "
137,"President Trump made a personal phone call on Wednesday to a political supporter with a huge megaphone — Roseanne Barr. Mr. Trump called Ms. Barr to congratulate her on the revival of her comedy, “Roseanne,” and to thank her for her support. The call was confirmed by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. The president, an obsessive about how TV shows perform, was enthralled by the “huge” ratings “Roseanne” had received, said a person familiar with the call. The show’s first episode, broadcast Tuesday evening on ABC, averaged 18.2 million viewers. “Roseanne,” featuring a working-class family of five and assorted relatives, returned to the air this week more than two decades after it ended its run. The lead actress’s character plays a backer of Mr. Trump. (Roseanne’s TV sister, Jackie Harris, by contrast, supports Hillary Clinton, though ultimately voted for Jill Stein.) Ms. Barr herself has been a vocal defender of Mr. Trump. In an interview with The New York Times published Tuesday, Ms. Barr said that she decided to turn her character, Roseanne Conner, into a Trump supporter because she felt it was an “accurate portrayal” of the political preferences of many working-class Americans. “I just wanted to have that dialogue about families torn apart by the election and their political differences of opinion and how we handle it,” she said. “I thought that this was an important thing to say at this time.” Ms. Barr defended the president at several points in the interview, objecting to a suggestion that he opposes many of the views that she and Roseanne Conner have espoused over the years, like support for abortion rights, same-sex marriage and organized labor. Mr. Trump used to back abortion rights before running for president as a Republican, but he has never supported same-sex marriage. “I think he voices them quite well,” she said of the stances that the president shares with her — and her character. She insisted that Mr. Trump favored same-sex marriage, even though he has never endorsed its legalization. “He has said it several times, you know, that he’s not homophobic at all,” she said. Ms. Barr did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday night. "

139,"PEORIA, Ariz. — With allegations of sexual misconduct swirling around President Trump, Debbie Lesko — a Republican candidate for Congress — sat down recently and clicked on “60 Minutes.” There was Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, saying that she had hidden a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump out of fear for her safety. Ms. Lesko, an ally of Mr. Trump’s, listened. And after, she said she found Ms. Clifford’s story “a little hard to believe.” “The business that she’s in — I’m sorry,” Ms. Lesko said. “People can make any kind of allegations they want, that doesn’t mean they’re true.” Here in Arizona, Ms. Lesko is in the final stretch of a special House race in the state’s deeply conservative Eighth Congressional District, which is being watched as a test of Mr. Trump’s popularity and as a possible foretelling of the fall midterm elections. The seat came open after the incumbent was caught in a sex scandal of his own. "
140,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department’s inspector general, facing increasing political pressure from Republicans in Congress and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said on Wednesday that his office would investigate the surveillance of a former Trump campaign official. The announcement came amid a stream of attacks in recent months from the White House and Republican lawmakers seeking to undermine the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, said he would examine whether law enforcement officials complied with the law and departmental policies in seeking permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap the former campaign adviser, Carter Page. Law enforcement officials had long had concerns that Mr. Page, a former investment banker based in Moscow, was acting as a Russian agent. Republicans have seized on details about the court-ordered surveillance of Mr. Page as evidence that the Justice Department abused its authority in the Russia investigation. Mr. Horowitz did not name Mr. Page in his announcement. Mr. Horowitz said he would also review what the Justice Department and the F.B.I. knew at the time about a former British spy and longtime F.B.I. source, Christopher Steele, who provided information about Mr. Page that was included in the surveillance application. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision but acknowledged that it fell short of demands by three Republican committee chairmen that the Justice Department appoint a second special counsel to investigate the accusations of surveillance abuses. "
141,"Trade pacts typically require years of detailed negotiations. The North American Free Trade Agreement needed two years. Creation of the World Trade Organization took eight. The Trump administration wants to remake global trade in a matter of months. To secure agreements quickly, the White House has taken a contentious approach to negotiations not seen in decades, threatening allies and adversaries alike with harsh sanctions like tariffs and quotas. Those tactics have returned a few early concessions from trading partners, including South Korea, whose revised trade agreement was formally announced by the United States on Wednesday. But it remains to be seen how much American workers would benefit from these deals and whether the global trading system can sustain the chaos. President Trump and his chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, have set a series of crucial deadlines that are rapidly approaching. Temporary exemptions on imports of steel and aluminum from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea have been scheduled to expire on May 1, and the Trump administration has been using that deadline as a cudgel to extract concessions from those nations. Mr. Trump is demanding that Canada and Mexico, which have been locked in tense, monthslong negotiations with the United States over Nafta, agree to a rewrite of the trade pact in a matter of weeks. He is seeking Europe’s support by then in a trade showdown with China, and has publicly questioned whether the United States will continue to accept a deal made long ago that allows the European Union to charge a tariff on imported cars that is four times as high as the United States’ tariff. In what might be the most difficult trade fight ahead, the Trump administration is taking steps to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion a year worth of goods from China as soon as late April. "
142,"NDONGA, Central African Republic — This remote village doesn’t have an official school, and there’s no functioning government to build one. So the villagers, desperate to improve their children’s lives, used branches and leaves to construct their own dirt-floor schoolhouse. It has no electricity, windows or desks, and it doesn’t keep out rain or beetles, but it does imbue hope, discipline and dreams. The 90 pupils sitting on bamboo benches could tutor world leaders about the importance of education — even if the kids struggle with the most basic challenges. “It’s hard to learn without a paper or pen,” Bertrand Golbé, a parent who turned himself into a teacher, acknowledged with a laugh. “But this is the way we have to do it. “They never have had breakfast when they arrive,” Golbé added. “They’re hungry. It’s difficult.” Yet the students do learn, here in one of the poorest countries in the world: They spoke French with me, and some were doing real geometry when I happened to drop in. One student, Doria Seleyanca, 13, said that his father had been killed in the warfare that has engulfed Central African Republic for 14 years, and his family doesn’t have much. “I eat one meal a day,” he explained stoically. Doria said he wanted to grow up to be a teacher — and he knew that an education was the only ticket to a better life. "
143,"It often seems that there is no end to President Trump’s cruel determination to transform America into a country that divides and dehumanizes its people. After his denigration of Muslims, refugees and undocumented immigrants, the latest example of this disgraceful proclivity is a presidential policy banning most transgender people from serving in the military — the second attempt to do so in less than a year. It puts thousands of servicemen and servicewomen at risk of losing their careers and means countless others may never get a chance to put on the uniform. The policy Mr. Trump announced Friday states, “Transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service,” unless the Pentagon grants an exception. This exacerbates uncertainties about how such a policy would be enforced and “makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome,” the American Civil Liberties Union said. The policy can’t yet take effect because federal courts have issued temporary injunctions that stay the ban on transgender service members that Mr. Trump abruptly decreed in a series of tweets last July, without consulting the nation’s top generals. Transgender Americans first secured the right to defend their nation as equals in 2016, under President Barack Obama, who made gender identity a protected category in the Pentagon’s equal opportunity policy. Mr. Trump’s announcement last summer was an attempt to reverse that Obama-era policy — and a clear effort to pander to Vice President Mike Pence, other right-wing zealots and regressive generals. The United States “will not accept or allow” transgender people in the military “in any capacity,” Mr. Trump tweeted at the time. The president, who avoided fighting in the Vietnam War by getting five deferments, also suggested that transgender enlistees are unfit to serve, tweeting that the military “must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.” In October, after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked the move and said the ban was probably unconstitutional, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to find a way to carry out a version of the ban, and in February, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis provided a recommendation. Mr. Mattis, a former Marine general, said that there were “substantial risks” related to transgender people who serve in the military and that allowing some of them to serve would amount to an exemption from certain mental, physical and sex-based standards, potentially undermining troops’ readiness and disrupting unit cohesion. "
144,"WASHINGTON — As the White House prepares to levy punishing tariffs on an array of Chinese goods, it is planning a much more strategic strike against China’s dominance in cutting-edge technology by restricting investment in American innovation. The Trump administration is preparing to limit Chinese investment in sensitive American technology, ranging from microchips to 5G wireless technology, as it tries to prevent China from gaining an edge in industries projected to power the global economy for decades. After years of tough restrictions on American companies trying to operate in China, including coercing the transfer of proprietary technology, the White House is looking to subject China to similar investment hurdles in the United States. To do so, the Treasury Department is considering using a powerful law generally reserved for national emergencies, according to administration officials. The 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was used to place sanctions on other countries after the Sept. 11 attacks, gives the president broad authority to respond to an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” including by halting incoming Chinese transactions, nullifying business deals and freezing foreign-owned assets. Matt Gold, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the statute has allowed the United States to impose economic sanctions on nations like Iran and Sudan and tends “to involve restrictions on U.S. firms investing in those countries or doing business with firms of those countries.” Using the law to restrict investment from China would allow the president to “block transactions to move funds, dispose of assets or otherwise do business,” Mr. Gold said. That would be a significant broadening of America’s existing power when it comes to foreign investment. The United States has broad export controls on sensitive technologies, and it reviews international mergers through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which can recommend that the president block foreign investments that pose a threat to national security. "
145,"Which would you rather have, a Donald Trump Wall or a Donald Trump Military Parade? No fair saying neither. Trump’s been pushing hard for both, and sooner or later the man has to win something. So if you had to choose, which way would you go? A. Parade, but there should be floats. B. Wall, but maybe around Mar-a-Lago. C. I don’t care as long as he doesn’t bomb anybody. Reasonable answers! And I’ll give you an advance hint of how it’s working out: The wall option is toast. Congress passed its big spending package last week, and the president’s request for wall money was ignored like a burp at a dinner party. All Trump got was $1.6 billion for stuff like fence repair. “I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill” Trump tweeted, complaining that “the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.” “Not fully funded” is a euphemism for “totally ignored.” Twittering Trump also bitterly complained that Congress had not done anything about DACA reform — protection for the people who were brought here illegally as children. That was, indeed, strange on two points. You’d think the Democrats would have tried to do something. But the Dreamers are safe now because of court orders, and their supporters think they’ve got more time to work the problem out. "
146,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s latest effort at banning transgender individuals from serving in the military amounts to what legal experts said is essentially a reprise of an all-too-familiar directive at the Pentagon: the 1994 “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. A slew of medical and legal professionals have already lined up against the newest White House order, issued late Friday night, which experts said may survive only if it is backed by the Supreme Court. That order is based on recommendations outlined by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in a Feb. 22 memo on the circumstances under which transgender people would be allowed to join or remain in the military. The memo by Mr. Mattis disqualified all people “who require or have undergone gender transition.” But he also recommended that, going forward, “transgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all service members, in their biological sex.” Gender dysphoria is the psychological condition of a person’s discomfort with their biological gender. The memo said that transgender troops who would be grandfathered into the system — under an Obama administration policy that allowed them to serve — could be discharged from the military if they continue to challenge the recommendations in courts. Supporters of transgender rights said the recommendations echoed “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which was repealed in 2010 after 17 years of requiring gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in the military to keep their sexuality a secret. "
147,"To the Editor: President Trump’s inaction in handling the opioid epidemic (“Mr. Trump’s Bluster on Opioids,” editorial, March 21) is heartbreaking. The point of “draining the swamp” was to more effectively address problems that career politicians neglected, with the overprescription of opioids being a prime example. Instead, we have a president who would rather project the image of improvement than actually institute effective changes. This is also seen in the issue of infrastructure, which Mr. Trump is happy to let fall by the wayside, knowing that his base wants him to build an impractical border wall instead. His solutions for the opioid problem reflect his desire for brash and dramatic “solutions”; his proposal to arm teachers occupies the same world as his call to execute drug dealers. What’s heartbreaking is that there are sensible, boring ways to fix such problems but that Mr. Trump most likely will never put them to use. HARRY LEVINE, BALTIMORE The writer is a senior at the Park School of Baltimore. "
148,"The many Americans now cheering President Trump’s willingness to fight a trade war with China no doubt believe that trade in recent years with that Asian nation has destroyed too many American jobs. Not long ago an academic paper by the economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson garnered an unusual amount of public attention because of its estimate that trade with China from 1999 to 2011 destroyed 2.4 million jobs in the United States. Our anxiety about trade-related job loss is not confined to China. Just a few weeks ago Mr. Trump declared that the North American Free Trade Agreement caused a “massive relocation of companies and jobs.” On Nafta’s 20th anniversary, in 2014, the trade skeptic Lori Wallach complained that the agreement had destroyed one million American jobs. These estimates of jobs destroyed by trade sound big, but they’re actually tiny. Relative to overall routine job destruction and creation — “job churn” — the number of American jobs destroyed by trade is minuscule. In January alone, the number of American workers who were laid off or dismissed from their jobs was 1.8 million. The number of workers who quit their jobs that month was 3.3 million. Adding in workers who left their jobs for other reasons, such as retirement and disability, the number of job separations in January was 5.4 million. But there were 5.6 million hires in January, too. Those numbers are typical of most months. Awareness of job churn should calm Americans’ fears about imports. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data on monthly nonfarm discharges and layoffs since September 2006. Unsurprisingly, this number peaked during the Great Recession, at 2.57 million in January 2009. But even excluding the recession months, the monthly average number of workers in the United States who lose their jobs is around 1.75 million. In a normal year, then, the number of workers laid off or dismissed averages 21 million. Compared with the number of total annual job losses, therefore, job losses from trade shrink into insignificance. "

Our correspondent says that’s the image North Korea’s young leader, Kim Jong-un, left, sought to project during a visit with President Xi Jinping in Beijing. It was Mr. Kim’s first known trip abroad since taking power — and it could strengthen his hand going into talks with the U.S. Here’s how the Chinese and North Korean news media covered the meeting. President Trump was quick to chime in. He posted on Twitter that Mr. Xi told him that the meeting went “very well” and that Mr. Kim “looks forward to his meeting with me.” ____ 2. A lawyer for President Trump broached the idea of pardoning two of his former top advisers, Michael Flynn, above, and Paul Manafort, with their lawyers last year, according to three people with knowledge of the talks. But the lawyer, John Dowd, who resigned last week, denied it. "
150,"Repairs on the Staten Island Expressway. Vegetables for nutritional programs in the Bronx. Programs for seniors in Manhattan and Queens. New schools in Brooklyn. The $7 billion from the federal government that funds all these aspects of New York life could be affected by one question on the 2020 census: Are you a United States citizen? That question is provoking fear among the city’s elected officials, who worry that because of its inclusion on the census questionnaire, some immigrants may decline to participate. Census information is not supposed to be shared with other parts of the government, but the Trump administration has said that all undocumented immigrants are subject to deportation, leading many to say they do not trust what the government will do with their information. Immigrants or children of immigrants make up nearly 60 percent of the city’s population, and the ripple effect could be powerful. Officials are concerned that could lead to an inaccurate population count in New York. “People have identified this as an immigrant problem, and that’s really not accurate,” said Joseph J. Salvo, the chief demographer for the Department of City Planning. The city’s education department comes to him for the data it uses to redraw school zones, he said, as does the health department when it needs to understand illness rates. Businesses use federal information to determine whether to open in underserved neighborhoods. "

This week, we’re talking about the surprises hidden in the spending bill; one thing that the president’s new hires have in common; and a court hearing on climate that we didn’t witness. Last week, lawmakers in Washington took a significant step toward addressing climate change. They just didn’t call it that. Buried in the $1.3 trillion spending bill passed by Congress and grudgingly signed by President Trump were surprisingly large increases in funding for clean energy programs at the Department of Energy. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has helped reduce the cost of solar power, got a 14 percent bump. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which funds long-shot technologies like algae biofuels, got a 16 percent increase. The Office of Nuclear Energy got a 19 percent increase. "
152,"As environmental concerns drive power companies away from using coal, natural gas has emerged as the nation’s No. 1 power source. Plentiful and relatively inexpensive as a result of the nation’s fracking boom, it has been portrayed as a bridge to an era in which alternative energy would take primacy. But technology and economics have carved a different, shorter pathway that has bypassed the broad need for some fossil-fuel plants. And that has put proponents of natural gas on the defensive. Some utility companies have scrapped plans for new natural-gas plants in favor of wind and solar sources that have become cheaper and easier to install. Existing gas plants are being shut because their economics are no longer attractive. And regulators are increasingly challenging the plans of companies determined to move forward with new natural-gas plants. “It’s a very different world that we’re arriving at very quickly,” said Robert McCullough, an energy consultant in Portland, Ore. “That wind farm can literally be put on a train and brought online within a year. It is moving so fast that even critics of the old path like myself have been taken by surprise.” The shifting dynamics are being seen in the Western states in particular — driven not only by economics, but by regulation and climate as well. The Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates the state’s investor-owned utilities, recently refused to endorse plans by three power companies that included more natural-gas facilities. Commissioners directed them to make greater use of energy storage and plants that produce zero emissions. "
153,"WASHINGTON — After weeks of uncertainty atop the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Trump dismissed its secretary, David J. Shulkin, on Wednesday and announced he would replace him with the White House physician, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. If confirmed, Dr. Jackson, a career Naval officer who has no real experience running a large bureaucracy, would inherit a set of challenges that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican administrations alike. The department, the federal government’s second largest, has been burdened for years by aging infrastructure, an inefficient health care system and an unwieldy 360,000-person work force. He could also quickly face crucial, multibillion-dollar decisions over the replacement of its outdated computerized records system and legislation that would ease the rules around veterans seeking private health care at government expense. The announcement punctuated what has been a rapid fall from favor for Dr. Shulkin, a politically moderate former hospital executive who delivered Mr. Trump a string of bipartisan legislative victories at a time when he was struggling to find them. But in his final weeks, he struggled to fight off attempts by more conservative administration officials to have him removed and was dogged by an unflattering inspector general report on his overseas travel that undermined his relationship with the president. Dr. Shulkin’s departure was the latest chapter in the remaking of Mr. Trump’s team of senior advisers, a shake-up that has led to the replacement of the secretary of state, the director of the C.I.A. and the national security adviser, along with White House aides. In the midst of that turmoil, Dr. Jackson, 50, who was named to his current position by President Barack Obama in 2013, has grown close with Mr. Trump, a commander in chief who enjoys familiar faces in his orbit and often rewards them with new roles.

’m in rural Victoria this week reporting on immigration — part of our effort to explore Australia’s multicultural present and future — and I have to say, now I get why so many of you urged me to get out of the cities and into the country. This isn’t my first trip to regional Australia, and let’s put aside the “real Australia” argument; in my book, cities and towns are both reflections of national character. But just as dinner parties are different with six guests rather than 60, towns with a few hundred people do have a lot to teach about human interaction and how a country really works. In my experience, towns of the singular — one market, one intersection — tend to produce a few things in abundance. Questions are among them. Visiting reporters rarely get too far without being asked about their plans, and within a day or so, word gets around. If you’re deemed trustworthy, introductions are made, phone numbers are shared and people just appear to tell their stories. "
155,"Until last week, the comedian and television creator Donald Glover was working on an animated series for FX about the Marvel superhero Deadpool, a violent mercenary character known for his wisecracks and toilet humor. By this week, the project had been canceled and Mr. Glover was on Twitter publicly raising more questions about what led to his departure from the show. The project, planned as a 10-episode run for the FXX channel and announced in May, was to have been a collaboration with Mr. Glover’s brother Stephen, another pairing of the siblings behind the show “Atlanta,” which airs on FX. (FXX is FX’s sister channel, and both are owned by 21st Century Fox.) But on Saturday, FX, citing “creative differences,” announced that the project had been canceled. Its statement said the Glovers had agreed to part ways with the network and with Marvel television. In an article about the announcement, Variety said the show “may have been a casualty of Donald Glover’s packed schedule.” Mr. Glover, who also releases music under the name Childish Gambino, disputed that characterization in a tweet thread on Wednesday: “For the record: I wasn’t too busy to work on ‘Deadpool,’” he said. "
156,"At the end of a recent Sunday service, the congregants at the Fourth Universalist Society on Central Park West placed their hands on the shoulders of a woman who stood in the center of the church. Then other members reached forward to touch those people’s shoulders, until the entire congregation was linked by touch like a radiating star. It was a symbol of their commitment to put the woman, Aura Hernandez, 37, an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant, at the center of their church’s life for what may be months or even years to come. Two weeks ago, Ms. Hernandez moved into a worn former office at the historic Upper West Side church with her 15-month-old daughter, Camila, to avoid deportation to Guatemala. In doing so, she joins about 40 other immigrants around the nation who are being publicly shielded by houses of worship. She vows to remain there, without going outside, until her immigration status changes. “I don’t intend to stand here with my arms crossed, and do nothing,” Ms. Hernandez said in Spanish at the church on Tuesday, about her goal in seeking sanctuary. “I have to stand up and raise my voice because an injustice is being committed to me and to us. I think I’m here for a reason.” With help from other houses of worship and volunteers, this 130-member congregation will feed Ms. Hernandez, do the family’s laundry, and help care for Camila, who is a U.S. citizen and can go outside. They will buy new carpet and paint for her room, and welcome Ms. Hernandez’s 10-year-old son, Daniel, to live there on weekends and when the school year ends. Daniel, also born in the United States, is living in Westchester County with Ms. Hernandez’s husband, who also is undocumented. It is a difficult situation, but the members of the Fourth Universalist, who met Ms. Hernandez at the March 18 service, said they were excited about being asked for help. Their Unitarian Universalist denomination calls for the use of social action to advance progressive principles, they explained. So for them, this is a unique opportunity. "
157,"DAKAR, Senegal — Thousands of Ghanaians rallied in the streets of their capital on Wednesday to protest a deal that would give the United States military an expanded role in Ghana. As part of the agreement struck last week, the United States would invest about $20 million in equipment and training for the Ghanaian military, carrying out joint exercises with Ghana and using the nation’s radio channels and runways. Ghanaian officials said the agreement was an extension of a two-decades-long relationship between the United States and Ghana, a West African nation that has been a regular host of bilateral and multilateral military exercises. “It’s the same arrangement we’ve had in times past,” said Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, the deputy minister of information. He said that resistance to the deal was largely driven by the political motivations of opposition lawmakers. But the deal struck a nerve in Ghana, which is in a region where the expansion of the American military has received increasing scrutiny. In Accra, the capital, more than 3,000 people gathered in the streets to protest the agreement. “Having partaken in the struggle and fight towards our independence, we can never sit unconcerned when it comes to an agreement which has the tendency of compromising our sovereignty and integrity,” said Frank Amoako Hene, president of the National Union of Ghana Students, who was among the protesters.

158,"To the Editor: Re “At Least 12 States Ready to Sue U.S. Over the Census” (front page, March 28): Basic civil disobedience 101: Every resident of the United States — documented and undocumented alike — should refuse to answer any citizenship question on the census. The addition of this question after decades can be nothing but a blatant effort by an administration hostile to undocumented (read: brown) residents to locate and deport them, and to rig congressional districts in favor of Republicans. As with many impulsive and ham-handed decisions by this administration, it is simply a means to an end without consideration of collateral consequences. Here, populations (who are not going anywhere) will be undercounted and could lose funding for trivial things like education, health care and basic civic services as well as their fair and proportionate political representation. We need an accurate count. The Constitution demands it. JOANNE POLVY COHEN
SHERMAN OAKS, CALIF. To the Editor: The Constitution specifically requires a census count of “persons,” not “citizens,” and this unrestricted count of “persons” was specifically intended and constitutionally insulated to protect the states in their then-sovereign prerogative (pre-Dred Scott) to decide who would have the right to vote. If the Constitution had counted citizens, it would have left out slaves. If the Constitution had not counted persons, it would have prevented slaves from being counted as three-fifths “of all other persons” for purposes of increasing the number of representatives that slave states would have in Congress. WILLIAM R. EVERDELL, BROOKLYN "
159,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is attempting to scale back federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws, freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses, including Facebook, while sidelining officials who have aggressively pursued civil rights cases. The policy shift, detailed in interviews with 20 current and former Department of Housing and Urban Development officials and in internal agency emails, is meant to roll back the Obama administration’s attempts to reverse decades of racial, ethnic and income segregation in federally subsidized housing and development projects. The move coincides with the decision this month by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, to strike the words “inclusive” and “free from discrimination” from HUD’s mission statement. But Mr. Carson dismissed the idea he was abandoning the agency’s fair housing mission as “nonsense” in a memo to the department’s staff earlier this year, and reiterated that point during recent congressional hearings. A spokesman for the agency, Jereon Brown, said any programmatic changes are part of the routine recalibration undertaken from administration to administration, rather than a philosophical shift. Advocates for the poor and career HUD officials say that Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, and his political appointees have begun weakening the department’s fair housing division at a critical moment. The agency now has its greatest leverage to right past wrongs thanks to the $28 billion in disaster recovery Community Development Block Grants that Congress has appropriated to rebuild the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. In an email in November, a top HUD official relayed the news that the head of the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity division, Anna Maria Farías, had ordered a hold on about a half-dozen fair housing investigations given the highest priority under Mr. Carson’s most recent predecessor, Julián Castro. The freeze would be in effect “until further notice,” the official wrote. The investigations, known as “secretary-initiated cases” to indicate their importance, had been used in the past to set precedent and to put other localities and developers on notice. "
160,"Ecuador’s government said Wednesday that it had suspended internet access for Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who since 2012 has lived in Ecuador’s Embassy in London, out of concern that he was harming its relationships with Britain and other European nations. The decision set off a furious reaction from some Assange supporters. One of them, Kim Dotcom, an online renegade who founded a file-sharing site, urged supporters to gather outside the embassy in protest. The filmmaker Oliver Stone wrote on Twitter: “Free Julian Assange! Restore his internet connection!” Ecuador’s government granted Mr. Assange citizenship in January, the latest step in a longstanding diplomatic standoff. But it said it had suspended Mr. Assange’s online communications on Tuesday because he had imperiled “the good relations that the country maintains with the United Kingdom, with the rest of the states of the European Union, and other nations” through his social-media messages. The government did not provide specifics, but some speculated that the decision might have been related to the Western nations’ coordinated actions against Russia after the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. In a series of Twitter posts this week, Mr. Assange was critical of Western nations’ expulsions of Russian diplomats. The agendas of WikiLeaks and Russia have dovetailed at times, whether by coincidence or intent. In July 2016, WikiLeaks published nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails that had been hacked by the Russian government, embarrassing the party’s nominee, Hillary Clinton. In November, it emerged that Donald Trump Jr. had online conversations with WikiLeaks during his father’s campaign. Two Assange supporters — the English rock musician Brian Eno and the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis — speculated that Ecuador was reacting to tweets in which Mr. Assange criticized the Spanish government’s detention of Catalan separatists and the recent arrest, in Germany, of the separatist leader Carles Puigdemont. They called efforts to isolate Mr. Assange “appalling.” "
161,"An American military drone strike over the weekend in southern Libya killed a top recruiter and logistics specialist for Al Qaeda’s branch in northwest Africa, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, and a senior military official warned of more attacks on extremists there. The military’s Africa Command said in a statement that the attack killed two militants, one of whom was identified as Musa Abu Dawud, a high-ranking official in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM. Mr. Dawud trained Qaeda recruits in Libya for strike operations in the region, and provided logistics, money and weapons that enabled the group to threaten and attack American and Western interests, the military statement said. Until now, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya — eight since President Trump took office — almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north. Over several months in 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt to destroy the Islamic State’s stronghold there. The missile fired by the American drone on Saturday was the first in southern Libya. It struck a house in Ubari, 435 miles south of Tripoli, in the country’s southwest, a notorious haven for a deadly mix of Al Qaeda and other extremist groups that also operate in the Sahel region of Niger, Chad, Mali and Algeria. The area is also close to major oil fields that were crippled by violent ethnic feuding in 2015. “I wouldn’t say this is the beginning of a wider campaign,” Col. Mark Cheadle, the Africa Command’s chief spokesman, said in an email. But, he added, “If we find targets we can strike, and it is appropriate to do so, I think we would certainly consider the option.” "
162,"WASHINGTON — A lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by refusing to divorce himself from his businesses cleared a critical hurdle Wednesday when a federal judge in Maryland refused the Justice Department’s plea to dismiss it. In a 47-page opinion, Judge Peter J. Messitte rejected the federal government’s claims that the plaintiffs had not shown that they had suffered injuries that a court could address. The suit, filed by Washington, D.C., and the State of Maryland, accuses Mr. Trump of violating constitutional anticorruption clauses intended to limit his receipt of government-bestowed benefits, or emoluments. The local jurisdictions claim that in hopes of currying presidential favor, government officials are patronizing Trump-owned properties instead of hotels or convention centers that the District of Columbia or Maryland own or have some financial interest in. Although the case could still be thrown out on other grounds, the judge’s ruling adds to the president’s growing legal troubles. Besides the continuing criminal inquiry into Russia’s influence over the presidential election, an actress in pornographic films, a former Playboy model and a onetime contestant on “The Apprentice” have filed civil lawsuits over their alleged relationships with Mr. Trump before he became president. The emoluments case raises basic questions that have never been litigated. Even the specific definition of an emolument is unclear. During a January court hearing, Judge Messitte seemed to acknowledge that the case would ultimately be decided by a higher court than his. "
163,"Almost a year after Kathy Griffin appeared in a widely condemned photograph that depicted her holding the severed head of President Trump, this comedian and actress is making a TV comeback of sorts. Ms. Griffin will appear on Tuesday in a special episode of the Comedy Central series “The President Show,” in which she will play Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, the network announced on Thursday. “I am kicking the hornet’s nest, as much as I can,” Ms. Griffin said in a phone interview. “I think it’s important to lean into the controversy, because I know so much more about it now,” she added. “I think now enough time has passed where people are starting to see the ridiculousness of what happened to me, and they’re seeing other people that Trump has done it to.” “The President Show” stars Anthony Atamanuik as a satirical version of Mr. Trump hosting a late-night program from the Oval Office. It has also featured other comedians playing members of the Trump family and administration, including Peter Grosz as Vice President Pence, Adam Pally as Donald Trump Jr. and Mario Cantone as Anthony Scaramucci. This will be Ms. Griffin’s first television role since the incident last May in which she posed in a photograph while holding a blood-smeared representation of Mr. Trump’s head. (She has appeared on talk shows since then, including a recent episode of “Real Time With Bill Maher.”) Ms. Griffin was swiftly rebuked by Mr. Trump, who wrote on Twitter that she “should be ashamed of herself.” "
164,"WASHINGTON — President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday, saying in an early-morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes — and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation’s largest e-commerce business. Mr. Trump accused Amazon, one of the country’s most recognizable and successful brands, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its “Delivery Boy.” The president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015. And privately, people close to him said, Mr. Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company, often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos. By focusing on the threat to small businesses, Mr. Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon’s disruptive force. The company has changed industries as varied as publishing, groceries and health care. That has helped the company grow to be worth more than $700 billion, but it has also made it a convenient target. The president has little clear authority to take action against the company. Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company, but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases. Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that “the president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.” "

The Times reports that President Trump’s personal lawyer discussed pardoning Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, and Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman. Writing in Just Security, Harvard Law School’s Alex Whiting offers one legal interpretation: If presidential pardons were dangled in an attempt to keep the pair from cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s Russia ties, “it should qualify as a potential act of obstruction of justice.” That’s because the president has the power to issue pardons — but not to secretly offer them in exchange for silence, argues Asha Rangappa, a former F.B.I. special agent. “Even the immense powers of the president can’t be used as a bargaining chip.” Kim Jong-un goes to China. The North Korean leader’s meeting with President Xi Jinping of China this week suggests the two countries are setting aside their differences to advance a shared goal: limiting American influence in Asia, argues Ankit Panda in The Atlantic. China will likely play a key role in upcoming negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program. “Meanwhile,” Panda writes, “the White House remains in chaos.” Now, to millions of Americans, today is one of the best days of the year.

Amazon hasn’t responded to President Trump’s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won’t. Mr. Trump’s criticisms, though, are largely mistaken. For a long time, Amazon did not pay state sales tax, but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it. It is the case, however, that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform. As for the United States Postal Service, Amazon’s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue. Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon’s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful. "
168,"Updated, 10:30 a.m. Good morning on this Holy Thursday. It’s opening day for Major League Baseball, and our two teams have two new faces that will be hard to miss this season. Their managers. Mickey Callaway has taken over for the Mets, and Aaron Boone will lead the Yankees. “The manager is the most public face of every single team, more so than the players,” said James Wagner, who covers the Mets for The Times. “Both teams had managers for a long time,” he added — Terry Collins had been with the Mets for seven years, and Joe Girardi with the Yankees for 10 — “so there’s been continuity for both teams that changed at the same time.” It will be a gamble for both squads because neither manager has done the job before; Mr. Callaway was the pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians, and Mr. Boone was an ESPN announcer with no coaching or managing experience. They are also younger than most managers. At 68, Mr. Collins, was the oldest manager in the major leagues. Mr. Callaway, 42, is one of the youngest. “It’s become a trend to have younger, more inexperienced people be managers,” Mr. Wagner said. “Knowing how to handle data and information and knowing how to relate to the players is more important than having done this for 30 years.” "
169,"Crucial disputes over Democratic strategy concerning economic distribution, race and immigration have in large part been based on Election Day exit polls that now appear to have been inaccurate in key ways. According to subsequent studies, those polls substantially underestimated the number of Democratic white working-class voters — many of whom are culturally conservative — and overestimated the white college-educated Democratic electorate, a far more culturally liberal constituency. “The short answer is that the exit polls are wrong,” Matthew DeBell, a senior scholar at Stanford’s Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, emailed me. He continued: The Pew Research Center and the Center for American Progress have produced methodologically sophisticated surveys of the electorate that sharply contradict 2016 exit polls. Perhaps most significant, a March 20 Pew Research Center public opinion survey found that 33 percent of Democratic voters and Democratic leaners are whites without college degrees. That’s substantially larger than the 26 percent of Democrats who are whites with college degrees — the group that many analysts had come to believe was the dominant constituency in the party. According to Pew, this noncollege white 33 percent makes up a larger bloc of the party’s voters than the 28 percent made up of racial and ethnic minorities without degrees. It is also larger than the 12 percent of Democratic voters made up of racial and ethnic minorities with college degrees. In sum, Pew’s more precise survey methods reveal that when Democrats are broken down by education, race and ethnicity, the white working class is the largest bloc of Democratic voters and substantially larger than the bloc of white college-educated Democratic voters. "
170,"In the throes of the campaign in September 2016, Mike Pence told a crowd at the Living Word Bible Church in Mesa, Ariz.: “I’m old enough to remember back in the last Clinton administration where America really had a debate over whether character mattered to the presidency. We don’t need to have that debate again. We don’t need to have that debate again. Character matters to the presidency and Donald Trump will bring the highest level of integrity to the highest office in the land. You can count on it.” Ha. This after a lifetime of Trump boasting about his sexual conquests, after years of him going on the Howard Stern show and saying the most debauched things, and just two weeks before the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape on which Trump boasted about kissing and groping women without their permission — in other words, sexual assault. Pence’s proclamation was a lie when he said it, and is even more of a lie now. Trump is involved in litigation over sexual encounters on three fronts, including with the porn star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels. But the Daniels scandal is hardly making a dent. As Politico reported Wednesday, “The data suggest Trump’s past behavior with women is already known among voters — and many are willing to overlook it.” Politico continued: “Trump’s seeming imperviousness to the scandal is stunning given the opinions Americans profess to hold on issues of character. In the most recent Politico/Morning Consult poll, 91 percent said honesty is ‘very important’ for elected officials to embody in their personal life in order to carry out their official duties. Seventy-five percent said the same about morality. On the question of extramarital affairs, 80 percent said they were morally wrong. Despite all that, when asked directly about the Daniels scandal, nearly half of voters say it doesn’t change how they view Trump.” Conservatives have twisted themselves into knots trying to excuse Trump’s vulgarities as acceptable and somehow set them apart from the supposed productivity of the man himself, somehow cleaving the sin from the sinner.

171,"Even as it issues full-page apologies in print newspapers promising ritualistically “to do better,” Facebook and its allies have minimized the importance of the seismic revelation that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on behalf of the Trump campaign in 2016, had gained access to the private information of about 50 million Facebook users. Some executives have pointed out that the mechanism that until a few years ago allowed a researcher with 270,000 app downloads to have access to 50 million profiles wasn’t exactly a secret, and, besides, Facebook users nominally agreed to the sharing of these profiles so that apps would perform better. The company’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter to complain that Facebook and other “platforms” were being held to a double standard concerning the profiles, since they may well “have been criticized as monopolists for locking them down.” Others poured cold water on the idea that Cambridge Analytica was able to use these profiles as grist for its research on swaying voters by cracking the code of human intention. Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and a Facebook board member, doesn’t tweet anymore, but he “likes” hundreds of tweets a week, a group that recently included a string that mocked the public’s fear that new media forms can be turned into “weapons of total mind control.” Perhaps these are the wrong reasons for outrage, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be outraged. What Facebook is selling to political campaigns is the same thing Uber is selling to its drivers and customers and what YouTube is selling to advertisers who hope to reach an audience of children — namely, the right to bypass longstanding rules and regulations in order to act with impunity. When you look at the Facebook data leak scandal this way, you realize that Facebook’s irresponsibility isn’t merely an abuse of a personal relationship — what its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us” — but also an abuse of a civic relationship. Selling relief from government scrutiny of elections is a different kind of threat to the social fabric than selling relief from government scrutiny of commerce, especially in light of our country’s record of denying voting rights to African-Americans. Facebook can’t be allowed to be a tool for enemies of democracy because it fears that regulation could hurt its bottom line. "
172,"If you take Jeremy Corbyn at his word, then the leader of Britain’s Labour Party is no anti-Semite. It’s just that, like the Wild West preacher who keeps accidentally wandering into Fannie Porter’s house of ill repute, Corbyn has an odd knack for stumbling into the arms of the Hebraically disinclined. Corbyn is facing public protests and scathing criticism again this week after it emerged that in 2012 he had questioned the removal of a London mural by the artist Kalen Ockerman that looks like a scene drawn from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. He now claims, unconvincingly, that he regrets not looking “more closely at the image.” It also turns out that he was a member of several Facebook groups, one of which displayed “postings about the Rothschild banking family, Jews harvesting organs and theories connecting Israel with Islamic State,” according to London’s Jewish Chronicle. “Had I seen” anti-Semitism, Corbyn says, “I would have challenged it straight away.” This was barely a month after Corbyn issued a Facebook post for Holocaust Memorial Day that included no mention of Jews or anti-Semitism. Following an outcry, Corbyn made public another message, this one mentioning “our Jewish brothers and sisters.” Around the same time, a Labour Party briefing document urged its members to reject an effort to ban Hezbollah in Britain. In 2009, Corbyn had described the Lebanese terrorist group, along with the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, as “friends.” Seven years later he explained he was merely using “inclusive language,” which “with hindsight I would rather not have used.” "
173,"Legal journalists and bloggers have been having a field day with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s put-down of Justice Sonia Sotomayor during a Supreme Court argument last week. The argument came in a case challenging California’s effort to regulate “crisis pregnancy centers,” offices that look like abortion clinics but that don’t provide abortions. Some provide pregnancy-related medical services, while others don’t have a doctor on the premises and offer no medical services at all. The California law requires clinics without doctors to disclose that fact. Close to the surface of the case, although only obliquely confronted during the argument, is whether the clinics’ operating model is properly described as luring women inside by pretending to be something they’re not. Justice Sotomayor came close to making that accusation. Addressing the lawyer for the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, the network of pregnancy centers that brought the case, she said she had looked at “a few” of the clinics’ websites and had come upon one that showed “a woman on the home page with a uniform that looks like a nurse’s uniform in front of an ultrasound machine” in what looked like an examination room. “I’m fairly sophisticated,” Justice Sotomayor said, and suggested that she might nonetheless have been fooled into thinking she was about to see a doctor. Justice Sotomayor and the lawyer, Michael P. Farris, went back and forth for a some minutes until finally Justice Kennedy jumped in to offer Mr. Farris a helping hand. “Well, in this case I didn’t go beyond the record to look on the internet because I don’t think we should do that,” he began. Aha! “Sotomayor Rapped for Surfing the Web” read The Associated Press headline on an article carried by news outlets all over the country. In a smart article in The Washington Post titled “Supreme Court Rule: (Other) Justices Shouldn’t Conduct Independent Research,” Robert Barnes, the newspaper’s Supreme Court correspondent, had great fun chronicling instances of research conducted outside the official record of a case by members of the Supreme Court including Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, the current Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and, yes, Justice Kennedy himself. Everyone was shocked! shocked! (or at least, amused) to learn there was research going on. In fact, the courtroom exchange opened the window on a subject as elusive as it is fascinating: How do judges know what they need to know in order to perform the job of deciding cases? The formal answer is that when it comes to the facts, appellate judges are bound by the record established at trial. Supreme Court justices, who of course never get near a trial, frequently consult the trial record; in fact, the court’s electronic docket, which lists the procedural progress of every case filed, often includes the notation “record requested.” "
174,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • What do Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort know? A lawyer for President Trump broached the idea of pardons for the two former advisers last year, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The talks could suggest that the White House was concerned about what Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort might reveal to the special counsel in the Russia investigation. The lawyer who is said to have made the offer, John Dowd, denied the reports on Wednesday. He resigned as the president’s lead lawyer for the Russia inquiry last week. • Separately, a top Trump campaign official had frequent phone calls  before the election with a person the F.B.I. believes had active links to Russian spy services at the time. That’s according to a document released this week by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. • President Trump nominated his physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, replacing David Shulkin. Dr. Jackson, a career Naval officer, appeared in the spotlight this year when he announced the results of Mr. Trump’s first physical while in office. If confirmed, Dr. Jackson would inherit the federal government’s second-largest department, which has been burdened by aging infrastructure, an inefficient health care system and a 360,000-person work force.

175,"A campaign to unseat eight state Democratic senators — members of a renegade group that has helped empower Republicans to rule the Senate in Albany — will receive a significant boost from the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer. Mr. Stringer on Thursday will endorse two Democratic challengers trying to topple members of the group, the Independent Democratic Conference, in the September primary. “When you run for office as a Democrat and caucus with the Republicans, you are not acting like a Democrat.” Mr. Stringer, a Democrat, said in an interview. “This has gone on for too long. I want to break the dam.” The cooperation of the eight-member body has helped allow Senate Republicans to control the chamber even though they are outnumbered by Democrats. Mr. Stringer will endorse Robert Jackson, who is challenging Marisol Alcantara in Manhattan, and Jessica Ramos, who is challenging Jose R. Peralta in Queens. Although the I.D.C. was created in 2011, its existence — largely tolerated or ignored by many Democrats in New York — has now become a hot-button issue. "

177,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea will meet for the first time on April 27, officials said on Thursday, setting a date for talks meant to extend the recent détente on the Korean Peninsula and pave the way for discussions between Mr. Kim and President Trump. Early this month Mr. Kim agreed to a meeting with Mr. Moon, part of a flurry of diplomacy around North Korea’s nuclear program that began with the North’s participation last month in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Senior negotiators from both Koreas met Thursday at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village on the countries’ border, to agree on a date and discuss other aspects of the summit meeting. The two Korean leaders will meet at Peace House, a South Korean building inside Panmunjom, according to a joint statement the negotiators issued at the end of their talks on Thursday. Peace House lies south of the demarcation line that bisects Panmunjom, which means that Mr. Kim would become the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War. Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, the South’s chief delegate to the Panmunjom talks, hinted at progress toward including denuclearization in the agenda for the Kim-Moon meeting. But he said the two Koreas might need another round of high-level talks in coming weeks to settle the matter. “The South and North agreed on efforts to make the summit successful, sharing its historic significance in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, settling peace there and improving inter-Korean relations,” Mr. Cho told reporters. The meeting will be the third ever held between leaders of the two Koreas. Mr. Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, met with two South Korean presidents — Kim Dae-jung in 2000 and Roh Moo-hyun in 2007 — in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. "
178,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Kim Jong-un’s power play, a French march against hate and a Balkan design facepalm. Here’s the latest: • Confident, reasonable — willing to bargain. That’s how North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, came across in his debut as a global statesman — and he did so with a dash of mystery. Here’s how the Chinese and the North Korean news media portrayed the meeting with President Xi Jinping. Mr. Kim’s two-day visit — his first known trip abroad since taking power — was a reminder of how much he has set the agenda in the North Korean nuclear crisis and, our correspondent writes, what a strong hand he has going into negotiations. President Trump was quick to chime in. He posted on Twitter that Mr. Xi told him that the meeting went “very well” and that Mr. Kim “looks forward to his meeting with me.” _____ • “In France, we kill grandmothers because they’re Jewish.” Condemning anti-Semitic violence, thousands marched through Paris to honor Mireille Knoll, above, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor who was murdered in her apartment last week.

179,"Rusty Staub reached base 34 more times than Rogers Hornsby. He also reached base more times than — among many others — Tony Gwynn, Nap Lajoie, Ichiro Suzuki and Honus Wagner. He reached base 1,000 more times than Joe DiMaggio. When the man they called Le Grand Orange died on Thursday, baseball lost one of its finest practitioners of the sport’s most important skill. And owing to the unique way in which he approached batting, he died as one of the game’s most underappreciated stars. In 23 seasons, Staub reached base 4,050 times, the 41st highest total in baseball history. (The number grows to 4,165 if you include the 115 times he reached via error.) He was a six-time All-Star who finished his career with 292 home runs, 1,466 runs batted in and 45.8 wins above replacement. Most of those career totals are, admittedly, below Hall of Fame standards. But for some context on how impressive the feat of reaching base 4,000 times is, consider how often those who have accomplished it have been enshrined in Cooperstown. Forty-six players have done it, 43 have been retired long enough to be considered for Hall of Fame induction, and 37 of those players were elected. The six who were not: Pete Rose, Barry Bonds, Rafael Palmeiro, Gary Sheffield, Staub and Manny Ramirez. It is a group that mostly explains itself in terms of Hall exclusion. There are four players who had their careers tainted for many voters through connections to performance-enhancing drugs, one who was barred from baseball for life for gambling on the sport and thus was ineligible for election, and then there is Staub, a treasure of at least two teams’ fan bases, who appeared on the ballot seven times and never garnered more than 7.9 percent of the vote. The problem, of course, is that Staub got so much of his on-base production through walks rather than hits. He finished his career with a good-but-not-great 2,716 hits, and a truly spectacular 1,255 walks. Those totals propelled him to a .362 career on-base percentage, which when combined with his .431 slugging percentage, and adjusted for his home parks and era, made him 24 percent better than the average batter for the duration of his career. Only 19 batters in major league history finished their careers with as many at-bats as Staub (9,720) and an adjusted on-base plus slugging percentage higher than his (124). "
180,"Eric H. Holder Jr., the United States attorney general for six years under President Barack Obama, stepped away from public service in 2015 but has since emerged as a bulwark against the Trump administration, taking a leading role in challenging the president’s policies in court and trying to chip away at the Republicans’ grip on state governments. Mr. Holder discussed his efforts to fight Republican gerrymandering, whether Facebook should be regulated and the potential legacy of Mr. Trump’s presidency in a wide-ranging TimesTalks conversation with the reporter Alexander Burns on Wednesday night in New York. Here are the takeaways. After the Trump administration announced this week that it would add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, Mr. Holder said he planned to sue to block the change on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which he chairs. The census aims to count everyone who resides in the country, whether they are citizens or not, and Mr. Holder echoed the concerns expressed by several states this week that the citizenship question could reduce the responses from noncitizens and even legal immigrants. He said his lawsuit would be aided by Mr. Trump’s Twitter utterances. “This is one of those incidences where I think the president’s tweets and public statements will become relevant,” Mr. Holder, 67, said. “To show the true intent — that it is not as benign as they would make it out to be. Through the words of Donald Trump and through the tweets of Donald Trump, you’ll see what the true intention was of the administration.” Normally, he noted, it would be difficult to argue in court that the government pushed a policy with a malicious intent. But Mr. Trump’s tweets provide plenty of material for lawsuits, Mr. Holder said. “It is certainly the gift that keeps on giving,” he said. Mr. Holder conceded that he prefers Twitter to Facebook but occasionally catches a glimpse of Facebook when his wife signs on. But he said he had been following the recent news that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. That security breach, along with the social network’s role in spreading Russian-backed propaganda during the presidential election, bolstered an argument for regulating Facebook, Mr. Holder said. "
181,"Before reading the article: Every 10 years the Census Bureau counts each person who lives in the United States, as required by the Constitution. As The Times recently reported: Watch this short Reuters video about the Trump administration’s decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Do you think asking residents if they are citizens is a good idea? Why or why not? Now, read the article, “At Least Twelve States to Sue Trump Administration Over Census Citizenship Question,” and answer the following questions: 1. Why are 12 states suing to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census? 2. What did Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts say about the new census question? 3. Why are some people opposed to the new question, according to the article? 4. What is the Trump administration’s rationale for adding the question? 5. What details does the article give about the history of asking residents if they are citizens? What does the article say about the timing of the added question? 6. What does Eric. T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, mean when he says adding the new question “will create an environment of fear and distrust in immigrant communities that would make impossible both an accurate census and the fair distribution of federal tax dollars”? Why? 7. Why did Kenneth Prewitt, a director of the Census Bureau under President Bill Clinton and now a professor of public affairs at Columbia University, dismiss the administration’s rationale that the question is needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act by saying, “It’s certainly unnecessary”? Finally, tell us more about what you think: Do you think the citizenship question is necessary for the 2020 census, and why? Do you think some people will ignore the citizenship question on the census or refuse to fill the census out completely? Why? What do you think will happen if the 2020 census data reflects an undercount of the population of the United States, and why do you think so? What do you think is the best way to get a fair and accurate count of the people living in the United States, and why? For related coverage, see “Here’s Why an Accurate Census Count Is So Important,” “Why Asking About Citizenship Could Make the Census Less Accurate” and “With 2020 Census Looming, Worries About Fairness and Accuracy.” "
182,"BRIDGEPORT, CONN. — Joseph P. Ganim, the mayor of Connecticut’s largest city, is selling a message of imperfection, but also redemption. He is the embodiment of the second chance: After serving as Bridgeport’s mayor in the 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Ganim, a Democrat, was convicted on multiple charges of corruption and sent to federal prison. Seven years later, he emerged from his “time away,” as he calls it, a changed man. He returned to City Hall as mayor in 2015, vowing to make his mayoral redux squeaky clean — even hiring, as a senior adviser, the F.B.I. agent who was a key member of the prosecution team that convicted him. Now, Mr. Ganim is hoping to pull off an even more improbable comeback: He is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor amid a crowded field of candidates bidding to replace the Democratic two-term governor, Dannel P. Malloy, who is not seeking re-election. Mr. Ganim believes that his life experience will resonate with voters across the state, and not only in cities like Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven that are troubled by crime, unemployment and poverty. “There are people in every pocket of Connecticut who are struggling,” he said. “I’m ‘second chance.’ But there are people who are still looking for their first chance. One thing I do bring — imperfect as I might be — is the experience of solving problems in a public-sector environment.” "
183,"In announcing Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, as his choice to be the new secretary for veterans affairs, President Trump has taken his latest misstep in what has been the worst presidential personnel process in modern history. We take no pleasure in saying so, including because one of us (Mr. Eisen) worked with Dr. Jackson in the White House, was even treated by him, and can testify that he is a very capable physician. But that good opinion of Dr. Jackson, which was widely held in the Obama administration, by no means qualifies him to run one of the largest, most complex and troubled cabinet agencies in the federal government. Indeed, the very affability of Dr. Jackson’s approach when it comes to his current presidential patient is perhaps his greatest disqualification, followed closely by his lack of relevant management experience and the apparent absence of a normal pre-nomination personnel vetting. Dr. Jackson’s January examination of President Trump, and subsequent news conference, give us great pause because they evinced a disturbing lack of independence — one of the most important qualities in a cabinet member. Dr. Jackson startled observers by not only finding the president healthy, but declaring he would remain so in the future. The doctor even looked into his crystal ball to predict good health for a second term, a pronouncement extending seven years into the future and so more fit for a fortuneteller than a scientist. [Get more of the biggest debates of the day right in your inbox by signing up for the Opinion newsletter.] Some expert observers also felt Dr. Jackson may have understated the president’s heart disease, and even fudged the president’s height (his driver’s license says 6 feet 2 inches; Dr. Jackson reported 6 feet 3 inches) because the lower number would have forced the doctor to admit his patient was obese. When asked why he had such glowing things to say about the president’s health when Mr. Trump gorges on McDonalds, guzzles diet Coke, and seldom exercises, Dr. Jackson said: “Some people have just great genes. I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old.” "
184,"UNITED NATIONS — Nuclear weapons? Famine? Civil war? Nope. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, on Thursday called climate change “the most systemic threat to humankind” and urged world leaders to curb their countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. He didn’t say much, though, about the one world leader who had pulled out of the landmark United Nations climate change agreement: President Trump. Instead, Mr. Guterres suggested that Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris accord nearly a year ago didn’t matter much. The American people, he said, were doing plenty. “Independently of the position of the administration, the U.S. might be able to meet the commitments made in Paris as a country,” the secretary general said. “And, as you know, all around the world, the role of governments is less and less relevant.” That may be overly optimistic. Sixteen American states and Puerto Rico have pledged to stick to the commitment that the United States made in the Paris agreement to reduce emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025. Those states are on track to keep their promise. But they represent less than a half of the country’s population, and the United States as a country will most likely fall short of its Paris pledge as Mr. Trump dismantles environmental regulations, according to a 2017 study by the Rhodium Group, a private economic research company. And a group led by Michael R. Bloomberg, the United Nations special envoy on climate change, and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, came to the same conclusion in a report that relied on the same data. "
185,"RICHFIELD, Ohio — President Trump heralded a new trade agreement with South Korea at his first public appearance in nearly a week on Thursday, but then immediately suggested that he might delay finalizing it while negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program. “I may hold it up until after a deal is made with North Korea,” Mr. Trump said, immediately after celebrating the new agreement. “Does everybody understand that? You know why, right? You know why? Because it’s a very strong card.” He added, “We’ll probably hold that deal up for a little while, see how it all plays out.” It was unclear what leverage Mr. Trump believed he could gain in the North Korea talks by delaying the deal with the South. The move could be an attempt by Mr. Trump to prod President Moon Jae-in of South Korea to hold a firm line with North Korea when talks begin over its nuclear program. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that South Korea and the United States had reached an agreement “in principle.” “The president, taking into account all relevant considerations — including negotiations with North Korea — will determine the best time to sign a finalized agreement on behalf of the United States,” he said. But Mr. Trump’s comments seemed to undercut a weeklong White House effort to promote the agreement. And they were in keeping with the at-times confusing tone of Mr. Trump’s speech at a muddy-floored training center for union workers here in this Cleveland suburb: His appearance was billed as an attempt to promote his infrastructure plan, but Mr. Trump addressed it only briefly near the end of his remarks, and said it was unlikely to pass soon. After a week marked by persistent scandals and high-profile staff departures, policy was not at the forefront of the president’s mind. Mr. Trump seemed intently focused on delivering his own progress report to supporters on a range of red-meat issues, including his zeal for improving border security, his promise to construct a border wall with Mexico, his administration’s efforts to roll back what he called “job killing” regulations and his thwarting of Democrats.

He also accused The Washington Post — which is owned by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon — of functioning as a “lobbyist” on behalf of the retailer. Here is our earlier fact-check on Mr. Trump’s assertions about Amazon, with some updates. President Trump assailed Amazon on Thursday, accusing the online retail giant of paying “little or no taxes to state & local governments,” while taking advantage of the United States Postal Service and “causing tremendous loss to the U.S.” "
188,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The clash between Russia and the West is intensifying. Russia will expel 150 diplomats, including 60 Americans, in retaliation for Western measures designed to punish Moscow for its alleged role in a nerve-agent attack on a former spy in Britain. Russia denies any involvement. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, above, summoned the American ambassador, Jon Huntsman, to his office to give him the news. The Americans were given until April 5 to leave the country. The daughter of the spy, who was also poisoned, is showing improvement as she recovers in a British hospital. ____ 2. The Trump administration is expected to launch an effort to weaken standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy for automobiles. That would be a major victory for car manufacturers, giving them ammunition to potentially roll back industry standards worldwide. "
189,"If you’re like us, your initial reaction upon hearing that President Trump had picked his personal physician to head the Department of Veterans Affairs was: “What? You mean the guy who looks like a retired Grateful Dead roadie and said ‘unequivocally’ that Mr. Trump would be ‘the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency’ ”? No, not him. The doctor with no managerial experience nominated to head the second-largest federal bureaucracy is Dr. Ronny Jackson, the lead White House physician since 2013 and a rear admiral, who said after an exam in January that Mr. Trump was in “excellent health,” despite being overweight and needing a higher dosage of cholesterol-lowering medication. Mr. Trump tends not to look very far when seeking to fill top government positions. He named his family event planner to head an important regional office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He floated the idea of putting his personal pilot in charge of the Federal Aviation Administration. What’s next, making his son-in-law Middle East peace envoy? But, anyway, it seems that as secretary of veterans affairs, Dr. Jackson would not be tending to Mr. Trump so much as to the right-wing billionaires Charles and David Koch and others who support privatization of veterans’ health care and other services. The man Dr. Jackson would replace as head of this long-troubled department, David Shulkin, whom Mr. Trump fired on Wednesday, was the highest-ranking holdover from the Obama administration and among the few Trump cabinet members with demonstrated ability at their jobs.

Bolton, President Trump’s incoming national security adviser, in an interview with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show” Wednesday night. It was a bit reminiscent of Carvey’s famous impression of the first  President George  Bush — but a few notches more ludicrous. Colbert asked “Bolton,” who is known for his far-right views and is said to act abusively toward co-workers, for reassurance that he was not gunning for pre-emptive war with North Korea or Iran. The interview began with Carvey’s character pleading innocence, but it didn’t take long to fly off the rails. By the end, his face was covered in an overgrown mustache, and he was attempting to breast-feed a golden retriever puppy. Here’s how it started. Midway through the interview, Colbert noticed something suspicious going on with his interviewee’s facial hair. "

192,"The Trump administration is expected to launch an effort in coming days to weaken greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards for automobiles, handing a victory to car manufacturers and giving them ammunition to potentially roll back industry standards worldwide. The move — which undercuts one of President Barack Obama’s signature efforts to fight climate change — would also propel the Trump administration toward a courtroom clash with California, which has vowed to stick with the stricter rules even if Washington rolls back federal standards. That fight could end up creating one set of rules for cars sold in California and the 12 states that follow its lead, and weaker rules for the rest of the states, in effect splitting the nation into two markets. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to frame the initiative as eliminating a regulatory burden on automakers that will result in more affordable trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles for buyers, according to people familiar with the plan. An E.P.A. spokeswoman confirmed that Mr. Pruitt had sent a draft of the 16-page plan to the White House for approval. The particulars of the plan are still being worked out. Those specifics, which are expected this year, could substantially roll back the Obama-era standards, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. “This is certainly a big deal,” said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard environmental economics program. “The result will be more gas-guzzling vehicles on the road, greater total gasoline consumption, and a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions.” "

Here’s what you need to know: • Russia hits back. The Kremlin announced that it would expel 150 Western diplomats and close the American consulate in St. Petersburg, as tit-for-tat retaliation continues over a nerve-agent attack on British soil that London and its allies have blamed on Moscow. Britain said it would review the cases of 700 wealthy Russians who were granted visas largely because they could invest millions of dollars. It also signaled an openness to blocking the Russian government from British financial markets. The moves came on a day of good news in the poisoning attack.

194,"Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host, apologized under pressure on Thursday for taunting a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., as at least eight companies confirmed they would pull advertising from her show. The dispute began Wednesday when Ms. Ingraham shared an article about the student, David Hogg, 17, getting rejected from colleges and accused him of whining about it. In response, Mr. Hogg, who has rapidly become a prominent advocate for gun-control policies, called on Ms. Ingraham’s advertisers to boycott her show. Eight of the companies, TripAdvisor, Wayfair, Hulu, Nutrish, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle, Atlantis Paradise Island and Stitch Fix, said they were removing their ads. A ninth, Expedia, said it had recently pulled its advertising but declined to say when. As news of the boycotts began coming out on Thursday, Ms. Ingraham apologized. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” she said, extending an invitation for Mr. Hogg to appear on the show. Mr. Hogg said he was unimpressed by the apology. “She only apologized after we went after her advertisers,” he said. “It kind of speaks for itself.” "

196,"To the Editor: Re “Cynthia Nixon and the Age of Inexperience” (column, March 25): Frank Bruni’s argument that our current “romance” with inexperienced political candidates degrades the importance of experience more generally reflects an erroneous view of politics in the United States. His essay is a response to Cynthia Nixon’s decision to run in the Democratic primary against Andrew Cuomo for governor of New York, but his point reflects a division between those who believe that political experience is required to govern well and those who do not. There is a long tradition in the United States of governance by people with nonpolitical experience. The reason is simple: In a representative democracy we, in some sense, govern ourselves. Politics is not a technical discipline for which esoteric knowledge is indispensable. My problem with Donald Trump, for example, has nothing to do with his political inexperience and everything to do with his moral and intellectual incompetence. Governing requires wisdom, not technical expertise. It truly is not brain science. JOHN DOUARD, BLOOMFIELD, N.J. To the Editor: Frank Bruni rightly points out the importance of experience in any profession, whether a plumber, doctor or, yes, even a politician, to do the job correctly. The clearest example of lack of experience is the debacle that is the Trump White House. Cynthia Nixon is a wonderful actress and clearly civic-minded. But rather than run for Congress, Ms. Nixon is shooting for the big kahuna — governorship of New York State. We simply don’t need another person learning on the job. Cynthia, please, stay in your lane. "

It should be criminal how our veterans have been treated over the years, by both political parties. Thank you for your service, and don’t let the door hit you on the way out. Dr. David Shulkin, the outgoing V.A. chief, betrayed his position when he spent over $120,000 of taxpayer money on a trip to Europe with his wife. Hardly the actions of a dedicated public servant. Unfortunately, I think the choice to replace him, Dr. Ronny Jackson, is a poor one for many reasons, but at the top of the list is his lack of experience running, well, anything. That, and the glowing physical report he gave Donald Trump — a poster boy for hardening of the arteries — make him suspect in this veteran’s eyes. LEN DISESA, DOYLESTOWN, PA. "
198,"MOSCOW — Russia on Thursday escalated a confrontation with Europe and the United States over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, saying it would expel 60 American diplomats and an unspecified number of envoys from other countries to retaliate for a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats working in the West and beyond that was ordered this week. Furious at what it described as an anti-Russian campaign orchestrated by Washington and London, the Kremlin exceeded an equivalent response to the United States and ordered the closing of the American Consulate in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city. The consulate is bigger and far more important to relations than the Russian Consulate in Seattle, which the Trump administration ordered closed on Monday as part of its expulsion decree. The crisis over the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter has driven tensions between the Kremlin and the West to their highest pitch in decades and forced European countries like Germany that are usually wary of clashing with Moscow to choose sides. Britain contends that the poison used was a signature Russian nerve agent created by Soviet-era scientists. Voicing alarm that the East-West confrontation was spinning out of control, the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, said that the crisis recalled the Cold War, only without the controls and channels of communication established before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union “to make sure things would not get out of control when tensions rise.” The intensifying crisis has also put new pressure on President Trump. He has been loath to criticize Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and, against the advice of his advisers, he avoided any mention of the March 4 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England, when he telephoned Mr. Putin to congratulate him on his lopsided victory in Russia’s March 18 election. Following his practice of avoiding public criticism of Russia, Mr. Trump made no mention of the expulsions during a speech on Thursday afternoon in Ohio. "

200,"Having more orders than you can fill is generally deemed a high-class problem. Despite demand for 400,000 of its Model 3, Tesla is proving otherwise, and that’s a problem for investors, not to mention the future of electric vehicles. The Trump administration is dialing back regulations that locked carmakers into improving average fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by 2025. The Environmental Protection Agency, under its administrator, Scott Pruitt, is also looking to review California’s authority to impose stricter pollution rules, a move that prompted a blistering response from the California Air Resources Board’s chairwoman, Mary Nichols. “This is not a technical assessment,” she said. “It is a move to demolish the nation’s clean-car program.” President Trump claims that companies overestimated demand for highly efficient cars such as fully electric vehicles — E.V.s. Yet consumers’ initial rush to own Tesla’s Model 3, with current pricing starting around $50,000, certainly belies that claim. What Tesla overestimated was the number of E.V.s it could produce. Tesla’s inability to ramp up production has created a cash crunch and a crisis of confidence for a company valued at $45 billion, or about as much as Ford Motor. Although valued similarly, there are vast differences between the companies. Ford sold 6.6 million vehicles last year, some 64 times Tesla’s sales of 103,000. Ford earned $7.6 billion, which the market found disappointing. Tesla lost $2.24 billion on sales of $3.3 billion, which the market shrugged off, at least until recently. That tells you how the stock market values the future of both companies and of E.V.s in particular. It’s not a belief that’s universally held. For at least a year, there has been open warfare between the Tesla believers and the Tesla skeptics and short sellers. The believers see the advance orders for the Model 3 as testimony to the company’s disruptive brilliance. The Tesla shorts — investors who bet against the stock — see the company as an automotive Ponzi scheme. To them, the founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, is beginning to look more like Tesla’s corporate eponym, Nikola Tesla, the brilliant but eccentric scientist who in 1888 created the alternating current electrical grid that powers the world today and who died penniless. "
201,"Rebecca Dallet, a Milwaukee County Circuit judge favored by liberals, was elected on Tuesday to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, The Associated Press reported, reducing the hold of conservative justices over the state’s highest court. Judge Dallet’s defeat of Michael Screnock, a Sauk County Circuit judge who had the backing of conservatives, was immediately being held up as a sign of Democratic enthusiasm ahead of the November elections, in a state that narrowly chose President Trump in 2016. The election was officially nonpartisan, and it involved candidates who were little known in Wisconsin until a few weeks ago. It was held during an off season for voting, on a day when snow and freezing rain were predicted in parts of the state. Still, the realities of this race fell firmly along partisan lines, as have many Wisconsin Supreme Court races in recent years. And it came at a moment when seemingly every contest across the country is being examined through the lens of the approaching midterm elections. A series of recent races in states like Pennsylvania, Alabama and Virginia has shown Democratic strength. The Wisconsin Supreme Court contest was the first chance in 2018 to take the temperature of voters across the state — a matter of intense interest to analysts, in part because Wisconsin’s choice of President Trump in 2016 marked the first time in 32 years that a Republican had carried the state in a presidential race. Wisconsin state politics had been shifting to the right; in 2010, Scott Walker, a Republican, won the governor’s office, and both chambers of the State Legislature flipped to red as well. Then in January, though, a Democrat won a special election for a State Senate seat that had been held by a Republican for 17 years, setting off a flurry of predictions. "
202,"WASHINGTON — Amazon, you’re not alone. President Trump once accused Verizon of making “a STUPID deal” for AOL. He ridiculed Coca-Cola as “garbage” — but said he would keep drinking it. He called both H&R Block and Nordstrom “terrible.” He said Sony had “really stupid leadership” and described executives at S&P Global, a financial firm, as “losers.” Before and after he became president, Mr. Trump attacked tech firms, military contractors, carmakers, cellphone companies, financial firms, drug companies, air-conditioner makers, sports leagues, Wall Street giants — and many, many media companies, which he has labeled “shameful,” “dishonest,” “true garbage,” “really dumb,” “phony,” “failing” and, broadly, “the enemy of the American people.” Lately, Mr. Trump’s antibusiness rants have become particularly menacing and caused the stocks of some companies to plunge. His Twitter posts have carried with them the threat, sometimes explicit, that he is prepared to use the power of the presidency to undermine the companies that anger him. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long a booster of Republican presidents, is not happy. “It’s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the chamber. Mr. Bradley, who did not specifically name Mr. Trump, added that criticism of companies from politicians “undermines economic growth and job creation.” Amazon’s stock price dropped sharply before rebounding this week after Mr. Trump threatened the company with possible antitrust action. The president’s remark in November that the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would not be “good for the country” roiled the continuing antitrust fight between the companies and the government. His earlier complaint on Twitter that Boeing’s $4 billion price for a new generation of Air Force One was “out of control” forced a fresh round of negotiations, although the price fell only to $3.9 billion. Most presidents have clashed with business interests and industries, sometimes in ways that generated headlines. But Mr. Trump is unique in singling out individual companies for ridicule with regularity. And rarely have presidents done so because of a personal pique or grudge, as happens with Mr. Trump. "
203,"SEATTLE — Five times in the last week, President Trump has pointed his Twitter arrows at Amazon over what he insists is a bad deal for the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday that the agreement, which sets what Amazon pays the Postal Service for many orders, costs American taxpayers billions of dollars. “I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,” he wrote. The details about the deal are not public — they are considered commercially sensitive information — but some of the available evidence suggests the opposite: that Amazon has been a boon to the Postal Service. The Postal Service has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships as more of its customers turn away from postcards and letters in favor of email, texting and other forms of digital communication. The total pieces of mail it shipped last year was 149 billion, down from 212 billion a decade earlier. Yet there is a bright spot — its business of package shipping, including Amazon orders, which grew to 5.7 billion packages last year from 3.3 billion in 2008. Several years ago, the Postal Service added Sunday delivery for Amazon packages. The agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion on $69.6 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and faces huge retirement benefit obligations. Without Amazon’s business, the financial picture at the Postal Service would most likely be bleaker, many analysts say. "

205,"There has been a lot of talk lately about Kim Jong-un’s willingness to discuss the “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula. It’s a cumbersome word and one that has given rise to more than a few misunderstandings. Many people, including President Trump, seem to hear “denuclearization” and imagine a promise by Mr. Kim to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, recently acquired at great cost. But the term means more than the North’s disarmament. It imposes obligations on the United States, too — even if Americans don’t want to hear that part. The word “denuclearization” is more or less native to the Korean Peninsula. This wasn’t the term experts used to talk about the elimination of nuclear weapons programs in South Africa, Iraq or Libya. In those contexts, the word was almost always “disarmament.” So why have diplomats this time chosen the far more complicated word “denuclearization”? Because the situation is, well, far more complicated. The term itself is a relic from the 1990s, the moment in which the ongoing crisis over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions began. At the end of the Cold War, the only nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula were American. The problem, from an American perspective, was that North Korea wanted to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities of its own. Ultimately, President George H.W. Bush’s administration chose to withdraw American nuclear weapons from South Korea as part of an effort to seek a diplomatic solution to the North’s nuclear ambitions. For a moment, it seemed like it would work: After the 1991 withdrawal of American nuclear weapons, South Korea and North Korea signed in 1992 a joint declaration on “the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” “Denuclearization” was conveniently abstract. That allowed it to capture different aspects of what James Baker, Mr. Bush’s secretary of state, called “the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula.” It covered at the same time the nuclear weapons that the United States withdrew from South Korea, the so-called “nuclear umbrella” of extended deterrence provided by the United States, and North Korea’s own nuclear weapons ambitions. It was a shapeless, ill-fitting word. But the alternatives — “disarmament” or “nonproliferation” — were just too narrow. Diplomats couldn’t squeeze everything that mattered into them. "
206,"With Democrats winning in normally deep red places like Alabama and Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District, it looks like a blue wave is swelling for the midterm elections. There’s still time for Republicans to change that, but first they must figure out how to mount an effective defense. To do that, they need to focus on a largely overlooked group of voters: Donald Trump voters who did not like him. According to the 2016 exit polls, 18 percent of Americans did not like either Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump owes his victory to the fact that he beat her among this group by a 17-point margin, 47 percent to 30 percent (the remainder voted for a third party or write-in candidate). Multiplying Mr. Trump’s percentage among this group by the group’s share of the electorate yields a startling fact: Nearly one-fifth of all Trump voters didn’t like him. This is a shockingly high share; it goes a long way toward explaining why places that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 could be voting against Republicans in 2018. The president’s job-approval rating remains historically weak, in the low 40s, only a few points higher than his humble favorability rating was on Election Day. Both exit polls in 2017 and analysis of recent generic congressional ballot polls — which indicate a Democratic lead — show that willingness to vote Republican or Democratic is highly correlated with one’s opinion of President Trump. That can mean only one of two things: Either people who voted for Mr. Trump without liking him are so discouraged they aren’t even answering polls (unlikely) or millions of Trump voters are intending to vote for Democrats in the fall. That probably shocks political pros from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Trump’s first year in office, while tumultuous, followed a predictable script. He signed the Republicans’ signature agenda item, a giant tax-cut bill. He pursued a traditional business-friendly Republican program for deregulation and promoted conservative priorities like stricter immigration policy. He appointed the conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, regularly attacked the news media and provoked liberals with culture-war tweets (like berating N.F.L. players for kneeling during the national anthem).

209,"Like all things in this Trump-deranged era, the remarkable ratings success of the rebooted “Roseanne,” a show that last aired when I was 17 years old but commanded a larger audience in its return than any sitcom now on network television, has unleashed a thousand takes about the show’s political significance. Who’s going to win “Roseanne” voters in 2018? Can Hollywood entertain Trump country without betraying its principles? Is the pro-Trump Roseanne Barr an oracle or a conspiracy theorist? Can a member of the #Resistance watch “Roseanne” in good conscience? All of these takes are, I’m sorry, tiresome. So let’s try to analyze the return of the Conner family in strictly cultural terms, without directly referencing the present occupant of the White House. The show’s sky-high ratings probably owe something to Roseanne’s political views and blue-collar goddess reputation, but above all they are a case study in the power the baby boom generation still wields, even as it begins to enter old age, over our collective cultural imagination. And not only that: They testify to the extent to which the boomers, for all the destruction trailing in their wake, might be the only thing holding American culture together at this point. That’s because if the boomers were destructive, they were also creative. Indeed, you can make a reasonable case that theirs was the last great burst of creativity in Western history, the last great surge of mass cultural invention. The boomers were the last generation to come of age with some traditional edifices still standing, the old bourgeois norms and Christian(ish) religion and patriotic history, which gave them something powerful to wrestle with, to rework and react against and attempt to overthrow. And because they came of age within a stable-seeming (though not for long) common culture, their revolution was experienced as a communal experience itself, something that united millions of people simply by virtue of their being young and Western in 1965 or 1969 or 1975. In an essay on “Golden Ages” in his “Prejudices: Philosophical Dictionary,” Robert Nisbet argued that a great period of ferment and achievement often features a “dialectical antinomy.” This is a fancy way of saying that you need ideas and trends and forces in tension with each other (community and individualism, the secular and the sacred, new ideas and settled consensus, younger and older generations) to ignite what he calls “the blaze of creativity.” We can debate just how golden their achievements really were, but in hindsight his description applies to the period of the boomer takeover — it was the tension between a multitudinous younger generation’s utopianism and libertinism and mysticism and an older generation’s attachment to patriotism and family and religion that shaped and stamped the rise of rock ’n’ roll, the rebel cinema of the 1970s, the New Age reinvention of religion, the New Journalism and the postmodern wave in the academy and the libertarian ascendancy in the G.O.P. and more.

Jimmy Kimmel was dumbfounded by the criticism, and Jimmy Fallon took the opportunity to poke fun at Trump. Dwayne Johnson sat down with Kimmel on Tuesday, 48 hours after April Fools’ Day, but he still found a way to play a prank on the host. He told Kimmel with seeming sincerity that his girlfriend had played an April Fools’ joke on him, pretending to go into labor and nearly letting him take her to the hospital before she revealed the joke.

211,"According to most estimates, there are more than 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the United States, and it seems as if you can find some version of beef and broccoli at almost all of them: velvety wok-fried meat in brown sauce, served in a forest of green. The dish has been part of the Chinese-American restaurant-food canon since at least the 1950s, a few decades after broccoli first rode to popular heights on the backs of the southern Italian immigrants who championed it on our shores. The dish is a standard at high-end restaurants and scruffy takeout shops alike, wherever there is a market for the sweet-salty-crisp flavors that Americans claim as a birthright. But it would be a trial to find such a dish in China. “It’s diaspora food,” said Jonathan Wu, who until it closed recently was the chef at the elegant dim-sum bar Nom Wah Tu on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, “a genre unto itself.” Wu, an American of Chinese descent, ate the dish a lot when he was growing up outside Hartford, a home-cooked variety in which his mom reversed the proportions to provide a lot more broccoli and rice than beef. The broccoli was his favorite part, he said, lightly tossed in a wok that never got very hot on her electric-coil stove, and mixed with a sauce she never thickened beyond its base of pungent oyster cut through with soy. “She kept it simple,” he said. “Streamlined.” That happens to be excellent advice for anyone who believes that home-cooked takeout-style beef and broccoli can trump the white-carton delivery variety. Inspired, I found myself cooking a version of Wu’s mother’s recipe for beef and broccoli not three hours after talking to him. On his advice, I trimmed chuck steak and cut it against the grain into strips, then stirred them into a marinade of rice wine, soy sauce and cornstarch. It clung to the beef, a kind of lustrous cloak. I cut broccoli into florets and planked the stems, just as his mother did, and made a sauce out of three others: Wu’s oyster and soy, and a little chile-garlic for zip. The result was a heady miracle for a family that somehow always believes that the food coming on the bicycle, being handed through the Plexiglas shield, served from the steam table in the corner of the airport will be excellent, though it never really is. The two little Michelin inspectors who eat my food every night gave it two stars. I thought: Two stars is great. [Pause] I was looking for three. In search of improvement, I considered the lead of the antic, puckish chef Danny Bowien, of Mission Chinese in New York and San Francisco, who put a recipe for beef and broccoli into his 2015 cookbook. He built the dish on a foundation of braised beef cheeks and Chinese broccoli adorned in smoked oyster sauce. But the beef cheeks alone took the better part of a day. The smoked oyster sauce was like building a rocket. I looked at the other end of the spectrum as well, at chain-restaurant copycat recipes, considering the shiny slurries of cornstarch, soy and mirin that are meant to evoke the sugary sauce on the beef and broccolis served at PF Chang’s and Panda Express. I don’t love the food at those restaurants. I hated the slurries. "
212,"SHANGHAI — China hit back at the United States on Wednesday with proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of American soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods, in a move likely to stoke fears that the countries’ escalating confrontation could become an all-out trade war. Moving with unusual speed, Chinese officials outlined plans to make it more costly to import 106 types of American goods into China. They are intended to hit the United States square in the farm belt — a major section of President Trump’s political support but also a major supplier of what China stocks in its supermarkets. Beijing’s plan to institute new tariffs was announced just hours after the Trump administration detailed its own protections on a similar value of Chinese-made aircraft parts, cars and car parts, televisions, steel and much more. Following a previous round of tit-for-tat tariffs unveiled over the past few days, the new measures have sparked concerns that the dispute could widen further, hurting jobs and growth in both countries. Investors drove financial markets lower over the prospect that the two sides were not yet done fighting. “China has never succumbed to external pressure,” Zhu Guangyao, vice minister of finance, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. He added, “External pressure will only make the Chinese people more focused on economic development.” The question now is whether the two sides will intensify their efforts to punish each other before they sit down to negotiate. Neither set of tariffs go into effect right away, though the exact timing of the Chinese measures was not clear. "

Separately, Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince said that Israelis “have the right to have their own land,” reflecting his view of Israel as an economic and strategic partner amid growing tensions with Iran, the kingdom’s main rival. _____ • “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military.” "
214,"In March, The New York Times, working with The Observer of London and The Guardian, obtained a cache of documents from inside Cambridge Analytica, the data firm principally owned by the right-wing donor Robert Mercer. The documents proved that the firm, where the former Trump aide Stephen K. Bannon was a board member, used data improperly obtained from Facebook to build voter profiles. The news put Cambridge under investigation and thrust Facebook into its biggest crisis ever. Here’s a guide to our coverage. The Times reported that in 2014 contractors and employees of Cambridge Analytica, eager to sell psychological profiles of American voters to political campaigns, acquired the private Facebook data of tens of millions of users — the largest known leak in Facebook history. There was more. Our article first showed how Cambridge received warnings from its own lawyer, Laurence Levy, as it employed European and Canadian citizens on campaigns, potentially violating American election law. The Times also found that tranches of raw data still existed beyond Facebook’s control. Read how researchers may have used your Facebook “likes” to predict your political views. In a companion piece, The Times reported that people at Cambridge Analytica and its British affiliate, the SCL Group, were in contact with executives from Lukoil, the Kremlin-linked oil giant, as Cambridge built its Facebook-derived profiles. Lukoil was interested in the ways data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature and said the oil giant never became a client. The articles drew an instant response in Washington, where lawmakers demanded that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, testify before Congress. Democrats looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election — already interested in Cambridge’s role in providing analytics to the Trump campaign — said they would seek an investigation into the leak. They were echoed by lawmakers in Britain investigating Cambridge Analytica’s role in disinformation and the country’s referendum to leave the European Union. "
215,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’re tracking the ethics issues surrounding the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency. And we’re thanking our newsletter subscribers — all 100,000 of them. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, made a big announcement this week: The E.P.A. will reconsider, and most likely roll back, Obama-era automobile standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency. The decision goes beyond what even the automakers had asked for, and sets up a showdown with California over air pollution rules. But headlines in recent days have focused on Mr. Pruitt himself as he faces a growing list of potential ethics scandals. It can be hard to follow every development, so let us catch you up on some of the biggest ones dogging Mr. Pruitt this week. On Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, was asked whether Mr. Trump was “O.K.” with Mr. Pruitt’s apartment arrangement. “The president’s not,” she said. “We’re reviewing the situation. When we have had a chance to have a deeper dive on it, we’ll let you know the outcomes of that, but we’re currently reviewing that here at the White House.” "
216,"HOUSTON — A cyberattack on a shared data network forced four of the nation’s natural-gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers over the last week. No gas service was interrupted, the companies said, and the interruption of customer transactions was merely a precaution. It was unclear whether any customer data was stolen. The attack highlighted the potential vulnerability of the nation’s energy system, cyberexperts say. Beyond consumer and business data — energy companies possess much proprietary information about their holdings, trading strategies and exploration and production technologies — the increasing dependence of pipeline infrastructure on digital systems makes them a particularly ripe target. Control valves, pressure monitors and other equipment connected to wireless networks are vital to daily functions of everything from refineries to oil wells. With nearly 2.5 million miles of oil, gas and chemical pipelines crisscrossing the country, intrusions into control systems could do more than disrupt deliveries, said Andrew R. Lee, a cybersecurity expert at the law firm Jones Walker in New Orleans. The risks include “explosions, spills, or fires, which easily will threaten human life, property and the environment,” he said. Nothing close to that kind of disaster happened this time. But the pipeline industry leaders Oneok; Energy Transfer Partners; Boardwalk Pipeline Partners; and Eastern Shore Natural Gas, a Chesapeake Utilities subsidiary, all reported communications system interruptions. The attack’s target appears to have been Latitude Technologies, a Texas-based provider of electronic data-sharing between pipeline companies and their gas producer and utility customers. The company handles the critical computer communications of gas storage facilities, as well as sales contracts and shipment scheduling. "
217,"Many people, including many Republican lawmakers, dismiss President Trump’s attacks on The Washington Post, CNN and other news organizations as just one of those crazy — but ultimately harmless — things he does to blow off steam. They’re wrong. Yes, Mr. Trump hasn’t been able to implement many of his worst proposals to undermine the press. Congress hasn’t tried to change the First Amendment or pass new libel laws, for example, and journalists — including at the “failing New York Times” — regularly unearth new scandals in the Trump administration. But the president’s rhetoric is clearly having an effect in the United States and especially around the world, where political leaders have seen it as a green light to crack down on the press. Malaysian lawmakers this week passed a law that would impose prison sentences of up to six years on people found to be spreading “fake news,” an ill-defined term that will put tremendous power in the hands of government officials to punish journalists and publishers. In India, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed revoking the accreditation of journalists who traffic in “fake news” before scrapping the idea after journalists denounced it. In recent days, Mr. Trump turned his guns on The Post, accusing it of trying to advance the business interests of its owner, Jeff Bezos, and the company he founded and runs, Amazon. Much has been made of the accusations the president has hurled at Amazon’s business practices, like its unwillingness for many years to collect state and local sales taxes. Some of these practices are indeed troubling. But don’t be distracted. Mr. Trump isn’t really distressed about the coffers of state and local governments, small retailers or whether the United States Postal Service suffers losses delivering Amazon packages. He is trying to undermine the credibility of The Post because it is holding his administration to account. Such attacks on the integrity of news organizations confuse the public about what’s true. Many Republican voters have long been skeptical of the mainstream news media, but their trust in it has fallen sharply since 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. And a study by two Yale professors found that Republicans were much more likely to trust hyperpartisan media outlets and news sites that peddle outright falsehoods than are Democrats. That phenomenon has undoubtedly been bolstered by Mr. Trump’s embrace of conspiracy theories and his endorsements of Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting, which has compelled news anchors at its local TV stations to read outrageous statements questioning the credibility of other news organizations. “Trump seems to be succeeding just through the force of his daily verbal assaults in shaking trust in the press and in other institutions that are crucial to our democracy,” says Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.

In the weeks following Britain’s vote in 2016 for “Brexit,” fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain’s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective. Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump’s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China’s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent. Investors may believe China’s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear. "
219,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. It looks a lot like a trade war. Hours after the White House outlined $50 billion in tariffs on largely high-tech Chinese products, China announced its own tariffs on $50 billion worth of American goods. China’s list focused on agricultural products that come from the Republican-dominated farm belt, where lawmakers might be expected to have some influence with President Trump. Above, harvesting soybeans in Illinois. Administration officials say they see no reason to panic, and markets rose after an erratic day. ____ 2. The White House said that the U.S. would remain in Syria to continue the fight against the Islamic State — just a day after President Trump said “it’s time” to bring the 2,000 U.S. troops there home.

220,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Farmers across California’s agriculture industry are worried over the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, with steep new tariffs specifically targeting some of the state’s most lucrative exports. The Chinese finance ministry announced over the weekend that it would impose tariffs on more than 100 American products, including many of California’s staples like wine and pistachios, in retaliation against tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum by President Trump. “We have heard a lot of concerns from our wine grape growers and our pistachio and almond growers. Those markets are definitely going to take the largest hit,” Sara Neagu-Reed, of the California Farm Bureau Federation, said. “Putting us in the middle of this issue is just not fair for our farmers.” That could mean trouble for the state’s farmers in the Central Valley and elsewhere. China is California’s third most valuable destination for agriculture products, according to the California Farm Bureau Federation, just behind the European Union and Canada. The state’s exports to China totaled more than $2 billion in 2016. Three products alone, all facing tariffs, accounted for most of those exports: $530 million in pistachios, $518 million in almonds and $161 million in wine. The tariffs add another layer of uncertainty for growers in California, and in particular those in the wine industry, which already faces growing production costs. The full impact of the tariffs is not yet clear, but experts are warning of significant decreases in exports of those products. Fluctuating prices in steel could also affect the price of farm equipment. "
221,"Stocks rose on Wednesday in a roller-coaster trading session during which investors were whipsawed by updates on an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished up 1.2 percent, an upbeat end to a session that started with a steep, nearly 1.5 percent decline driven by jitters of worsening trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Stocks reversed course after Larry Kudlow, President Trump’s newly installed director of the National Economic Council, sought to play down the risks of an outright trade war in late-morning comments to reporters. Washington and Beijing have announced a series of tariffs and counter-tariffs in recent days, with China saying on Wednesday that it planned to impose some $50 billion in import duties on soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods from the United States. The moves came in response to Mr. Trump’s recent decision to place tariffs on steel, aluminum, aircraft parts, flat-screen televisions and other products from China, which he has long accused of engaging in unfair trade practices. "
222,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has instructed his military commanders to quickly wrap up the American military operation in Syria so that he can bring troops home within a few months, senior administration officials said on Wednesday. He dropped his insistence on an immediate withdrawal, they said, after commanders told him they needed time to complete their mission. The president’s decision to keep the 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria for the immediate future came in a meeting of the National Security Council in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday, hours after Mr. Trump had told a roomful of reporters that “it’s time” to bring American forces home from a conflict that has been a crucial battlefield in the fight against the Islamic State. At the meeting, Mr. Trump’s top military advisers told him they had drawn up plans to pull American troops out of Syria immediately. But they also presented a plan for the forces to stay longer to clean out the residual pockets of Islamic State fighters and to train local forces to stabilize the liberated territory so that the group could not regain a foothold. “How long do you need to do that?” the frustrated president asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, according to an official present for the exchange. They responded that it was difficult to predict a precise timetable, but that it would not take years. As long as the operation lasted months rather than years, Mr. Trump replied, “I can support that.” After that, discussion in the Situation Room turned to issuing a statement that would reassure Syrian Arab allies that the United States would not cut and run, and would reinforce Mr. Trump’s message that Persian Gulf states needed to do more to contribute to the stabilization and reconstruction of liberated areas. "
223,"WASHINGTON — Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress’s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration’s efforts to re-examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. The report, issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported — including by black students in affluent schools. Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration’s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates. The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety. On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year — and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person. "
224,"EVELETH, Minn. — On northern Minnesota’s Iron Range, where evergreen trees stretch on for miles and snowpack lingers into the spring, a political shift is underway. Generations of residents have gone to work in the mines, endured cycles of booms and layoffs, and mostly voted for Democrats. But President Trump’s tariffs on imported steel are being celebrated as a boost to the local taconite mines, which supply American steel mills, and Republicans are hopeful that they can flip the area’s congressional seat in November. “President Trump is keeping his promises that he made on the campaign trail,” said Pete Stauber, a retired police officer and former professional hockey player who is running for Congress as a Republican. “He talked about leveling the playing field for the American worker. He did that with the tariffs.” Much has been said about groups who dislike the tariffs: a bipartisan mix of manufacturers, farmers and politicians who warn of trade disputes and unforeseen consequences. China’s announcement on Wednesday of proposed tariffs on a range of American exports — including soybeans, chemicals and cars — heightened concern that a trade war could be looming. But in a few places where Republicans see openings to win seats and upend a national political forecast that seems to favor Democrats in November, the 25 percent tariff on foreign steel and the 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum are viewed as economic lifelines straight from the Oval Office. "
225,"It looks a lot like a trade war. On Monday, China imposed tariffs on 128 American products imported into the country, including wine, pork and steel pipes. The next day, the Trump administration took a direct hit at China, announcing tariffs on about $50 billion worth of imports like flat-screen TVs, medical devices and aircraft parts. The day after that, China upped the ante. And on Thursday, President Trump said the United States should go further, suggesting additional tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese goods. With each move, the world’s two biggest economies have appeared more than willing to one-up the other to protect their interests, as the Trump administration tries to enact policies to help American workers and the Chinese government tries to become a global leader across a variety of cutting-edge industries. American companies have complained that they don’t have a level playing field with their Chinese counterparts. The Chinese government provides big subsidies for its homegrown players, as part of a broader state-led plan. The country has taken advantage of gaps in international rules or hasn’t bothered to follow them. "
226,"“Roseanne” mania has cooled slightly, but the ratings numbers for the show’s second night suggest that it is indeed a bona fide hit for ABC. The first two episodes of the revived sitcom, which aired back to back on March 27, scored huge ratings, surprising television executives and making the case that traditional networks are not about to cede their audiences to Netflix and other streaming services. In its return on Tuesday, the show notched 15.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen, a sturdy performance after last week’s blockbuster debut. The numbers were expected to increase once delayed viewing is factored in later this week. Including those viewers who watched the “Roseanne” premiere in the days after it aired, 25 million people saw it, according to Nielsen. That was the biggest audience for a sitcom in nearly four years. President Trump made a congratulatory phone call to Roseanne Barr, the show’s co-creator and a supporter of Mr. Trump, who was at the center of a national conversation in a way she had not been since “Roseanne” was an ABC stalwart from 1988 to 1997. Network executives moved quickly to renew the show for another season. In all, Tuesday’s figures were a 16 percent decline from the premiere. In the 18-to-49-year-old demographic vital to advertisers, “Roseanne” notched a 3.9 rating, a 25 percent decline. "
227,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — John Kasich had been here before. This much he pointed out, twice, before anyone had a chance to wonder why he was back. “Wow!” he called out, stepping into the Red Arrow Diner on Tuesday for an unannounced stop, emitting the kind of surprise that only a politician can summon over three dozen people eating lunch. “It was just this crowded the last time.” Mr. Kasich sidled up beside the counter, squatting to greet a young customer, Sophia Bauer, whose name he seemed to hear as “Sylvia.” “How old are you?” he asked. “Five? Are you going to be in first grade? Do you have a dog? Oh, really?” Soon, Sophia was being tickled by the two-term Republican governor of Ohio. He led her by the hand toward a booth in the corner, where a television camera was waiting. “Isn’t that cool?” he said. The two peered into the camera together. The governor smiled. Then Sophia was dismissed. “All right, Sylvia,” he said. “Go back to your mom.” It was time to talk to CNN again. It is both unclear what Mr. Kasich is doing here, in the first-in-the-nation primary state, and entirely clear what he is doing. He is not not running for president. "

PALOS VERDES ESTATES, CALIF. To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Perversion of Leadership,” by Frank Bruni (column, April 4): It is in his contempt for the very office he holds, his effort to make the presidency bend to him instead of giving it the respect it deserves and that we demand, that Donald Trump does the most damage. He luxuriates in his boorishness, somehow perceiving that changing what came before means repudiating every shred of decency, renouncing every ounce of compassion, rejecting every hint of morality. Even as we watched others in this office falter, we never sensed that the very essence of what made us a great country was under attack. We took comfort in the unshakable belief that our highest office was bigger than any one person, that its underlying principles were greater than the mistakes of omission or commission of any temporary holder, our structure stronger than any errors committed on one person’s watch. But that understanding has been shaken to the core. President Trump has made us question the fundamental belief of the greatness of the office of the presidency.

229,"THE MAKING OF A DREAM
How a Group of Young Undocumented Immigrants Helped Change What It Means to Be American
By Laura Wides-Muñoz
Illustrated. 361 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99. On Jan. 1, 2010, four student activists began a 1,500-mile walk from Miami to Washington, D.C. They wore white Nikes and, later, white T-shirts that said “Undocumented.” They chose the start of a new decade for their walk because it seemed auspicious. Exhausted by years of lobbying for immigration reform that never came to pass and a Dream Act that never materialized, the friends wanted to stage a protest. When they got to Washington, they hoped to persuade President Obama to address their predicament, one shared by hundreds of thousands of young people. That quandary, aptly summarized by the veteran journalist Laura Wides-Muñoz in “The Making of a Dream: How a Group of Young Undocumented Immigrants Helped Change What It Means to Be American,” was this: They were “kids raised in a country whose language and culture they identified with, whose Pledge of Allegiance they recited every morning in school — and yet a country that sought to render them akin to ghosts the moment they became adults, making it impossible for most to seek a college education, work legally or have any official say in the political system.” Consigning young immigrants to illegitimacy makes no sense, Wides-Muñoz points out, because taxpayers invest about $130,000 to educate a given student, and can only recoup that investment when students go on to work legally and pay taxes themselves. “The Making of a Dream” is a sweeping chronicle of the immigrant rights movement in which the four walkers took part. The teenagers profiled by Wides-Muñoz refused to accept their parents’ ghostlike status, and instead evolved into some of the most politically engaged student leaders in the nation. Wides-Muñoz casts their fight as the latest chapter in the civil rights movement; as they planned their march, the Latino students from Miami read Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail,” and selected a route that allowed them to visit important sites from the civil rights era. The young Dreamers wrestled with one question in particular: What should they ask of Barack Obama? Initially, the country’s first biracial president had signaled that he wanted to pass comprehensive reform, but then Wall Street melted down. After that, Obama became consumed by the raucous debate over health care. It had been thus for years. Early in George W. Bush’s presidency, the proposed legislation known as the Dream Act, which would have granted a path to citizenship to children who had been brought into the country without legal permission through no fault of their own, received promising support from key leaders like Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. But its first big hearing in Congress was slated for Sept. 12, 2001. After 9/11, the Dream Act sputtered, and Congress instead passed the Patriot Act, allocating more technology and personnel to domestic security, including surveillance along the borders. "
230,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will issue a proclamation on Wednesday directing the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to work with governors to deploy National Guard troops to the southwest border to assist the Border Patrol in combating illegal immigration. “It’s time to act,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, as she outlined the policy during a White House briefing. In recent days, and in anticipation of an annual increase in numbers of people who attempt to cross the border, the Trump administration has been ramping up plans to block migrants and asylum seekers, including young unaccompanied children, from entering the United States. The announcement came a day after Mr. Trump said he wanted to send the military to the southwest border to guard against growing threats from unchecked immigration, suggesting he might want to use active-duty armed forces to do what immigration authorities cannot. “We are going to be guarding our border with our military,” Mr. Trump had said on Tuesday during a meeting with Baltic heads of state. “That’s a big step.” By Tuesday evening, the White House said Mr. Trump had been referring to mobilizing the National Guard, a step that previous presidents have taken to support border enforcement. “We do hope the deployment begins immediately,” Ms. Nielsen said. “We’re working with all haste.” The active-duty military is generally barred by law from carrying out domestic law enforcement functions, such as apprehending people at the border. Even so, previous presidents have deployed National Guard troops to act in support roles on the border with Mexico. President Barack Obama sent 1,200 in 2010 and President George W. Bush dispatched 6,000 in 2006. Governors of border states have done the same when faced with large inflows from the south. "
231,"A group that is suing Harvard University is demanding that it publicly release admissions data on hundreds of thousands of applicants, saying the records show a pattern of discrimination against Asian-Americans going back decades. The group was able to view the documents through its lawsuit, which was filed in 2014 and challenges Harvard’s admissions policies. The plaintiffs said in a letter to the court last week that the documents were so compelling that there was no need for a trial, and that they would ask the judge to rule summarily in their favor based on the documents alone. The plaintiffs also say that the public — which provides more than half a billion dollars a year in federal funding to Harvard — has a right to see the evidence that the judge will consider in her decision. Harvard counters that the documents are tantamount to trade secrets, and that even in the unlikely event that the judge agrees to decide the case without a trial, she is likely to use only a fraction of the evidence in her decision. Only that portion, the university says, should be released. “This is an important and closely watched civil rights case,” William S. Consovoy, the lawyer for the group, Students for Fair Admissions, said in his letter to the court. “The public has a right to know exactly what is going on at Harvard. Even if this were a commercial issue — as Harvard would like to portray it — the public would have a right to know if the product is defective or if a fraud is being perpetrated.” At stake in the dispute is the secrecy of the university admissions process, especially at elite institutions like Harvard that are competing for a small pool of highly qualified students, and whether and how race and ethnicity play a role.

232,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Australia’s pokie problem, uproar in Big Tech and relaxed snow monkeys. Here’s what you need to know: • Anger that YouTube was blocking her videos may have motivated the woman who shot three people on Tuesday at the company’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., and then killed herself with the same handgun. Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s and living in California, was a social media star in Iran. Known there as “Green Nasim,” she posted music parodies and workouts, promoted vegan cooking and opposed animal cruelty. (We gathered some of her clips in this video, which our Tehran bureau chief narrates.) Some of her videos were apparently “demonetized” — deliberately starved of ads — by YouTube, which has been under pressure over offensive content. _____ • A rapidly escalating trade confrontation. Hours after the White House outlined $50 billion in tariffs on largely high-tech Chinese products, China struck back. "
233,"JANESVILLE, Wis. — When dozens of high school students from across Wisconsin marched through his hometown, chanting his name and demanding new gun control laws, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, was not around to hear them, having just wrapped up a trip to the Czech Republic. But Randy Bryce was. Mr. Bryce, for those who don’t watch MSNBC, is better known by his Twitter handle, “Iron Stache” — a nod to his occupation (ironworker) and his thick horseshoe mustache. A Democrat, he has become a liberal media darling of sorts, as he seeks to do the unthinkable: unseat Mr. Ryan in Wisconsin’s First Congressional District this fall. But Mr. Bryce is not the only candidate hoping to dethrone a congressional king. Another Democrat, a schoolteacher named Cathy Myers, is also running for her party’s nomination. She is irked that national Democrats and progressives — including Senator Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate — have thrown their weight behind Mr. Bryce. And on the right, Republicans are confronting an embarrassing spectacle: A white nationalist and anti-Semite, Paul Nehlen, who lost to Mr. Ryan by 68 points in the 2016 Republican primary, is running again, this time flaunting his bigotry to gain a national following. His Twitter account was suspended in February after he used it to make racist comments about Meghan Markle, the fiancée of Prince Harry. “It’s a circus,” sighed Mark Graul, a seasoned Republican strategist here. “You can’t make this stuff up.” Mr. Ryan, meanwhile, has been coy about his intentions. After passing a landmark tax overhaul that fulfilled a career-long dream, he has not yet announced his candidacy for re-election, saying he will make a decision after consulting with his wife in the spring. That has prompted speculation that he will retire, which his aides have dismissed as nonsense. "
234,"The gender pay gaps detailed by British companies in recent months surprised almost no one — men are paid more than women, often by a wide margin, at the vast majority of businesses. But by making companies publicly air their salary information, Britain intends to force a reckoning. Officials in London hope the embarrassing revelations in the reports, which had to be submitted by Wednesday, will shame companies into doing more to close the divide. The push is one of a growing number of efforts among countries to promote the principle of equal pay. Australia recently mandated gender pay gap reporting for most companies. In Germany, a new law will require businesses with more than 500 employees to reveal their pay gaps. Nordic countries like Iceland have been even more aggressive, by making companies prove they are paying male and female staff equally. Proponents of the British effort argue that the increased transparency will lead to smaller gaps. Research by the accounting firm PwC predicts that if nothing is done, it could take nearly a century for the divide to close entirely across the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of rich countries that includes Britain. “This is a game-changer,” said Andrew Bazeley, a policy manager at the Fawcett Society, a British organization that campaigns for women’s rights and equality. “It will force businesses to think about the gender pay gap in ways they might not have before.” Under the new reporting requirements, companies with 250 or more employees must publish salary differences between men and women every year. They are also required to provide details on gaps in average bonuses paid, and the proportion of men and women who received those bonuses. "
235,"WASHINGTON — White House officials moved quickly on Wednesday to calm fears of a potential trade war with China, saying the administration’s proposed tariffs were a “threat” that would ultimately help, not hurt, the United States economy, hours after China said it would punish American products with similar levies. The administration’s insistence that a trade war was not imminent came as the United States and China traded tit-for-tat penalties that caused wild swings in stock markets from Hong Kong to New York. Led by more audacious leaders than either country has had in decades, China and the United States are now locked in a perilous game of chicken, with the possibility to derail the global economic recovery, disrupt international supply chains and destabilize the huge yet debt-laden Chinese economy. White House officials reiterated on Wednesday that China must stop the “unfair” trading practices President Trump believes have disadvantaged American companies and workers, but they held out the possibility that tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods outlined on Tuesday might never go into effect. “There’s no trade war here,” Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s new top economic adviser, said in an interview on Fox Business Network. He described the threat of tariffs as “just the first proposal” in a process that would involve negotiations and back-channel talks. “I understand the stock market’s anxiety,” he said. “But on the other hand, don’t overreact.” Behind the scenes, however, top officials remained split over the administration’s approach as the United States and China move into a period of high-stakes negotiations. That includes how far to go in punishing China and the types of concessions the White House should accept to avoid a protracted and damaging trade war. People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit — the gap between what China ships to the United States and what America ships in the other direction. Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance, arguing that these changes would do little to address the mercantilist and protectionist trade policies China has adopted for decades. "
236,"As I write this, China’s announcement of a new round of tit-for-tat tariffs has stoked fears of trade war and sent stock futures plunging. If this morning’s futures hold, the S&P 500 will be about 10.5 percent off its January peak, around 6 percent off its level when Gary Cohn, the last of the Trump “globalists,” was pushed out. My question is, why such a large fall? One good answer is, that’s a stupid question. The three rules you need to bear in mind when discussing the stock market are (1) the stock market is not the economy (2) the stock market is not the economy (3) the stock market is not the economy. And stocks move for all sorts of reasons, or no visible reason at all. As Paul Samuelson famously quipped, the market has forecast nine of the last five recessions. Another answer is that the trade war is a signal: Trump, Navarro et al are showing that they really are as unhinged and irresponsible as they seem, and markets are taking notice. Imagine how these people would handle a financial crisis. Still, I think it’s worth noting that even if we are headed for a full-scale trade war, conventional estimates of the costs of such a war don’t come anywhere near to 10 percent of GDP, or even 6 percent. In fact, it’s one of the dirty little secrets of international economics that standard estimates of the cost of protectionism, while not trivial, aren’t usually earthshaking either. Yet there is a reason why stock prices might overshoot the overall economic costs of a trade war. For a trade war that “deglobalized” the U.S. economy would require a big reallocation of resources, including capital. Yet you go to trade war with the capital you have, not the capital you’re eventually going to want – and stocks are claims on the capital we have now, not the capital we’ll need if America goes all in on Trumponomics. Or to put it another way, a trade war would produce a lot of stranded assets. First, about the costs of trade war. This is the wonkish part, so feel free to skim and don’t worry if it seems incomprehensible, as long as you’re willing to accept the bottom line for the sake of argument. "

Decades later, the story of the civil rights movement can seem so tidy — so virtuous and inevitably victorious — that it loses some of its inspirational power. In its own day, though, the movement had much in common with today’s political struggles, over justice, democracy and equality: It involved more defeats than victories. It often felt contaminated by the grubbiness of partisan politics. And its leaders were human, which is to say that they were flawed and that they made many mistakes. Today, of course, is the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., killed in Memphis while he was supporting striking sanitation workers. King is now such a widely revered figure that many remembrances of him lack substance. But there are plenty of ways to celebrate what he actually stood for: not just moral clarity but also courage, toughness and resilience in the face of frequent setbacks and vicious criticism. You can read his final speech, delivered in Memphis the night before his death, or you can listen to it. Don’t settle for the usual quick outtakes. The famous lines — like “I’ve been to the mountaintop” — aren’t the only worthwhile ones. “Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination,” King said. “And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.” "
238,"Medicare officials have announced plans to crack down on prescriptions for opioids in an attempt to limit their use and thus their damage. But making it harder for people to get pain medication legally will most likely drive many to seek relief from far more dangerous and superpotent synthetic opioids. And they are surprisingly easy to obtain. Recently, out of curiosity, I typed into Google the terms “synthetic opioid and Chinese pharmacy.” Within minutes, I found a website where I could purchase the synthetic opioid carfentanil. For just $750, I could buy 100 grams of the drug, which would be shipped to me “overnight by discreet courier.” Carfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, another synthetic opioid that has already hit the streets, and 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. This drug is typically used to sedate large animals, like elephants. It is so dangerous that when veterinarians administer it, they wear gloves and face masks to avoid exposure. Fentanyl is scary enough. A dose of two milligrams — a few grains of the substance — can be fatal. But with carfentanil, 0.02 milligrams — hardly more than a speck of dust — could be enough to kill a person. That means that for $750, I could in theory purchase enough carfentanil for five million fatal overdoses. Americans are by far the largest consumers of the world’s natural and synthetic opioids, and 116 of us are dying every day as a result. Carfentanil could unleash a wave of mortality that would dwarf these numbers. "
239,"WASHINGTON — A witness who is cooperating in the special counsel investigation, George Nader, has connections to both the Persian Gulf states and Russia and may have information that links two important strands of the inquiry together, interviews and records show. Mr. Nader’s ties to the United Arab Emirates are well documented — he is an adviser to its leader — but the extent of his links to Russia had not been previously disclosed. Mr. Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman, has a catalog of international connections that paved the way for numerous meetings with White House officials that have drawn the attention of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. For example, Mr. Nader used his longstanding ties to Kirill Dmitriev, the manager of a state-run Russian investment fund, to help set up a meeting in the Seychelles between Mr. Dmitriev and a Trump adviser days before Donald J. Trump took office. Separately, investigators have asked witnesses about a meeting Mr. Nader attended in 2017 with a New York hedge fund manager, where he was joined by Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, who at the time were both senior advisers to Mr. Trump. The investigative trail even led Mr. Mueller’s team to stop an Australian entrepreneur with ties to the U.A.E. after he landed at a Washington-area airport, according to people briefed on the matter. The investigators questioned the entrepreneur about Mr. Nader, including Mr. Nader’s relationship with Russia and his contacts with Mr. Trump’s advisers, as well as the movement of money from the U.A.E. into the United States. Mr. Nader has received at least partial immunity for his cooperation, and it appears unlikely that Mr. Mueller is trying to build a case against him. Instead, it is common for prosecutors to interview as many people as possible to corroborate the testimony of a key witness like Mr. Nader. "

241,"MATÍAS ROMERO, Mexico — With a sarcastic half-smile, Nikolle Contreras, 27, surveyed her fellow members of the Central American caravan, which President Trump has called dangerous and has used as a justification to send troops to the border. More than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, waited patiently on Wednesday in the shade of trees and makeshift shelters in a rundown sports complex in this Mexican town, about 600 miles south of the border. They were tired, having slept and eaten poorly for more than a week. All were facing an uncertain future. “Imagine that!” said Ms. Contreras, a Honduran factory worker hoping to apply for asylum in the United States. “So many problems he has to solve and he gets involved with this caravan!” The migrants, most of them Hondurans, left the southern Mexican border city of Tapachula on March 25 and for days traveled north en masse — by foot, hitchhiking and on the tops of trains — as they fled violence and poverty in their homelands and sought a better life elsewhere. This sort of collective migration has become something of an annual event around Easter week, and a way for advocates to draw more attention to the plight of migrants. But this particular caravan caught the attention of Mr. Trump, apparently after he heard about it on Fox News. In a Twitter tirade that began Sunday, he conjured up hordes of dangerous migrants surging toward the border. He demanded that Mexican officials halt the group, suggesting that otherwise he would make them pay dearly in trade negotiations or aid cuts. "
242,"David D. Smith, the chairman of Sinclair Broadcast Group, says the media is getting his company all wrong. His remark, in a lengthy email exchange with The New York Times, came in response to renewed scrutiny of Sinclair after a video spread rapidly showing anchors at dozens of its stations across the country reciting the same speech about media bias. Mr. Smith defended the anchors’ segments, known as “must-runs,” and likened them to the late-night shows that networks air on their local affiliates. “Not that you would print it, but do you understand that every local TV station is required to ‘must run’ from its network their content, and they don’t own me,” he wrote on Tuesday. “That would be all their news programming and other shows such as late-night talk, which is just late-night political so-called comedy.” In the Sinclair-mandated segments, the anchors warned that some media outlets published fake stories. They also said they were “concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country.” “Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility,” the anchors added. “Now more than ever.” "

244,"In the escalating economic showdown between the United States and China, President Trump is trying to put American shoppers first. The administration did not place tariffs on necessities like shoes and clothes, and mostly spared smartphones from the 25 percent levy on Chinese goods announced this week. But by shielding consumers, Mr. Trump has put American manufacturers — a group he has championed — in the cross hairs of a potential global trade war. If the measures stand, along with China’s retaliatory tariffs, they could snuff out a manufacturing recovery just beginning to gain steam. “If you want to spare the consumer so you don’t get this massive backlash against your tariffs, then there goes manufacturing, because that’s what’s left,” said Monica de Bolle, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The irony is, you cannot spare manufacturing from anything because manufacturing is globally integrated. The sector sources its parts and components from all over the world.” That intricate supply chain often runs directly between the two countries, sometimes in both directions. Chinese factories make wing panels and doors for Boeing’s Next Generation 737 planes, which are assembled by union workers in Renton, Wash. General Motors makes its Buick Envision, a sport-utility vehicle, in Shandong Province, and sells it to American consumers. Construction workers in Denver use building materials manufactured in China, made in part from ethane gas produced in Texas. A central aim of Mr. Trump’s America First agenda is to bring back pieces of the supply chain lying outside the country. The tariffs announced this week are just a bargaining point in a broader negotiation between the United States and China over trade. “They are trying to force end-product manufacturers here to use more American content by making it more expensive for them to use Chinese content,” said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "
245,"President Trump escalated his verbal fusillade against immigrants this week by announcing a foolish plan to deploy troops along the Mexican border. Such a move has at best a tenuous basis in law and none in logic, and it will burn through federal funds better spent elsewhere. Mr. Trump has long stoked a xenophobic fear of newcomers among his political base. Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, he seems increasingly desperate to find ways to compensate for his failure to deliver on his promise to build a “big, beautiful” border wall on Mexico’s dime. On Sunday, Mr. Trump began a new round of confusing tweets and specious claims about undocumented immigrants. The president tweeted about “the big caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our ‘Weak Laws’ Border,” suggesting Central American hordes were converging upon the United States to take advantage of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. “Must pass tough laws and build the WALL,” another tweet read. “Democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime!” On Tuesday, he went further, declaring an urgent need for military forces on the border to confront this growing threat. He was expected to issue the order on Wednesday. It is a president’s duty to defend the country, and putting troops on the border is not unprecedented. Yet Mr. Trump’s move is not rooted in the reality of immigration in recent years. The number of people apprehended at the border plummeted from more than 1.6 million in 2000 to 310,000 last year, the lowest level since 1971. The main causes are slowed population growth, improved economic opportunities in Mexico and stronger American border security, the result of investment in thousands of guards, physical barriers and technology. "
246,"WASHINGTON — Whether it is the Paris climate accord or the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has moved methodically to dismantle the foreign policy legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama. Except for Syria, on which Mr. Trump has faithfully echoed Mr. Obama’s hands-off policy. Mr. Trump’s statement on Tuesday — that “I want to bring our troops back home; I want to start rebuilding our nation” — underscored again how similarly he and Mr. Obama view the United States’ role in the overlapping conflicts in Syria. Both men have doubted the wisdom of a long-term American military commitment in the country. Both have complained that Saudi Arabia expects the United States to bear the burden of a costly war against President Bashar al-Assad. Both have viewed Syria primarily through the prism of combating the Islamic State. Though Mr. Trump’s aides made much of his order to fire Tomahawk missiles at Mr. Assad’s airfields last spring — an order that Mr. Obama famously refused to give four years earlier — it was the exception that proved the rule. Mr. Trump, a former senior adviser said, does not believe that Syria’s civil war is a vital national security interest of the United States. Neither did Mr. Obama, which is why he initially rebuffed proposals to funnel weapons to the rebels in Syria or to impose a no-fly zone over parts of the country. “Both men retreat from the idea of getting deeply involved in other countries’ civil wars,” said Robert S. Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria. “Both of them are instinctively more concerned about the American economy and things at home, even if they have very different visions of America.” "

248,"Last May, the private equity firm Blackstone announced that it was creating a $40 billion fund that would invest in infrastructure projects in the United States. The fund’s largest backer was the government of Saudi Arabia, which agreed to kick in half the cash. Ten months later, the highly anticipated fund has yet to complete an initial round of fund-raising, much less start investing in infrastructure. Although the Saudis promised to contribute up to $20 billion, Blackstone is required to raise a dollar from other investors for every dollar the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund puts in. So far, only two other investors have publicly committed to the fund, with their contributions totaling $575 million, according to data provider Preqin, which tracks such investments. In the short term, Blackstone’s goal now is to raise a total of $15 billion — much less than it trumpeted during President Trump’s visit to Riyadh last spring — according to a document posted on the website of a Pennsylvania pension plan that has agreed to invest in the fund. Facing hesitant investors, Blackstone has twice missed its own deadlines for completing the first round of fund-raising, according to people briefed on the plans and a timetable included in the Pennsylvania pension plan’s documents. Among the factors that have complicated the fund’s launch: Saudi officials told Blackstone last year that they wanted to create an investment committee — including one or more Saudi representatives — that would oversee the fund, according to four people briefed on the talks who weren’t authorized to discuss them publicly. "
249,"WASHINGTON — It was the kind of story destined to take a dark turn through the conservative news media and grab President Trump’s attention: A vast horde of migrants was making its way through Mexico toward the United States, and no one was stopping them. “Mysterious group deploys ‘caravan’ of illegal aliens headed for U.S. border,” warned Frontpage Mag, a site run by David Horowitz, a conservative commentator. The Gateway Pundit, a website that was most recently in the news for spreading conspiracies about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., suggested the real reason the migrants were trying to enter the United States was to collect social welfare benefits. And as the president often does when immigration is at issue, he saw a reason for Americans to be afraid. “Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming,” a Twitter post from Mr. Trump read. The story of “the caravan” followed an arc similar to many events — whether real, embellished or entirely imagined — involving refugees and migrants that have roused intense suspicion and outrage on the right. The coverage tends to play on the fears that hiding among mass groups of immigrants are many criminals, vectors of disease and agents of terror. And often the president, who announced his candidacy by blaming Mexico for sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States, acts as an accelerant to the hysteria. The sensationalization of this story and others like it seems to serve a common purpose for Mr. Trump and other immigration hard-liners: to highlight the twin dangers of freely roving migrants — especially those from Muslim countries — and lax immigration laws that grant them easy entry into Western nations. "
250,"WASHINGTON — Facebook on Wednesday said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election — a figure far higher than the estimate of 50 million that had been widely cited since the leak was reported last month. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules. The European rules, which go into effect next month, give people more control over how companies use their digital data. Facebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, the firm connected to the Trump campaign. It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russian-backed actors to influence the 2016 presidential election. Among Facebook’s acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed “most” of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested. The new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks — including a rare question-and-answer session with Mr. Zuckerberg and reporters — came just before Mr. Zuckerberg’s expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill, where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users. Sheryl Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg’s top deputy, has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week. The company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook in Washington, said the 87 million figure was an estimate of the total number of users whose data could have been acquired by Cambridge Analytica. He said that the estimate was calculated by adding up all the friends of the people who had logged into the Facebook app from which Cambridge Analytica collected profile data. “We wanted to put out the maximum number of people who could have been affected,” Mr. Zuckerberg told reporters. It remains unclear exactly how many users had their personal information accessed by Cambridge Analytica. The firm said Wednesday that it had licensed data for no more than 30 million users of the social network. Facebook also released a lengthy document describing how it would protect personal data in the future. In that document, Facebook said its search and account recovery systems had been open to abuse by anyone who already had some information about an individual, such as a phone number or email address. The vulnerability extended to much of the platform’s user base before it was closed on Wednesday, Facebook said. The company also said it would limit the types of data that can be harvested by software used by outside businesses. The changes mean that users will have to give permission before an app can collect information beyond their names and addresses. The company also said it would no longer allow outsiders to use apps to gather information about the religious or political views of its users. And it will stop using third-party data from companies such as Experian and Acxiom to help supplement its own data for ad targeting. “It’s clear now that we didn’t focus enough on preventing abuse,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “We didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is. That was a huge mistake, and it was my mistake.” The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement meant to protect users’ privacy. User data is crucial to the company’s business, because it is used to deliver advertising to users. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify about the company’s handling of sensitive user data before the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. “This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues,” said Representatives Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, and Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, of the House committee. Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, “With all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms, users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured.” Facebook’s problems stretch back before the reports about Cambridge Analytica, to earlier investigations into how Russian actors infiltrated the platform by placing ads and posts to influence the 2016 election. Mr. Zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea of foreign interference on Facebook as a “crazy idea.” Since then, the company has been the focus of investigations by law enforcement and congressional committees that are delving into the Russian influence campaign. Facebook now acknowledges that its platform was used to sway voters. All those troubles have prompted investors to flee the company, and its stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks. In response, the company has put its executives front and center. Mr. Zuckerberg typically talks to groups of reporters only after the company releases its quarterly financial reports. But after not responding in public for several days following the Cambridge Analytica disclosure, he has given a series of interviews. And Ms. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer and the second most recognizable face at the company, is set to be interviewed this week by Fox News, “PBS NewsHour,” NBC’s “Today” show and Bloomberg. Ms. Sandberg will be interviewed remotely from California. Facebook said its new openness was meant to show that it takes the intense criticism over its handling of user data seriously. In Washington, Facebook employees and public relations firms retained by the company have talked to regulators and congressional staff members about new privacy measures, including updates to policies that are intended to make them easier to understand. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg provided a preview of what he will tell Congress next week. He said Facebook was “an idealistic and optimistic company.” But he acknowledged that the company had committed serious errors by not ensuring that robust safeguards were in place for users. Asked if he should still be leading the company, he said, “Yes. Life is about learning from the mistakes and learning what you need to go forward.” Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, said that Mr. Zuckerberg has a big task ahead of him in Washington. “I think it is important for Zuckerberg to clearly explain how Facebook plans to earn back consumer trust,” Ms. McSweeny said. “Consumers need reassurance that their data are not being misused.” "
251,"Settlement agreements between Bill O’Reilly and two of his accusers — made public for the first time on Wednesday — filled in previously unknown details about tactics employed by the former Fox News host to silence women who came forward with sexual harassment allegations against him. The documents show that two women who reached settlements, Andrea Mackris and Rebecca Gomez Diamond, were required to turn over all evidence, including audio recordings and diaries, to Mr. O’Reilly. In addition, Ms. Mackris was required to disclaim the materials “as counterfeit and forgeries” if they ever became public. The settlement with Ms. Mackris confirms a New York Times investigation that found a private investigator had been used to dig up information about her, with the agreement calling for the destruction of materials collected about her by Fox News’ private investigators, including Bo Dietl. The document also shows how her lawyers agreed to switch sides in the midst of the fight. Strict confidentiality was the goal of the settlements. If the women were found to breach the agreements, they would be forced to return all the money they had received, forfeit any future payments and pay Mr. O’Reilly’s legal fees. The settlement agreements were made public on Wednesday as part of the ongoing defamation lawsuit against Mr. O’Reilly and Fox News filed in December in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Ms. Mackris, Ms. Diamond and Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, who reached harassment settlements involving Mr. O’Reilly. There are six publicly known settlements involving Mr. O’Reilly, five for sexual harassment and one for verbal abuse, that total about $45 million. "
252,"Good Thursday.

Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. On Wall Street, there’s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year’s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself “barely a Democrat,” says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon’s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment. Mr. Dimon’s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump’s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: “It is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,” and that “one of the administration’s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.” However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should “revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.” On immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, “American citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.” He also said, “People immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.” At the same time, he also advocated for “a path to legal status and citizenship” for “Dreamers” and improving “merit-based immigration” programs so that immigrants educated here can stay. Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other. "
253,"MATÍAS ROMERO, Mexico — The caravan of Central American migrants that President Trump has portrayed as an emblem of flawed immigration policy in the United States began to splinter on Thursday, as hundreds of people departed this rural town aboard buses and on foot, abandoning the decrepit municipal sports complex where their journey had stalled for five nights. But the movement’s organizers insisted that the caravan would regroup in the Mexican city of Puebla in the next few days before continuing on to Mexico City, where it would officially end after meetings with government officials and possibly a street protest. Mr. Trump has been fixated on the caravan this week, making it a recurring motif in his tweets, warning that it represented a grave threat to the sovereignty of the United States, and using it as a justification for sending the military to reinforce the southwest border. On Thursday morning, he returned to the subject, declaring that the caravan had mostly dissipated, even though organizers estimated at the time that there were still some 800 migrants gathered at the sports complex. “The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border,” the president wrote on Twitter.

256,"Officials from the Trump administration and the State of California, who have been negotiating behind the scenes on car emissions standards, are expected to reopen talks that could preserve rules targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency for elimination, according to people briefed on the talks. Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, announced this week that his agency would start the process of rolling back the federal standards, which are aimed at cutting tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming. He also demanded that California, which has vowed to stick to its own stricter standards, fall in line and follow Washington’s lead. That announcement raised the specter of a messy legal battle between the Trump administration and California, which has the legal authority to write its own air pollution rules and has threatened to sue to protect that authority. Though California’s authority is considered to be on solid legal footing, a protracted legal fight would raise the prospect of uncertainty and a domestic auto market split between the states that follow stricter emissions rules — California and 12 other coastal states that adhere to its standards — and the ones that would allow for dirtier cars. Officials and former officials with direct knowledge of the talks declined to be identified for this article, citing the sensitivity of ongoing negotiations. An E.P.A. spokeswoman, Liz Bowman, confirmed that the agency had “an ongoing dialogue with California” on emissions standards but declined to discuss details. Stanley Young, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, the state’s clean air regulator, declined to disclose the state of negotiations. But privately, officials from the Trump administration and California, along with representatives of major automakers, are searching for a compromise that could save a uniform set of standards for the entire country, according to a half-dozen people briefed on recent communications among the parties. One person close to the Trump administration said he considered communications with California as “active and ongoing.” "
257,"We now have a president whose actions are governed by emotions: envy, vanity, guilt, hatred and, chief among them, fear. Donald Trump seems to have become shaken by fear that his base might abandon him because of his inability to deliver on his signature promises, like the construction of a border wall between this country and Mexico. (Completely gone is the suggestion that Mexico would pay for this ridiculous boondoggle.) So he has been on a tear, resurrecting the even more nationalist, isolationist Trump of the campaign. He has pushed us to the teetering verge of a trade war, has suggested that we hasten withdrawal from Syria, has recommended that we send “the military” to the southern border and railed against caravans of brown people heading our way. To a large degree, he appears to be making policy from the podium, responding to the propaganda organ Fox News and bouncing ideas off a small circle of loyalists. His cabinet and the White House are left to respond to what Trump says on the fly and develop that into a quasi-coherent policy. This is no way to run a country, unless your intention is to run it into the ground. This is now the American quandary: The wheels of government are being forced to turn on the erratic whims of an egomaniac. "
258,"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, transformed this week what has appeared to be a weakness — his relative lack of independence — into a strength. Since he was appointed in May by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the scope of Mr. Mueller’s power has been intensely debated. President Trump’s allies have portrayed the special counsel as running amok as his focus expanded to the business dealings of Mr. Trump’s associates. The president’s critics have worried that Mr. Mueller is too vulnerable to potential Trump administration interference. The tension is familiar when the president comes under scrutiny by law enforcement, as the vast powers of the executive branch are at stake. Similar tensions cropped up during the Watergate, Iran-contra, Whitewater and Valerie Plame leak investigations. Now they have spurred the first significant legal fight arising from Mr. Mueller’s work, as Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, battles charges related to payments he received from a pro-Russia government in Ukraine. “Manafort’s fight over Mueller’s authority goes to a central question in our republic, going all the way back to Plato’s question, ‘Who guards the guardians?’” said Neal Katyal, a former Justice Department official who drafted its special counsel regulations in 1999. “The central debate is how much independence do you want, versus how much accountability for the prosecution. There needs to be a balance between these two competing goals.” Last month, Mr. Manafort asked Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss his indictment. Portraying Mr. Mueller as out of control, Mr. Manafort’s defense lawyers contended that criminal allegations arising from their client’s Ukraine dealings either exceeded the limits of the special counsel’s assigned jurisdiction or that Mr. Rosenstein had improperly given Mr. Mueller a “blank check” to prosecute anything. Mr. Manafort has also filed a  lawsuit making similar arguments. Mr. Mueller’s original assignment from Mr. Rosenstein was to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any links to Trump campaign officials, with the ambiguous addition of “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” "
259,"WASHINGTON — The United States military is spending about $1 million to help detain thousands of Islamic State fighters and their family members in makeshift camps run by Kurdish militias in northern Syria, pulling the Pentagon deeper into the war zone detention operations it has sought to avoid. The dilemma is unfolding even as President Trump has pledged to withdraw the 2,000 remaining United States troops in Syria, many of whom are vetting the most dangerous detainees, and suspend more than $200 million in State Department recovery funds for the country. Defense Department and Kurdish officials said several thousand detainees — including at least 400 fighters from more than three dozen countries and their families, as well as other Syrian militants — were being held in several camps. The American funding is paying to erect fencing, put bars on windows and otherwise secure schools and other buildings being used as temporary jails for fighters who were captured or surrendered after last year’s collapse of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital. Military officials insist American personnel are not strengthening the buildings or guarding the detainees themselves, just paying for it. Critics fear the facilities could become breeding grounds for extremists and repeat a key security miscue of the Iraq war. But without the American assistance, the camps lack sufficient security to prevent jailbreaks of battle-hardened militants who could reinvigorate pockets of Islamic State fighters near Abu Kamal, a town in eastern Syria along the Iraqi border. Syrian Kurdish officials said the camps were straining their capacity to oversee the dangerous fighters and rapidly depleting their budgets to pay for operations at the half-dozen sites in and around Raqqa. One senior American official said as many as 50 to 60 fighters were detained in a single room. "
260,"H. Fred Walker stood before his Edinboro University community on a recent snowy day and issued a warning. “We have been very insular in that we have not looked beyond the boundaries of Edinboro,” the college president told a group of staff and students who had gathered at a meeting in this town tucked away in Northwestern Pennsylvania to hear the details of the college’s strategic plan. “When we’re judged against our peers, it’s a punch in the eye for us.” While it was difficult for many in the room to hear, it was a reality years in the making for Edinboro, a four-year public university with an enrollment of about 6,000 students that is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. In the last decade, enrollment has plummeted, faculty salaries have caused expenses to skyrocket and completion rates have dissipated. No longer is the school’s most promising pipeline the average teenager going to college for the first time, but more likely the adult who may need to go back for a second or third. After 160 years as an anchor of rural Pennsylvania, the university is becoming obsolete. “There’s a reckoning that has to come,” Mr. Walker said in an interview in early March. For Mr. Walker, the reckoning came just a few weeks later. He resigned on March 27 after he enraged faculty and students with comments he made about his reform tactics to the The Chronicle of Higher Education. "
261,"If you’ve been watching stock markets, you’re probably feeling seasick. The Dow is crashing! No, it’s bouncing back! Wait, it’s crashing again! In general, trying to explain stock fluctuations is a mug’s game. But in this case it’s pretty clear what’s going on. Whenever investors suspect that Donald Trump will really go through with his threats of big tariff increases, provoking retaliation abroad, stocks plunge. Every time they decide it’s just theater, stocks recover. Markets really, really don’t like the idea of a trade war. So is a trade war coming? Nobody knows — even, or perhaps especially, Trump himself. For while trade is one of Trump’s two signature issues — animus toward dark-skinned people being the other — when it comes to making actual demands on other countries, the tweeter in chief and his aides either don’t know what they want or they want things that our trading partners can’t deliver. Not won’t — can’t. As a result, incoherence rules: The administration lashes out, then tries to calm markets by saying that it might not carry through on its threats, then makes a new round of threats. Let’s talk in particular about the will-he-or-won’t-he confrontation with China. In some ways, China really is a bad actor in the global economy. In particular, it has pretty much thumbed its nose at international rules on intellectual property rights, grabbing foreign technology without proper payment. And to be fair, Trump officials do sometimes raise the intellectual property issue as a justification for getting tough. But if getting China to pay what it owes for technology were the goal, you’d expect the U.S. both to make specific demands on that front and to adopt a strategy aimed at inducing China to meet those demands. "
262,"L
isa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska, is not known for her fiery speeches or public charisma; in interviews, she is sometimes so cautious that you can almost hear the strain of her self-editing. Murkowski is, however, exceptionally comfortable in one-on-one informal encounters, where she is skilled in the art of the folksy, quick connection. On Saturdays, she and her husband, Verne Martell, a well-liked former small-business owner, occasionally hit their local Anchorage Costco, which entails hours of active listening to constituents in the toilet-paper aisle (“Verne wants to slit his wrists,” reports Murkowski’s cousin Anne Gore). She spends less time than most senators sequestered in a private car, because 80 percent of her state can be reached only by flight. And because Murkowski never takes her upgrades on flights to and from Alaska (the optics of traveling in first class are terrible), she is forever mixing and mingling with her constituents on planes, not infrequently while in line for the bathroom. Murkowski was in just such a line, on a flight out of Wrangell, Alaska, on July 5, when one of her constituents, a 39-year-old financial adviser, looked up from her seat and recognized her. “Hi, Lisa,” she said. “I’m Kerri Willoughby. Do you remember me?” Murkowski said she did and greeted her warmly by name — “like a friend,” Willoughby said. Willoughby is a member of a group of liberal, activist women from Juneau who call themselves the ReSisters. In March 2017, the group published an open letter to Murkowski in The Alaska Dispatch News, laying at her feet their concerns about President Trump. The letter said they hoped the senator, “as a strong female leader,” would have their backs on reproductive choice, affordable health care and defending “the foundations of our democracy.” A few months later, Murkowski — who is more popular with women than men and is strong with moderates generally — met with the group to hear them out. By the time Willoughby and the senator crossed paths on the plane, several weeks after their first encounter, the vote on the new health care bill was imminent. The Republican Party had staked its reputation on its promise to roll back the Affordable Care Act and could afford to lose the votes of only two of the 52 Republican senators. (Vice President Mike Pence would provide the deciding vote in the case of a tie.) Senator Susan Collins of Maine had made it clear that she was a no; John McCain, Rand Paul and Murkowski had expressed reservations but not yet declared their decisions. On the plane, Willoughby took the opportunity to ask Murkowski what everyone wanted to know: “Have you decided which way you are going to vote on the health care bill?” Murkowski told Willoughby that the last bill she saw was “unpassable,” adding, “We have to get this right.” Willoughby left the flight feeling hopeful that Murkowski would not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Three weeks later, Murkowski did, in fact, cast one of the three decisive votes that killed the bill. One of Willoughby’s fellow ReSisters, Julie Nielsen, a fisheries biologist with a side passion for health care reform, was so happy that she put a bright pink sign in the window of her office overlooking one of the main shopping streets in Juneau. “Thank you Lisa!!” read the sign. In the middle of the “O” in “you,” she had drawn a big heart. "
263,"Until Thursday afternoon, there had been a reassuring sense of restrained, tit-for-tat reciprocity in the trade skirmish between the United States and China. But if this spirals into a bigger conflict between the world’s two biggest economies — something that seemed to become more likely Thursday evening with President Trump’s threat to add $100 billion more in tariffs — it’s worth keeping something in mind: In a trade war, the usual rules of commerce may not apply. That is doubly true in a potential trade war with China, for several reasons. Because the country exports far more in goods to the United States than it imports, China simply doesn’t have as much room to keep up with escalating American tariffs, especially given the Chinese government’s desire to cushion its citizens from higher prices for food staples. Moreover, China has in the past proved willing to use a wide range of government powers to achieve commercial objectives — from campaigns against out-of-favor companies in state media to selective, stepped-up regulatory enforcement. And if things really get nasty, the United States and China are financially intertwined in ways that China could seek to exploit — though not without creating risks for a country holding $1.2 trillion in United States Treasury bonds. “One of the very important tools that the Chinese have is the ability to make life difficult for a large number of American businesses,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who studies Chinese economic relations. “They have all of these unconventional weapons that are not covered by traditional trading rules that could be potent weapons in actually fighting a trade war.” The details of what China might do are speculative. Thus far, China’s government has reacted to new tariff actions by the Trump administration with relatively restrained words and promises of proportional responses to the American government’s actions.

264,"LONDON — Nicole Grobert is German, but she has spent almost all of her career in Britain, developing tiny nanomaterials and figuring out how to use them in everything from artificial bones to super-efficient batteries. Young scientists have an unusual degree of autonomy here, she has found, and European Union funds enabled her to build her own research group at the University of Oxford. These days, though, Dr. Grobert says her future at Oxford looks cloudier than it used to. Since Britain voted to quit the union, she has been getting calls from universities on the Continent, and farther abroad, gauging her interest in a new job. For now, she is staying put, but if grants grow scarce or immigration rules create new hassles, she is ready to move. “I came with a suitcase,” Dr. Grobert said. “I can grab that suitcase and go.” For decades, the European Union has provided a collaborative, cross-border framework in which British universities have grown and thrived. European grants fund research like Dr. Grobert’s and nurture the international back-and-forth crucial to scholarly work in disciplines from archaeology to economics. Free movement within the bloc has meant faculty from other European nations can live and work in Britain visa-free, and students from elsewhere in the union pay the same tuition as Britons. Now, university administrators are watching anxiously as negotiations between London and Brussels lurch along, with little clarity about how drastically ties may change after the divorce, known as Brexit, which is expected next March. Last month, negotiators announced a 21-month transition period, which may postpone the biggest shifts, but like everything about Brexit, it remains subject to change. “This is the single biggest challenge to our universities, in the same way it is the single biggest challenge to our nation, since the Second World War,” said Alastair Buchan, Oxford’s head of Brexit strategy.

Here’s the latest: • The ISIS files. On five trips to battle-scarred Iraq, New York Times journalists scoured old Islamic State offices in 11 cities and towns, gathering thousands of documents abandoned by the militants as their “caliphate” crumbled. Following a paper trail that led through booby-trapped streets near the front lines of battle, they found suicide bomber forms, birth certificates, tax records, school books teaching English words like “gun” and “martyr,” and papers from the Ministry of War Spoils. (Here’s a closer look at the documents.) The records reveal how the terrorist group combined brutality and paperwork to wield power over territory that at one point was the size of Britain, with a population estimated at 12 million people.

267,"NEW DELHI — India’s defense minister is visiting Moscow this week to finalize the purchase of a Russian missile defense system, Indian officials say, in a weapons deal that would violate American sanctions against Russia. The potential $6 billion deal comes at a time when the Trump administration is both weighing more extensive sanctions against Russia and trying to forge a military alliance with India. Indian officials say the agreement could be finalized as soon as this week, with India purchasing five S-400 Triumf systems, an antiaircraft missile array that can also intercept missiles. If the purchase goes through, the Trump administration would have to choose between punishing India for violating the sanctions or granting an exemption to avoid souring the relationship. The United States has been trying to cultivate India as a strategic ally and a hedge against Chinese military expansion. Washington has typically dangled defense deals as a way to improve military ties with countries, and it has courted India aggressively. Lockheed Martin offered last summer to move the production of F-16 fighter jets from Texas to India if India agreed to buy the plane. “In the past few years you’ve seen a massive transition where more equipment is being bought from the U.S. That’s because the U.S. wants a closer relationship with India, and defense deals are essentially diplomatic deals,” said Shailesh Kumar, the Asia director of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm. "
268,"WASHINGTON — At least five officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, four of them high-ranking, were reassigned or demoted, or requested new jobs in the past year after they raised concerns about the spending and management of the agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt. The concerns included unusually large spending on office furniture and first-class travel, as well as certain demands by Mr. Pruitt for security coverage, such as requests for a bulletproof vehicle and an expanded 20-person protective detail, according to people who worked for or with the E.P.A. and have direct knowledge of the situation. Mr. Pruitt bristled when the officials — four career E.P.A. employees and one Trump administration political appointee — confronted him, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The political appointee, Kevin Chmielewski, was placed on administrative leave without pay, according to two of the people with knowledge of the situation. Mr. Chmielewski was among the first employees of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, serving as a senior advance official. The two people, who are administration officials, said that Mr. Chmielewski flagged some of his concerns about Mr. Pruitt directly to the White House’s presidential personnel office. Two of the career officials, Reginald E. Allen and Eric Weese, were moved to jobs where they had less say in spending decisions and less interaction with Mr. Pruitt, the people said. A third career official, John E. Reeder, joined American University as a temporary “executive in residence” after being told by the E.P.A. to find a new job. And John C. Martin, who served on the security detail, was also removed from the team and had his gun and badge taken away after raising concerns about how Mr. Pruitt’s security was being handled. A sixth official, Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, also raised questions about Mr. Pruitt’s spending, according to three E.P.A. officials. He remains in his job but is considering resigning, agency officials said. Mr. Jackson came to the agency from the office of Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who like Mr. Pruitt had been a major critic of regulatory moves made under President Barack Obama, and is a prominent climate change skeptic. "

270,"WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — President Trump dispensed on Thursday with what he called a “boring” speech on tax reform here, tossing his text to his fans before launching into a lengthy tirade against immigration that included an accusation that Democrats were embracing dangerous policies to secure immigrant votes. Mr. Trump traveled to West Virginia to promote his $1.5 trillion tax overhaul before a friendly audience. But the president grew tired of his prepared remarks after a few moments and returned to the bitter complaints about the United States’ immigration laws that have dominated his attention this week and prompted him on Wednesday to ask governors to deploy the National Guard to the southern border. “This was going to be my remarks — it would have taken about two minutes, but what the hell — that would have been a little boring,” Mr. Trump said, tossing a sheet of paper covered with neat paragraphs of text into the audience. “I’m reading off the first paragraph, I said, ‘This is boring.’ Come on. We have to tell it like it is.” Instead, he recounted the terrorist attack last October in Lower Manhattan, in which an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people when he drove a truck onto a pedestrian and bicycle path on the West Side Highway. “This is what the Democrats are doing to you, and they like it because they think they’re going to vote Democrat,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re doing it for that reason, and other reasons.” The president later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he intended to deploy 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops to the border with Mexico. If Mr. Trump sends the low end of his proposal, it would barely exceed the 1,200 sent by President Barack Obama in 2010 to support other border agencies. Even if Mr. Trump sends 4,000, the top end of his proposal, he would be dispatching fewer than President George W. Bush did in 2006. "

272,"In 1994, Newt Gingrich, brandishing his Contract with America, led a Republican revolution that swept aside Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate, initiating an epoch of conservative ascendancy that lingers on. Don Sipple, a Republican campaign consultant, declared at the time that the 1994 midterms pitted a Republican Party calling for “discipline” against a Democratic Party focused on “therapy.” Two years later, George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley, published “Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think,” which argued that Several approaches to contemporary politics echo the insights of Sipple and Lakoff. The crucial word now, however, is authoritarianism. The election of Donald Trump — built as it was on several long-term trends that converged in 2016 — has created an authoritarian moment. This somewhat surprising development is the subject of “Remaking Partisan Politics through Authoritarian Sorting,” a forthcoming book by the political scientists Christopher Federico, Stanley Feldman and Christopher Weber, who argue that The three authors use a long-established authoritarian scale — based on four survey questions about which childhood traits parents would like to see in their offspring — that asks voters to choose between independence or respect for their elders; curiosity or good manners; self-reliance or obedience; and being considerate or well-behaved. Those respondents who choose respect for elders, good manners, obedience and being well-behaved are rated more authoritarian. The authors found that in 1992, 62 percent of white voters who ranked highest on the authoritarian scale supported George H.W. Bush. In 2016, 86 percent of the most authoritarian white voters backed Trump, an increase of 24 percentage points. Federico, Feldman and Weber conclude that Last year, Federico, writing with Christopher Johnston of Duke and Howard G. Lavine of the University of Minnesota, published “Open versus Closed: Personality, Identity, and the Politics of Redistribution,” which also explores the concept of authoritarian voting. In an email, Johnston summarized some of their findings: Johnston notes that personality traits like closed mindedness, along with aversion to change and discomfort with diversity, are linked to authoritarianism: Johnston addresses class differences in voting patterns and also differences stemming from the level of a voter’s interest in politics: In their book, Johnston, Lavine and Federico reinforce this point: The revived interest in authoritarianism in politics began well before anyone seriously considered the possibility of a Trump candidacy — except, apparently, Trump himself.

273,"In the cheerily sterile, fitfully funny comedy “Blockers,” parents conspire to save the virginity of their daughters, high school seniors planning a collective deflowering (not, it should be said, with one another). That is the movie’s big joke, and while it sounds positively antediluvian it also brings to mind news reports that the Trump administration plans to introduce abstinence-only education this summer. According to the website The Hill, the idea is to emphasize “sexual delay,” which sounds like the title of a song that Marvin Gaye never recorded. The world has a way of killing the mood, if you let it. Thinking too hard and long about a would-be laugh-in like “Blockers” isn’t usually the best idea, of course. The point is to sit back and enjoy it, no matter how sporadic or familiar the jokes. That’s the case with the lighthearted, eager-to-please “Blockers,” which features an innocuously pleasant cast of middle-age professional goofballs and a rather less-funny collection of dewy young cuties. As expected, while the daughters and their dates frolic, the parents regress. They yell, fall, run in circles, and flap their hands and mouths. One also partakes in an inadvisable practice you can learn about by typing the words alcohol enema in your browser. The parents, Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter (Leslie Mann, John Cena and best in show, Ike Barinholtz), have done a bang-up job with their kids. Their three high school daughters, lifelong friends, are smart, social, happy, healthy and dull. Because they’re exceedingly, grindingly average, they hatch up a plan to have sex with three boys on prom night. And because the screenwriters Brian Kehoe and James Kehoe haven’t worked nearly as hard as they should have, Lisa’s daughter, Julie (Kathryn Newton), leaves her laptop vulnerable to parental prying. Enter Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter, who, after breaking the teenage emoji code in one of the movie’s cleverer bits, plot and deploy. High jinks and slapstick ensue. "
274,"WASHINGTON — A spreading crisis has threatened to engulf Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, who until recently ranked among the stars of the Trump administration. Now, he is mired in a series of ethical questions about his housing arrangements, staffing decisions and costly travel at taxpayer expense. Senior White House officials say that Mr. Pruitt’s fate has become uncertain. On Thursday, one of the central questions facing the E.P.A. chief — his decision in 2017 to rent a room in Washington from the wife of a top energy lobbyist — was exacerbated when an E.P.A. ethics official walked back his earlier assessment that Mr. Pruitt had done nothing wrong. In a new memo made public Thursday, the official said that he did not have all the facts when he made his initial finding. On Wednesday one of Mr. Pruitt’s top advisers, Samantha Dravis, resigned and Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, has grown frustrated enough that he has also considered resigning, according to three people in whom Mr. Jackson has confided.   "
275,"A Virginia woman who lost her job with a government contractor after she was photographed extending her middle finger at President Trump’s motorcade last year has sued her former employer for wrongful termination. Juli Briskman directed the gesture toward a string of black sport utility vehicles that zoomed by her on her bicycle on Oct. 28, as Mr. Trump’s motorcade was leaving Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Va. Reporters and photographers in a car behind her captured the moment, which quickly spread online and became a source of many jokes on late-night television. But Ms. Briskman’s employer, Akima L.L.C., did not find it funny. When she returned to work the following week, she said, company executives told her she needed to resign. Ms. Briskman, 50, had violated the company’s social media policy on obscenity by sharing the image on Facebook and Twitter, they told her, according to the lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. The executives also feared blowback from the Trump administration, Ms. Briskman said the executives told her. “I was fired from my job because my employer feared unconstitutional retaliation,” Ms. Briskman said Thursday afternoon. “But on a larger scale, I feel that our democracy is being threatened.” Her lawyers assert that Ms. Briskman’s gesture was “core political speech” protected by Virginia law and the Constitution. She is seeking $2,692 for two weeks of severance she said she was promised but never received, as well as compensation for legal fees. "
276,"BEIJING — China’s leaders sound supremely confident that they can win a trade war with President Trump. The state news media has depicted him as a reckless bully intent on undermining the global trading system, while presenting the Chinese government as a fair-minded champion of free trade. And China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has used the standoff to reinforce the Communist Party’s message that the United States is determined to stop China’s rise — but that it no longer can. China is already too strong, its economy too big. “China is not afraid of a trade war,” the vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, declared at a news conference to discuss possible countermeasures. More than once, he cited the history of the “new China” — which began its extraordinary economic revival four decades ago — as evidence that it would “never succumb to external pressure.” Missing in the bluster and the propaganda are the questionable methods that China has adopted to squeeze foreign companies out of key technology markets — and the fact that in the cold-eyed calculus of economics, China is more vulnerable to a trade war than officials admit. Exports account for a big share of Chinese economic growth. Because the United States buys so much from China, Washington has many more ways to hit Chinese manufacturers. By contrast, the retaliatory tariffs Beijing has proposed already cover more than one-third of what China buys from the United States, leaving it fewer options to strike back. In the political realm, however, Mr. Xi enjoys advantages that may allow him to cope with the economic fallout far better than Mr. Trump can. His authoritarian grip on the news media and the party means there is little room for criticism of his policies, even as Mr. Trump must contend with complaints from American companies and consumers before important midterm elections in November. "
277,"WASHINGTON — The United States Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, issued a national advisory Thursday urging more Americans to keep on hand and learn how to use the drug naloxone, which can save the lives of people overdosing on opioids. Naloxone has already revived thousands of overdose victims as the opioid epidemic has intensified, but rescue workers have usually been the ones to administer it. It was the first advisory issued by a surgeon general since 2005, and it underscored the urgency of addressing an opioid epidemic that has killed more than 250,000 people over the past decade, including more than 42,000 people in 2016. Dr. Adams said making naloxone more available in communities across the country is critical to reducing overdose deaths among people prescribed high doses of opioids for pain, as well as those who abuse painkillers or illicit opioids like fentanyl and heroin. “Each day we lose 115 Americans to an opioid overdose — that’s one person every 12.5 minutes,” Dr. Adams said in a statement. “It is time to make sure more people have access to this lifesaving medication, because 77 percent of opioid overdose deaths occur outside of a medical setting and more than half occur at home.” Naloxone can be administered through a nasal mist or an injection, suspending the effects of an overdose and resuscitating the victim. Many police officers and emergency medical technicians already carry the drug, and most states and many cities have issued standing orders allowing anyone to get naloxone at a pharmacy without a prescription. Most insurance plans cover it, and people can sometimes get it for free or low cost through public health programs or manufacturer discounts. Dr. Adams, who is scheduled to speak on Thursday at a conference in Atlanta, emphasized in the advisory that more opioid users, as well as their families and friends and anyone who regularly comes into contact with them, should carry naloxone.

279,"Dr. Ellen Stofan, the former chief scientist at NASA, will become the first woman to lead the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian Institution announced on Thursday. At NASA, Dr. Stofan, who has a background in geology, was a top adviser to Charles F. Bolden Jr., then the administrator for the department, where she helped lead in the development of a long-term plan to get humans to Mars. “Ellen’s scientific background, leadership skills, communication acumen and strategic thinking have positioned her superbly to lead the National Air and Space Museum,” David Skorton, the director of the Smithsonian Institution, said in a statement. “Her passion for science coupled with her love of education will ensure that the museum will continue to be a global treasure and world leader through its extensive programming, exhibitions and scholarship.” Space has been a part of Dr. Stofan’s life for almost its entirety. Her father was a NASA rocket scientist and at the age of 4 she attended her first rocket launch at Cape Canaveral, an event that spurred her own career. “It is an incredible honor to join the National Air and Space Museum family at this important point in the museum’s history,” Dr. Stofan said. “Space and aviation inspire our next generation of explorers, and there is no better place to experience this than at our museums on the Mall and at the Udvar-Hazy Center.” Dr. Stofan joins the museum at a time when interest in space interest might be climbing. In the new budget recently passed by Congress and signed by President Donald J. Trump, NASA was a big winner, to the tune of a $1 billion increase. She will be overseeing an institution with more than 300 full time employees and a budget of $48 million, 70 percent of which comes from federal appropriations. "
280,"President Trump has railed repeatedly against the Senate filibuster as a major reason that many of his policy priorities have flopped. Monday, raging about the Mexico border, he tweeted that “Congress must immediately pass border legislation, use nuclear option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people.” He’s not alone. Restive House members have also blamed Senate rules for the party’s thin legislative record under the first year of unified Republican control in Washington since 2006. As Representative Chris Collins of New York said, “Let’s be done with that archaic nonsense rule, once and for all.” Representative Darrell Issa of California went even further: “I regret the very existence of the Senate.” There are certainly bills that have been killed by Democratic filibusters in this Congress — just as there was legislation torpedoed by Republican obstruction during the Obama administration. The need to overcome a filibuster in the Senate on spending bills, and the influence that gives Democrats, was a primary cause of the protracted budget conflict that produced a brief government shutdown in January. But the greater cause of many Republican headaches is substantive divisions within the party. Democrats’ leverage on spending bills has been enhanced by the fact that a bloc of Republicans, especially in the House, generally refuse to support large, omnibus packages like the one Congress passed last month. And on issues where Republicans are capable of legislating without Democratic involvement, disagreements about how to proceed have been the major obstacle. The failed effort to repeal Obamacare using a legislative process that did not require overcoming a filibuster threat stands as the clearest casualty of Republican divisions, but it is not the only one. Consider the budget measure, passed by the House and Senate last fall, which provided the framework for what would become Republicans’ tax cut package. Some House Republicans pushed for a budget resolution that would have allowed them to pursue — on a party-line basis — significant cuts to the social safety net. Disagreements among House Republicans led them to scale back the initial plan, and eventually they abandoned it altogether for a tax-cuts-focused approach advocated by their Senate colleagues. "
281,"Sally Q. Yates spent nearly three decades in the Justice Department, rising to become acting attorney general before President Trump fired her last year for refusing to defend his travel ban. In a conversation in Washington on Tuesday with the reporter Matt Apuzzo of The New York Times, Ms. Yates discussed issues ranging from the wiretapping of a Trump campaign adviser to the president’s interference in criminal investigations. Here are the takeaways. Ms. Yates returned frequently to the difference between public policy and fundamental principles. “Elections have consequences, and I think you have to expect in a change in administrations, a change in party, that there are going to be policy decisions that are made that you don’t think are a good idea,” she said. “What worries me more than any of that is the relentless attack on democratic institutions and norms, and the impact that that can have on our country not just during the term of a Trump presidency, but in the years to come as well.” On issues like criminal justice (she supports lesser sentences for nonviolent drug offenders; the Trump administration doesn’t) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (she believes its prohibition on sex-based discrimination extends to gender identity; the Trump administration doesn’t), she gave her opinions but offered only mild criticism of Mr. Trump’s course. But when it came to the president’s penchants for pressuring the Justice Department, questioning the legitimacy of judges and attacking the news media, Ms. Yates did not hold back. His interference with the Justice Department — she declined to say whether it constituted obstruction — is especially worrisome, she said. "
282,"Since the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the March for Our Lives, the emergence of Emma González, a senior at the school, as a national face of gun control activism has drawn much attention for her role as a founder of #NeverAgain and for her views on social media strategy — and for her now famously shaven head. To many outside eyes, her hair (or lack of it) has become the symbol of her refusal to accept the status quo, her refusal to simply sit back and leave change to the establishment. So much so that The New Yorker recently published an article comparing her to Joan of Arc, as depicted in the 1928 film by Carl Theodor Dreyer: another young woman with a genius for inspiring leadership, a deeply felt belief system and “brutally close-cropped hair.” No matter that, as the essay’s author acknowledges, a few weeks before the shooting Ms. González had declared, on her school’s Instagram account, that “I decided to cut my hair because it was a pain in the neck, if you’ll forgive the pun. It was really hot all the time; it was very cumbersome and very heavy, leading to a lot of headaches. It was expensive to keep it up, and as prom time came around, I figured it would be cheaper to not have to worry about doing my hair.” Her original motivation has become shrouded in her advocacy, and in the eyes of the watching world, her head has taken on its own meaning, representative of our failure, of her renunciation. If, a few years ago, it seemed possible that with the advent of models like Ruth Bell and Kris Gottschalk, buzz cuts on women could be viewed as representations of “quirky beauty” and celebrated all over the East Village and beyond, the reaction to Ms. González’s hair has made it clear that we were deluded. "
283,"Why was this Passover Seder different from all other Passover Seders? Well, for one, it took place on Monday night, the fourth night of the holiday and not one on which the traditional dinner is called for. But that’s showbiz: Some of the 100 guests, and most of the evening’s performers, were Broadway actors, composers, producers — and Mondays are when Broadway theaters are dark, meaning casts and crews are available for socializing. It took place in a large downtown apartment in a prewar building, decorated with billowing scarves, bright pillows and hanging palm branches to replicate a Bedouin tent. The usual holiday prayers and songs, which commemorate the biblical exodus of Jews from slavery, were replaced by a high-caliber revue of poetic and musical performances from stars of some of the biggest current Broadway shows, including “Hamilton,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Frozen.” The story of exodus that was told over the course of the night was not of Moses and the ancient Jews’ sojourn eastward across the Red Sea, but of a man named Mohammed Al Samawi, who escaped a near-certain death in his home country, Yemen, by traveling westward over the Red Sea on what happened to be the second night of Passover in 2015. “Unleavened,” as this night was billed, was organized by Adam Kantor, an actor appearing in “The Band’s Visit”; Benj Pasek, the lyricist of “La La Land,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “The Greatest Showman”; and four other friends, all of whom are interested in contemporizing Judaism and making it relevant in an increasingly secularized climate. "
284,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and California are fighting a furious multifront legal war, and every week seems to bring a new courtroom battle. “It’s bloody combat,” said Jessica Levinson, who teaches at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “This isn’t a cold war. It’s a scorching hot war. And that’s politically expedient for both sides.” The state has filed 29 lawsuits against the federal government since President Trump took office, on issues including immigration, the environment and voting rights. “Government by litigation isn’t what the American people voted for,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Monday, “and attempting to thwart an administration’s elected agenda through endless, meritless lawsuits is a dangerous precedent.” That same day, Mr. Sessions filed suit against the state, accusing it of interfering with the sale of federal lands. It followed a separate suit last month to block three state laws that sought to protect unauthorized immigrants. Clashes between states and the federal government are nothing new, said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. "
285,"UNITED NATIONS — Solar panels are everywhere: perched on thatched roofs in rural Kenya, helping Indian farmers pump groundwater for their fields, and powering United States military bases. Solar power accounted for more than a third of all net new power capacity added worldwide in 2017, a larger share than any other new source, the United Nations Environment Program said in a report issued Thursday.  And solar power is becoming much more affordable.  The cost of electricity from large-scale solar projects has dropped by 72 percent since 2009, according to the study.   But even as solar and its renewable energy cousins — like wind, biomass and geothermal power; but not counting big hydropower projects —  expand, they still account for barely 12 percent of all the electricity that the world consumes. The greatest share still comes from fossil fuels like coal, and more coal-fired power plants continue to be built, contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that have warmed the planet to dangerous levels. “This shows where we are heading,” said Nils Stieglitz, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, which produced the report along with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The fact that renewables altogether are still far from providing the majority of electricity means that we still have a long way to go.” The world leader in investing in renewables, by far, is China. The country accounted for nearly half of all renewable energy investments worldwide, pumping $86.5 billion into solar energy alone in 2017 in what the report described as “an extraordinary solar boom.” China has cut back significantly on coal at home, though it has continued to fund and build coal-fired power plants abroad. One of the most closely watched is a proposed plant on the coast of Kenya, near the ancient island town of Lamu, a Unesco world heritage site. "
286,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Gavin Newsom is the lieutenant governor, a former San Francisco mayor and a leading Democrat to replace Gov. Jerry Brown. California Today has been doing occasional question-and-answer sessions with candidates for office. Today’s interview with Mr. Newsom, edited and condensed for clarity, was conducted for our article on the race. Q. Were there things Jerry Brown did you would continue? A. Oh, the “one that gets me in trouble” question. Brown’s perfect. (Laughs) Look — he’s done an extraordinary job. It’s important to remind folks where we were seven years ago: 12.4 percent unemployment, $27 billion budget deficit. Now we are having a raging debate about the size of the surplus. This state has turned a corner. Q. What has not gone right? A. We’re not all rowing in the same direction. We are the richest and the poorest state. Eight million living below the poverty line, 40 percent of our kids at or near the poverty line. Inequality is the issue that is going to define a good part of my tenure. To say it happened on our watch is accurate. Q. Has the governor paid enough attention to homelessness? A. He has on the margins. But have we designed a framework to regionalize solutions and to have the state drive the effort? No. And I intend to do that. We have never had a governor particularly animated by homelessness. Q. Do you support the proposal by Senator Scott Wiener to override local zoning and permit construction of eight-story housing near transit lines? A. I told him point blank, “I would not sign this bill, but I love what you are doing. How can I help?” No sooner than did we have that conversation than he’s already made substantive amendments, on rent control protection. He realizes one size does not fit all. The spirit of what he is doing is right. "
287,"On Sunday, Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party will likely cruise to another victory in Hungary’s general election, giving Mr. Orban, the reigning champion of “illiberal democracy” — a term he proudly embraces — a fourth term to pursue his assault on democratic institutions, immigrants, the European Union and anything smacking of social change. The campaign has been surprisingly tough, but then Fidesz designed the voting system and controls much of the media. A victory will no doubt hearten the ranks of the nativist populists who, despite their avowed aversion to international organizations, take pride in being in the vanguard of an international reactionary movement. It is telling that after his ouster from the White House, Stephen Bannon went on a tour of European soul mates, during which he hailed Mr. Orban as his hero and “the most significant guy on the scene right now.” A report by The Times’s Patrick Kingsley on how Mr. Orban reached that august status offers a chilling look at the breadth of the populist assault not only on the “hardware” of democracy — constitution, judiciary, the electoral system — but also the software: the culture, civil society, education system and religious organizations. Fidesz (founded in 1988 as the Hungarian Alliance of Young Democrats) has actively pushed a narrative of Hungarian victimhood and ethnocentrism in schools, theaters and universities while vilifying any opposing viewpoint, and especially pro-democracy organizations funded by George Soros, the Hungarian-American billionaire who has become something of a whipping boy for the far right throughout Central Europe. Mr. Orban’s defenders say people support him not for his populism but for his handling of the economy. Government debt and the budget deficit are down, the country’s credit rating is up, growth has almost quadrupled since 2010. What these figures do not show, though, is that many of these improvements have come through membership in the European Union, which Mr. Orban assails at every opportunity. At the same time, according to the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators, corruption has risen significantly under Mr. Orban. With national variations, Mr. Orban’s Hungary has been the template for the “authoritarianization” — the term some experts use — in Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s Poland, Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, Vladimir Putin’s Russia and in other democracies where populism has made headway. The United States may not fit into the same pattern, but like the others, President Trump came to power by playing on the resentments of a deeply divided nation. The populists, no matter how narrowly elected, assume that electoral victory was the will of the people and, in a terrible irony, a license to trample on the same democracy that raised them to power. They feel empowered to muzzle the press, crush the opposition, manipulate the courts and vilify whoever disagrees with them. "
288,"To the Editor: President Trump wants to be an American version of Vladimir Putin of Russia and cannot understand why there are factions in this country that oppose this. Mr. Trump wants to be like Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and kill drug dealers. Mr. Trump wants to be like Xi Jinping of China and be president for life. Mr. Trump is not stupid. He may be intentionally ignorant or uninterested in certain options if they don’t serve his limited agenda. Plenty of smart people rise to success of a sort despite strategies that do not embrace a larger understanding of the consequences of being unfair or dishonest or immoral or selfish. Mr. Trump does not appreciate how reducing diversity or silencing alternate intelligent voices will have dire consequences in the long term. He just wants instant gratification and to protect at any cost a view of himself as uniquely capable. The world must be a shallow, materialistic place to be deceived by these men. But this is what you get when you allow selfish children to rule the world — “Lord of the Flies.” KENNETH J. GARCIA, BETHPAGE, N.Y.

EMBUDO, N.M. "
289,"WASHINGTON — Scott Lloyd’s unadorned job title betrays little hint of the power he has over the pregnant teenagers in his custody. As director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, he oversees the assistance program for the tens of thousands of refugees who still seek shelter in the United States, even with the Trump administration’s crackdown. But as the government official who is also responsible for the care of young, undocumented immigrants who enter the United States without their parents, he spends much of his time trying to stop those who want an abortion. He has instructed his staff to give him a spreadsheet each week that tells him about any unaccompanied minors who have asked for one and how far along they are in their pregnancy. In at least one case he directed staff to read to one girl a description of what happens during an abortion. And when there’s a need for counseling, Mr. Lloyd’s office calls on someone from its list of preferred “life affirming” pregnancy resource centers. Last fall Mr. Lloyd’s refusal to let a 17-year-old in Texas leave the shelter where she was living to get an abortion drew an admonishment from a federal judge who said she was “astounded” the government had been so insistent on keeping someone from obtaining a constitutionally protected procedure. Last week another judge barred him from trying to prevent any girl in his care from getting an abortion, but government lawyers have asked for a stay and plan to appeal. How Mr. Lloyd, an appointee of President Trump, turned a small office in the Department of Health and Human Services that provides social services to refugees into a battleground over abortion rights is part of the larger story of the Trump administration’s push to enact rules that favor socially conservative positions on issues like abortion, contraception and gay, lesbian and transgender rights. Unlike some traditional Republicans, many religious conservatives eagerly sought jobs in the administration and the chance to shape policy after eight years of a Democratic president. This was especially true at H.H.S., where the senior ranks are staffed with former activists who have built careers advancing socially conservative causes. "
290,"The United States ground war in Syria started in late 2015, when the Obama administration ordered a small deployment of roughly 50 troops. The American public saw little of the engagement: a few photos of familiar-looking soldiers in familiar-looking armored vehicles. The White House and the Pentagon stressed that the war in Syria against the Islamic State was being waged by Kurdish and Arab allies — small groups that American commandos were just “advising and assisting.” The American war, it seemed then, was primarily fought from the sky, taking the form of thousands of airstrikes. [The Times is reintroducing the At War blog, a forum for the firsthand experiences of global conflict.] As the months passed, the number of American troops on the ground increased. Today roughly 2,000 American troops live in Syria. The Islamic State’s de facto capital, Raqqa, is littered with rubble and explosives, and some of the Islamic State’s holdouts occupy a small slice of the Euphrates River Valley. President Trump has said he wants the Pentagon’s forces to leave. “I want to get out — I want to bring our troops back home,” Trump said on Tuesday during a news conference with leaders of Baltic nations. “It’s time. We were very successful against ISIS.” Trump’s statement ran almost directly opposite Pentagon plans, which were communicated at roughly the same time Tuesday by Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the top officer at the military’s United States Central Command. On Wednesday, Trump adopted the Pentagon’s view. The White House released a statement saying that the American military was going nowhere until the Islamic State was “eradicated” in Syria. "
291,"This September, The Learning Network will turn 20. And this Sunday, we’ll be in print for the first time. As you may know, our site was created in 1998 after The Times did a survey of loyal readers and asked how they were first introduced to the paper. Two answers dominated: “My parents read it” came first, but “my teacher gave it to me” was a close second. That supplied us with our mission — to help people teach and learn with Times content — and has guided what we do ever since. Now The Times is publishing a new quarterly section, called Learning, that will take over for the long-running Education Life — and work from our site, by students and by teachers, will be featured in every issue. For this inaugural April 8 edition, you can find: • Drawings of President Trump submitted by students to this year’s Editorial Cartoon Contest. • “Nothing Less Than Heroic,” a “found poem” by Ryan Nguyen, winner of last year’s annual April contest, which celebrates National Poetry Month. (To submit to this year’s contest, visit this page.) • Selected answers from our question, “What Do You Wish More People Understood About What It’s Like to Be a Student in 2018?” • Selected answers from our question, “What Do You Wish More People Knew About What It’s Like to Be a Teacher in 2018?” • The comic at the top of this post, which was created by David Finkle, a Florida teacher and cartoonist, who sent in another comic in response to our question, and from whom the Learning editors then commissioned this one. So please pick up a paper this Sunday and look for us on Page 15 of the new section. And stay tuned, because we’ll be regularly reaching out to you for ideas, opinions, drawings, photos and more for future editions. "
292,"In Graham Greene’s short story “The Destructors,” a gang of arrogant boys demolishes the home of a stranger. They break into the man’s dwelling and, in an act of arbitrary aggression, dismantle it piece by piece. They rip up the floorboards and saw the support beams. They smash the glass and shred the wiring. They strip it to its plumbing and finally pull down its walls. “My house,” their victim sobs when he discovers the wreckage. “Where’s my house?” This is a tale for our times. There are destroyers everywhere, from the White House on down. But there is one particular demolition crew that needs your urgent attention, because its work stands apart for both sheer ambition and lasting harm. The demolition crew is called the House Committee on Natural Resources. Led by the powerful Representative Rob Bishop of Utah, a Republican, it is intent on erasing the great edifice that we call American conservation. For more than a century, the people of the United States have been at work building this country’s conservation system. Like a family of visionary architects laboring over many generations, citizens here have erected a system of ideas and policies meant to ensure our society’s future by protecting it from ecological devastation. This system is built atop a few foundational laws: the Antiquities Act of 1906, the Wilderness Act of 1964, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, among others. Destroy this architecture of environmental sanity, and you destroy our conservation heritage. The destruction is already well underway. Even as I write, Mr. Bishop and the other members of the House Committee on Natural Resources are waging a relentless assault on each and every one of these essential laws. If they succeed, our priceless public lands, water and wildlife will suffer irreversible damage. Consider, for instance, the National Monument Creation and Protection Act, which Mr. Bishop shepherded through his committee in October. Despite its name, the bill would fundamentally gut one of our oldest conservation laws. It would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 by severely restricting the president’s ability to independently designate national monuments on public land to protect natural, historic and cultural treasures. His legislation would also empower future presidents to reduce such monuments in size, effectively enshrining in law the Trump administration’s ongoing and legally dubious attack on national monuments across the country, especially in Mr. Bishop’s home state.

293,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The Islamic State’s paper trail, Beijing’s Bible ban and sexism at the sumo ring. Here’s what you need to know: • Five trips to Iraq. More than 15,000 documents. One collapsed “caliphate.” We published the results of a yearlong investigation, in which Times journalists scoured former offices of the Islamic State that were abandoned by the militants. It shows that ISIS fighters, known for their brutality, were also effective administrators. We also have a new audio series, “Caliphate,” which followed our reporter Rukmini Callimachi as she covered the Islamic State and the fall of Mosul, Iraq. Listen to a preview here. The U.S. military, meanwhile, is spending about $1 million on makeshift detention camps for Islamic State prisoners in Syria, broadening its involvement in operations it had sought to avoid. _____ • “China is not afraid of a trade war.” That was a senior Chinese finance official who also said that the “new China” would “never succumb to external pressure.” Some of that is believable: Beijing has a strong grip on banks, the news media and politics. It also seems willing to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the U.S. political system. (China also has some “unconventional weapons” to make life harder for American companies.) "
294,"SHANGHAI — Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, arguing that he mischaracterized his company’s effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country. Taking aim at comments Mr. Zuckerberg made in a recent interview, the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar. The same problems keep recurring, they said, with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions. In a conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox this week, Mr. Zuckerberg referred to a pair of chain letters that were widely shared in Myanmar on Facebook Messenger last year. One message warned Buddhist groups about an imminent attack by Muslims, expected on Sept. 11. The other, spread among Muslims, cautioned of violence from Buddhist nationalists on the same date. “So that’s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “Now, in that case, our systems detect that that’s going on. We stop those messages from going through.” In an open letter, the organizations, which have worked with Facebook to flag dangerous and misleading content, including the chain letters, said the messages had spread for days, caused widespread fear and set off at least three violent incidents. They also said there was no system at all, only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol. "
295,"A Trump administration proposal to steeply increase entrance fees to the most popular national parks landed with a thud when it was presented in November, and park officials say they are now reconsidering it. The proposal, which would apply during the peak visitor season to 17 parks including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, called for a $70 fee for noncommercial vehicles, up from $30. The fee for motorcycles would rise to $50 from $25, while pedestrians and cyclists would be charged $30, up from $15. Officials received more than 109,000 comments during a monthlong public comment period last year, with most commenters writing against the increase. Many said they would no longer be able to afford a trip, or would choose other options for vacations. “If you enact this insane fee, I will no longer be able to afford to visit the national parks,” one said. “If that is your ultimate goal, well done.” A National Park Service spokesman said this week the plan was “still being reviewed and not yet finalized.” “We’ve taken the public’s suggestions seriously and have amended the plan to reflect those,” the service said in a statement.

Trump in the 2016 election but hoped he would never follow through on his threats to impose tariffs on China. They feared that they would suffer if China imposed its own tariffs as payback.

On today’s episode: • Eldon Gould, a farmer in Illinois who voted for President Trump. Background reading: • The Midwest, which accounts for roughly half the nation’s agricultural output, is a prime target for any tit-for-tat response to American tariffs.

297,"Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in “wasteful spending” and needs to be slimmed down. To underscore the point, he submitted a quarterly budget request recently that was a nice round number: $0. That attitude, though, apparently didn’t apply to two of his recent hires. Mr. Mulvaney appointed two senior staff members who are paid salaries of more than $230,000, amounts that are far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs in Washington, according to agency documents obtained by The New York Times through a public records request. The consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street. As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency’s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have been trying to defang the agency, which they view as overly tough on the finance industry. One weapon they have tried to employ — so far, unsuccessfully — is to reduce the amount of money the agency can pay employees. But Mr. Mulvaney was willing to shell out top dollar for his highest-ranking appointees. When Mr. Mulvaney hired Kirsten Sutton in January to be the agency’s chief of staff, he agreed to pay her $259,500 a year, according to the documents obtained by The Times. Her salary is the highest allowed under the consumer bureau’s pay scale. (The hiring documents identify her as Kirsten Mork, but professionally, she uses the surname Sutton.) "
298,"TOMS RIVER, N.J. — The tables inside the hotel room were full and Andy Kim, the candidate responsible for filling them, was pleasantly surprised. It was a weeknight fund-raiser after all, rescheduled once already, for this relatively unknown Democratic challenger in a Republican district and a thick fog on Route 37 had obscured the tiny sign directing drivers to the hotel. “Seven months before Election Day this is not normal, to be able to pack a room on a weekday,” he told a crowd of about 150 supporters, each of whom contributed at least $10 to listen to Mr. Kim and snack on donated croissants. Ever since the election of President Trump, Democrats across the country have seen a predictable surge in energy among a base eager to take on the White House. What has been perhaps less expected is the uprising against the president coursing through more moderate suburbs, including many Mr. Trump won. Democrats buoyed by recent victories in Republican districts have lofty aims in suburban New Jersey as they work to wrest control of the House from the G.O.P., given Democrats’ surprise victories in Virginia, Alabama and, most recently, Pennsylvania. In New Jersey, which has been described by Democrats and Republicans as the most suburban state in the country, the revolt has been especially muscular and has put into play Republican-held congressional seats that until this year had hardly been on the Democratic radar. Voters have grown increasingly angry with Mr. Trump, viewing many of his actions as damaging the state’s fortunes. Under the new federal tax overhaul pushed by Mr. Trump, which severely limits the deductibility of local taxes and mortgage interest payments, over 10 percent of New Jersey households will see their taxes rise, more than any other state, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group. And Mr. Trump has been adamant about blocking any federal funding for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River that would ease travel for tens of thousands of commuters. As a result, New Jersey has become a key focus of the party’s effort to win the 24 seats it needs to retake the House. National leaders, outside groups and statewide officials have launched a concerted effort targeting four of the five New Jersey districts held by Republicans, including the Third Congressional District where Mr. Kim is running. "
299,"MOSCOW — A Russian historian of the Soviet forced labor camps known as the Gulag, whose work ran counter to official contemporary narratives that play down the crimes of the Stalin era, was acquitted on Thursday of child pornography charges, which human rights groups said had been trumped up for political reasons. The historian, Yuri A. Dmitriev, gained renown in 1997 for discovering the remains of more than 9,000 victims of Stalinist purges buried in communal pits in Sandarmokh, a forest in northwestern Russia. Mr. Dmitriev has devoted the past 30 years to searching for such mass graves together with colleagues from Memorial, one of Russia’s oldest and most respected human rights organizations. Mr. Dmitriev serves as the regional director of Memorial in Karelia, a region in northwestern Russia bordering Finland. Initially, local government officials had supported his efforts and attended memorial events at the forest, which has been commemorated with a chapel and monuments to the victims amid the trees. But attitudes have been changing, and the Kremlin now emphasizes taking pride in Russia’s past, not uncovering its darker chapters. President Vladimir V. Putin said last year that “excessive demonization of Stalin is one of the ways to attack the Soviet Union, Russia.” Pro-government news outlets have run articles suggesting that Mr. Dmitriev’s grim discovery of masses of decaying bones could have been the site of executions of Soviet Army soldiers by Finns during the so-called Winter War with Finland that began in 1939, though most historians say that is unlikely. Mr. Dmitriev’s research was not on trial but formed a backdrop for his case. Mr. Dmitriev was arrested in December 2016 on the child pornography charges after taking nine nude photographs of his adoptive daughter, who was 11 at the time. He denied the images were pornographic. He said he took the photos to prove that he was not beating the girl, in case social services accused him of child abuse as the official pressure against him mounted. A court-appointed committee eventually agreed that the pictures were not pornographic in nature. The verdict on Thursday, handed down by a court in the city of Petrozavodsk, cleared Mr. Dmitriev of the pornography accusations but convicted him on a lesser charge of illegally possessing parts for a shotgun. He was sentenced to three months of probation and community service, Russian news agencies reported. Mr. Dmitriev had also denied the firearms charge, and it was not immediately clear whether he would appeal. Russian human rights groups had spoken out in defense of Mr. Dmitriev, saying investigators had illegally searched his house, opened a criminal case based on an anonymous claim and subjected him to a forced psychological examination, all practices reminiscent of the Stalinist past that Mr. Dmitriev had dedicated his life to exposing. "
300,"WASHINGTON — President Trump made clear on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” at Syria at any moment, telegraphing a military operation as he has previously said he would never do. But the real suspense remained — how many missiles, for how long, at what targets and to what end. The strike that Mr. Trump was preparing as retaliation for a suspected chemical attack carries all sorts of perils that worry military planners and diplomats alike. A fresh intervention in one of the most combustible battlegrounds on the planet — one already crawling with Syrian, Russian, Iranian, American, Turkish and Kurdish forces — could easily bring unintended consequences. The more expansive the strike, officials and experts said, the greater the risk of accidental casualties that could deepen the conflict with Russia or Iran. Yet a more restrained operation might not inflict enough damage on the government of President Bashar al-Assad to change his calculations. If Mr. Trump goes beyond missiles and authorizes the use of manned aircraft even from outside Syrian airspace, they face the dangers of a modern air defense system provided by Moscow. And Mr. Trump’s Twitter warning, along with the delay in acting, has given the Syrians as well as their Russian and Iranian allies days to prepare. Two Defense Department officials said the Syrian military had moved some of its key aircraft to a Russian base, assuming the Americans would be reluctant to strike there. Russian commanders have also moved some of their military forces in anticipation of American action. "
301,"Washington — Although perhaps justified by the tragic events in Syria, President Trump’s last-minute decision to skip the eighth Summit of the Americas, which begins this week in Lima, Peru, was discouraging to his Latin American and Caribbean counterparts. Most probably see it as confirmation of his continuing indifference to the region. His aggressive rhetoric and erratic policies have already roiled inter-American relations and left the hemisphere’s leaders disconcerted. Several White House decisions have been criticized as openly hostile to Latin America, including the ordering of National Guard troops to the Mexican border and the undoing of programs that now shield millions of immigrants from deportation. Particularly unnerving has been the president’s obsession with erecting a wall along the border. Also resented are the Trump administration’s threat to unilaterally rewrite international trade rules, levy protectionist tariffs and possibly scrap the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. Washington’s moves to revive the futile “war on drugs” are unwelcome. So is the renewed hard-line approach to Cuba, reversing much of President Barack Obama’s opening, which was heralded throughout the region and brought Raúl Castro to his first summit meeting three years ago. He is expected in Lima as well. With few encouraging gestures or initiatives from the White House, it is no surprise that Gallup reports only 16 percent of Latin Americans approve of Trump, a fraction of Mr. Obama’s 62 percent first-year approval. Further muddying the waters are the alarms raised by senior United States officials about China’s expanding role in the region, which have stirred unpleasant memories of a long-past era when Washington considered Latin America its “backyard.” Many in the region wonder whether the administration’s new, more hawkish foreign policy team might resurrect the Monroe Doctrine, again giving the United States self-appointed authority to intrude on the region’s sovereignty. "
302,"WASHINGTON — After two days and more than 10 hours of questioning of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, there was widespread consensus among lawmakers that social media technology — and its potential for abuse — had far outpaced Washington and that Congress should step in to close the gap. But the agreement largely ended there. For lawmakers, the calculus is tricky: They do not want to infringe on First Amendment rights or hurt Silicon Valley innovation but are also unsure how to regulate this new breed of company, which wields enormous power by collecting vast amounts of private data from billions of consumers. “While Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured,” said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “I think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.” Mr. Zuckerberg, composed but noncommittal about making any sweeping privacy changes, conceded that it was “inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.” The growing calls for regulation — and the two days of congressional hearings — were prompted by revelations that Facebook failed to protect the sensitive data of as many of 87 million users from being harvested, without their explicit permission, by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign. But lawmakers’ concerns extended beyond that breach to the business of Facebook itself, a free social network that profits by collecting data from its users and selling advertising that is informed by that data. “The American people are concerned about how Facebook protects and profits from its users’ data,” Mr. Walden said. “Does Congress need to clarify whether or not consumers own or have any real power over their online data?” "
303,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — For two days and a night, the computer science student had been huddling with his family in the basement of their apartment building as pro-government forces rained bombs down on their rebel-held Syrian town. After night fell, they heard the whirring of helicopter blades followed by the whistling sounds of objects falling from the sky. Soon, a strange smell wafted down the stairs. “People started shouting in the streets, ‘Chemicals! Chemicals!’” the student, Mohammed al-Hanash, 25, said by phone from Syria. The attack in the Syrian town of Douma on Saturday, which witnesses and medical workers said used chemical weapons, has resonated far beyond the war-scarred community’s destroyed buildings, ratcheting up tensions among world powers and threatening to escalate Syria’s multi-sided civil war. President Trump has vowed to punish not only President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for the attack, but also Syria’s Russian and Iranian allies. On Wednesday, a Russian official said that any American missiles fired at Syria would be shot down, and Mr. Trump responded in a tweet that Russia should “get ready” for missiles that would be “nice and new and ‘smart.’” "
304,"PHOENIX — In 2016, Wisconsin turned red for Donald Trump but Paul Ryan’s Janesville remained stubbornly blue — so perhaps it is no surprise that the speaker of the House won’t seek re-election. For Republicans, this is an unalloyed good. For his entire career, Mr. Ryan has been the wunderkind who couldn’t deliver. As the No. 2 on the Romney ticket in 2012, he was supposed to add youth, depth and a key that would unlock coveted Midwestern electoral votes. He didn’t do that, either. It required the New Yorker Donald Trump to pick that lock. This didn’t worry Mr. Ryan’s many supporters among the Republican ruling class. Congress, they assured us, was his natural habitat. In 2015, his reputation for policy-oriented nerdiness got him the chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, where he was supposed to reform the nation’s entire fiscal regime with a superhuman knowledge of both the details and the substance of the nation’s finances. He didn’t. Undaunted, Mr. Ryan took the speaker’s chair later that year after playing Hamlet and claiming implausibly that he didn’t want the job and would accept it only if Republicans thrust it upon him. He promised fidelity to the conservative catechism and a return to budget sanity, but he didn’t follow through. His fecklessness led the Tea Party base that had swept him and his colleagues to power to grow even more disenchanted with the Republican congressional leadership. For seven years, the leadership raised countless millions of dollars and won first the House, then the Senate, and finally the presidency, in part by promising to repeal Obamacare. Nothing was more central to Republican identity between 2010 and the rise of President Trump. But when given the chance, Mr. Ryan couldn’t get the House to pass repeal. The bill the House finally sent to the Senate wasn’t a repeal but a dilution. It never became law, either. Likewise, Mr. Ryan, a longtime budget hawk, was incapable of returning the House budget process to regular order. And rather than reducing spending and the deficit, he increased both. Worse, Mr. Ryan is at odds with the president and a majority in his party on immigration and border control. The bill for those contradictions and failures has finally come due. "
305,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s fusillade of tweets about Syria, Russia and China this week set a new standard for contradictory and inconsistent positions in Mr. Trump’s approach to war, trade and relations with adversaries. The president promised never to telegraph military action against an enemy, yet all but showcased a coming missile strike on Syria. He threatened Russia and called its relations with the United States worse than during the Cold War, yet blamed the ill will not on Moscow but on the special counsel investigation. He praised President Xi Jinping of China for his “enlightenment” on trade in a highly anticipated speech, but in it Mr. Xi actually offered little to change what Mr. Trump has called decades of predatory practices by Beijing. Mr. Trump might argue, like Ralph Waldo Emerson, that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” But the latest reversals and back flips were so jarring that they left foreign officials more bewildered than usual about Mr. Trump’s next moves. The tweets also appeared divorced from the administration’s policies on Russia, where the United States is expelling diplomats and imposing sanctions on cronies of President Vladimir V. Putin. They are at odds with policy on China, where the United States appears ready to escalate the confrontation over trade. They are at cross-purposes with the latest actions on Syria, where the administration is trying to cobble together a coalition before it unleashes a strike against President Bashar al-Assad for his suspected use of chemical weapons in a Damascus suburb last week. “His administration may have drafted a Russia policy through the interagency process,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia, “but Trump seems completely disconnected from it, like he seems to be on many foreign policies.” "
306,"CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — On a sun-scorched prison patio in this sprawling border town, a 23-year-old inmate calmly explained to me how he trafficked hundreds of guns a year from the United States to Mexico. He never bothered paying American citizen straw buyers to purchase the weapons for him, he said. Instead, he would go to one of the many weekend gun shows around Dallas and take advantage of the so-called gun show loophole to buy firearms from private sellers without a background check or proof of citizenship. He would drive back to Mexico with about a dozen guns hidden in refrigerators and stoves in the back of his truck, and sell the weapons in his hometown, a few hours south of the Rio Grande. His most requested weapon, he told me, was the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which he could buy for as little as $500 and sell for five times that. He became richer than he had dreamed, buying a house and new trucks and motorbikes. “At the beginning I felt bad, but you get used to it,” he said. “It’s the way you can have a good time. You sell weapons, you earn money and you have fun.” He got caught only because his cousin informed on him after an argument, he said, and he is now serving a nine-year sentence. Guns from America inundate Mexico, arming the brutal cartels that have drowned this country in blood, destroyed families and driven people from their homes. Over a six-year period, the Justice Department traced more than 74,500 firearms seized from criminals here to the United States, where they were either manufactured or sold on after being imported from other countries. Many more weapons are still in the hands of cartel gunmen who commit dozens of murders every day. A 2013 study by the University of San Diego and the Igarapé Institute estimated that between 2010 and 2012, some 253,000 firearms were purchased to be trafficked over the southern border. The gaps in regulation, like the gun show loophole, make it impossible to know the true numbers. In contrast, in Mexico there is only one legal firearms shop in the entire country, run out of a military base in the capital. Buyers have to apply for permits showing at least six forms of identification, including proof they have no criminal record and a letter from their employer, and the process can take months. "
307,"When House Speaker Paul D. Ryan announced Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in November, it left Republicans with another open seat to defend in a midterm cycle that has already led to dozens of retirements. But even before Mr. Ryan’s surprise announcement, several candidates had emerged to challenge him in the race for Wisconsin’s First Congressional District, a traditionally conservative area in the southeastern corner of the state. Barack Obama carried the district in 2008, but lost it in 2012. In 2016, Donald J. Trump won it by more than 10 points. The filing deadline to run for the seat is June 1, leaving potential candidates with plenty of time to organize a campaign ahead of the Aug. 14 primaries. Here is a look at some of the candidates already running. _____ Tweeting under the handle @IronStache, Randy Bryce is a mustachioed ironworker, Army veteran and liberal media darling who has appeared frequently on cable news to criticize Mr. Ryan. "
308,"WASHINGTON — The calls were placed quietly to top American diplomats who had resigned in droves over the past year. The message: Mike Pompeo, nominated to become the next secretary of state, wanted them back. Mr. Pompeo, currently the director of the C.I.A., also telephoned Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, the last two Democrats to run the State Department. The gestures — the likes of which Rex W. Tillerson, President Trump’s first secretary of state, bypassed — were similarly well received by career diplomats in the run-up to what is expected to be a contentious confirmation hearing for Mr. Pompeo. On Thursday, Mr. Pompeo’s charm offensive will face its greatest test as he testifies in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has vowed to vote against him in part because of Mr. Pompeo’s past support for enhanced interrogation techniques that have been likened to torture. Democrats have promised to needle a nominee whom critics doubt can rally the Middle East against extremists given what they say is a record of anti-Muslim remarks and ties to anti-Islam groups. In a written opening statement filed with the committee, Mr. Pompeo promised to avoid past missteps with North Korea and said that the president hoped negotiations with European partners would sufficiently toughen the Iran nuclear pact to make it acceptable for him. “If confirmed, it will be an immediate personal priority to work with those partners to see if such a fix is achievable,” he said. Negotiators from Europe have been working with their United States counterparts on such an agreement since Tuesday at the State Department, their fourth such conclave. "
309,"President Trump has long had ties to the nation’s major media players. But his connections with the country’s largest tabloid publisher, American Media Inc., run deeper than most. A former top executive of Mr. Trump’s casino business sits on A.M.I.’s four-member board of directors, and an adviser joined the media company after the election. The company’s chairman, David J. Pecker, is a close friend of the president’s. And in the Trump era, A.M.I.’s flagship tabloid, The National Enquirer, has taken a decidedly political turn, regularly devoting covers to the president’s triumphs and travails with articles headlined “Trump’s Plan For World Peace!” and “Proof! FBI Plot to Impeach Trump!” Since the early stages of his campaign in 2015, Mr. Trump, his lawyer Michael D. Cohen and Mr. Pecker have strategized about protecting him and lashing out at his political enemies. Now the tabloid company has been drawn into a sweeping federal investigation of Mr. Cohen’s activities, including efforts to head off potentially damaging stories about Mr. Trump during his run for the White House. In one instance, The Enquirer bought but did not publish a story about an alleged extramarital relationship years earlier with the presidential candidate, an unusual decision for a scandal sheet. "
310,"Tom Ingersoll, a longtime satellite entrepreneur, admits being startled by a call he received last year: A nonprofit foundation wanted to build a satellite and launch it into orbit to help fight climate change. “I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of crazy.’” In February, he signed on as the project’s manager, after having taken a long look at the technologies required. “It’s hard, but we could probably pull it off,” he said. Now the rest of the world can decide for itself. On Wednesday, Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund, announced plans for MethaneSAT, an orbital eye in the sky that could monitor industrial methane leaks all over the planet. Methane remains one of the thorniest climate problems. It is the major component of natural gas, which produces half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned to run electric plants. But when methane leaks, it is a potent greenhouse gas that traps more than 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. By some estimates, human-caused emissions of methane are thought to be responsible for about a quarter of the warming being experienced today. But figuring out where methane emissions are coming from is a major challenge. The colorless, odorless gas has proved difficult to measure at the source of leaks without nearby access to the sites. Early attempts by the Environmental Protection Agency to determine the scope of the problem significantly underestimated emissions. Methane leaks are relatively inexpensive to fix, and stopping leaks allows energy companies to sell more gas. The International Energy Agency has estimated that as much as 50 percent of the 84 million tons of methane emitted by the oil and gas industry every year — from leaky wells and pipes and other causes — “can be mitigated at no net cost, because the value of the captured methane could cover the abatement measures.” "

312,"Well, Paul Ryan, you’re a free man now — at least, much freer than you were before you announced on Wednesday that you’d be stepping down as House speaker and departing Congress in January. What an opportunity you have to serve the country and to demonstrate, despite all the ground you’ve created for eye-rolling, that you care about something more than short-term partisan advantage. Have you truly been offended, as you suggested in 2016, by the bigotry and bullying of Donald Trump? Would you like to see the White House, and the Republican Party, set a higher standard? Now you have the chance to go far beyond milquetoast observations, like “he could have done better,” your less-than-withering reaction to President Trump’s claim that there were “very fine people” among the white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., who chanted, “Jews will not replace us.” You say you’ve been given assurances that the president doesn’t intend to fire law-enforcement officials who are investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. So you’re clearly worried about that possibility. Why not take steps to ensure your fellow citizens won’t have to suffer the constitutional crisis that a step like that would precipitate? You don’t have to worry anymore about weathering a primary challenger from the far right. You don’t have to truckle before a blast of presidential tweets. You can use your remaining authority and credibility with your colleagues to pass legislation to make it harder for the president to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel, and other officials at the Department of Justice. On your way out the door, on that crucial question, you still have a chance to put yourself on the right side of history. Unfortunately, the reputation you hoped to build for yourself across your nearly 20 years in Congress, as an earnest policy wonk in anguish over the federal deficit, vanished long ago beneath a flood of red ink. You talked a lot about making government more effective and efficient, but actually pushed a conventional hard-line agenda of huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and steep cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and other government programs that benefit low-income and middle-class families. The tax law you rammed through last year will blow up the deficit by more than $1.85 trillion over the next decade. All that debt is part of your legacy. Too late to fix that. "
313,"WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Board policymakers raised concerns at their March meeting about the prospect of the United States heading into a global trade war, zeroing in on potential harm to American farmers such a clash would cause, according to minutes of the meeting released by the Fed on Wednesday. The officials also expressed uncertainty about how newly enacted tax cuts would affect the economy, partly because the cuts are expected to exacerbate the swelling of federal budget deficits, and because some of the cuts are to expire in the years ahead. Policymakers also expressed unanimous, increased confidence in the strength of the country’s economic recovery, even accounting for trade and tax uncertainties. The minutes of the meeting, on March 20 and 21, provide more detail into the concerns being raised by the farm industry about the potential domestic impact of President Trump’s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum. “Participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook,” the minutes read, “but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retaliation.” Fed policymakers also said at the meeting that they expected the combination of the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump last year and a bipartisan congressional deal this year to increase federal spending to give economic output “a significant boost” in the next few years. However, the minutes reflect officials’ uncertainty about how big that boost might be, and when it might come, because there is little historical precedent for such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low. The minutes also show that policymakers “suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.” "
314,"That the questioning of Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday by two full Senate committees was considered a triumph for Mr. Zuckerberg — he made $3 billion personally as Facebook stock shot up during his testimony — shouldn’t come as a surprise. This was an unfair fight between a man who knew intimately the project being debated and a lot of people who didn’t. The occasion for his Senate hearing, and his appearance in the House on Wednesday, was a data breach that allowed a British political consulting firm working for the Trump campaign to gain access to 87 million Facebook profiles, but as the questioning unfolded Mr. Zuckerberg behaved as if he were the only competent one in the room. When Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked, “Would you agree that users should be able to access all of their information?” Mr. Zuckerberg seemed confused: “Senator, we have already a ‘download your information’ tool that allows people to see and to take out all of the information that Facebook — that they’ve put into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them. So, yes, I agree with that. We already have that.” Similarly, when Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, asked, “Are you going to go back to work on giving me a greater right to erase my data?” Mr. Zuckerberg again appeared perplexed, saying, “Senator, you can already delete all the data that’s there.” This wasn’t quite the contemptuous Jimmy Fallon character — Nick Burns, Your Company’s Computer Guy — who briefly tries to explain the problem before shouting, “Move!,” and fixing it himself. But then again Mr. Zuckerberg had the benefit of intensive politeness training. Mr. Zuckerberg has been winning these unfair fights going on 15 years now. The idea that he’s the Computer Guy and we are the helpless office workers in his way exemplifies the attitude of Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly. "
315,"STARR COUNTY, Tex. — The soldier stood on a cliff above the swift green waters of the Rio Grande, peering into the brush with binoculars, an M-4 carbine rifle at his chest, a 9-millimeter pistol in a holster low on his thigh. The rainstorm was over, but a thick layer of mud lined the bottom of his combat boots. He was one of 250 Texas National Guard troops stationed on the border with Mexico, part of President Trump’s latest plan to stanch the flow of immigrants entering the country illegally. The troops at the observation post chatted very little. They stared into the brush, took a few steps to change their position, then stared some more. Then it happened — one of the soldiers saw a raft in the river. The troops got on their radio and summoned the Border Patrol down below, fulfilling, military officials said, one of the primary missions of the National Guard’s controversial mobilization on the southern border: to observe and report. On Tuesday, the Guard allowed a group of journalists to shadow some of its troops on the border, an early look at the new deployment that follows a surge in illegal crossings into South Texas. The Department of Homeland Security said more than 37,000 people were detained in March. Though the flow of asylum seekers into Texas regularly goes up in the springtime, detentions this year were three times the levels seen in March of last year. “We’re like an extra pair of eyes and ears,” said a Texas National Guard captain, one of several positioned at two observation posts in rural Starr County in the Rio Grande Valley. Like other troops, he had been instructed by his commanders to speak anonymously; many of them live and work on the border, and there are fears that the soldiers could become potential targets for cartel-linked smugglers. "
316,"WASHINGTON — Fifteen months after Republicans took full control of Washington, the man long seen as central to the party’s future is abandoning one of the most powerful jobs in the capital, imperiling the G.O.P. grip on the House and signaling that the political convulsions of the Trump era are taking a grave toll on the right months before Election Day. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s retirement announcement on Wednesday blindsided many House Republican candidates and their campaign leaders who were counting on him to lead them to victory in the November midterm elections. His decision to leave Congress at 48 sent an undeniably pessimistic message to Republicans: that stable, steady leadership is lacking in their deeply divided party as they head into a campaign season defined by the whims of President Trump. And for a White House bracing for a potential Democratic impeachment inquiry, the ominous impact of Mr. Ryan’s retirement was unmistakable. He has made it more difficult to stave off Democrats’ taking control of the House, where Republicans currently hold a 23-seat majority. As many as 50 House Republican seats are at risk in competitive races this year. Private polling indicates that Mr. Trump’s approval rating is well below 40 percent in some of those tossup districts, the sort of low political standing that often dooms candidates of the president’s party. “This is the nightmare scenario,” said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican. “Everybody figured he’d just hang in there till after the election.” "
317,"Social media lives and dies on engagement. You serve your audiences such provocative content — news, political hot takes, baby pictures — that they keep their eyes on you as long as possible. When Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, showed up in Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, he seemed to be aiming for disengagement. Facing a grilling over data breaches and Facebook’s role in foreign interference in the 2016 election, he was interested in keeping the provocation, and thus the attention, to a minimum. If the byword of platforms like Facebook is “stickiness,” Mr. Zuckerberg’s prepared, bland affect achieved the opposite. He was so unsticky, the questions slid right off him. Washington had been prepared for a showdown since the revelations that tens of millions of users had their data “scraped” by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The major broadcast and cable news networks carried the hearing live. Mr. Zuckerberg took his seat Tuesday facing a sea of snapping cameras, a handy if heavy-handed metaphor for the invasion of privacy. But Mr. Zuckerberg had no interest in providing a show. He was apologetic. He was soft-spoken. Even his clothing was deferential. He ditched his Silicon Valley T-shirts for a suit the color of the Facebook logo banner and a tie the shade of the Like button. He came prepared with stock answers: “Senator, that’s a great question”; “I’ll have my team get back to you.” (That team is going to be busy.) He repeatedly alluded to having begun Facebook in his dorm room at Harvard, framing the company as a bootstrap success story rather than a global supra-state with a population larger than any country’s.

318,"To the Editor: Your April 11 editorial “The Law Is Coming, Mr. Trump” was brilliant. The problem is nobody cares. Nobody cares how he does business and the kinds of people he surrounds himself with. Nobody cares about his prevarications, his hypocrisy, his misogyny, his illiteracy, his rants and, most of all, his lack of a moral compass. Nobody cares. Not Congress, not the evangelicals who are eager to give him all the mulligans he needs, and certainly not his 40 percent base. The results of the Mueller investigation won’t matter. President Trump will never be impeached, and all of his minions currently under investigation will be pardoned. The only way to contain Mr. Trump until 2020 is to elect a veto-proof Democratic Congress in 2018.

319,"The F.B.I. agents who raided the office and hotel of President Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, were seeking details on his relationship with the Trump campaign and his efforts to suppress negative information about Mr. Trump, according to three people briefed on the matter. Prosecutors are interested in whether Mr. Cohen, who had no official role in the 2016 campaign, coordinated with it to quash the release of anything detrimental to it and whether that violated campaign finance laws — a new front in the investigation into Mr. Cohen. The warrant executed Monday by the agents was striking in its breadth, according to those people. It demanded documents related to the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Mr. Trump was heard making vulgar comments about women, and to other materials related to secret agreements Mr. Cohen made with women in exchange for them not speaking publicly about sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. The warrant also covered emails and other documents that could reveal Mr. Cohen’s private communications with Mr. Trump during a tense period in the presidential campaign when Mr. Trump confronted the possibility of embarrassing details of his extramarital affairs. And it delved deeply into Mr. Cohen’s past, including documents about Mr. Cohen’s personal and business finances, including his work as a New York taxi fleet manager. The additional details the agents were seeking came a day after it was revealed that the authorities sought documents from Mr. Cohen related to payments made to two women who claim they had affairs with Mr. Trump, Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star known as Stormy Daniels, as well as information on the role of the publisher of The National Enquirer in silencing the women. The investigation is being run by Robert S. Khuzami, whose boss, Geoffrey S. Berman, the interim United States attorney in Manhattan, has recused himself. Mr. Khuzami is a veteran federal prosecutor who spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention in support of President George W. Bush and later led the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration. "
320,"To the Editor: Re “For G.O.P., Threat of Impeachment May Spur Voters” (front page, April 9): It is particularly disappointing that in the campaign for the November elections, the G.O.P.’s strategy will be the scare tactic of possible impeachment of the president should the Democrats win the House. Have they nothing else to present to the electorate? Like plans and ideas for the real problems and issues facing the country? That the G.O.P. and its supporters will be using words such as “coup” reveals their fear of having genuine and substantive discussions regarding policies and programs. RICHARD ANDRESEN, LOLETA, CALIF. To the Editor: Many Republicans, both right-wing and moderate, are totally disgusted with President Trump and would much prefer the true ideologue, Mike Pence, as their president. I suspect they are kneeling in prayer for impeachment and conviction. They may be so upset that they could hold their noses to vote Democratic and for possible impeachment. Conversely, there are many Democratic voters, especially on the left, who fear a purely ideological right-wing Pence presidency to the point of joining Republicans in opposing impeachment. This would militate against Republican fears of losing their president, and makes the possibility of Democrats taking Congress more probable. Go figure. JOSEPH GIUSTRA, NEW YORK To the Editor: The argument that we need more proof before pressing for impeachment proceedings against President Trump belies the facts. We already have overwhelming evidence that the president has committed impeachable offenses, including obstruction of justice; violations of the anti-corruption provisions of the Constitution (the emoluments clauses); abuse of the pardon power; undermining the freedom of the press; recklessly threatening nuclear war against foreign nations; directing or seeking to direct law enforcement, including the Department of Justice and the F.B.I., to prosecute political adversaries for improper purposes; and giving aid and comfort to white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Whether the president was directly involved in a conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere with the 2016 election remains the subject of Robert Mueller’s investigation. But we do not need to wait for the outcome of that criminal investigation before moving forward with an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives on whether the president has committed crimes against the state: abuse of power and abuse of the public trust. Our Constitution is facing one of its greatest tests. We must rise to defend it, using the power of the impeachment clause to confront the unprecedented corruption of the presidency. That starts with the launch of an impeachment investigation of Mr. Trump. JOHN C. BONIFAZ
BEN T. CLEMENTS The writers are, respectively, the president and chairman of Free Speech for People. To the Editor: The vehicle for removing Donald Trump from office should be an election, not an impeachment. Although the latter may satisfy the emotional needs of some, a defeat at the polls will be definitive, dispositive and, for the vast majority of rational Americans, whether Democrats or Republicans, unarguable.

321,"To the Editor: Re “Wary Lawmakers Question Facebook’s Founder” (front page, April 11) and “Data Mining Scandal Deals Blow to Clout of Billionaire Donors” (news article, April 11): While Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg deserve the grilling they are getting on the Hill, I find it amazing that Robert and Rebekah Mercer and their control of Cambridge Analytica are not getting the same treatment. There are laws about how much money individuals can donate to candidates. If the Mercers are behind this incredible abuse of information gathering, done solely to sway an election, then why are they not being called on the carpet just as dramatically? Facebook users know full well that letting it all hang out on social media is a risk. Whether they pay attention to the ads that strategically bombard them each day is up to them. However, it only took changing the minds of some 77,000 voters in three states to elect Donald Trump. It might not have been illegal, but bringing people like the Mercers before Congress to explain their motives would be very instructive to the voting public. ARLENE RUBIN, NEW YORK "
322,"TEHRAN — All this week panicked Iranians have gathered in throngs outside banks and other financial businesses hoping to buy dollars, as the government seeks to head off a collapse in the rial, the national currency. But they have met with nothing but frustration, told there were no dollars or other currencies for them to buy at the official government rate. In an effort to stop the run on foreign exchange, the government has forbidden anyone from holding more than the equivalent of $10,000 in dollars or euros, which account for most of the foreign exchange in Iran. Long on a downward path, the rial plunged this week, losing 35 percent of its value against the dollar and hitting what has been widely described as a record low. The government is seeking to impose an exchange rate of 42,000 to the dollar, but in Tehran’s black-market exchanges this week the going rate was 60,000. When President Hassan Rouhani took office in 2013, the rate was 36,000. In an effort to squelch currency speculation, the government sent riot police into the bazaars on Wednesday, where they arrested several money changers. One senior cleric, Ayatollah Nasser Makarem-Shirazi, said that some money changers ought to be executed to set an example. However, many of those changing money in the bazaars were ordinary people seeking to protect themselves against rising prices and fearful of further declines in the currency. "
323,"BOAO, China — The International Monetary Fund chief praised his openness. A senior British banker lauded his authoritarian rule. The Philippine president said he loves the man. President Xi Jinping of China took center stage at his country’s annual Boao Forum for Asia this week to the welcoming arms of many in the global elite. He portrayed himself as a champion of free trade and world order, speaking to a group that included Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary general of the United Nations, and Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the World Trade Organization, and his words helped move markets around the world. The forum, held every year on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, has long been a platform for China to portray itself as an economic powerhouse and regional leader. But this year’s meetings took on an elevated role, as a platform for Beijing, a result of a growing trade dispute between China and the United States. It was an opportunity for Mr. Xi to present himself as a foil to President Trump, who has rejected globalization and  focused on an “America First policy,” targeting China, in particular, with a series of protectionist moves. Plaudits from foreign leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, as well as leading figures of the economic and diplomatic world, have helped to cement this image. “I congratulate you, Xi Jinping, for this new life that you have identified, for the openness that you have celebrated and advocated,” Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech, “for the innovation and inclusiveness that you have encouraged.” "
324,"BRUSSELS — Virtually no one in Europe wants President Trump to plunge headlong into a trade war with China. But nearly everyone thinks that it is time to stand up to China’s closed markets and trade manipulation. The European Union may not like Mr. Trump or the way he is doing things — but that does not mean it dislikes his aims when it comes to trading with China. But Europe would also like the conflict to go away, fearing the bloc will be caught between the United States, its primary market and second-largest supplier, and China, its primary supplier and second-largest market. The way to make that happen, it believes, is challenging China through negotiations within the existing trading system, avoiding a degenerative tit-for-tat battle that could harm Europe’s relatively vibrant economy. “When Trump was elected, a lot of Europeans wondered whether there will be a point where we have to decide between the U.S. and China, and it seems that moment may be now,” said Angela Stanzel, a China expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. “I don’t think Europe will side with China — we have the same problems with China as the Americans do,” she said. “But the E.U. does agree with the Chinese that Trump is doing it the wrong way and has been outspokenly critical about his methods. A trade war between the U.S. and China would really put Europe on the spot.” "
325,"WASHINGTON — A former American intelligence official who came under intense scrutiny during a stint at the White House last year is returning to government as the national security adviser to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to a person familiar with the decision. The official, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, will play an important role at the Justice Department, advising Mr. Sessions on counterintelligence and counterterrorism. Mr. Cohen-Watnick is known to be hawkish on Russia and China, believing the intelligence community needs to take a more aggressive approach in countering their activities. Both countries conduct wide-ranging espionage in the United States that targets commercial and government secrets. Mr. Sessions is broadly viewed in the Justice Department as lacking expertise in the area. The Justice Department declined to comment. Mr. Cohen-Watnick, 31, served briefly at the start of the Trump administration as the senior director for intelligence for the National Security Council, overseeing covert action and other intelligence programs. He was brought on by Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser. But some former officials criticized Mr. Cohen-Watnick, a former clandestine officer in the Defense Intelligence Agency, as too young for the job, which is usually filled by C.I.A. veterans. Mr. Cohen-Watnick was ousted in August 2017 as part of changes in the White House, one of several appointees of Mr. Flynn who were removed by his replacement, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. National Security Council aides usually draw little public scrutiny, but Mr. Cohen-Watnick was swept up in the tumult of early 2017 when Mr. Trump accused the previous administration, without evidence, of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower. Mr. Trump’s allegations were bolstered by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who said he had evidence that Mr. Trump’s communications were incidentally swept up in surveillance of foreigners by American spy agencies. Mr. Nunes did not divulge the sources of this information, but American officials later told The New York Times that Mr. Cohen-Watnick, at the instruction of two senior White House officials, helped print intelligence reports that later served as Mr. Nunes’s proof. The revelation showed that Mr. Nunes and one of the aides, Michael Ellis, a lawyer in the White House Counsel’s Office, were using intelligence to advance political goals. It also undercut Mr. Nunes’s claims that his information came from whistle-blowers, and revealed that he was eager to aid the Trump administration when he was conducting what was supposed to be an independent investigation of Russian election meddling. Mr. Cohen-Watnick did not provide the intelligence reports to Mr. Nunes. The episode prompted Mr. Nunes to recuse himself from the committee’s inquiry, which devolved into partisan bickering and has effectively ended. "
326,"MOSCOW — Compared to the sunny, palm-lined offshore tax havens where Russians typically stash their fortunes — think the British Virgin Islands or Cyprus — two chilly, windswept Russian islands would seem to offer little. Yet October Island, a glorified swamp in Russia’s European exclave of Kaliningrad, and Russian Island, a former cow pasture facing the far eastern port of Vladivostok, were highlighted by Moscow this week as potential alternatives. Washington’s imposition of unexpectedly tough sanctions against several leading oligarchs is in many respects a game changer for Russia, with repercussions that are only slowly coming into view. Establishing tax havens within the country was just one reaction by the Kremlin, seemingly caught off guard as aftershocks rippled through currency and financial markets. “Russia has no strategy on how to react to this situation, to these new economic circumstances,” Evgeny Gontmakher, a prominent opposition economist, said. The most immediate effect is being felt by Oleg V. Deripaska and his aluminum giant, Rusal, which has lost about one-third of its value on the Moscow stock exchange. “This is a new stage,” Mr. Gontmakher said. “This is targeting for isolation a very big, export-oriented company. That is very painful.” The ramifications could also be felt by wealthy Russians in London, as Washington warned British banks on Tuesday that they could face severe penalties if they continued dealings with any of 24 Russians named in the sanctions, including seven oligarchs. "
327,"President Trump resembles a Geiger counter: When he emits increasing howls, he is signaling that we’re approaching some radioactive or explosive truth. Trump is said to be near a “meltdown” in his fury at what he describes as “an attack on our country” — by which he means the ongoing criminal investigation of him. It’s a phrase that he has not used about Russia’s interference with our elections, and my guess is that at some point Trump will fire Robert Mueller, directly or indirectly, or curb his investigation. Republicans and Democrats alike are pleading with Trump, begging, for the good of the country: Don’t go there. This is larger than Trump. It is a struggle for the idea of equality before the law. In a narrow sense, firing Mueller might be good for Democrats in November. A Quinnipiac poll this month found that Americans by a 69-percent-to-13-percent majority oppose the firing of Mueller. Even Republicans say by more than a two-to-one ratio that Trump shouldn’t fire Mueller. [While I have you here, I wanted to remind you that you can sign up for my twice-weekly newsletter here.] It may be that Republicans in Congress would get over their indignation, form a protective circle and try to move on, for that’s what has happened every time Trump has committed some new outrage. So I’m not so sure that “it would be suicide” to fire Mueller, as Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, suggested. But even if it wouldn’t quite be suicide, it would be immensely damaging to the entire country. "
328,"JANESVILLE, Wis. — Not everybody in this quiet, blue-collar city cares much for Paul D. Ryan. But he is undoubtedly of this place, a product of Janesville schools, first elected to Congress from here at only 28 years old. As speaker of the House, he is known as one of the most powerful people in American politics — and also the resident of the red brick Georgian over on St. Lawrence Avenue. So on Wednesday, when Mr. Ryan abruptly announced that he would not run for re-election, people in Janesville said they were stunned that the man once seen as a strong presidential contender appeared to be cutting short his political career. In a place that over decades had seen the universe of manufacturing upended and the working class battered by the loss of well-paying jobs, Mr. Ryan, 48, had seemed a rare constant. Then again, reasoned both Democrats and Republicans in Janesville, who could blame him? Disappointed by the daily chaos in Washington, unnerved by a volatile and emotional president and weary of constant battles within splintering political parties, residents of Mr. Ryan’s district said they understood why he was ready to give up his seat in Congress and retreat to Janesville, the southeastern Wisconsin community where he grew up, where his family still lives and which he has represented for nearly 20 years. “Nobody can do a good job on their own,” said Mel Stankewitcz, 69, a plumber who said he had voted for Mr. Ryan. “I don’t think anyone in Washington is doing what they’re supposed to be doing. They just yell at each other.” Mr. Ryan’s surprise announcement comes in a year of wild and unpredictable political races in Wisconsin, and instantly sent the election in the state’s First Congressional District into turmoil. Republicans set off on a furious scramble for a candidate to replace Mr. Ryan on the ticket in a district that could conceivably swing to Democrats. "
329,"The Trump administration has always seen Obamacare as an abominable roadblock to the less regulated insurance market it prefers. Last year, it tried to knock it down and failed. Now, it’s building a set of detours. More customers who want to avoid buying health insurance can now find a way out of the law’s individual-mandate penalty, which will disappear completely next year. Those who want skimpy plans not covering maternity care or bills exceeding a set annual amount may soon have that option in many states — provided they don’t have pre-existing conditions. The downside: Many who do want Obamacare-style coverage are going to have to pay more. Obamacare’s many rules about insurance — meant to make coverage accessible to Americans regardless of their health status, and comprehensive enough to cover their needs — still exist. Obamacare plans will still have to cover a basic set of health benefits and accept customers who have a history of illness. But, through a series of regulatory maneuvers, the Trump administration is making the insurance market governed by those rules increasingly optional. Alongside the Obamacare market it couldn’t destroy, it is helping to build a second market, free of many rules, and more like the market that Obamacare replaced. On Monday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces, unveiled a series of policies that Seema Verma, the agency’s administrator, made clear were aimed at working around the health law’s requirements. “Americans shouldn’t be punished by its failure to provide choices,” she said, referring to the Affordable Care Act. “Until the law changes, we won’t stand idly by as Americans suffer.” Rules and other guidance released Monday provide some ways out. People who live in a county where only one insurer offers Obamacare-compliant health plans now can get an exemption to the law’s individual mandate penalties right away. (They’ll go away for everyone next year under legislation passed as part of the tax overhaul.) The administration is allowing older plans that predated Obamacare and that don’t follow all its rules to stick around another year. It’s also allowing health plans to cover a slightly less robust set of benefits, although those changes are mostly marginal. "
330,"Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg — or perhaps more accurately, members of his staff —  are going to be very busy getting through a stack of homework.   Over two days of congressional hearings this week in which Mr. Zuckerberg was barraged with questions by lawmakers over data privacy, election interference and more, the 33-year-old billionaire was often not able to provide an immediate answer. His standard response in those situations, a variation of “my team will get back to you,” was repeated so often it became an internet meme. Here are all the things that Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to getting back to Congress on. Yes, it’s a long list. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Mr. Grassley on whether his team finds any new examples in which user data was improperly transferred to a third party in breach of Facebook’s terms of service. He also said he would get back to Mr. Grassley on how many outside developers his team has audited to make sure they are following Facebook’s rules. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would follow up with Ms. Feinstein on the exact number of fake accounts Facebook has removed from the social network. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Ms. Cantwell on whether Facebook employees ever worked with Cambridge Analytica to help the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. "
331,"WASHINGTON — Paul D. Ryan took the helm of the House two and a half years ago, not because he wanted it, but because he was seen as the only lawmaker who could keep Republicans from devouring themselves. They had shut down the government, nearly precipitated a debt crisis and toppled a speaker, John A. Boehner. Mr. Ryan announced his departure on Wednesday with the gaps in the party as evident as ever, but drawn along new fault lines, with nativists and populists following the lead of President Trump, pitted against what remains of Mr. Ryan’s brand of traditional conservatism. The speaker, who once dreamed of a more inclusive party, open to black, Latino and immigrant voters enticed by a youthful, optimistic vision, was being left behind. “I think he’s tired,” said Newt Gingrich, who was driven from his own speakership in 1998. “It’s a combination of dealing with 240 House Republicans, the United States Senate and President Trump. That trio was about enough.” Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker in more than 100 years when he took the job in 2015, and he has managed to maintain an uneasy peace within his fractious conference, an achievement unto itself. He will leave Congress in January satisfied that he fulfilled a career-long dream: passage of a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s tax laws. "

333,"I live in one of those old towns that was not built for cars. Its Main Street is narrow, hedged in with historic stone houses and walls. As commuter traffic has intensified over the past several years, it’s become increasingly dangerous to walk along Main Street. The mayor of my tiny Virginia town has worked incessantly to fix this, by fostering walkability and traffic-calming measures since he ran for town council in the 1990s. I’m determined to help him: I want to walk with my daughter to the playground or the farmer’s market without fearing for her safety. Our mayor is liberal. He drives around town with an Obama ’08 bumper sticker on his car. I am a conservative, pro-life Christian; in 2016, I voted for Evan McMullin for president. But our partisan political differences mean nothing when it comes to caring for this town and making it better. Here at the local level, our interests intertwine: They are practical, achievable, even apolitical. This is localism, a bottom-up, practically oriented way of looking at today’s biggest policy dilemmas. Instead of always or only seeking to fix municipal issues through national policy, localism suggests that communities can and should find solutions to their own particular problems, within their own particular contexts. The best walkability solutions for Washington, D.C., may not work in my town. Urban revitalization efforts in Detroit will need to look different than those efforts employed in rural Iowa. If we’re to find hope and unity for our politics in this fractured era, localism may be the perfect place to start. It hands ownership and power back to those who are most likely to feel hollowed out and powerless in the face of federal stasis. As the Brookings Institution fellows Bruce Katz and Jeremy Nowak write in their new book “The New Localism,” this approach empowers postindustrial cities and dying towns to fix their problems from within, without federal bureaucracy or funds.

335,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to vote in the coming weeks on bipartisan legislation introduced Wednesday that would allow special counsels like Robert S. Mueller III to appeal their firing to a panel of judges and possibly be reinstated. The committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, was seeking expedited consideration of the bill that would have allowed for a vote as soon as next week. That pace was slowed somewhat by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, his Democratic counterpart, who said the committee needed another week to review an amendment Mr. Grassley planned to offer. The chairman’s request came as many Republicans continue to say that no legislative action is necessary, despite continuing threats from President Trump against Mr. Mueller and senior Justice Department officials. Republican leaders have steadfastly maintained that Mr. Trump knows the consequences of firing Mr. Mueller too well to do so. But Republicans are under pressure to shift their stance. Even if the legislation never passes Congress, a bipartisan committee vote would send a signal to Mr. Trump and push Republican leaders to respond. The compromise bill, written by Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans, and Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both Democrats, would enact a statute codifying an existing Justice Department regulation that says a special counsel may be fired only by the attorney general, and only for good cause, like misconduct. The bill also creates a 10-day window within which a special counsel can seek judicial review of the firing. If it is determined that the special counsel was not, in fact, fired for good cause, then he would be reinstated. In the interim, it would ensure that the special counsel’s staff and investigative materials are preserved. "

337,"When Scott Pruitt wanted to refashion the Environmental Protection Agency’s “challenge coin” — a type of souvenir medallion with military origins that has become a status symbol among civilians — he proposed an unusual design: Make it bigger, and delete the E.P.A. logo. Mr. Pruitt instead wanted the coin to feature some combination of symbols more reflective of himself and the Trump administration. Among the possibilities: a buffalo, to evoke Mr. Pruitt’s home state, Oklahoma, and a Bible verse to reflect his faith. Other ideas included using the Great Seal of the United States — a design similar to the presidential seal — and putting Mr. Pruitt’s name around the rim in large letters, according to Ronald Slotkin, a career E.P.A. employee who retired this year, and two people familiar with the proposals who asked to remain anonymous because they said they feared retribution. Many agencies have challenge coins to hand out as gifts to employees or guests. The name comes from a military tradition of carrying a coin stamped with an insignia to prove one’s affiliation, if challenged. Mr. Pruitt’s numismatic preferences, laid out last year during his first few months at the agency, raised concerns among senior agency officials, according to Mr. Slotkin and the others. Over the course of several months of discussions, they said, staff members expressed worries that his proposals would cost too much, and that dropping the agency’s seal — a stylized flower — would be a breach of protocol. They urged Mr. Pruitt to consider more modest designs and to drop his objection to the seal. Mr. Slotkin said the proposals appeared to refashion the coin into a keepsake embodying Mr. Pruitt, as opposed to the E.P.A. "

340,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has proposed a redesign of the agency’s commemorative coin, an adaptation of longstanding “challenge coins” exchanged among American troops. From a military drinking tradition to civilian government agencies, here is how the coins have evolved and proliferated. Military commanders often give pocket-size medallions, called challenge coins, to service members as a mark of camaraderie. A commander’s unique coin — often copper, bronze or nickel — carries symbols and mottos denoting the unit or office. Coins are usually circular, but also can be pentagons, spades or even dog tags to be worn around the neck. Throughout their service, military members use the coins to prove their allegiance when challenged. High-ranking officers and retirees often display a collection of coins in their offices alongside uniform patches and ribbons as a symbol of pride. “In the military, the coins have always been purely about morale and commitment,” said Tracy English, a historian at the Air Force’s 37th Training Wing at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas. “If you walk into a high-ranking service member’s office with a big magnet, chances are you will die.” Challenge coins were never officially sanctioned, so the history behind the tradition is widely debated among military historians.

343,"The latest salvo in the seven-year war in Syria, an apparent chemical attack in the suburb of Douma at dusk on Saturday, has presented a new challenge to a Trump administration that has vowed to strongly respond. But much is still unclear or unconfirmed about the attack, including what action the United States will take and what impact it will have on relationships with allies and adversaries. Syrian government forces prevent access to Douma for journalists, aid workers and investigators. Here’s a brief look at what we know so far, and what remains to be seen as of Wednesday. • About 500 people in Douma, a suburb of Damascus, had symptoms consistent with a chemical attack: burning eyes, breathing problems and white foam coming from their mouths and nostrils, according to several independent medical and rescue groups. • Residents said they heard objects falling from the sky, followed by a strange smell that witnesses said resembled chlorine. • About 70 people died while sheltering in basements, the World Health Organization said. Of them, 43 had signs of being exposed to “highly toxic chemicals.” • Videos circulated by antigovernment activists showed graphic images of families sprawled out in their homes, dead from apparent suffocation. A stream of victims rushed into clinics on Saturday, according to medical and rescue groups. "

It’s an amorphous term, redolent of Chex cereal or disco floors or cocktail bars, and not easy to define in the context of books journalism. But this week’s recommended titles offer a perfect illustration of the concept: On the surface, these eight books have little in common, but taken together they add up to a broad snapshot of life today. One novel looks at gun culture; another explores how feminism has changed over the years.

Senior Editor, Books INSEPARABLE: The Original Siamese Twins and Their Rendezvous With American History, by Yunte Huang. (Liveright, $28.95.) Yunte Huang’s new book recounts the extraordinary 19th-century lives of Chang and Eng Bunker, the original “Siamese twins.” The brothers went from the humiliations of showcased servitude all across America to a life of Southern comfort in small-town North Carolina, fathering at least 21 children between them and at one point owning as many as 32 slaves. Our critic Jennifer Szalai calls “Inseparable” a “contemplative yet engrossing” history. THE FEMALE PERSUASION, by Meg Wolitzer. (Riverhead, $28.) Of all the political threads that permeate Wolitzer’s 12th novel, the most interesting is the challenge of intergenerational feminism. The book “is speaking to the larger issue of ambition: who has it, what curtails it and what it means to reframe it,” Lena Dunham writes in the Book Review. “But when all is said and done, Wolitzer is an infinitely capable creator of human identities that are as real as the type on this page, and her love of her characters shines more brightly than any agenda.” AETHERIAL WORLDS: Stories, by Tatyana Tolstaya. Translated by Anya Migdal. (Knopf, $25.95.) Tolstaya’s remarkable short stories are all about people haunted by their flashing glimpses of shadow worlds — moments of pure transcendence when the dull plastic coating of reality peels back to reveal something vastly more precious underneath. “Tolstaya is doubly haunted by the past, both by its lostness and by its stubborn refusal to go away,” Lev Grossman writes in his review. “She is blessed, and cursed, with the mystic’s gift of seeing the shades of the departed.” RUSSIAN ROULETTE: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, by Michael Isikoff and David Corn.

Two veterans of Washington political journalism provide a thorough and riveting account of the 2016 election that casts an unfavorable light on both the Democratic and Republican campaigns.

The third season kicks off this weekend with a new co-host, Alex Wagner, who has taken over for the disgraced Mark Halperin. Too bad everything is so chill and peaceful and standardized now, and there’s nothing left for “The Circus” to cover. ‘Jane the Virgin’
When to watch: Friday, 9 p.m., the CW
Add it to your Watchlist No other show on TV can cram so many moments of real joy and deep sorrow into one episode, but that’s one of the many things that make “Jane” such a special show. (Also on that list: beautiful performances and inventive narrative formats.) In this penultimate episode of the season, Xiomara (Andrea Navedo) is undergoing chemotherapy and enduring excruciating physical pain alongside the fear and helplessness of being sick. But the episode isn’t torturous — instead, it’s a reminder that love, support, human decency and the occasional pot brownie can make even the hardest times a little easier. ‘Money Heist’
When to watch: Now, on Netflix
Add it to your Watchlist Formerly known as “La Casa de Papel,” this limited Spanish series (in Spanish with subtitles, or dubbed) has been renamed “Money Heist” for American audiences, and fair enough: It’s about a heist at the Royal Mint of Spain. A scarily brilliant mastermind who calls himself the Professor assembles a group of highly capable thieves and plans an elaborate siege designed to take place over several days, which includes essential tasks for the dozens of hostages and a vow that no one will be hurt. At 22 episodes across two seasons, it is too drawn out, but even so, it’s often as tense and exciting as early-era “Lost.” If you want a thriller with visual panache — like freaky Dalí masks — try this.

351,"What do boys in America think about being boys today? What do they imagine is expected of them? Whom do they look up to, and how are they navigating the transition from being boys to becoming men? In a 2018 Times opinion essay “The Boys Are Not All Right,” the comedian and author Michael Ian Black writes: In this unit, we explore some of the questions Mr. Black, and others, raise, and suggest ways to deconstruct definitions of masculinity as they manifest in our society and our lives. We end with suggestions for several projects students might take on to expand and reimagine what “being a man” might mean in their own lives and in our society at large. Note to teachers: This is a sensitive topic, and some of the readings, discussion questions or activities may not be suitable for your students. We hope you will tailor it to fit your needs, but we also hope you’ll tell us how and why you did that, in the comments. If you are doing a larger study of gender issues, please see the links at the bottom of this post for related lesson plans, including one on the #MeToo movement, and one, contributed by a teacher, on pronoun use in schools. _________ In 2015, Michael Kimmel, a leading scholar on masculinity and the director of the Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities, helped start the nation’s first master’s degree program in Masculinities Studies. The program, at Stony Brook University, explores what it means to be male in today’s world. "
352,"To the Editor: Re “The Tragedy of James Comey” (column, April 9): David Leonhardt gets James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in ways many Americans don’t. I never thought for a minute that Mr. Comey sought to change the outcome of the presidential election, the balance of power in the Senate and the philosophical leaning of the Supreme Court. I also have no doubt the aw-shucks Jimmy Stewart impersonator did all three — not out of partisanship or venality, but out of an unspeakably arrogant naïveté and self-absorption. Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers plummeted after Mr. Comey’s October surprise, which left her campaign virtually defenseless as F.B.I. agents reviewed her email messages. Mr. Comey’s Shakespearean-scale blunder put a sword in Mrs. Clinton’s back and led to the election of a dangerous, corrupt buffoon. Regardless of his intentions, his hubris has done our nation more lasting harm than words can capture. DAVID A. SCOTT, COLUMBUS, OHIO To the Editor: David Leonhardt fashions a fairy tale dressed up as a Greek tragedy when claiming that James Comey acted out of “hubris” in an effort to “protect his own fearless image” by speaking “truth to power” when he went public with the reasons for not charging Hillary Clinton. The motivations he attributes to Mr. Comey are utterly misplaced. I’ve known Jim Comey for over 32 years since we were law clerks together. Jim doesn’t have an arrogant bone in his body and would never put any thought of himself above his duty. As for speaking the truth, that is Jim’s nature. If the powerful happen to be in the room, they’ll hear the truth, too. The tragedy in Washington is that there are too few men and women in power who share Jim Comey’s character.

354,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, in a sharp reversal, told a gathering of farm-state lawmakers and governors on Thursday morning that the United States was looking into rejoining a multicountry trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal he pulled out of days after assuming the presidency. Mr. Trump’s reconsideration of an agreement he once denounced as a “rape of our country” caught even his closest advisers by surprise and came as his administration faces stiff pushback from Republican lawmakers, farmers and other businesses concerned that the president’s threat of tariffs and other trade barriers will hurt them economically. Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, said in an interview on Thursday with The New York Times that the request to revisit the deal was somewhat spontaneous. “This whole trade thing has exploded,” Mr. Kudlow said. “There’s no deadline. We’ll pull a team together, but we haven’t even done — I mean, it just happened a couple hours ago.” Mr. Trump’s decision to throw out the Trans-Pacific Partnership and his pledge to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement were bedrock promises of his populist campaign, which centered heavily on unfair trade practices that he said had robbed American manufacturers and workers. As he often does, the president started to change gears after hearing complaints from important constituents — in this case, Republican lawmakers who said farmers and other businesses in their states would suffer from his trade approach since they send many of their products abroad. Then late Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to shift gears again, saying in a Twitter post at 11:15 p.m. that he would consider re-entering the agreement only if it were “substantially better” than the deal offered to President Barack Obama. “We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP,” he wrote, “and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!” "

357,"To the Editor: Re “The Failures of Anti-Trumpism” (column, April 10): David Brooks is right that those who want to resist President Trump should ignore his tweet-fueled personal drama and “focus instead on the social problems that gave rise to Trumpism.” But Mr. Brooks is wrong to focus on changing the minds of confirmed Trump-supporting Republicans as a measure of success. A growing majority of Democrats, moderate Republicans and independents opposes Mr. Trump and his policies. The key to success is to unify and motivate this coalition to win the midterm elections. True believers in Mr. Trump who get their news only from Fox and their marching orders from white supremacists or the alt-right cannot be converted by argument. The forces of democracy and the rule of law must come together in a big tent to win in November to preserve our Republic, and there is no use wasting time seeking to convert the willfully blind. ERIC W. ORTS, PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: There are roughly three groups of Trump voters. The first are the people who always vote Republican. This is regrettable but normal. There are always people who vote party first. The second are people who could “never vote for Hillary.” This too is regrettable but normal. The third group are the people who voted for Mr. Trump because they felt that he 1) heard their complaints; 2) offered simple solutions to their problems; and 3) didn’t make them feel put down. Take a 50-year-old laid-off mill worker. Democrats tell him 1) his job was horrible because it polluted and is not sustainable and 2) he has to go back to school, learn a new job and start all over at the bottom of the ladder. "

360,"A HIGHER LOYALTY
Truth, Lies, and Leadership
By James Comey
290 pages. Flatiron Books. $29.99. In his absorbing new book, “A Higher Loyalty,” the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey calls the Trump presidency a “forest fire” that is doing serious damage to the country’s norms and traditions. “This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,” Comey writes. “His leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty.” Decades before he led the F.B.I.’s investigation into whether members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, Comey was a career prosecutor who helped dismantle the Gambino crime family; and he doesn’t hesitate in these pages to draw a direct analogy between the Mafia bosses he helped pack off to prison years ago and the current occupant of the Oval Office. A February 2017 meeting in the White House with Trump and then chief of staff Reince Priebus left Comey recalling his days as a federal prosecutor facing off against the Mob: “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.” An earlier visit to Trump Tower in January made Comey think about the New York Mafia social clubs he knew as a Manhattan prosecutor in the 1980s and 1990s — “The Ravenite. The Palma Boys. Café Giardino.” The central themes that Comey returns to throughout this impassioned book are the toxic consequences of lying; and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty to an individual over truth and the rule of law. Dishonesty, he writes, was central “to the entire enterprise of organized crime on both sides of the Atlantic,” and so, too, were bullying, peer pressure and groupthink — repellent traits shared by Trump and company, he suggests, and now infecting our culture. [ALSO READ: James B. Comey: By the Book] “We are experiencing a dangerous time in our country,” Comey writes, “with a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded.” "

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis took pains to walk back President Trump’s threat of an imminent strike against the Assad regime in Syria. Speaking before the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Mattis said that retaliation for a suspected chemical weapons attack on Douma had to be balanced against the threat of a wider war between Russia, Iran and the West. British and French officials were also discussing military options. We interviewed survivors of that attack and reviewed videos and flight records to verify what occurred. “It was a scene that you don’t want anyone to have to see,” said one man who heard people run into the street, yelling: “Chemicals! Chemicals!” At least 43 people were killed. ____ 2. In a stunning U-turn, President Trump asked his advisers to look into rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal he withdrew from within days of taking office. "

367,"WASHINGTON — One day after he stunned fellow Republicans by announcing his retirement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan moved on Thursday to tamp down a succession fight, throwing his weight behind his second-in-command, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. But Mr. Ryan’s surprise exit, and his pledge to remain in his office until his term expires in January, set the stage for an unpredictable — and possibly unruly — leadership battle, with the ideological direction of the conference at stake. Mr. McCarthy’s ascension is hardly assured; the last time Mr. McCarthy sought the speakership, he angered Republicans with a series of gaffes, then withdrew for lack of support from hard-line conservatives. If he stumbles again, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip, would be there to step in — and take the conference in a still more conservative direction. In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Mr. Scalise said he did not intend to challenge Mr. McCarthy. “I’ve never run against Kevin and wouldn’t run against Kevin,” he said. Mr. Ryan, addressing reporters at his regular weekly news conference, apparently picked up on Mr. Scalise’s comment — and used it to project a sense of unity. “I was encouraged that Steve Scalise this morning said that he thinks that after the election, Kevin McCarthy ought to be the person to replace me,” Mr. Ryan said. “I think that’s encouraging because what it shows you is that we have an intact leadership team that supports each other, that’s all heading in the right direction.” "

369,"WASHINGTON — With bipartisan agreement, members of Congress said this week that Silicon Valley needed to be reined in with new regulations after Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, failed to allay concerns over the company’s mishandling of user privacy. But time and again, when the most pressing issues have landed on Capitol Hill — like gun violence, school shootings, immigration and border control — Congress has declared five-alarm fires only to fail to follow through on major legislation. The current zest for new privacy laws is also likely to stall as lawmakers wrestle with the technical complexities and constitutional vexations sure to emerge with any legislation to control content on the internet. “I think we need to be careful,” cautioned Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. “I think there are a number of different ideas, but I don’t think anything has coalesced in terms of a consensus.” For the public, watching the many bursts of fireworks from Congress and the quick after-fizzle can be dizzying. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for internet regulation, warned voters not to expect much. “I hate to be such a pessimist, but I don’t believe the Republicans will end up doing anything,” he said. “I just don’t have any faith in their willingness to regulate to protect privacy in the context of Facebook.” Beyond the typical political gridlock that has stymied action in Congress, technology and the companies that sell access to it are particularly protected.

371,"We took last week off for spring break, but students all over the country were still enthusiastically commenting on our daily writing prompts. So, this week, we chose the seven that were most popular in late March and early April and rounded up our favorite responses below. But while we have you, we want to mention something we’ve noticed. Over the course of this school year, we’ve seen the writing on our prompts get better and better, and we’re thrilled. However, lately we’ve also seen more and more students, perhaps at the behest of their teachers, go even further, posting multi-part formal essays, complete with in-text citations. But unlike our contests, where we hope for that kind of formal composition, here what we prize is conversational writing in which your real voices come through — almost as if you were simply raising your hands in class to add to the conversation. Below, you can find many examples of that kind of lively informal writing, but we’d like to call out one student in particular who does a notably good job writing about hot-button issues. Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C.: We like how thoughtfully you write, how you often you acknowledge other sides, and how you always keep your side of the discussion civil. Thank you. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ “What Should Lawmakers Do About Guns and Gun Violence?” brought in the most comments of any of our prompts in the last two weeks. Below is a sampling of representative views on all sides of the issue. Dimitrios Spanos from Lincoln, N.H., said family and community have shaped his opinion: Nolan Douglas from Texas would like to see a balance struck between both sides of the gun debate: Hailey from PA thinks more guns are not the answer to gun violence: Robert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the Second Amendment is out of date: Patrick Losee from Wilmington, N.C.,wrote a two-part answer outlining proposed changes: _________ In response to our Student Opinion prompt, “How Do You Get Your Nature Fix?,” students told us their thoughts on an artificial nature “immersion room” and about their own adventures camping in the mountains of Virginia, skiing in Vermont, surfing in North Carolina and just walking in their own neighborhoods. G Wang from Fort Washington, Pa., likes the idea of a nature immersion room, but doesn’t think it comes close to an encounter with the real thing: But Monalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., loves the idea of a more sanitized nature experience: For Patrick Iammatteo Wilmington, N.C., though, being outdoors is all about getting out of his comfort zone: For some, like Jenny H. from North Carolina, you can experience certain emotions only by putting down your phone and communing with nature: Bradly Boaz from Wilmington, N.C., who learned to appreciate the outdoors as a Boy Scout, agreed: And, no matter how busy she is, Anneliese Israel from Fort Washington, Pa., always finds time to get outside: _________ In our writing prompt “Do You Vape?,” we wanted to know if vaping is a problem at your school and, if so, what could be done about it. Emily Lane Player from Hoggard High School says vaping is a major issue at her school: Charlie A from pembroke, N.H., says his school is struggling to deal with vaping, too, and thinks there is a need for harsher punishments: Rosser Baxley from Wilmington, N.C., sees stress as the major contributor to the epidemic: Emilia Cordon from Wilmington, N.C., suggested that teenagers don’t realize the risks of e-cigarettes pose to their health: But, Eason from Wilmington, N.C., had this theory as to why so many young people today are taking up vaping: So how should schools deal with this problem? Ellie Hannum from Wilmington, N.C., recommended using a variety of approaches: Jessica Brevil from Wekiva high, Apopka believes that offering therapy and education will help students make better choices: And Hayley DeArmond says that e-cigarettes need to be less accessible to teenagers: _________ Some impressively well-developed opinions came in for our Student Prompt “What Are Your Thoughts on Sports Betting?” We feature comments from both novice and seasoned sports bettors below. Benjamin Kaplan from Fort Washington, Pa., thinks daily limits for betting is a good idea: Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C., doesn’t agree with the ban: Bradly Boaz from Wilmington, N.C., became a basketball enthusiast because of bracket participation: Lucas Pichini from Upper Dublin, Pa., thinks people should be free to bet on sports: Sydney from north carolina leans toward legalizing sports betting: Jamie Prince from Philadelphia prefers legalization, and thinks brackets are a bonding activity: Tyler Rouse from “A galaxy far far away” thinks betting is fine within limits: _________ We heard some impassioned voices raised in response to our Student Opinion prompt “Do You Need a Homework Therapist?,” with most students acknowledging the benefit, and simultaneously thinking it a luxury. Alice Gerasimova from Wilmington, N.C., understands the appeal but thinks students should learn how to deal with stress on their own, if possible: Jocelyn Savard from Wilmington, N.C., raised the issue of the cost to a family for a program like this: McKenzie Ingram Wilmington, N.C., supported Jocelyn in a response: And so did Sesha Patel from Wilmington, N.C., who said: Sydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., thinks homework tutors are unnecessary: Elyssa Sanchez from Apopka, Fla., said she works with friends to make homework less stressful: __________ After learning that 75 million cells of bacteria lurk in just one square centimeter on a rubber duck, we wanted to know: “Do We Worry Too Much About Germs?” Or not enough? As a self-described germaphobe, Sesha Patel from Wilmington, N.C., is hyper-aware of potential diseases hiding everywhere: Neil Phillips from Wilmington, N.C., said he doesn’t think enough about the bacteria that could exist on everyday objects: Maddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C., also changed her opinion about germs after reading the article: Max Bergman from Wilmington, N.C., though, remained unconvinced: Nikki Tinnerello from Wilmington, N.C., thinks reports like these help us learn how to protect ourselves from potential illnesses: But Truth Jr. from NC believes they may make bacteria seem scarier than they really are: __________ Students gave their heartfelt support for teachers across the nation on our most popular Picture Prompt, “Teacher Walkouts.” McKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., used a personal anecdote to tell us why teachers should be paid more: Guadalupe C. from Caruthers, Calif., backed up her response with facts and reason: Even as a supporter of small government, Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C., agreed that teachers need to make more money: Jacqueline Rose Behringer from Wilmington, N.C., says her school sorely lacks adequate funding: Zac Gill from Wilmington, N.C., recommended voters take action at the polls: But, Hayley DeArmond sees education as a bipartisan issue: Finally, Kasey Kiser from Wilmington, N.C., challenged us to imagine a different world: _________ "
372,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Democratic primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, are poised to face their first consequential battle as early as this weekend, as they vie for one of New York’s most coveted progressive endorsements: the Working Families Party. The blessing of the small but influential coalition of labor unions and progressive activists is seen as an early test of the depth of liberal unhappiness with Mr. Cuomo and the potential energy around Ms. Nixon. The party endorsed Mr. Cuomo in both 2010 and 2014, although it did so reluctantly four years ago. The party’s convention, where a nominee will be formally chosen, is not until next month, but the 200-plus state committee members are gathering in Albany on Saturday and could jump the gun to deliver a shock endorsement, according to a half-dozen party officials. “I’m anticipating there might be a resolution that the party would endorse Cynthia Nixon,” said David Schwartz, an influential state committee member from Westchester County.

374,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has in his first year marginalized American diplomats, sought to slash the State Department’s budget and reversed crucial pieces of his predecessor’s economic and diplomatic opening to Cuba. But Mike Pompeo promised on Thursday to reverse nearly all of that if he becomes the next secretary of state. In five hours of testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director, said he was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis, still believed that the Iran nuclear deal could be saved, disagreed with the president’s assertion that poor relations with Russia had been caused by the special counsel’s investigation and, perhaps most remarkably, promised to defend gay rights around the world. He was voluble, charming and gracious, which meant he was the opposite of how he had presented himself during the 2015 Benghazi hearings, the last time he had the nation’s attention. Then, he was the scowling, scathing attack dog hounding Hillary Clinton. On Thursday, he smiled throughout the hearing, occasionally even agreeing with Democrats. “At the State Department, there are too many holes, too many vacancies, too many unfilled positions,” Mr. Pompeo said in one of his many promises to restore the department to its former glory after his predecessor, Rex W. Tillerson, pushed out hundreds of diplomats. The vow was greeted with relief by nearly all on the panel. Under persistent questioning, Mr. Pompeo said he had spoken to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. But Mr. Pompeo refused to describe what he had said, maintaining that he was at the hearing to discuss foreign policy. His testimony in both tone and substance was so different from his past statements and profile as a Tea Party congressman from Wichita, Kan., that Democrats on the committee were left puzzled and, almost despite themselves, delighted. Gone was any hint of the warmonger his critics have portrayed him as. "

377,"TEL AVIV — On Wednesday, Israel observed Yom Hashoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is one of the most important days on the country’s calendar, observed with innumerable ceremonies and gatherings. At many of these, a motto will be recited: “To remember, not to forget.” Of course, in Israel no one forgets. One reason is that in this country, the Holocaust is not merely a matter of historical remembrance. It is part of our present. Many of Israel’s founders believed the Jewish state was necessary because the Jewish people would always be under the threat of destruction, others could not be relied upon to protect the Jews, and the preservation of the Jewish people required a country of their own. Or, to put it with typical Israeli directness, “to rely only on ourselves.” In 2011, I interviewed Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister, in his Tel Aviv office, on a subject that was at the time highly classified. Four years earlier, when he was in office, the Mossad had learned that North Korea was building an atomic reactor in northern Syria to be used for making nuclear weapons. Mr. Olmert asked the United States to destroy the facility, but President George W. Bush declined. Israeli leaders took this as proof that the United States would not take serious risks to protect Israel, especially in the period after the invasion of Iraq. “So what did you do?” I asked Mr. Olmert. He pointed at a photograph on the wall behind him. It showed three Israeli F-15 fighter planes flying over the railroad tracks and gate of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. In the picture, which the commander of the Israeli Air Force had given to Mr. Olmert, he had written, “The Israeli Air Force over Auschwitz; in the name of the Jewish people, the State of Israel; to remember and not to forget; to rely only on ourselves.” “I decided to act in accordance with that rule,” Mr. Olmert told me. On the night between Sept. 5 and 6, 2007, the Israeli Air Force bombed the reactor and destroyed it. Mr. Olmert gave the order despite warnings from the C.I.A., as well as some high-ranking Israelis, that such an attack could cause President Bashar al-Assad to start a war against Israel. Last month, the Israeli military lifted the ban that had prevented Israeli media from reporting that Israel had bombed the Syria reactor; the military’s communications office even released video footage and documents related to the attack. Why now, more than 10 years later? It was intended to send a clear message: Israel would not permit the construction of military and intelligence infrastructure in Syria by Iran and Hezbollah. "

379,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, insisted on staying in luxury hotels that were costlier than allowed by government standards, while also pushing to fly on an airline not on the government’s approved list so he could accrue more frequent flier miles, one of his top former deputies at agency has told congressional investigators. The new allegations are detailed in a scathing six-page letter signed by two senators and three House lawmakers — all Democrats — whose staff members met this week with Kevin Chmielewski, who served as the E.P.A.’s deputy chief of staff until he was removed from his post after raising objections to this and other spending. In a separate letter on Thursday, Democratic lawmakers also demanded information about two previously unknown E.P.A. email addresses that have been used by Mr. Pruitt, asking if they were a tool for withholding public information from records requests. Their letter echoes a controversy in 2012, during the Obama administration, when Lisa P. Jackson, who was E.P.A. chief at the time, was criticized for a similar use of an undisclosed E.P.A. email account. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said the agency had consistently searched all email addresses associated with Mr. Pruitt when responding to records requests. Of the allegations outlined to lawmakers by Mr. Chmielewski, he said, “We will respond to members of Congress through the proper channel.” Ms. Jackson, who was President Obama’s first E.P.A. administrator, came under fire from Republican lawmakers when it was found that she used a secondary E.P.A. email address, under the name “Richard Windsor,” for government correspondence. The name was a combination of Ms. Jackson’s family dog growing up and her hometown, East Windsor Township, in New Jersey. According to Thursday’s six-page letter from lawmakers, Mr. Chmielewski told congressional staff members during a meeting this week that Mr. Pruitt would often seek to schedule trips back to Oklahoma, where he still owns a home, so he could stay there for weekends. “Find me something to do,” were the instructions Mr. Pruitt gave his staff, after telling them he wanted to travel to particular destinations, the letter says, quoting Mr. Chmielewski, who was expected to sign off on the trips.

The forces unleashed in those struggles shaped Trump’s current policies on both immigration and racial integration. Trump was born on June 14, 1946. Until he was four, he lived in a two-story mock Tudor home built by his father, Fred, just south of Grand Central Parkway in Jamaica Estates. In 1950, Donald and his family moved around the corner to a grander 23-room, 9-bathroom redbrick — also built by his father — at 85-14 Midland Parkway. “The Jamaica Estates of Mr. Trump’s boyhood was an exclusive and nearly all-white place, resistant to outsiders and largely impenetrable to minorities,” The Times reported in 2015. In fact, the 1950 census found that at that time, 96.5 percent of the 1.55 million Queens residents were white. Taken together, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 — with attendant white flight — drove the upheavals that converted Queens into one of the most diverse counties in the nation. To those who love it, it is a vital, dynamic, multicultural community of people who enrich one another’s lives in myriad ways. To Trump, residents of modern American inner cities are “living in hell.” In 1960, when Trump turned 14, there were so few Hispanics that the census did not keep count; by 1970, when Trump turned 24, 153,691, or one out of 13, Queens residents were Latino. From 1960 to 1970, the black population of Queens grew from 145,885 to 258,006. "

390,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed the Environmental Protection Agency’s second-in-command, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who not only shares the deregulatory zeal of Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. chief, but also his doubtful view of climate science. More notable, however, are the differences between the two men. Unlike Mr. Pruitt, a Washington outsider caught in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending, Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a low-key insider with years of Washington experience in the art of pursuing policy change while avoiding public distraction. Deregulation is among President Trump’s central campaign promises, and Mr. Pruitt has proposed ambitious rollbacks of rules governing clean air and water and fighting against climate change. But many of his initiatives have stumbled because of haste or imprecision, and at least six have been struck down by the courts. That makes the arrival of Mr. Wheeler’s expertise particularly consequential. In fact, on Thursday Mr. Trump also sent new marching orders to the E.P.A., directing the agency to weaken or delay implementation of a variety of air pollution regulations, several of which have been priorities for industries for which Mr. Wheeler has lobbied in the past. Among other things, the proposals would reverse an Obama-era policy of forcing federally designed pollution restriction plans on states that fail to meet national standards for reducing soot, smog, and nitrogen oxide. They would also allow states that fail to meet clean air standards not to comply with regulations if they attribute the dirtier air to pollution that drifted from Asia. Mr. Pruitt, in a statement, said, “This memorandum helps ensure that E.P.A. carries out its core mission, while reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing.” "

California Today is conducting occasional question-and-answer sessions with candidates for office, and today is Mr. Chiang’s day at the plate. The interview, edited and condensed for clarity, was done for our story on the race. Q. What do you think of how Governor Brown has done? A. Jerry and I are aligned on making sure our fiscal house is in order. We don’t want to be a poor state. We don’t want to be broke — cutting health care, giving pink slips. Q. How big a problem is homelessness in this state? A. There are tens of thousands of homeless Californians. Do we take care of the vulnerable who live in the wealthiest state? To leave people in harm’s way is not acceptable. That is why I have tried to shore up the state’s financial position so we have the resources to take care of California’s homeless. The state has to partner with local governments — which I would hope to do as governor. Q. What do you see as the biggest problems facing California? A. Education is my top priority. You can’t have the disparate outcomes that you have. This needs to be a state where every child — regardless of background, heritage — gets access to a world-class education. Q. Are you worried the state is heading into a recession? A. People are very concerned about where we are in the economic cycle. They are very concerned about President Trump. If you look at the historical pattern, you know at some point we are going to face a recession. "

396,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought on Thursday to slow down an imminent strike on Syria, reflecting mounting concerns at the Pentagon that a concerted bombing campaign could escalate into a wider conflict between Russia, Iran and the West. During a closed-door White House meeting, officials said, Mr. Mattis pushed for more evidence of President Bashar al-Assad’s role in a suspected chemical attack last weekend that would assure the world that military action was necessary. Despite the caution, two Defense Department officials predicted it would be difficult to pull back from punishing airstrikes, given President Trump’s threat on Twitter a day earlier of American missiles that “will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart.’” Mr. Mattis publicly raised the warning on Thursday morning, telling the House Armed Services Committee that retaliation must be balanced against the threat of a wider war. “We are trying to stop the murder of innocent people,” Mr. Mattis said. “But on a strategic level, it’s how do we keep this from escalating out of control — if you get my drift on that.” Hours later, after Mr. Mattis detailed his concerns at the White House, the president’s top national security advisers ended an afternoon meeting without a decision to attack, said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary.

399,"On Saturday I took my family to have a closer look at Syria. This was on the Golan Heights, from a roadside promontory overlooking the abandoned Syrian town of Quneitra. The border is very green at this time of year, a serene patchwork of orchards and grassland, and it was hard to impress on our kids that hell on earth was visible in the quiet distance. But I wanted them to see it — to know that Syria is a place, not an abstraction; that the agonies of its people are near, not far; that we should not look away. Later that day, in a suburb of Damascus, Syrian forces apparently again gassed their own people. It’s fortunate for Israel that it did not bargain the Heights away during the ill-fated peace processes of the 1990s: Had it done so, ISIS, Hezbollah or Iran might in time have trained their guns on Israeli towns below. The strategy of withdrawal-for-peace has not been vindicated in recent years, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Gaza. It’s a point Donald Trump obviously missed when he insisted last week on U.S. withdrawal from Syria, likely encouraging the apparent chemical attack he now threatens to punish. As it is, the chances of a wider and bloodier war over Syria have grown in recent days. Syrian tanks and artillery have reportedly entered the demilitarized buffer zone near the Israeli border, in brazen violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, as they prepare to sweep rebel forces from the rest of the border area. Israel did very little to deny its attack Monday on an air base used by Iran in central Syria, and Jerusalem is threatening more aggressive steps to keep Tehran from further entrenching itself militarily in its client state. The Iranians have vowed retaliation for the attack, which they are sure to make good on, probably via their proxies in Hezbollah. And tensions between Israel and Russia are at their highest point since the Cold War, in part because Israel did not notify Russia in advance of Monday’s attack. So where is the United States in all of this? As Michael Doran pointed out in an astute Times op-ed on Tuesday, Trump seems to have violated his own ostensible rules for winning in recent days. First he promised to withdraw U.S. forces, which would eliminate what little military leverage we have with Syria (and Turkey), and then he telegraphed the kind of feckless missile strike he seems intent on carrying out sometime in the coming hours or days.

401,"MOSCOW — At least one bright spot stands out in the Russian economy, even as its prospects darken in the face of escalating sanctions: the manufacture of work uniforms. The production of specialized work clothes, including bulletproof vests, is one of the lone growth areas in the economy, up by 27 percent, said Igor Nikolaev, director of the Strategic Analysis Institute at the FBK auditing and consulting firm. The comments came at an otherwise gloomy news conference Tuesday focused on Russia’s economic prospects. That statistic, amid a generally dormant economy kept afloat as usual by energy sales, seemed to underscore what many analysts are saying at the moment: President Vladimir V. Putin’s increasingly aggressive posture toward the West is producing a boomerang effect, with an isolated Russia likely to suffer long-term economic damage as a result. The deterioration reflects a growing awareness in Western capitals that Russia, growing ever more hostile, should be treated as a threat rather than a mere annoyance. That in turn is pushing them toward a unified front in challenging Moscow over such serial transgressions as destabilizing its neighbors, assassinating its critics abroad, meddling in the elections of other countries, tolerating the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government and cyberskirmishing. The confrontation is likely to only get worse, analysts say, for one main reason: Mr. Putin and his closest advisers are convinced they are justified in their policies and have persuaded important portions of the elite as well as the bulk of Russians that the country is thriving, rebuilding its global muscle rather than weakening itself. “The party of war has won within the Russian elite,” said Yuliy A. Nisnevich, a political-science professor. “There are people in the elites who would like the confrontation to stop — these are the people who would like to spend or earn money abroad. But the party of war, the people who get their money inside the country and live here, is prevalent now.” "

407,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump dispatched the C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo to North Korea to meet with its leader, Kim Jong-un, in recent weeks to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, two people briefed on the secret trip said on Tuesday. Mr. Trump alluded to Mr. Pompeo’s mission when he said on Tuesday afternoon that the United States was in direct talks with North Korea at “extremely high levels,” and that the White House was looking at five sites for a potential meeting of the two leaders. The White House has used intelligence, rather than diplomatic channels, to communicate with North Korea, ever since last month, when Mr. Trump unexpectedly accepted Mr. Kim’s invitation to meet. Mr. Pompeo, who is awaiting confirmation as secretary of state, has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to other officials. And he has been in close touch with the director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, who American officials said brokered Mr. Kim’s invitation to Mr. Trump. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump also said he would give his blessing to North and South Korea to “discuss the end of the war” when the leaders of those countries meet this month, opening the door to a peace treaty that would replace the armistice that halted the Korean War in 1953. His statements, which came as he welcomed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to his oceanfront estate here, were fresh evidence of a diplomatic thaw underway on the Korean Peninsula, and made a once-unthinkable encounter between him and Mr. Kim far more likely.

It is the most recent prosecution in a growing series of leak cases being pursued by the Justice Department, which has significantly increased its focus on such investigations since President Trump took office. However, the actions of the agent, Terry J. Albury, largely predate Mr. Trump’s presidency. As a field agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Minneapolis office, Mr. Albury provided a reporter with two documents between February 2016 and Jan. 31, 2017, according to the charges against him. The first document, dated Aug. 17, 2011, described how the bureau evaluated confidential sources; the second, which was undated, concerned “threats posed by certain individuals from a particular Middle Eastern country.” Mr. Albury also possessed, without authorization, “a document relating to the use of an online platform for recruitment by a specific terrorist group.” “Mr. Albury was entrusted by the F.B.I. with a security clearance, which included a responsibility to protect classified national defense information,” Bill Priestap, assistant director of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Division, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Instead, he knowingly disclosed that material to someone not authorized to receive it.” Mr. Albury, 39, faces up to 10 years in prison on each of the two charges, but under his plea agreement, he could receive less than five years. Judge Wilhelmina M. Wright of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota will decide his sentence. "

Across the street from the barber shop are a Haitian bakery, a Haitian church and a Haitian restaurant, Ms. Bichotte, the first Haitian-American woman elected to office in New York City, explained. People of Haitian descent make up 20 percent of the Caribbean population in Flatbush and the local Haitian parade used to pass directly in front of the barber shop. “Miami already has a Little Haiti,” Mr. Flambert, 42, a bus driver for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said as he sipped from a miniature bottle of Rhum Barbancourt. “But the Haitian presence out here is real strong. It makes sense.” Not everyone in the central Brooklyn neighborhood agrees. Last year, an area bounded by Flatbush, Church and Nostrand Avenues was designated the Little Caribbean cultural district, making a separate Haitian district redundant, some local leaders say. Ms. Bichotte says there were plans to name the area Little Haiti dating back more than a decade. Now, with momentum fueled by anger over recent slights by President Trump, prominent members of the Haitian community in Brooklyn and New York State are hoping the City Council will officially designate Little Haiti in May.

412,"Barbara Bush, wife of the 41st president and mother of the 43rd, died on Tuesday at the age of 92, prompting an outpouring of tributes and remembrances. In a statement, President Trump said that “as a wife, mother, grandmother, military spouse and former first lady, Mrs. Bush was an advocate of the American family.” On both sides of the aisle, lawmakers joined him in emphasizing Mrs. Bush’s support for literacy programs. Through the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy and other outlets, it was one of her most treasured causes. “Through her own work to promote literacy as a value in every American home, countless families now have the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in all aspects of their lives,” President Jimmy Carter said in a statement. Mrs. Bush is survived by her husband, her brother, five children, 17 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, many of whom shared tributes of their own. “My grandmother’s entire life was focused on others,” wrote George P. Bush, whose father is Jeb Bush. President George W. Bush, her son, said she was “so much more” than her public persona. “Laura, Barbara, Jenna and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was,” he wrote, referring to his wife, Laura Bush, and their two daughters. “Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end.” Many people noted the priority she placed on her family, despite her career in the public eye. “Mrs. Bush approached her public role with a class and grace seldom matched in our nation’s capital,” wrote Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, where the Bushes lived. “But it was her private role which she prized above all.” President Barack Obama, who succeeded Mr. Bush, and his wife, Michelle Obama, recalled “the generosity she showed to us throughout our time in the White House.” “We’re even more grateful for the way she lived her life — as a testament to the fact that public service is an important and noble calling,” they wrote. And President Bill Clinton, who in 1992 foiled the re-election bid of Mrs. Bush’s husband, George Bush, tweeted that she was “fierce & feisty in support of her family & friends, her country & her causes.” “I’ll always treasure my summer visits to Kennebunkport,” Mr. Clinton said in a statement. “Barbara joked that George and I spent so much time together I had become almost a member of the family, the ‘black sheep’ that had gone astray.” "

414,"WASHINGTON — After publicly flirting last week with having the United States rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Trump appeared to rebuff the idea once and for all late Tuesday. In a Twitter post at 10:49 p.m., Mr. Trump said that although Japan and South Korea would like the United States to join the 11 other nations in the multilateral trade agreement, he had no intention of doing so. The decision put an apparent end to a meandering trade policy in which Mr. Trump pulled out of the deal in his first week in office, before suggesting last week that he was having second thoughts. “Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work,” Mr. Trump wrote from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers.” The comments confounded some trade experts on Tuesday night because South Korea is not in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Trump followed up with a shot at the World Trade Organization, which he said was “bad” to the United States. The declaration comes as Mr. Trump has been in discussions with South Korea about peace talks with North Korea and as the president hosts Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Mar-a-Lago, where they are expected to discuss trade, among other issues.

417,"I came to America from India at age 23. That was in 1985, a golden age of immigration to this country. It didn’t feel like it, though, because it still took my husband, a medical physicist, and me a good seven years to trade up from our student visas for an H-1B for him and an H-4 spouse visa for me. Eventually we got the ultimate prize: green cards — which, to our amusement, weren’t even green back then. In the decades since, wait times for green cards for Indian techies have become impossibly long, with particularly unfortunate consequences for H-4 spouses who want to work. And President Trump is now poised to undo a 2015 Obama-era regulation that took a small stab at addressing their plight. An H-1B, which is primarily reserved for high-tech talent, allowed my now ex-husband to accept a job at a Detroit cancer hospital. But my H-4 barred me from working, even though I already had several years of journalism experience along with a degree in biology and chemistry. I had to wait another two years for my green card before I got the legal right to earn a living. Putting my career on hold until I was 30 was frustrating, especially since we had a baby to support. But Indian spouses on H-4s — well over 90 percent of them women — who came after me envy my experience. When I arrived, the wait times for green cards for Indian H-1Bs averaged about four years. But over the next several decades, the wait steadily grew. By 2005, it was more like 10 to 15 years. Today, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research outfit, Indian H-1Bs can expect to stand in the green card queue for several decades. This happened because in 1990, Congress imposed an annual limit on employment-based green cards that was far too low for America’s growing economy. This was on top of the overall green card cap and country-specific quotas. With the I.T. revolution taking off and Silicon Valley aggressively recruiting Indians on H-1Bs, the timing of this third blow couldn’t have been more inopportune. "

419,"Was Robert Mueller, the special counsel, complicit in one of the worst scandals in the F.B.I.’s history — the decades-long wrongful imprisonment of four men for a murder they didn’t commit? This question, which has been raised before, is being addressed again — this time by some of President Trump’s most ardent supporters on the right, especially Fox News’s Sean Hannity but also Rush Limbaugh and others. My friend Alan Dershowitz, the retired Harvard Law School professor, has also weighed in. In an April 8 interview with John Catsimatidis on his New York radio show, Mr. Dershowitz asserted that Mr. Mueller was “the guy who kept four innocent people in prison for many years in order to protect the cover of Whitey Bulger as an F.B.I. informer.” Mr. Mueller, he said, was “right at the center of it.” Mr. Bulger was a notorious crime boss in Boston, the head of the Winter Hill Gang, and also a secret source for the F.B.I. There is no evidence that the assertion is true. I was the federal judge who presided over a successful lawsuit brought against the government by two of those men and the families of the other two, who had died in prison. Based on the voluminous evidence submitted in the trial, and having written a 105-page decision awarding them $101.8 million, I can say without equivocation that Mr. Mueller, who worked in the United States attorney’s office in Boston from 1982 to 1988, including a brief stint as the acting head of the office, had no involvement in that case. He was never even mentioned. The case wasn’t about Whitey Bulger but another mobster the F.B.I. was also protecting, the hit man Joseph Barboza, who lied when he testified that the four men had killed Edward Deegan, a low-level mobster, in 1965. Mr. Barboza was covering for the real killers, and the F.B.I. went along because of his importance as an informant. But the evidence — or rather, lack of it — hasn’t stopped the piling on against Mr. Mueller, particularly by Mr. Hannity. In a March 20 broadcast, he said, “Robert Mueller was the U.S. attorney in charge while these men were rotting in prison while certain agents in the F.B.I. under Mueller covered up the truth.” "

421,"WASHINGTON — A looming trade war between the United States and China has put Qualcomm, one of America’s largest technology companies, squarely in the middle of the battlefield. A major supplier in both China and the United States, the San Diego-based chip maker has long managed to play the trading relationship between the world’s two largest economies to its advantage. But an escalating trade battle over which country will dominate the technologies of the future is now threatening Qualcomm’s business and its growth. On Monday, Qualcomm lost the ability to export semiconductors to one of its biggest customers after the United States banned Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corporation from purchasing American technology for seven years. In China, Qualcomm’s plan to acquire NXP Semiconductors, a critical part of its growth strategy, has been stalled by a prolonged antitrust review, a move critics see as Chinese retaliation for President Trump’s aggressive trade moves. On Thursday, Chinese officials said that Qualcomm will have to make more concessions to compensate for the market power it would enjoy after completing the deal, without providing details. The White House, which has already threatened tariffs on more than $150 billion in Chinese goods, is preparing new restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States and could limit American partnerships with Chinese firms abroad. Such a move could place further restraints on American companies with advanced technology, like Qualcomm, General Electric and Boeing, as they seek to form overseas partnerships. It would also likely incite more retaliation from the Chinese. On Tuesday, the administration advanced a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies, including Huawei, one of Qualcomm’s competitors and a customer, to sell their products in America. Qualcomm’s situation illustrates the perils of trying to punish a major trading partner that has become a crucial link in supply chains stretching across the globe. By targeting foreign players with ties to their own markets, the United States and China are putting their own economic futures at risk. The question is whether the Trump administration will balk at paying that price — or see its goal of punishing China for unfair trade practices as more important than any collateral damage that could ensue.

The settlement agreement, reached on Wednesday, ends a lawsuit brought by the model, Karen McDougal, and protects the president from being drawn into a legal case involving efforts to buy the silence of women who had stories to tell about him during the 2016 campaign. He still faces another lawsuit from Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Ms. Clifford is suing to get out of a deal that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, arranged in 2016 for her silence about an alleged affair. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied both women’s stories. In August 2016, A.M.I., which owns The National Enquirer, acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story about Mr. Trump — which it never ran — in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her current career as a fitness specialist. Under the terms of Wednesday’s settlement, A.M.I. has the right to up to $75,000 of the profits from any deal she makes in the next year for her story about the alleged affair. According to her lawyer, Peter K. Stris, Ms. McDougal can keep the $150,000 payment, and the publisher will retain the rights to photographs of her that it already has. In a statement, A.M.I. called the settlement an “amicable resolution” and said that under the new agreement it would devote an upcoming magazine cover and feature article to Ms. McDougal, and would run several of her fitness columns in its publications.

426,"I don’t know what will happen in the midterm elections. But if Republicans pull it out – that is, if they lose the popular vote by a small enough margin that gerrymandering and the geographic concentration of nonwhite voters frustrate the public’s will – it will be the result of tribalism. It won’t be because the G.O.P. won voters over with a tax cut. That’s not what they expected. The people who rammed through a massive tax cut without hearings or analysis thought they could sell it to voters as free money for everyone; never mind the big bucks for corporations and the wealthy, look at the extra cash we’re putting in your pocket. And history suggested that they might be right: the Bush tax cuts, like the TCJA, offered big breaks to the wealthy but only what amounted to loss leaders for the middle class. Yet as Larry Bartels famously documented in his paper “Homer gets a tax cut,” most people focused on their direct gains, and were unmoved by or unaware of the indirect implications of bigger deficits for government programs they depended on. As a result, the Bush tax cuts were popular – not hugely popular, but more people approved than disapproved, and they were probably a net electoral plus. But not this time. Polling suggests that only a minority – and probably a declining minority — of the public considers the Trump tax cut a good idea. Most people don’t see any benefits from the tax cut in their paychecks. And Republicans have pretty much given up campaigning on the tax cut. Voters are, of course, right to have negative views about TCJA. It’s a mess of a bill; it will do little for economic growth, while increased deficits will create pressure to cut social insurance programs that affect many more people than the relative handful of wealthy stockholders who will win big. But voters should have been negative about the Bush tax cut too. Why do voters seem so much more woke? Why is this time different? "
427,"Not long ago, the things Emmanuel Macron said this week would not have needed saying. Yet, addressing the European Parliament, the French president — barely 40 and not yet a year in office — sounded almost like a biblical prophet, warning of the rising fascination with antidemocratic and “illiberal” ideas, “the deadly tendency which might lead our continent to the abyss, nationalism, giving up of freedom.” Mr. Macron did not mention anyone by name — not Viktor Orban of Hungary, not Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Poland, not the populists who won in Italy’s national election, not the far-right parties that have spread across Europe on hatred of immigrants, xenophobia, disdain for the rule of law, intolerance of dissent and suspiciousness of international cooperation. Nor did he name Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin, though they are clearly an inspiration and model for the European far right. He did not have to. The struggle between the traditional values of Western liberal democracy and the new forces of authoritarianism, intolerance and nationalism has become a defining challenge of the times. Invoking the title of a well-known German trilogy by Hermann Broch about the deterioration of values in the years before World War I, Mr. Macron said: “I don’t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past. I want to belong to a generation that has decided forcefully to defend its democracy.” Mr. Macron’s crushing defeat of France’s reactionary National Front last May raised hopes that the tide of illiberalism was turning in Europe. But Prime Minister Orban’s easy win in Hungary’s national election on April 8 and the success of antiestablishment parties in Italy a month earlier have signaled otherwise. To the east, Russia’s brazen violation of international norms has only increased despite broad economic sanctions — witness the chemical assault on a double agent in Britain, while to the west, the Trump administration relentlessly pursues its chaotic assault on American values and traditions. Mr. Macron said political change was inevitable, but it should not mean abandonment of democratic principles. "

South Korea confirmed that it had been in talks with the North and the U.S. about negotiating a formal peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice that halted, but did not end, the Korean War. A treaty could increase pressure on the North to give up its nuclear program, and on the U.S. to withdraw troops from the peninsula. President Trump supports the effort. But his decision to send Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and secretary of state nominee, on a secret trip to the North reflects the central role that spies — rather than diplomats — played in brokering an opening. One thorny issue is where to hold the meeting — a decision complicated by the limited range of North Korea’s aging fleet. Here’s a look at previous diplomatic efforts.

The domestic terrorism verdict came at a time when threats against religious and racial minorities are rising nationally, and the case drew interest from the highest levels of the Justice Department. “The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “That’s not just illegal — it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it.” The men, Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright and Patrick Stein, all of whom are white, appeared stoic as the verdicts were read at the federal courthouse in Wichita. Defense lawyers had tried to convince jurors that their clients were manipulated by the F.B.I., and had been unfairly targeted for exercising their rights to own guns and speak freely. “He was a member of a militia. He loved his guns. This was a lifestyle,” Melody Brannon, a lawyer for Mr. Allen, told the mostly white jury. “The government tried to criminalize that lifestyle.” The trial, which played out over about a month, focused on a period before the 2016 presidential election when a paid F.B.I. informant infiltrated a militia group that included the three men and secretly recorded hours of their conversations. Politics were front and center throughout the trial, with defense lawyers portraying the F.B.I. as a bullying-government force that used its informant to steer their clients from hateful speech to violent plotting. The courtroom critiques of the F.B.I. came after a series of condemnations of the bureau by President Trump, who overwhelmingly carried Kansas in 2016. "

433,"THE WOMAN’S HOUR
The Great Fight to Win the Vote
By Elaine Weiss
Illustrated. 404 pp. Viking. $28. It’s probably inappropriate to evaluate a work of history on the basis of how many novels can be extracted from its pages; it’s also, if one is a novelist, irresistible. Which real-life situations and characters are so intriguing that they’d be worthy of delving into and depicting in the truly intimate manner that only fiction allows? By this measure — and by several others — “The Woman’s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote,” by the journalist Elaine Weiss, is a gold mine. After Congress passed the 19th Amendment in 1919, ratification needed to occur in 36 states for women’s right to vote to become federal law. By July 1920, the possible 36th state — or the place where the amendment would die after 70 years of strenuous activism — was Tennessee. Thus, for several weeks that summer, in and around Nashville’s statehouse, a frenetic pageant of political organizing, lobbying, demonstrating and double-crossing unfolded among the “Antis,” who opposed the amendment, and the “Suffs,” or suffragists, who supported it. As one legislator declared, “The entire world today has cast its eyes on Tennessee.” Weiss presents a panoramic view of the proceedings, which are alternately juicy (accusations of libel and bribery abounded, and, in spite of Prohibition, the whiskey and bourbon were free-flowing) and procedural. Weiss also provides national and international context: World War I had ended less than two years earlier, and both the war and its aftermath had jumbled established norms of gender, race and employment. In the United States, a physically ailing Woodrow Wilson occupied the White House, and two Ohioans, Warren Harding and James Cox, were vying to replace him, which raised the stakes of the 19th Amendment’s passage: Though women in some states could already vote, it was unclear how enfranchising all 27 million American women in time for the fall’s presidential election would influence national politics. In addition to offering contemporaneous perspective, Weiss goes back several decades to the roots of the women’s movement and the efforts of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others. Weiss celebrates their persistence and courage but does not sugarcoat their racism. Despite early unity with abolitionists, upper-middle-class white women willing to sacrifice racial equality for gender equality is nothing new. During the ratification in Nashville, Carrie Catt, the New York-based president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the successor to Susan B. Anthony, made calculated decisions to distance her groups’ interests from those of black men and women. After all, much of the Anti reluctance to grant women the vote was tied up with not wanting black women to vote. Weiss details the tribalism within the women’s movement as personified by Catt and the more militant and provocative Alice Paul, who led the National Woman’s Party. Though Paul was short on money and didn’t travel to Nashville for the special session, she dispatched the native Tennessean Sue Shelton White, an activist who could, with her very accent, dispel accusations about meddling outsiders. Weiss depicts another native daughter of Tennessee, this one a committed Anti: Josephine Pearson, who presided over multiple Anti groups and believed that in fighting against ratification, she was obeying both God and her deceased mother.

436,"TOKYO — The highest-ranking civil servant in Japan’s Finance Ministry offered his resignation on Wednesday amid swirling accusations that he had sexually harassed several female journalists. At a news conference, the official, Junichi Fukuda, 58, the administrative vice minister, said allegations that he had made sexually suggestive remarks to the women were “not factual.” Still, Mr. Fukuda’s resignation, which was accepted by Taro Aso, the finance minister, was a small sign that Japan might be joining the international reckoning of the #MeToo movement, spurred by widespread accusations of sexual harassment and assault. Two days earlier, Mr. Fukuda threatened to sue Shukan Shincho magazine, which originally reported the accusations. On Wednesday, he also vowed, “I am going to dispute it in court.” Mr. Fukuda offered to step down on the same day that Ryuichi Yoneyama, the governor of Niigata, on Japan’s western coast, said he would resign over what he called a “women problem.” The weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun is set to report on Thursday that Mr. Yoneyama had paid multiple women he met through an online dating site. Both men’s resignations came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Palm Beach, Fla., meeting with President Trump. Mr. Fukuda’s resignation is subject to confirmation by the entire cabinet, including Mr. Abe. "

439,"WASHINGTON — The Senate voted on Wednesday to overturn an Obama-era rule that restricted automobile lenders from discriminating against minorities by charging them higher fees for car loans, in the latest attempt by Republican lawmakers to roll back financial regulations. Republican lawmakers, along with one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, seized on the Congressional Review Act to overturn guidance issued in 2013 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The 1996 law gives Congress the power to nullify rules formulated by government agencies but has primarily been used to void recently enacted rules. After the Government Accountability Office determined late last year that the consumer bureau’s 2013 guidance on auto lending was technically a rule that could be rolled back, Republicans, led by Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, targeted it for rescission by using the Congressional Review Act. The House is expected to follow suit and also use the Congressional Review Act to void the guidance. Republicans have long derided the consumer bureau, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, for exceeding its authority, and President Trump’s pick to lead the agency on an interim basis, Mick Mulvaney, has largely frozen its rule-making and enforcement. Democrats and consumer watchdogs criticized the move and warned that Republicans were making broader use of the Congressional Review Act to advance their deregulatory agenda. “By voting to roll back the CFPB’s work, senators have emboldened banks and finance companies to engage in racial discrimination by charging millions of people of color more for a car loan than is justified,” said Rion Dennis of Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group. “Lawmakers have also opened the door to challenging longstanding agency actions that are crucial to protecting workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.” "
440,"CASSELTON, N.D. — Here in the largest soybean-producing county in the country, a snowy winter has left North Dakota farmers like Robert Runck with time on their hands before spring planting — time they have spent stewing over how much they stand to lose if President Trump starts a trade war with China. “If he doesn’t understand what he’s doing to the nation by doing what he’s doing, he’s going to be a one-term president, plain and simple,” said Mr. Runck, a fourth-generation farmer who voted for Mr. Trump. Pausing outside the post office in this town of 2,300, Mr. Runck said the repercussions could be more immediate for Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican whose bid against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, has been complicated by the proposed tariffs. “If it doesn’t get resolved by election time, I would imagine it would cost Kevin Cramer some votes,” he said. Stern warnings are coming from all over the Midwest about the political peril for Republicans in Mr. Trump’s recent course of action, in which the tariffs he slapped on foreign competitors invited retaliatory tariffs on American agriculture. Soybeans are America’s second largest export to China, and that country’s proposed 25 percent duties on the crop would hit hardest in states like Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota — where there are highly competitive House races — as well as Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, whose Senate contests may determine control of the chamber. By proposing the tariffs, Mr. Trump has moved to fulfill a central promise of his campaign: confronting those countries he believes are undermining American industry. Yet his goal — to revive the steel and aluminum industries, thereby aiding the Rust Belt states that were crucial to his election — has effectively prioritized one element of the Trump political coalition over another, larger bloc of voters. That larger segment, the farm belt, is essential to Republican success in the midterm elections and beyond. "
441,"As a child, Y. says she was beaten by her father with ropes and cables in Honduras. J. says he was forced into labor in Burkina Faso. R., who was born in the Dominican Republic, says she was neglected by her mother and abandoned by her father. All three applied for something known in immigration law as Special Immigrant Juvenile status, which lets children under the age of 21 who have been abused, abandoned or neglected by one or both parents obtain a green card. But in the last several weeks, all three, living in New York, were denied because of an unannounced policy reversal by the Trump administration. Under the new interpretation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services said that applicants in New York who were over 18, but not yet 21, when they began the application process no longer qualify. For the last 10 years, cases like theirs have routinely been approved. But as the Trump administration focuses on limiting all forms of immigration and tries to stop the flow of unaccompanied minors at the Mexico-United States border, it appears to be targeting the special immigrant status; President Trump often invokes fear that these immigrants could belong to MS-13, the transnational gang, and that they are committing fraud in their applications. “They are looking for what he calls ‘loopholes,’ and what we call protections, and trying to close them,” said Wendy Young, the executive director of Kids In Need of Defense, a nonprofit organization that represents young immigrants who come to the country unaccompanied. “Under this administration, everybody is presenting a fraudulent claim, rather than, ‘Why is this child here and do they need protection?’” "

446,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, confronting legal threats on multiple sides, sought on Wednesday to discredit a pornographic actress alleging a sexual encounter with him and investigators examining whether his campaign worked with Russia to sway the 2016 election, saying both were dealing in fake allegations. Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Wednesday to deny the claim by Stephanie Clifford, the actress also known as Stormy Daniels who has said she had an affair with him in 2006, that Mr. Trump dispatched a man to physically threaten her years ago. The president called a composite sketch of the man released on Tuesday by Ms. Clifford’s lawyer “a total con job,” marking only the second time he has weighed in on the subject after weeks of frenzied news media coverage. His tweet accompanied a post from another Twitter user, who said the man looked like Ms. Clifford’s former husband. In a news conference later in the day, Mr. Trump again referred to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russia’s election interference and whether the president has obstructed justice as a “hoax.” “This was a, really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss” in the election, he said during a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.

452,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea confirmed on Wednesday that it had been in talks with American and North Korean officials about negotiating a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War after more than 60 years, as the United States and its ally try to establish a basis for persuading the North to give up its nuclear weapons. Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, said he had discussed the matter with John R. Bolton, his newly appointed American counterpart, in Washington last week, as they prepared for the planned talks between each of their countries’ presidents and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader. South Korean officials said they had also been in talks with the North about a possible treaty. Mr. Kim told Mr. Chung and another South Korean official last month that the North was willing to give up nuclear arms if it received security guarantees. In the past, the North has said that a peace treaty and the normalization of ties with the United States would be among the security guarantees it would require in exchange for surrendering its nuclear program. Referring to his meetings with Trump administration officials, Mr. Chung said on Wednesday, “We held in-depth discussions on various ways of how to end hostilities and eventually establish a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, how to address the North Korean concerns and how to ensure a bright future for the North if it makes the right choice.” “Mr. Bolton made it clear to me that he will do his best as an honest broker in successfully implementing President Trump’s peace policy on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Chung added. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that a peace treaty was being discussed and that he approved of the idea. The president, who confirmed on Wednesday that he had sent Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, to meet with Mr. Kim, has said he would meet with the North Korean leader in May or early June, after Mr. Kim’s April 27 talks with South Korea’s president, Mr. Moon, on the Koreas’ border.

454,"Kris W. Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas and face of the Trump administration’s efforts to clamp down on supposed voter fraud, was found by a federal judge on Wednesday to have disobeyed orders to notify thousands of Kansans in 2016 that they were registered to vote. Mr. Kobach, who served last year as the vice chairman of the Trump administration’s short-lived presidential commission on voter fraud, was reprimanded in a 25-page ruling by Federal District Judge Julie A. Robinson of Kansas, who held him in contempt of court. Mr. Kobach has championed restrictive laws on voting around the country, warning that voting fraud is rampant and unchecked, despite widespread agreement from election experts that it is extremely rare. But voting rights advocates pointed to the judge’s findings as a counter to Mr. Kobach’s efforts to position himself as a protector of the voting process. “Secretary Kobach likes to talk about the rule of law,” Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “Talk is cheap, and his actions speak louder than his words.” A law went into effect in Kansas in 2013 that required proof of citizenship to register to vote, one of the strictest such laws in the country. But in May 2016, Mr. Kobach lost a challenge to the law brought by the A.C.L.U., and Judge Robinson ordered him to notify people who had tried to register while renewing or applying for a driver’s license that they were indeed eligible to vote. Judge Robinson wrote in the ruling on Wednesday that those voters should have received postcards with information telling them of their polling place and their registration status, but Mr. Kobach did not ensure that the postcards were sent. “The Court is troubled by Defendant’s failure to take responsibility for violating this Court’s orders, and for failing to ensure compliance over an issue that he explicitly represented to the Court had been accomplished,” the judge wrote. Mr. Kobach also failed to ensure that the county elections manual on the secretary of state’s website was updated properly, the ruling said. Judge Robinson did not impose a fine or other sanctions, but ordered Mr. Kobach to pay “reasonable” legal fees to the A.C.L.U. Moriah Day, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kobach, said that the secretary of state would appeal the decision and had no other comment. Mr. Kobach is vying for the Republican nomination for governor in Kansas, running on his record as a proponent of restrictive laws on immigration and voting rights. He is challenging Gov. Jeff Colyer, who succeeded Sam Brownback earlier this year after Mr. Brownback accepted an ambassadorship in the Trump administration. Mr. Kobach represented himself in a trial in March in Judge Robinson’s courtroom, where he is defending the 2011 proof-of-citizenship law. Mr. Kobach was previously fined $1,000 for his “deceptive conduct and lack of candor” before a federal court. That penalty was upheld by Judge Robinson last year. "

459,"WASHINGTON — Of all the obstacles to the potential summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, just getting there could prove the most turbulent. As officials scramble to convene the hastily announced and once-unthinkable meeting in the coming weeks, the site itself remains an open question. It is unclear whether Mr. Kim’s fleet of Soviet-era planes can fly him more than a few thousand miles from North Korea. “We know he has a plane, but it’s an old plane,” said Sue Mi Terry, a former C.I.A. analyst and National Security Council aide who worked on Korea issues. “No one really knows if it works.” Since taking power in 2011, Mr. Kim is not known to have flown outside his country, and the question of his transportation adds a layer of political complications to a fraught and uncertain summit meeting. Sitting leaders of the two countries have never met. Could Mr. Kim borrow a plane? Perhaps, but not without a significant dent to his well-established hubris. Could the meeting be held close enough for him to take a train, as he did last month in a secretive visit to China? In theory, though viable options are few. Could Mr. Trump instead travel to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, thus nullifying the issue? He is almost certainly unwilling to stomach the appearance of showing deference to Mr. Kim. “It’s really hard if you only have a 2,000-mile radius,” said David H. Rank, who previously served as the acting United States ambassador to China. "

hen John Wick and his wife, Peggy Rathmann, bought their ranch in Marin County, Calif., in 1998, it was mostly because they needed more space. Rathmann is an acclaimed children’s book author — “Officer Buckle and Gloria” won a Caldecott Medal in 1996 — and their apartment in San Francisco had become cluttered with her illustrations. They picked out the 540-acre ranch in Nicasio mostly for its large barn, which they planned to remake into a spacious studio. Wick, a former construction foreman — they met when he oversaw a renovation of her bathroom — was eager to tackle the project. He knew the area well, having grown up one town away, in Woodacre, where he had what he describes as a “free-range” childhood: little supervision and lots of biking, rope-swinging and playing in the area’s fields and glens. The couple quickly settled into their bucolic new surroundings. Wick began fixing leaks in the barn. Rathmann loved watching the many animals, including ravens, deer and the occasional gopher, from the large porch. She even trained the resident towhees, small brown birds, to eat seed from her hand. So smitten were they with the wildlife, in fact, that they decided to return their ranch to a wilder state. For nearly a century, this had been dairy country, and the rounded, coastal hills were terraced from decades of grazing. Wick and Rathmann would often come home and find, to their annoyance, cows standing on their porch. The first step they took toward what they imagined would be a more pristine state was to revoke the access enjoyed by the rancher whose cows wandered their property. Within months of the herd’s departure, the landscape began to change. Brush encroached on meadow. Dried-out, uneaten grass hindered new growth. A mysterious disease struck their oak trees. The land seemed to be losing its vitality. “Our vision of wilderness was failing,” Wick told me recently. “Our naïve idea was not working out so well.” Wick was especially bothered by the advance of a prickly, yellow-flowered invasive weed called the woolly distaff thistle. He pulled it, mowed it, doused it with herbicides. But the distaff kept moving into what had been pasture. He thought about renting goats to eat the weeds and brush, but they were too expensive. He even considered introducing wild elk, but the bureaucratic hurdles seemed too onerous. Then Wick and Rathmann met a rangeland ecologist named Jeff Creque. Instead of fighting against what you dislike, Creque suggested, focus on cultivating what you want. Squeeze out weeds by fostering conditions that favor grasses. Creque, who spent 25 years as an organic-pear-and-apple farmer in Northern California before earning a Ph.D. in rangeland ecology, also recommended that they bring back the cows. Grasslands and grazing animals, he pointed out, had evolved together. Unlike trees, grasses don’t shed their leaves at the end of the growing season; they depend on animals for defoliation and the recycling of nutrients. The manure and urine from grazing animals fuels healthy growth. If done right, Creque said, grazing could be restorative. This view ran counter to a lot of conservationist thought, as well as a great deal of evidence. Grazing has been blamed for turning vast swaths of the world into deserts. But from Creque’s perspective, how you graze makes all the difference. If the ruminants move like wild buffalo, in dense herds, never staying in one place for too long, the land benefits from the momentary disturbance. If you simply let them loose and then round them up a few months later — often called the “Columbus method” — your land is more likely to end up hard-packed and barren. Wick was persuaded. He began preparing for the cows’ return. He dug wells for water, pounded in steel posts and strung nonbarbed wire. He even bought a molasses lick to supplement the animals’ diet of dry thatch. He didn’t want medicated livestock excreting drugs that might harm the worms and insects living in his soil — most cows are routinely dewormed — so he tracked down a herd of untreated cows and borrowed them for the summer of 2005. The cows beat back the encroaching brush. Within weeks of their arrival, new and different kinds of grass began sprouting. Shallow-rooted annuals, which die once they’re chewed on, gave way to deep-rooted perennials, which can recover after moderate grazing. By summer’s end, the cows, which had arrived shaggy and wild-eyed after a winter spent near the sea, were fat with shiny coats. When Wick returned the herd to its owner that fall, collectively it had gained about 50,000 pounds. Wick needed to take an extra trip with his trailer to cart the cows away. That struck him as remarkable. The land seemed richer than before, the grass lusher. Meadowlarks and other animals were more abundant. Where had that additional truckload of animal flesh come from? Creque had an answer for him. The carbohydrates that fattened the cows had come from the atmosphere, by way of the grass they ate. Grasses, he liked to say, were like straws sipping carbon from the air, bringing it back to earth. Creque’s quiet observation stuck with Wick and Rathmann. It clearly illustrated a concept that Creque had repeatedly tried to explain to them: Carbon, the building block of life, was constantly flowing from atmosphere to plants into animals and then back into the atmosphere. And it hinted at something that Wick and Rathmann had yet to consider: Plants could be deliberately used to pull carbon out of the sky. Climate change often evokes images of smokestacks, and for good reason: The single largest source of carbon emissions related to human activity is heat and power generation, which accounts for about one-quarter of the carbon we put into the atmosphere. Often overlooked, though, is how we use land, which contributes almost as much. The erosion and degradation of soil caused by plowing, intense grazing and clear-cutting has played a significant role in the atmospheric accumulation of heat-trapping gases. The process is an ancient one. Ice cores from Greenland, which contain air samples trapped thousands of years ago, reveal increases in greenhouse gases that correspond with the rise of farming in Mesopotamia. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, agricultural practices and animal husbandry have released an estimated 135 gigatons — 135 billion metric tons — of carbon into the atmosphere, according to Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at Ohio State University. Even at current rates, that’s more than a decade’s worth of carbon dioxide emissions from all human sources. The world is warming not only because fossil fuels are being burned, but also because soils, forests and wetlands are being ravaged. In recent years, some scientists have begun to ask whether we can put some of that carbon back into the soil and into living ecosystems, like grasslands and forests. This notion, known as carbon farming, has gained traction as it becomes clear that simply reducing emissions will not sufficiently limit global warming. According to the 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an authority on climate science that operates under the auspices of the United Nations, humankind also needs to remove some of the carbon already in the atmosphere to avoid, say, the collapse of polar glaciers and the inundation of coastal cities worldwide. “We can’t just reduce emissions,” Keith Paustian, a soil scientist at Colorado State University and an author of an earlier I.P.C.C. report, told me. “It’s all hands on deck. Things like soil and land use — everything is important.” Some of the proposed methods to begin this drawdown include scrubbing the air with great air-conditioner-like machines; fertilizing the oceans with iron dust to prompt algal blooms that, when they die, carry captured carbon to the bottom of the sea; capturing and storing the carbon dioxide that results when energy is produced by burning trees and other plants that removed carbon from the atmosphere during their growth; and crushing and spreading certain types of rock, like basalt, that naturally absorb atmospheric carbon. None of these approaches are yet proved or affordable at the scale needed to make a difference. The most obvious hurdle is the additional energy some of them require, which, unless it comes from a free, renewable source, adds more costs. Plants, however, remove carbon from the atmosphere already, require no additional power and grow essentially free. During photosynthesis they harness the sun’s energy to make sugars by combining hydrogen atoms (acquired from water molecules) with carbon atoms (from carbon dioxide), while emitting oxygen as a byproduct. (Lest we forget, the fossil fuels that now power civilization contain carbon removed from the air during photosynthesis millions of years ago.) Every spring, as the Northern Hemisphere greens, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dips, before rising again the following fall and winter as foliage dies. Some scientists describe this fluctuation as the earth breathing. Nearly all the carbon that enters the biosphere is captured during photosynthesis, and as it moves through life’s web, every organism takes a cut for its own energy needs, releasing carbon dioxide as exhaust. This circular voyage is the short-term carbon cycle. Carbon farming seeks to interfere with this cycle, slowing the release of carbon back into the atmosphere. The practice is often conceptualized and discussed in terms of storing carbon, but really the idea is to change the flow of carbon so that, for a time at least, the carbon leaving a given ecosystem is less than the carbon entering it. Dozens of land-management practices are thought to achieve this feat. Planting or restoring forests, for one: Trees lock up carbon in woody material. Another is adding biochar, a charcoal made from heated organic material, directly to soil. Or restoring certain wetlands that have an immense capacity to hold carbon. (Coal beds are the fossilized remains of ancient marshes and peatlands.) More than one-third of earth’s ice-free surface is devoted to agriculture, meaning that much of it is already managed intensively. Carbon farming’s fundamental conceit is that if we change how we treat this land, we could turn huge areas of the earth’s surface into a carbon sponge. Instead of relying solely on technology to remove greenhouse gases from the air, we could harness an ancient and natural process, photosynthesis, to pump carbon into what’s called the pedosphere, the thin skin of living soil at the earth’s surface. If adopted widely enough, such practices could, in theory, begin to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, nudging us toward a less perilous climate trajectory than our current one. In a 2016 paper, Pete Smith, a soil scientist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, and the influential climate scientist James Hansen argued that land-management practices are one of the few affordable options available today for drawing down carbon. “What’s surprising to me is that we’ve not done it sooner,” says Smith, who is also a lead author on a recent U.N. report that explores carbon-dioxide-removal technologies. “This has the potential to make a huge difference.” Otherwise, Hansen told me, we’re leaving the problem to our grandchildren. “That assumption that somehow young people, and people later this century, are going to figure out how to suck it out of the air — that’s a pretty big burden to place on them,” he said. The I.P.C.C. is preparing a special report on climate change and land use, to be finalized in 2019, that will consider in greater detail the potential of sequestering carbon in soil. But for now the biggest international effort to promote carbon farming is a French-led initiative called “four per 1,000.” The proposal aims to increase the amount of carbon in the soil of crop- and rangelands by 0.4 percent per year through a variety of agricultural and forestry practices. These include agroforestry (growing trees and crops together increases carbon retention), no-till agriculture (plowing causes erosion and carbon loss) and keeping farmland covered (bare dirt bleeds carbon). Doing so, the French argue, could completely halt the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Few experts I spoke to think the impact would be quite that grand; Pete Smith, for example, estimates that soil could, at the most, store just 13 percent of annual carbon-dioxide emissions at current levels. “I appreciate that everyone wants to save the planet,” he told me, “but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that this is all we need to do.” Even so, the four-per-1,000 goal highlights how a relatively small annual increase in soil carbon could, on a large-enough scale, have a substantial impact. Increasing soil carbon could yield other benefits, too: Improvements in soil fertility, water retention and greater crop resilience would help agriculture adapt to a warming world. More soil carbon would also reduce the amount of fertilizer needed, decreasing emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, a byproduct of excess nitrogen fertilization. It would be profoundly appropriate if agriculture, whose modern practices have themselves contributed to climate change, could become part of its solution. Farming, responsible for the birth of civilization, could now help save it. In 2007, at Jeff Creque’s behest, John Wick got in touch with Whendee Silver, an ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Letting cows graze on his property had certainly made the land look healthier, he told Silver. But he and Creque wanted to know: Had it put carbon in the ground? And if so, was it possible to measure how much? Silver was skeptical that she could measure what was likely to amount to very small changes in his land’s soil carbon. The endeavor seemed akin to looking for cups of water added to a swimming pool. But she did sketch out a way to arrive at a definitive answer. When Wick offered to underwrite such a study, she warned him that he might not like the results. She wasn’t just going to tell him what he wanted to hear. “That’s when I knew I had to work with her,” Wick recalls. Silver agreed to the project, which she began that year. Seeking baseline values for the carbon concentrations in the soil, she and her students collected samples from different rangelands in Marin and Sonoma Counties. The samples with the most carbon, it turned out, came from current and former dairy farms. What distinguished these operations, she learned, was that they often sprayed manure onto their pastures; this was done both to fertilize the land and dispose of waste. Apparently, how soil was treated could very much affect its carbon content — a surprise. The larger implication was that people could potentially “grow” soil carbon deliberately. But how quickly could they do so? Silver found an answer, in part, by looking for nuclear fallout. In the mid-20th century, radioactive carbon isotopes were spewed into the atmosphere as a result of aboveground nuclear tests. Plants around the world absorbed those isotopes during photosynthesis, effectively turning them into a time stamp. Wherever that carbon shows up, it must have arrived there relatively recently. On dairy farms, Silver found the isotopes a full three feet below the surface. This was another surprise. Conventional wisdom holds that it takes perhaps hundreds of years for carbon-rich topsoil to accumulate. On these dairy farms, however, atmospheric carbon had pushed deep into the earth in a matter of decades. Wick wanted to know if he could deliberately replicate this process on his ranch — but without manure, which, as it decomposes, can release potent greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. The former traps about 30 times as much heat as carbon dioxide, the latter 300 times as much. As a carbon-farming tool, manure might be self-defeating. Jeff Creque, a onetime organic farmer, had a suggestion: Why not use compost? Compost can contain manure, but whereas manure alone can release nitrogen as nitrous oxide, the nitrogen in compost becomes locked up in complex molecules. At least in theory, that limits the escape of a powerful greenhouse gas. In 2008, Wick, Silver and Creque spread several semi trucks full of the stuff, purchased from a composting plant near Sacramento, onto Wick’s ranch and on another ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. In total, it amounted to about half an inch spread over three acres. After three years, Wick was disappointed to discover that grazing on its own wasn’t leading to carbon sequestration. In fact, the soil lost carbon in untreated control plots. No one knows precisely why, but grasslands throughout California are bleeding carbon. European settlers introduced shallow-rooted annual grasses to the state, which partly displaced deeper-rooted perennial grasses. So carbon put into the ground long ago by deep-rooted grasses may now be seeping out. That’s what made the treated plots so remarkable. They had the same history and were exposed to the same conditions, but instead of losing carbon, they absorbed it — at a rate equivalent to nearly 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year. That’s roughly equal to your car’s emissions if you drove from Miami to Seattle. Silver had thought that the compost would simply break down, releasing its carbon back into the atmosphere or, worse, produce nitrous oxide. But those emissions never occurred; moreover, judging by its chemical signature, most of the carbon moving into the soil came from the air, not the compost. The compost appeared to help the plants draw more carbon from the atmosphere than they otherwise would have. When it comes to mitigating climate change, soil scientists are most interested in what Silver calls occluded carbon — organic material, often in the form of dead microbes, trapped in clods of dirt. This type of carbon can potentially stay locked away for centuries. (Another carbon type, called labile carbon, continuously cycles among the atmosphere, plants and organisms in the soil.) It was precisely this more durable carbon, Silver discovered, that increased in the treated plots. Her findings corresponded with a shift in recent decades in scientists’ understanding of how soil carbon forms. Previously they emphasized how dead organic material had to physically work its way into the soil. But the newer model stressed the importance of living plants. Their rootlets are constantly dying, depositing carbon underground, where it’s less likely to go airborne. And perhaps more important, as plants pull carbon from the air, their roots inject some of it into the soil, feeding microorganisms and fungi called mycorrhiza. An estimated 12,000 miles of hyphae, or fungal filaments, are found beneath every square meter of healthy soil. Some researchers refer to this tangled, living matrix as the “world wood web.” Living plants increase soil carbon by directly nourishing soil ecosystems. In the years that followed, Silver’s analyses of soil cores indicated that the treated land kept taking in carbon. Computer simulations suggest that it will continue to do so for decades. It also retained more moisture and grew about 50 percent more grass. One dose of compost ignited what Silver calls a state change: The plants and the soil — and everything that inhabited it — moved toward a new equilibrium in which the soil ecosystem pulled in and retained greater amounts of carbon. Silver began publishing her findings in scientific journals in 2010. Her second paper, written with her postdoc Marcia DeLonge and the graduate student Rebecca Ryals, offered a remarkable bit of extrapolation. California has about 56 million acres of rangeland, the single largest type of land use in the state. If compost made with manure was applied to just 5 percent of that area, they calculated, it would offset emissions from about 80 percent of the state’s agricultural sector — all the cows raised, crops grown, fertilizer applied and tractors driven in California. Much of that offset came from diverting manure from festering lagoons — where it releases methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere — into compost, a one-time benefit. But the ongoing drawdown of carbon dioxide from enhanced grass growth could be important, too. If you treated 41 percent of the state’s rangeland, Silver told me, carbon pumped into the earth by photosynthesis might render the entire agricultural sector of the world’s sixth-largest economy carbon-neutral for years to come. The soil-improving practices that Wick, Silver and Creque stumbled into have much in common with another movement known as regenerative agriculture. Its guiding principle is not just to farm sustainably — that implies mere maintenance of what might, after all, be a degraded status quo — but to farm in such a way as to improve the land. The movement emphasizes soil health and, specifically, the buildup of soil carbon. This happy coincidence is one reason that carbon-farming advocates repeatedly describe their project as a “win-win.” Society could theoretically remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the earth, and at the same time enhance the fortunes of farmers and the overall stability of the nation’s food supply. Farmers’ obsession with soil health isn’t new, of course. It has been a preoccupation for ages. But modern, conventional agriculture has largely relied on synthetic fertilizer to compensate for losses in natural fertility. And while fertilizers help plants grow, some evidence suggests that they can, in excess, accelerate the loss of carbon from the soil. An influx of nutrients may feed precisely those microbes that release carbon back into the atmosphere. Plants may also excrete less carbon into the earth when bathed in synthetic fertilizers, causing the ancient relationship among plant roots, soil fungi and microbes — the symbiosis that increases soil carbon — to fray. In recent years, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, which was founded in response to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s, has promoted the fostering of soil carbon as an important farming practice. But one of the more remarkable aspects of the regenerative-agriculture movement is that it has been driven largely by farmers themselves. Its proponents fret over soil carbon not necessarily because the N.R.C.S. tells them to, or because they worry about the planet’s fate. They have discovered that doing so can help their bottom line. Darin Williams is one such farmer. He lives near Waverly, Kan., with his wife, Nancy, in a tidy, gray-painted house with a stone chimney. A life-size plastic deer sits on his front lawn, run through with arrows; he uses it for target practice to sharpen his hunting skills. He’s a big man with a baby face and a mischievous squint. When he drove me around his farm last October in his red “one-tonner” pickup truck, he talked incessantly about soil. For nearly 20 years, Williams worked as a contractor, building houses in Kansas City. But work dried up after the financial crisis hit in 2007. Williams decided to return to the family farm near Waverly, an area of gently rolling plains, and give farming a try. His family had farmed some when he was a teenager before leasing the land to tenants for years, and he knew it was difficult to make ends meet. But he was inspired by an article about a North Dakota rancher and farmer named Gabe Brown, who claimed to have developed, through trial and error, a more efficient and cost-effective way to farm. The gist of Brown’s argument was that if you focus on the health of the soil and not on yield, eventually you come out ahead, not necessarily because you grow more corn or wheat per acre but because the reduction in spending on fertilizer and other inputs lets you produce each bushel of grain more cheaply. Williams decided to follow Brown’s prescription. “If after three years, I’m bankrupt, I’ll admit it was a bad joke,” Williams remembers thinking. Seven years later, his gamble seems to have paid off. He started with 60 acres, now farms about 2,000 and, when I visited last fall, had just purchased an additional 200. In one of his fields, we walked down a lane he had mowed through his warm-weather cover crops — plants grown not to be harvested, but to enrich the soil — which towered over us, reaching perhaps eight feet. They included sorghum, a canelike grass with red-tinted tassels spilling from the tops, mung beans and green-topped daikon radishes low to the ground. Each plant was meant to benefit the earth in a different way. The long radishes broke it up and drew nutrients toward the surface; tall grasses like sorghum produced numerous fine rootlets, adding organic material to the land; legumes harbored bacteria that put nitrogen into the soil. His 120-strong herd of British white cattle — he introduced livestock in 2013 — would eventually eat through the field, turning the plants into cow patties and enriching the soil further. Then he would plant his cash crops. “Had I not found this way to farm,” he told me, “we would not be farming.” A mat of dead vegetation — from cover crops, cash-crop residue and dung — covered Williams’s fields. The mulch, along with his cover crops, inhibited weeds from becoming established, a major concern for conventional farmers, because so many weeds have evolved resistance to herbicides. “I don’t lie awake at night wondering how I’m going to kill weeds,” Williams said. Williams doesn’t till his fields. By minimizing soil disturbance, no-till farming prevents erosion, helps retain moisture and leaves the soil ecosystem — worms, fungi, roots and more — mostly intact. At one of his soybean fields, Williams showed me how this translated to soil with “structure.” “See how that crumbles into a cottage-cheese look?” he said, massaging a fistful of earth. Small clods fell through his fingers. “That’s what you want.” Worm holes riddled the dirt, giving it a spongelike quality that was critical, he said, for absorbing rain and preventing runoff. Weather patterns seemed to be changing, he noted. Rain used to arrive in numerous light storms. Now fewer storms came, but they were more intense. “We have to be able to capture rain and store it,” he said. By focusing on soil health, Williams says he has reduced his use of herbicides by 75 percent and fertilizers by 45 percent. He doesn’t use pesticides — he relies instead on beneficial insects for pest control — and he saves money by not buying expensive genetically modified, herbicide-resistant seed. He estimates that he produces a bushel of soybeans for about 20 percent less than his conventionally farming neighbors. Last fall, he claims, his yields ranked among the highest in the county. While doing all this, he has so far raised the amount of soil organic matter, a rough predictor of soil carbon concentrations, from around 2 percent to 3.5 percent in some fields. Gabe Brown, for his part, says he has more than tripled his soil carbon since the 1990s. And an official with the U.S.D.A.’s Agricultural Research Service confirmed to me that the amount of carbon in Brown’s soil — what his farming has pulled from the atmosphere — was between two and three times as high as it was in his neighbors’ land. The successes of Brown and Williams suggest that farmers can increase carbon in the soil while actually reducing their overall expenses. This could be vital, because in order for carbon farming to have an impact on the climate, as much land as possible, including both crop- and rangeland, will have to be included in the effort. Critics of regenerative agriculture say that it can’t be adopted broadly and intensively enough to matter — or that if it can, the prices of commodities might be affected unfavorably. Mark Bradford, a professor of soils and ecosystem ecology at Yale, questions what he sees as a quasi-religious belief in the benefits of soil carbon. The recommendation makes sense intuitively, he told me. But the extent to which carbon increases crop yield hasn’t been quantified, making it somewhat “faith-based.” William Schlesinger, an emeritus soil scientist at Duke, points out that “regenerative” practices might inadvertently cause emissions to rise elsewhere. If you stop tilling to increase soil carbon, for example, but use more herbicides because you have more weeds, then you probably haven’t changed your overall emissions profile, he says. He thinks the climate-mitigation potential of carbon farming has been greatly oversold. Williams has reduced his herbicide use, not increased it, but Schlesinger’s broader point — about the need for a careful overall accounting of greenhouse gases — is important. Williams, Brown and others like them aren’t focused on climate change; no one really knows if the carbon they put in the ground more than offsets the methane produced by their cows, for example. What they do demonstrate is that augmenting soil carbon while farming is not only possible, but also beneficial, even in a business sense. And that makes the prospect of rolling out these practices on a larger scale much easier to imagine. The carbon-farming idea is gathering momentum at a time when national climate policy is backsliding. The Trump administration has reversed various Obama-era regulations meant to combat or adapt to climate change, including the Clean Power Plan, which required power plants to reduce their carbon emissions, and a rule instructing the federal government to consider sea-level rise and other effects of a changing climate when building new roads, bridges and other infrastructure. In the absence of federal leadership on climate — and as emissions continue to rise globally, shrinking the time available to forestall worst-case outcomes — state and local governments (as well as nonprofits) have begun to look into carbon farming. Last year, Hawaii passed legislation meant to keep it aligned with the Paris agreement, which President Trump has said he will abandon; the state has also created a task force to research carbon farming. The New York state assemblywoman Didi Barrett introduced legislation that would make tax credits available to farmers who increase soil carbon, presumably through methods like those employed by Darin Williams and Gabe Brown. A bill to educate farmers about soil has been proposed in Massachusetts. And in Maryland, legislation focused on soil health passed in 2017. Other carbon-farming projects are in the works in Colorado, Arizona and Montana. But it is California, already in the vanguard on climate-mitigation efforts, that has led the way on carbon farming. By 2050, the state aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 20 percent of what they were in 1990. Nearly half its 58 counties have farmers and ranchers at various stages of developing and implementing carbon-farming plans. San Francisco, which already has the largest urban composting program in the country, hopes to become a model carbon-farming metropolis. Cities don’t have much room to plant trees or undertake other practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere, says Deborah Raphael, the director of San Francisco’s Department of the Environment. But they can certainly produce plenty of compost. “If we can show other cities how doable it is to get green waste out of landfills, we can prove the concept,” Raphael told me. “We like to say that San Francisco rehearses the future.” Many of California’s carbon-farming efforts owe a debt to Wick, Creque and Silver. In 2008, they founded the Marin Carbon Project, a consortium of ranchers, scientists and land managers. The goal is to develop science-based carbon-farming practices and to help establish the incentives needed to encourage California farmers to adopt them. Silver continues to publish her findings in respected journals. Creque also started a nonprofit, the Carbon Cycle Institute, that assists farmers and ranchers in making carbon-farming plans. Wick has thrown himself into the policy realm, hiring a lobbyist in Sacramento to push a carbon-farming agenda. (In 2014, he even testified before Congress, outlining the project’s discoveries and explaining how compost could increase soil carbon on public lands. He deliberately mentioned “climate” only once.) Educating policymakers matters because, as Torri Estrada, executive director of the Carbon Cycle Institute, points out, carbon-mitigation efforts that focus on agriculture can be much cheaper per ton of carbon avoided than the flashier energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects that usually get most of the attention. The major obstacle to their implementation, he says, is that government officials don’t understand or know about them. California’s Healthy Soils Initiative, which Wick helped shape, explicitly enlists agriculture in the fight against climate change. In principle, that means carbon farmers can receive money from the state’s climate-mitigation funds not just for compost but also for 34 other soil-improving practices already approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. That’s important because the compost needed to cover just a few acres can cost thousands of dollars. Wick has also tried to tap federal funding. Once N.R.C.S. scientists vet Silver’s work, a compost amendment could become the service’s 35th recommendation. As a result, farm bill money, which farmers receive to subsidize food production, could help finance carbon farming done according to Wick’s protocol — not to fight climate change explicitly (which is now seen as politicized), but to bolster the health of soil (which isn’t). As a carbon-farming tool, compost bears some notable advantages — namely, it works both preventively and correctively. Composting prevents emissions from the starter material — manure, food scraps — that, if allowed to decompose, might emit potent greenhouse gases. (About one-fifth of United States methane emissions comes from food and other organic material decomposing in dumps.) By enhancing plant growth, it also aids in removing carbon from the atmosphere, a corrective process. And because the carbon in nearly all organic material was originally pulled from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, compost that enters the soil represents the storage of carbon removed from the air earlier — the grass eaten by cows that became manure, or the trees that became wood chips — and at a different location. That, too, is corrective. Calla Rose Ostrander, Wick’s right-hand person at the Marin Carbon Project, told me that the project’s greater goal is to completely reframe how we think about waste, to see it as more than a nuisance — to recognize it as a resource, a tool that can help us garden our way out of the climate problem. Before the modern era, farmers had no choice but to return human and animal waste to the fields. (Wick is looking into the possibility of composting human waste as well; the end product is called humanure.) In a sense, Wick and Ostrander seek to resurrect these ancient practices and, with the aid of modern science, to close the loop among livestock, plants, air and soil — and between cities and the agricultural land that feeds them. What seems to most impress experts about the Marin Carbon Project is the quality of Silver’s research. Eric Toensmeier, the author of “The Carbon Farming Solution” and a lecturer at Yale, says that the project figured out a new way to increase carbon storage on the semiarid grasslands that cover so much of the world. Jason Weller, the former head of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, told me that “the level of science investment is out of the ordinary, or extraordinary, for a group that is really self-started.” Weller added that the agency’s scientists still needed to vet the research, which they are in the midst of doing. In late 2016 the agency oversaw the application of compost to different California regions — inland, Southern, Northern — to see if land in various conditions would, like Wick’s ranch, suck up atmospheric carbon. But the group also has critics. “I’m very skeptical of their results and their claims,” William Horwath, a soil scientist at the University of California, Davis, told me. He wants to see Silver’s experiments replicated. This is the project’s major weakness: Its big idea is based almost entirely on extrapolation from a few acres in California. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether compost can cause land to become a carbon sponge in all climates and conditions, and for how long treated grassland will continue to take in and retain its carbon. Cows, a flash point in any discussion about climate change, may also present problems. Ruminants burp methane, and while carbon farming does not require their presence, some argue that merely accepting them on the land undermines the goal of reaching a carbon-neutral or -negative future. Livestock emissions account for almost half the heat-trapping gases associated with agriculture, so an obvious way to reduce emissions is to decrease the number of cows on the planet. Instead of dumping compost on rangeland, says Ian Monroe, a lecturer on energy and climate at Stanford University, why not allow forests cleared for pasture to regrow, and change people’s eating habits so they include less meat? Criticism is directed at compost too. The stuff requires energy to produce; huge machines are required to shred the material and keep it aerated. And it’s unclear if compost, like synthetic fertilizer, can cause nitrogen pollution when put on the land, or how much greenhouse gas composting itself generates. (As long as compost mounds are regularly aerated to prevent low-oxygen conditions, composting is thought to produce few emissions.) Organic material from municipal sources can contain bits of plastic and glass, which no one wants on their fields. Manure might carry seeds of invasive plants. (Silver has seen no evidence of this.) Spreading compost on public rangeland could disrupt plant communities, squeezing out species adapted to conditions of scarcity. And in any carbon-farming scheme, who will monitor and verify that far-flung stretches of land are really absorbing and storing the carbon as they’re supposed to? Horwath considers the amount of compost used in Silver’s research — about 10 times the usual application, he estimates — to be unrealistically high for practical use. “It seems an inordinately large amount to apply to any system,” he told me. And given what he sees as the many unknowns in Silver’s research, that compost would be put to better use on cropland where, he says, scientists know with greater certainty that it could improve water retention and the efficiency of fertilizer. Then there’s the problem of supply. Demand for San Francisco’s compost, which mostly goes to vineyards in California’s wine country, already outstrips what’s available. But Wick thinks more starter material shouldn’t be hard to find: Americans throw out between 30 and 40 percent of all the food they buy, sending it to landfills where it rots and generates greenhouse gases. Silver has calculated that there’s enough organic waste material in California to treat one-quarter of its rangeland every few decades. Still, given the energy requirements, the logistical headaches and the cost, skeptics question whether spreading compost across extensive portions of the world’s surface — including conflict zones in the Sahel or Central Asia — is really feasible. Even if it is, soils probably can’t soak up carbon indefinitely. If they have a saturation point, increases in carbon will eventually stop when that moment is reached. And because soil degradation can cause the release of whatever carbon it holds, treated lands would have to be well cared for in perpetuity. On a cool autumn day at Wick and Rathmann’s ranch house, Wick fielded phone calls while I wandered around the cluttered, semicircular room that served as his office and meeting space. A whiteboard displayed scribbles from a presentation on the carbon cycle. Coils of warmly hued yarn hung from the doorways. They came via a local nonprofit dedicated to climate-friendly ranching practices called Fibershed. And draped over a chair was a T-shirt bearing what might as well have been Wick’s battle cry: “seq-C,” it read, punny shorthand for “sequester carbon.” Under that it read, “Doing it in the dirt.” Down the road, he showed me a composting facility that Creque dreamed up initially. He and Wick hoped it would serve as a self-sustaining prototype. “Anything that has ever been alive can be composted,” he told me, surveying the 10-foot-tall piles of chicken droppings and feathers, horse bedding (manure and straw) and shredded trees. A tractor mixed woody refuse with animal waste — to get the composting process started requires the right mix of carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. (That’s why some backyard composters recommend urinating on the pile to kick things off: Urine is rich in nitrogen.) Across the lot, a hulking machine straddled rows of steaming black compost, turning them with a metal spinner. Compost has to be regularly “fluffed,” or aerated, Wick explained, to prevent anaerobic microbes from producing methane and nitrous oxide. The manure piles were acrid, but the compost itself had a rich and pleasant odor, like cigars. Wick hopes that facilities like this will someday dot the American agricultural landscape. The idea is to manufacture compost close to both its source material and the place where it will be used, obviating the emissions from carting heavy materials over long distances. The plant also embodied Wick’s contention that composting can help farm carbon and manage waste at the same time. The challenge of affordably creating millions of tons of compost and applying it to great expanses of land is formidable. But there is a pleasing symmetry to the idea that we could use waste to bring the excess carbon in the atmosphere back to Earth, all while making the world lusher and more bountiful. When I first got in touch with Wick, in late 2016, he greeted me with a question: “Do you know how the earth’s atmosphere was oxygenated?” He was referring to a period 2.3 billion years ago when oxygen, produced by photosynthetic organisms, began building up in the atmosphere, prompting a mass extinction and clearing the way for multicellular life (and, eventually, humans). “Cyanobacteria?” I guessed. “Very good,” he said. “This might work.” Evidently I had passed some sort of scientific literacy test. But his bigger point was that living things — and particularly photosynthetic life — had always been the great engineers of the planet’s climate. Now, he believed, we could use that fact to our advantage. That sort of cosmic thinking about the planet and its history is ultimately what makes Wick’s vision so compelling and potentially powerful. The essential insight is one often overlooked when we talk about climate change: The element that threatens to smother civilization is also, in different forms, the fundamental building block of life. To prevent carbon from causing misery and destruction, perhaps we just need to change its location. Perhaps we can find a way to pull it from the air and restore it to the earth. "
463,"HONG KONG — China carried out live-fire military drills in the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, its state news media reported, an exercise intended to show the growing strength of its navy and deliver a message to self-governed Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. The war games were the first in the Taiwan Strait since 2016, Chinese state television reported. They were held in a two-square-mile area that includes two islets off the city of Quanzhou in Fujian Province. That area is about 125 miles west of the city of Hsinchu on Taiwan’s west coast. China has been increasing pressure on Taiwan in recent months, while the United States has taken steps to show support for the island, a longtime ally. While the drills Wednesday were most likely planned long in advance, they come at a time when the United States and China are increasingly at odds over a number of issues besides Taiwan, particularly trade. Liu Jieyi, the director of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said this week that the exercises were being planned with Taiwan in mind. “Our military exercises are carried out to protect the sovereignty of our motherland and territorial integrity,” he told reporters Monday on the sidelines of a cross-strait business conference in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Last week, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, attended large-scale exercises by the country’s navy off Hainan Island in the South China Sea. He was shown on state television wearing camouflage fatigues and watching as fighter jets took off from the Liaoning, China’s first aircraft carrier. Those exercises, which included 48 ships, 76 aircraft and more than 10,000 personnel, were the largest ever carried out by the People’s Liberation Army Navy, the state news media said. "
464,       
465,"WASHINGTON — A day after President Trump promised to slash the red tape involved in weapons sales, the administration announced on Thursday a new policy that could vastly expand sales of armed drones, a contentious emblem of the shift toward remotely controlled warfare. That change, in addition to a newly released update to the policy governing which nations are allowed to buy sophisticated American-made weapons, is intended to accelerate arms sales, a key priority of Mr. Trump. The president seemed to foreshadow the new policies on Wednesday night, when he said at a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan that after allies order weapons from the United States, “we will get it taken care of, and they will get their equipment rapidly.” “It would be, in some cases, years before orders would take place because of bureaucracy with Department of Defense, State Department,” Mr. Trump said. “We are short-circuiting that. It’s now going to be a matter of days. If they’re our allies, we are going to help them get this very important, great military equipment.” The new policies, though, will do little to change the often yearslong intervals between orders and deliveries of weapons, but the State Department announced that it intended over the next 90 days to re-evaluate the process that can sometimes lead to such gaps. Delays in delivering weapons systems have long been an irritant to foreign governments and domestic manufacturers, and almost every administration in the modern era has tried to fix the process. Top aides in the Trump White House have frequently called officials at the State Department and the Pentagon to try to hurry things along. "
466,"In early January, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer, filed a pair of lawsuits claiming that the political research firm Fusion GPS and the website BuzzFeed had defamed him by promoting the so-called Steele dossier, an intelligence report that alleged connections between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia. The dossier depicted Mr. Cohen as a central figure in what it described as a conspiracy. In the suits, Mr. Cohen complained that Fusion GPS had disseminated the dossier to reporters and that BuzzFeed put it on the internet, even though both companies knew that it contained what Mr. Cohen believed were lies. But much has changed in the past three months. Just last week, Mr. Cohen discovered that he is now the subject of a federal investigation seeking to determine if he broke the law by trying to tamp down scandals involving women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Because of that investigation, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer dropped both lawsuits in a sudden move on Wednesday night. “The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,” the lawyer, David M. Schwartz, said on Thursday. While Mr. Schwartz insisted that he still believes that BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS defamed Mr. Cohen, he added, “Given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.” Mr. Cohen’s chief complaint about the Steele dossier — a series of papers written by Christopher Steele, a former British spy — was its allegation that Mr. Cohen had secretly met last summer with a Russian official in Prague. Mr. Cohen has denied attending the meeting, and in one of the suits he said that the dossier’s defamatory claims turned him into “collateral damage in a U.S. political operation.” At the time the suits were filed — in Federal District Court in Manhattan and in State Supreme Court in Manhattan — Mr. Cohen’s lawyer said that he had sought legal action because it was the only way that he could “get back his reputation.” Last week, Fusion GPS responded with a court filing saying that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations and failed to “allege actual malice.” "
467,"With this week’s selection of titles, we put ourselves into the hands of experts: expert storytellers, expert thinkers, expert biographers of expert subjects. For instance? As the founding curator of the New York Public Library’s photography collection, Julia Van Haaften is a leading authority on the city’s rich photographic heritage — surely the right person to have produced the first major biography of Berenice Abbott, the larger-than-life artist who captured and defined New York City in some of the 20th century’s most arresting images. Read that, and spend some time lingering over the photos. Also for instance: We recommend fiction by the celebrated masters Thomas McGuane and Richard Powers — whose new novel, “The Overstory,” is reviewed by Barbara Kingsolver, speaking of experts — and nonfiction by Hannah Arendt (about politics), Barbara Ehrenreich (about mortality) and Ross Douthat (about the Catholic Church under Pope Francis). Other choices include a family memoir, a debut novel about a single gay mother, a ghost story and a Nordic thriller with shades of “The Silence of the Lambs.” And if the Abbott biography gets you thinking about the character and destiny of cities, you might want to settle in with Ben Austen’s “High-Risers,” about the ill-fated Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. It’s not a happy story, but it’s an important one, and Austen, a journalist who frequently writes about urban planning and housing issues, tells it expertly and well. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books BERENICE ABBOTT: A Life in Photography, by Julia Van Haaften. (Norton, $45.) The photographer Berenice Abbott (1898-1991) was born in Ohio and fled to Greenwich Village after dropping out after one year at Ohio State University. In 1920s Paris, she took sensitive and indelible portraits of Jean Cocteau, James Joyce and others. After returning to New York, she became a revolutionary chronicler of the modern metropolis. Julia Van Haaften, the founding curator of the New York Public Library’s photography collection, has written the first full-dress biography of her. “This is a vital work of American cultural history, and it wedges in so many personalities and vistas that it’s hard to know where to begin,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. NATURAL CAUSES: An Epidemic of Wellness, the Certainty of Dying, and Killing Ourselves to Live Longer, by Barbara Ehrenreich. (Twelve, $27.) At 76 years old, Barbara Ehrenreich has decided that she is old enough to die, and she has sworn off annual exams, cancer screenings and other measures those with health insurance are expected to take. “Natural Causes” takes aim at the wellness movement as a whole, at our tendency to treat aging as an outrage or, worse, as a sin. The book is “peevish, tender and deeply, distinctively odd,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “The pleasures of her prose are often local, in the animated language, especially where scientific descriptions are concerned. Her description of cells rushing to staunch a wound is so full of wonder and delight that it recalls Italo Calvino.” FUTUREFACE: A Family Mystery, an Epic Quest, and the Secret to Belonging, by Alex Wagner. (One World, $28.) Alex Wagner was born in 1977, in Washington, D.C. The only child of a Burmese mother and a white American father, she grew up listening to histories of “migrations, escapes, settlement, assimilation.” In “Futureface,” she embarks on a quest to find out as much as she can about both sides of her family, beyond the gauzy stories that have been handed down. The book “raises urgent questions having to do with history and complicity,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “Wagner is determined to look at her family with the coldest eye, making excuses for no one.” THE OVERSTORY, by Richard Powers. (Norton, $27.95.) The science of botany and the art of storytelling merge to ingenious effect in Powers’s magisterial new novel — a story in which people are merely the underbrush and the real protagonists are the trees that the human characters encounter. In her review, Barbara Kingsolver calls it a “monumental” book, and notes that by following various characters as they interact with the forest, Powers “accomplishes what few living writers from either camp, art or science, could attempt. Using the tools of story, he pulls readers heart-first into a perspective so much longer-lived and more subtly developed than the human purview that we gain glimpses of a vast, primordial sensibility, while watching our own kind get whittled down to size.” STRAY CITY, by Chelsey Johnson. (Custom House, $25.99.) Johnson’s engrossing debut novel explores a young, single, lesbian mother’s path to self-discovery and self-acceptance. “The sensitivity and insight with which Johnson treats Andrea’s bewilderment and shame … are among this novel’s many felicities,” our reviewer, Christine Sneed, writes, adding that “another of the novel’s delights” is “how clearly Johnson delineates the psychosexual dualities and prejudices of our culture, how effortlessly she instructs even as she entertains.” "

470,"Wells Fargo investors got yet another jolt of bad news on Thursday with the disclosure that regulators are poised to impose a $1 billion penalty on the bank for infractions related to mortgage rate extensions, auto loans, risk compliance and other matters. That comes on top of the $4.25 billion the bank set aside last year for liabilities related to its fake accounts scandal and the mortgage-backed securities issues it had before the financial crisis. It also paid a fine of $185 million in 2016 over the accounts scandal. In February, the Federal Reserve took Wells Fargo to the woodshed, ruling that the bank could not expand its balance sheet beyond the nearly $2 trillion in total assets that it reported at the end of 2017; it’s believed to be the first time the Fed has imposed such a curb on growth at a major bank. “We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank,” said the former Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, as she announced the move on her last day in the job. Even President Trump, ordinarily a champion of bank deregulation, piled on, saying on Twitter in February that fines and penalties against Wells Fargo for “their bad acts against their customers and others” will be “pursued and, if anything, substantially increased.” I’ve been a harsh critic of Wells Fargo’s previous management for fostering a culture of rule breaking and customer abuse, and for marginalizing as disloyal and even firing anyone at the bank with the courage and integrity to try to stop the illegal practices. But with the new $1 billion penalty, which is expected to be announced as soon as Friday, even I have to wonder: Has Wells Fargo been punished enough? "

473,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Irreversible damage to the Great Barrier Reef, a volcano erupts in Japan and Saudi Arabia screens “Black Panther.” Here’s what you need to know: • Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is no longer demanding that American troops be removed from South Korea as a condition for denuclearization, the South said. That removes a major obstacle to talks with the United States. “The North Koreans did not present any conditions that the United States could not accept,” President Moon Jae-in of South Korea told journalists in Seoul. If confirmed, the reversal could affect long-term U.S. military plans in the region and ease Washington’s reluctance to strike a deal with North Korea. The U.S. is also “fighting very diligently” to negotiate the release of three Korean-American prisoners in North Korea, President Trump said. Above, South Korean and U.S. Marines in a joint drill in July 2016. _____ • If the world economy is looking so great, why are global policymakers so gloomy? Worries about trade and debt are chief among the concerns of top officials gathering in Washington for the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings. President Trump tweeted last month that trade wars are “good, and easy to win,” but policymakers disagree. "
474,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell’s unilateral declaration this week that he would not allow a vote on legislation to protect the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provoked outrage from Democrats who said Mr. McConnell was giving President Trump carte blanche to oust the leader of the investigation into Russian election interference and the president’s inner circle. In reality, the bipartisan bill would stand little chance of passage even if Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, relented and allowed it to be debated and approved by the Senate. House Republicans are adamantly opposed. And if the bill somehow cleared Congress, Mr. Trump would have no incentive to sign a measure limiting his power. On top of that, the legislation might not be constitutional. But supporters of the bill are pressing ahead anyway, intensifying a dispute that underscores both rising concern among Republicans that Mr. Trump might fire Mr. Mueller and uncertainty about just how they would react if he did. Mr. McConnell’s stance has serious consequences. Backers of the legislation believe that a strong Senate show of support for Mr. Mueller and his inquiry would send an unmistakable signal to Mr. Trump that dismissing Mr. Mueller would present serious complications for his presidency. “It would send a message,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who recently endorsed the special counsel proposal written by two Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and two Democratic senators, Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Republicans both inside and outside the government warn that firing Mr. Mueller would be very unwise. "
475,"Kanye West is coming back with a vengeance — and two new albums. The rapper, who had been largely quiet in public since a dramatic spiral near the end of 2016 — during which he canceled a major tour, was hospitalized for a “psychiatric emergency” and angered some fans by meeting with then-President-elect Donald J. Trump before going dark — re-emerged recently on Twitter and in photos with his most frequent musical collaborators, stoking anticipation for a new release. On Thursday, Mr. West, 40, confirmed the whispers in his trademark off-the-cuff fashion, posting on Twitter, “my album is 7 songs,” followed two minutes later by a date: June 1. That was not all. Mr. West also announced a second album in collaboration with his on-again, off-again associate Kid Cudi due out June 8, according to his tweets: “it’s called Kids See Ghost,” Mr. West wrote. “That’s the name of our group.” Def Jam, Mr. West’s label, declined to comment further. The new music would be Mr. West’s much-anticipated follow-up to his seventh solo album, “The Life of Pablo,” which was released in February 2016. That body of work, too, had a less-than-traditional release: Mr. West debuted the songs during a fashion show at Madison Square Garden, released it a few days later as an exclusive on Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal and then continued to futz with the tracks, updating the music as he pleased. Things took a stranger turn during the rapper’s subsequent “Saint Pablo” tour, which attempted to redefine the arena show. Though critically acclaimed, the tour was abruptly halted — and later canceled — after Mr. West began cutting concerts short to express his grievances with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Mark Zuckerberg. “I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life — even at the risk of my own success, my own career,” he told one crowd. Mr. West had barely uttered a peep to his followers since, even after his hospitalization, which was never explained, until surfacing last week with a barrage of social media content. He also interviewed his interior designer, Axel Vervoordt, for The Hollywood Reporter, telling him, “I don’t wish to be number one anymore, I wish to be water.” On Twitter, such philosophical musings were mainlined directly to fans as Mr. West indicated he was writing a book “in real time” through the missives. “Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,” he wrote.

477,"WASHINGTON — Jake Tapper doesn’t seem to get rattled easily. He’s got a TV anchor’s unflappable poise and immovable hair, and radiates an almost eerie calm when a dozen explosive stories break during his daily CNN show. He’s weathered relentless online attacks from the right for his interrogations of Trump administration officials, and seemed unruffled when the president attacked him as a “CNN flunky” on Twitter. (Mr. Tapper retweeted the message, with an eye-roll emoji.) But during a recent interview at CNN’s Washington headquarters, Mr. Tapper confessed he was feeling nervous. On Tuesday, he’s publishing his first novel, “The Hellfire Club,” a political thriller set in 1954. It’s an ambitious debut, a meticulously researched work of historical fiction with a byzantine plot punctuated by explosive, Dan Brown-esque twists: a shootout at the Capitol, blackmail, murder, corruption, a stolen dossier, a terrorist attack at the House of Representatives and a top secret society made up of senior lawmakers, lawyers, chief executives and lobbyists, whose elite members engage in absinthe-fueled debauchery and other unsavory acts. Mr. Tapper has spent the last four years working on the novel — a seeming eternity for someone whose metabolism is attuned to the wild gyrations of the 24-hour news cycle, during one of the most volatile and unpredictable eras in the nation’s political history. And now that his book is about to come out, he’s feeling jittery. “It’s nerve wracking,” said Mr. Tapper, sitting at his desk in his office, an elaborately decorated shrine to political losers that’s brimming with campaign posters (the oldest, he proudly notes, is from Henry Clay’s failed presidential run in 1844). “You tinker with it until the last possible second. I can’t pick it up without thinking, oh, I wish I could change this word.” "
478,"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and longtime friend of President Trump, will join the president’s legal team in an effort to “quickly” resolve the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and possible ties to Trump associates. Mr. Trump will also bring on Jane Serene Raskin and Martin R. Raskin, former federal prosecutors based in Florida, according to Mr. Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow. Mr. Giuliani is himself a former federal prosecutor. “The president said: ‘Rudy is great. He has been my friend for a long time and wants to get this matter quickly resolved for the good of the country,’” Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. The three new lawyers give Mr. Trump a broader legal stable to rely on as he faces not just the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but the threat of an investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan into the president’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen. Federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room last week. Mr. Trump has a difficult time retaining top-flight lawyers as the inquiries have increasingly unsettled him, and he has angrily chafed against his lawyers’ legal strategies. Mr. Trump and his associates believe the issues in New York pose a far greater challenge to the president than even Mr. Mueller’s investigation. They do not know what was taken from Mr. Cohen’s office, and it is not clear what exactly investigators are looking into. But the fact that the authorities were able to get a federal judge to give them permission to raid Mr. Cohen’s office and residences has led Mr. Trump and his associates to believe the government possesses some evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Cohen. "
479,"HOUSTON — It’s going to be strange, living in Houston without Barbara Bush. She was so much a part of this place, even if many of us just imagined that we had anything to do with her. All those literacy galas starring best-selling authors, the loyal appearances at Astros games (thank God she lived to see them win the World Series!), the endless questions about who she would and would not support, and the bracingly frank answers that often seemed a little jolting in a country-club Republican wife. (See most recently: “I don’t know how women” could vote for Donald Trump.) Unlike so many flash-in-the-pan socialites here, Mrs. Bush reigned like a semi-benevolent monarch for decades, particularly after she and 41 moved back to Houston permanently in the 1990s, following that painful loss to Bill Clinton. And once 43 took over the White House in 2000, the Bush stock, which never hit a low here, began to rise precipitously again. It will be very hard to forget all those dinner parties where to say an unkind word about any member of the Bush family was to assure that you were never, ever invited back. In the beginning, they didn’t cause much of a fuss. The Bushes came to Houston from West Texas in 1962, when George H.W. had already set the family on the path to wealth as president of a small oil company. Back then, there were lots of families who were linked to the oil business, and many of them were, well, more colorful. The Bushes were just another pair of Yankee immigrants without much flash, which in those days was the behavior of choice. Then George got into politics, running for president of the Harris County Republican Party in ’62. Most Texans were Democrats back then — even if they were right-wing Democrats — and Barbara’s introduction to local politics sounds about right. She got a flier in the mail calling her father, a publisher of women’s magazines, “a tool of the Commies,” as she wrote in her autobiography, and when she canvassed a neighborhood for her husband a woman kept spitting in her flowerpot while Mrs. Bush asked for her support. Another not-so-potential supporter answered the door in his underwear “and didn’t seem to mind a bit.” “There was some discussion about making George wear a cowboy hat to make him appear more Texan,” Mrs. Bush wrote, when things didn’t look so good. That idea didn’t fly, even if Mr. Bush had proved himself to be a real Texas oilman out in Midland. The truth was, the Bushes lived in Houston as they had lived on the East Coast, like well-bred Yankees. Their friends were other people who acted like Yankees, even if they weren’t real Yankees, like James Baker (the Hill School and Princeton had limited appeal in Houston then). Robert Mosbacher was, on the other hand, a sailing champion in football territory. "
480,"HAVANA — As soon as Cuba and the Obama administration decided to restore diplomatic relations, decades of bitter stagnation began to give way. Embassies were being reopened. Americans streamed to the island. The curtain was suddenly pulled back from Cuba, a nation frozen out by the Cold War. But one mystery remained: While nearly everyone knew of Cuba’s president, Raúl Castro, his handpicked successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, was virtually unknown. So when members of the United States Congress visited Cuba in early 2015, they peppered Mr. Díaz-Canel with questions: What did he think of the revolution that defined the island’s politics and its place on the world stage? “I was born in 1960, after the revolution,” he told the group, according to lawmakers in the meeting. “I’m not the best person to answer your questions on the subject.” Mr. Díaz-Canel, who became Cuba’s new president on Thursday, the day before his 58th birthday, has spent his entire life in the service of a revolution he did not fight. Born one year after Fidel Castro’s forces took control of the island, Mr. Díaz-Canel is the first person outside the Castro dynasty to lead Cuba in decades. "
481,"By a lot of measures, these are very good times for the global economy. Nearly every major region of the planet is enjoying solid growth and prosperity simultaneously for the first time in a decade. Yet the world’s top  economic policymakers, who are gathered in Washington this week, are sounding awfully glum. “The present good times will not last for long,” said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, as he released the fund’s latest projections, which foresee a solid 3.9 percent expansion of the global economy in 2018. Or as his boss, the I.M.F. managing director Christine Lagarde, put it, “The current global picture is bright, but we can see darker clouds looming.” The pessimism among policymakers — who are attending spring meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank in Washington this week — contrasts with financial markets. Despite a bumpy couple of months, stocks and most other financial assets are still priced at levels that suggest growth will continue apace for some time to come. “Economists are paid to worry,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve. “We’re paid to find problems and challenges. I think the markets, on the other hand, are pretty good at living in the moment.” "
482,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Ted Appel was in his pajamas when the firestorm struck. It was 10 p.m. on Oct. 9 and what would become the most destructive wildfire in the history of California was bearing down on the city of Santa Rosa. Mr. Appel, the managing editor of the local newspaper, The Press Democrat, had to act fast. “I pulled reporters out of bed,” Mr. Appel said, thankful that he’d been alerted to the inferno by the veteran photographer Kent Porter. “We posted our first story at 12:35 and updated it 18 times by 6 a.m.” The PD, as the daily is known, quickly had 14 reporters and four photographers in the field. “Our people,” he said, “were in the teeth of it.” The firestorm lasted 30 days, killing 40 people and destroying more than 6,100 homes. Mr. Appel recalls an exhausting grind — part war zone, part marathon — that engulfed every member of his staff. The line between duty and safety soon blurred: Evacuated reporters slept in the newsroom, dogs and children ran between the desks. "
483,"James B. Comey is currently a lot of things: ex-director of the F.B.I., ex-United States attorney, author, moral crusader, “slimeball” (according to President Trump) and so ubiquitous that he is impossible to ignore. But whether you think he is a heroic truth teller or a self-aggrandizing grandstander, and there are arguments for both, what is indisputable is that he is also something else: a 21st-century embodiment of a 20th-century archetype rooted deep in American mythology. The ultimate G-man. With all the associations and expectations that image implies. If the Trump administration is its own reality show, Mr. Comey represents a character from a different Hollywood tradition. And if the goal of his book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” is to define what “ethical leadership” looks like — well. He’s providing an answer in more ways than one. Even though he is no longer, actually, a G-man — not since being fired by Mr. Trump last May. But oh boy, has he been dressing and acting the part in his appearances on George Stephanopoulos’s “20/20” special, “Good Morning America” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” And he is only going to get more omnipresent, thanks to a media blitz that includes appearances on “Today,” “The View,” “The Rachel Maddow Show” and CNN, and a book tour that lasts until May 25, with stops in New York; Chicago; Portland, Ore.; Washington; and Los Angeles (among other cities). Demand for some of those events is so high that tickets are being resold on sites like StubHub for hundreds of dollars. Mr. Comey stares out from small screens and promotional pictures everywhere — trailers, social media and reviews. He is steely eyed, often glancing upward, as to a higher goal, or resolutely ahead; dark, brush-cut hair just beginning to be smudged with gray; the squareness of his jawline matched only by the squareness of his shoulders, his 6-foot-8 frame often draped in layers of true blue.

486,"WASHINGTON — As trade tensions mount, an 84-year-old Washington institution could have been a powerful tool for President Trump. The institution, the Export-Import Bank, was created to help American companies compete overseas and bolster exports by providing cheap government-backed loans. But the institution, which once financed multibillion-dollar projects, has been effectively crippled by the Trump administration. The bank has been without a chairman since Mr. Trump took office and the last of the bank’s five board members quit in March. Since 2015, it has not had the quorum of at least three members it needs to finance deals or projects worth more than $10 million. The effective shuttering of the bank has put American manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric at a global disadvantage, prompting a frenzied lobbying campaign by business groups worried that the White House is undermining its own trade goals. “The Export-Import Bank plays a vital role in supporting American companies as they work to sell their products to customers across the world,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “But as long as the seats remain vacant, U.S. businesses are at a disadvantage relative to global competitors.” In the past, the bank had been used by large corporations like Boeing and General Electric, which received loan guarantees to sell products like airplanes, satellites and industrial equipment to developing countries, lifting sales and supporting American jobs. It has provided loan guarantees to overseas airlines looking to buy American-made jets and helped organizations like the Environmental Chemical Corporation build water facilities in Africa. Proponents of the bank, including some lawmakers, argue the institution could be a powerful weapon for a president who wants to increase domestic manufacturing and narrow the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports overseas.

496,"WASHINGTON — The number of new monthly prescriptions for medications that treat opioid addiction nearly doubled over the past two years, according to new data, while prescriptions for opioid painkillers continued to decline. The changing calculus reflects a stepping up of efforts among policymakers and the medical establishment to address the nation’s opioid epidemic, which is killing more than 115 people every day. But it also underscores questions about whether some pain patients are now being undertreated, and whether tightened prescribing over the last few years has contributed to the surge in overdose deaths from heroin and especially fentanyl. Although the number of people taking medications to combat addiction is rising, it remains a small fraction of the roughly 2.6 million people believed to suffer from “opioid use disorder,” or addiction. The federal government has estimated that about 20 percent of them are getting some kind of treatment, but of those, only about a third are getting buprenorphine, naltrexone or methadone, the three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Prescriptions for opioid painkillers have been dropping since 2011, but the trend accelerated last year with a decline of 10 percent from January through December, according to the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies prescription drug use and spending. The highest-dose prescriptions, equivalent to 90 milligrams or more of morphine daily, dropped even more sharply, by 16 percent. Over the course of 2016, high-dose prescriptions dropped by 14.3 percent and opioid prescriptions over all dropped by 1.5 percent. The number of people newly prescribed opioid pain medicine declined by 7.8 percent over the course of 2017, according to the report, after rising by less than 1 percent the previous year. The declines come amid a flurry of new insurance company policies and state laws setting limits on opioid prescribing. States have also been tracking opioid prescriptions more closely through electronic databases and requiring more doctors to check the databases for signs of “doctor shopping” or misuse before giving a patient opioids. In New Jersey, the former governor Chris Christie said this year that a new law limiting initial opioid prescriptions there to a five-day supply had led to a 15 percent decrease in overall opioid prescriptions.

499,"ALBANY — In the drama-laden race for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York — a contest that, although only one month old, has seen more fireworks than many campaigns ever do — the Working Families Party’s endorsement of Cynthia Nixon still stood out. The party’s decision on Saturday assured Ms. Nixon of a ballot line in November, gave her early bragging rights over the two-term incumbent, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and solidified her progressive bona fides. The endorsement also served as a catharsis to W.F.P.’s leaders, who likened it to breaking off a borderline abusive relationship. “You know the way you feel when you know you’ve done the right thing?” said Bill Lipton, the W.F.P.’s state director. “You sleep better at night.” As the dust settles on the party’s choice, the question remains of how, in practical terms — and how much, in political terms — the W.F.P. endorsement will help Ms. Nixon, an actress and educational activist making her first run for political office. The Working Families Party, a small but influential alliance built by labor unions and progressive activists, has become a force in local races, offering candidate and staff training, paid canvassers and organizers to fledgling campaigns. But as the party prepared to endorse Ms. Nixon, two powerful and prominent labor groups, with the governor’s blessing, pulled their support from the W.F.P. — a blow to the finances of the party, which has a $1.7 million yearly budget and a statewide staff of about 15 people.

Here’s the latest: • The Trumps hosted Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, the president and first lady of France, at the White House. At the top of the agenda: the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Macron vigorously supports. During a joint news conference, President Trump said he still thought the agreement was “terrible.” But he also said he could agree to “a new deal” negotiated by American and European officials if it was strong enough. Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron were particularly warm toward each other. We explore “le bromance” of the two presidents, which continued into the night at the Trumps’ first state dinner. On the fashion front, our critic weighed in on the wide-brimmed white hat Melania Trump donned for the arrival ceremony. "

503,"WASHINGTON — As Scott Pruitt, the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency, prepares to testify before Congress on Thursday amid a series of spending and ethics investigations, an internal E.P.A. document indicates that he may blame his staff for many of the decisions that have put a cloud over his tenure at the agency. The document, known as the “hot topics” list, appears to lay out talking points for Mr. Pruitt’s two sessions before the House of Representatives. It suggests that Mr. Pruitt is prepared to say that he now flies coach when traveling; that others were responsible for giving two close aides who used to work for him in Oklahoma substantial pay raises; and that E.P.A. officials who were reassigned or demoted after challenging his spending all had performance issues. The document, which The New York Times has reviewed and the veracity of which the E.P.A. did not dispute, seemed to be a work in progress. Mr. Pruitt’s responses may change on Thursday when he appears before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in the morning, and a House Appropriations Committee panel in the afternoon. His testimony coincides with rising calls from both Democrats and Republicans for Mr. Pruitt to step aside. He has been criticized for spending more than $3 million on security in his first year in office, a figure that includes salary and overtime for his security detail of more than 20 people, some of whom have been dispatched to protect Mr. Pruitt on private trips to Disneyland, professional basketball games and the 2018 Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Republicans in both chambers of Congress are increasingly raising concerns about Mr. Pruitt. “They’re not good reports,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate. “He has to answer those questions. There’s a lot of stuff out there that is certainly not helpful to his or the administration’s cause.” "

505,"Team owners, players and league executives held a confidential meeting in October, when they were under sharp criticism from President Trump over national anthem protests. During the three-hour session, the owners were particularly eager to find a way to avoid further public rebukes from Mr. Trump. [The full story on the private meeting is here.] "
506,"N.F.L. owners, players and league executives, about 30 in all, convened urgently at the league’s headquarters on Park Avenue in October, nearly a month after President Trump began deriding the league and its players over protests during the national anthem. It was an extraordinary summit; rarely do owners and players meet in this manner. But the president’s remarks about players who were kneeling during the anthem had catalyzed a level of public hostility that the N.F.L. had never experienced. In the spirit of partnership at the meeting, the owners decided that they and the players should sit in alternating seats around the large table, which featured an N.F.L. logo in the middle. “Let’s make sure that we keep this confidential,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said to begin the session. The New York Times has obtained an audio recording of the roughly three-hour meeting, and several people in the room corroborated details of the gathering. The unvarnished conversation reveals how the leaders of the most dominant sports league in the country and several of its most outspoken players confronted an unprecedented moment — mostly by talking past one another. [‘Divisive’ and ‘Disastrous’: Here are the most biting comments N.F.L. owners made about Trump.] The players sounded aggrieved. After discussing a proposal to finance nonprofit groups to address player concerns, they wanted to talk about why Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who started the anthem protests to highlight social injustice and police brutality against African-Americans, was, they believed, being blackballed by the owners. The owners sounded panicked about their business under attack, and wanted to focus on damage control. "

Yes, their candidate in an Arizona special House election lost, by five percentage points. But don’t be distracted by that. The district is overwhelmingly Republican. The Arizona result — along with several state-legislature races in New York — is consistent with that of dozens of other special elections so far this year and last year: Democrats are running far, far ahead of their 2014 and 2016 showings. Their performance suggests they are more likely to retake the House than not. Of course, there is still a lot that could happen between now and November. Reader project. A couple of weeks ago, I asked readers of this newsletter: Which political views that you disagree with do you nonetheless want to read? And on social media, I asked a related question: Which views are underrepresented in the national media? In both cases, I also asked which views readers considered beyond the pale of productive debate. The issue has obviously been in the news lately. Some Times readers have been upset by a couple of recently hired conservative writers here. The Washington Post faced similar criticism for its hiring of the libertarian-leaning Megan McArdle. And The Atlantic hired and — after a debate over his support for executing women who have had abortions — fired the writer Kevin Williamson. Nearly a thousand of you replied to my questions. Both I and my colleagues are grateful for the thoughtfulness of so many of the responses. We’ve now published an article about your thoughts, with extensive quotes. There were a few main themes: 1. The national media should expand the boundaries of the debate. 2. There should be more conservative arguments, especially the nonelite conservatism that helps explain Trump’s rise. 3. The media has many center-left voices. It needs more unabashedly left-wing voices. 4. The media’s voices are too male, too white, too privileged and too American. 5. Some positions don’t deserve a national platform. But don’t just rely on my quick description. Read for yourself what readers have to say. Technical difficulty.

510,"BEIJING — When President Xi Jinping announced measures to further open up China’s auto industry to foreign carmakers, the global industry initially cheered. Now the cheering has stopped. As details are emerging, foreign auto executives attending China’s annual auto show in Beijing this week said Mr. Xi’s initiative was too narrow and vague to change business on the ground. That means the initiative may not be a strong enough starting point for talks to stave off the Trump administration’s threats to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese-made goods. Central to Mr. Xi’s plan is that it will allow foreign automakers to own Chinese factories, instead of working through a 50-50 Chinese partner, as is currently required. But auto executives in Beijing said they were comfortable with the current system. “It would be crazy to think you can do it all yourself, in a market that is so different,” said Trevor Worthington, Ford’s vice president for product development in Asia and the Pacific. President Trump is sending to Beijing late next week a negotiating team that includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. Autos are one of the issues on the agenda. The Trump administration has accused Beijing of forcing foreign companies to share or reveal their technology as a price of doing business in China, particularly in futuristic areas like electric cars. Mr. Xi’s plan to further open up China’s auto market was seen as a potential olive branch. It calls for phasing out by 2022 the Beijing government’s requirement that any foreign automaker that wants to make cars in China do so through a 50-50 joint venture with a Chinese car company. For makers of electric cars, the requirement would end this year. He also said that China would reduce its 25 percent tariff on imported cars, without offering details. "

Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Facebook, engulfed in scandals stemming from the abuse of its network, has promised to spend large sums policing its operations, even if those outlays hurt the company’s bottom line. Facebook’s first-quarter results, released on Wednesday, gave the public a chance to see if Facebook is investing a lot more on cleaning up and securing its network. The company’s profits did not suffer much in the quarter. The results did show that expenses went up, and a company executive said on a conference call that security spending in part drove the increases. Still, the expense numbers did not provide clear evidence that Facebook is going the extra mile to police its network. Stamping out abuse was not the only cause of Facebook’s higher expenses – and the company’s costs are more or less in proportion to the levels of past quarters. Here are some relevant numbers. • On the conference call, David Wehner, Facebook’s C.F.O., highlighted a 51 percent increase in sales and marketing expense, the company’s third-biggest expense item. One of the drivers of the increase was spending on protecting the Facebook community, he said. But there were other factors, he added, like spending on what he called innovation. "
512,"The Trump presidency has sparked a debate about which voices are — and aren’t — reflected in the national media. Many publications have been criticized for publishing too narrow a range of opinions. And several publications, including The Times, The Atlantic and The Washington Post, have recently made high-profile conservative hires. I recently asked Times readers for their thoughts on the issue: Which opinions are underrepresented in the national media? And which if any should remain underrepresented because they’re beyond the pale of productive discourse? We have received almost 1,000 responses, via email and social media. Here, we describe some common themes from those replies: This was perhaps the most common response. There should be more writing from both pro-Trump conservatives and Jacobin-level socialists, as one reader, Andrew Ross, put it — “even though” (or maybe especially because) “elite readers may find their arguments objectionable.” Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab, called for a better airing of the “views of people whose politics are more than one standard deviation from the national mean.” A Twitter user named Rust Belt Jacobin summarized the missing as: “Leftists; Trump supporters; Latinos; working-class people.” In the 2016 Democratic primaries, for example, Bernie Sanders excited millions of people and won about 43 percent of the popular vote. Yet most national publications employed few if any opinion writers who preferred him over Hillary Clinton. Only a smattering of editorial boards endorsed Sanders: The San Francisco Examiner, The Seattle Times, The Daily Iowan and several alternative weeklies. The same broad point is true about Donald Trump. The Trump problem strikes me as trickier to solve, because so much of Trump’s political style depends on — and there’s no other accurate way to describe it — lying. I don’t think a publication would serve its readers by publishing columns arguing that Trump’s inaugural crowd set a record or that voter fraud was widespread. But the particular Trump phenomenon is different from a broader issue, as the next section shows.

516,"SEOUL, South Korea — The leaders of North and South Korea will meet for talks on Friday, a rare moment of face-to-face diplomacy after 70 years of bitter rivalry. Adding to the history-making stakes of Friday’s encounter is the prospect that if all goes well, President Trump and Kim Jong-un will have their own meeting in May or June. Those talks would be the first dialogue between a sitting American president and a leader of North Korea. On the table are issues that have bedeviled the Korean Peninsula for much of the 20th century, including an official end to the Korean War, as well as some that are already shaping the 21st, like the North’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. As Mr. Kim and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea prepare to meet at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village that straddles their countries’ border, here is what you need to know. The Korean War effectively ended in a stalemate in July 1953, after three years of fighting. The conflict, the first of the Cold War, pitted North Korea, a Communist dictatorship supported by China, against South Korea and its ally, the United States, which led a United Nations force. Generals from North Korea, China and the United States signed the 1953 armistice at Panmunjom. The South Korean leader, Syngman Rhee, however, refused to sign. "

519,"MAKE TROUBLE
Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead
By Cecile Richards with Lauren Peterson
304 pp. Touchstone. $27. Cecile Richards — the outgoing president of Planned Parenthood — may look calm and unflappable with her trademark blue suits and neat cap of golden hair, but she’s a troublemaker from way back. As a sixth grader in Dallas she refused to say the Lord’s Prayer in class. As a junior high schooler in Austin, she wore a black armband to express solidarity with the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, infuriating the principal. The rest is history. “Make Trouble” takes us through Richards’s life in activism and politics: Before Planned Parenthood, she had a full and varied career that included union organizing, starting the progressive organization America Votes and working for Nancy Pelosi. But there’s lots more, including loving depictions of family and friends, from the legendary Texas journalist Molly Ivins to her mother, Ann Richards, the “frustrated housewife” who became a beloved governor of Texas. Richards paints some vivid pictures of life in politics, too. For example, despite misgivings, she reached out to Ivanka Trump after hearing that she might want to help Planned Parenthood. They met at a Trump golf club in New Jersey, where Ivanka and her husband, Jared, offered her a deal: If Planned Parenthood stopped performing abortions, funding for birth control might go up. “Jared and Ivanka were there for one reason: to deliver a political win. In their eyes, if they could stop Planned Parenthood from providing abortions, it would confirm their reputation as savvy dealmakers. It was surreal, essentially being asked to barter away women’s rights for more money.” Books by public figures, especially when written with help from others — Lauren Peterson is a speechwriter — are often pretty deadly, but “Make Trouble” manages to be genial, engaging and humorous. (“It was almost like dealing with kidnappers,” is how Richards describes the months of waking to find yet another doctored video claiming to prove that Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue.) She’s good at sharing credit and giving praise — especially to her husband, the longtime labor organizer Kirk Adams, who was always game to move to a new city, take on a new adventure and pitch in with raising their three children. Her portrait of Nancy Pelosi as a nice person, a thoughtful boss and a brilliant strategist largely responsible for the passage of the Affordable Care Act (without the Stupak amendment that would have banned insurance coverage for abortion) is a pleasant corrective to the increasingly common view of her as an incompetent witch. As its title implies, this is not just a memoir but a call to action. Richards wants you to know that you too can make social change. She also wants you to know that a life of social activism is fun. She offers career advice (“never turn down a new opportunity”) and even travel tips (“try to know where the best ice cream is in any given airport terminal”). Considering how often progressives are portrayed as joyless scolds, this is a message that needs to get out more. There’s a lot of satisfaction in activism, even if you don’t win every battle. "

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump has shown a lot of affection for Emmanuel Macron during the French president’s visit to the White House this week. His handshakes seem to last a little too long, fingers get tangled, cheek-kisses flow abundantly. The late-night hosts rolled the tapes and let the jokes fly. One incident was a little less affectionate, but at least as awkward: Standing next to Macron, Trump told reporters he’d found dandruff on the French leader’s jacket. At one point in the visit Trump appeared to be trying to hold his wife, Melania’s, hand, while she avoided contact. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson’s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department has hit a major roadblock, with a number of serious accusations emerging against him in recent days. "

525,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician nominated to lead the Veterans Affairs Department, provided such “a large supply” of Percocet, a prescription opioid, to a White House Military Office staff member that he threw his own medical staff “into a panic” when it could not account for the missing drugs, according to a summary of questionable deeds compiled by the Democratic staff of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. A nurse on his staff said Dr. Jackson had written himself prescriptions, and when caught, he simply asked a physician assistant to provide him with the medication. And at a Secret Service going away party, the doctor got intoxicated and “wrecked a government vehicle,” according to the summary. The two-page document, distributed by committee Democrats, fleshes out three categories of accusations — prescription drug misuse, hostile work environment and drunkenness — that threaten to derail President Trump’s nominee. Committee staff members say the summary details the testimony of 23 current and former colleagues of Dr. Jackson, many of whom are still in the military. An aide to Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the committee, said each allegation included in the document was based on information provided by two or more individuals. The new details came as White House officials on Wednesday ratcheted up their public defense of Dr. Jackson, calling the charges of workplace misconduct “outrageous,” even as new episodes of questionable conduct surfaced.

526,"Before she became a comedian, Michelle Wolf was a high school track star whose experience as a high jumper taught her a lasting metaphor about life. A high jumper, Ms. Wolf recently explained, must leap over a bar raised to increasingly greater heights until she inevitably fails to clear it. “You could have the best jump of your career, and then you still end on a failure,” she said. “It’s like, ‘Yeah, that was your best — but you could do better.’” That nagging insecurity has gone hand in hand with the rapid accomplishments of Ms. Wolf, a 32-year-old stand-up who has contributed to “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah.” Among her latest career high points: On Saturday, she will be the featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, the annual, increasingly fraught Washington gathering of news media figures, politicians and celebrities. Then on May 27, her new topical comedy series, “The Break With Michelle Wolf,” will make its debut on Netflix. "

We thought: This is Europe’s problem, not ours, and we don’t want to be overrun by “those people.” Today President Trump is again slamming the door on desperate refugees. Indeed, the Trump administration is going a step further by wrenching children from the arms of asylum-seekers, apparently as a way of inflicting gratuitous cruelty to discourage new arrivals. José Demar Fuentes, a 30-year-old college graduate, arrived in November with his 1-year-old son, Mateo, from El Salvador, where Fuentes was on a gang’s execution list, according to his lawyer, Noreen Barcena. Father and son entered the United States legally, presenting themselves to an immigration officer, providing birth certificates and other documentation, and requesting asylum to save their lives. Several days later, immigration officers came and took Mateo. “They basically pried my client’s son from his arms and told him that he had to give up his son,” Barcena told me. “They were both crying.” Mateo ended up in foster care in Texas for about three months and had little or no contact with his family. Even kidnappers allow more communication. Caitlin Dickerson of The Times reported that more than 700 children have been separated from immigrant parents since October. "

531,"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, will invoke his Fifth Amendment right in a lawsuit filed against the president by Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star better known as Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen’s decision, disclosed Wednesday in a court filing in California, where the suit was filed, came a day before a federal judge in Manhattan was set to hold a hearing regarding materials seized from Mr. Cohen during an F.B.I. raid earlier this month. Mr. Cohen cited the Manhattan investigation in his filing on Wednesday, saying that, if called as a witness in Ms. Clifford’s lawsuit, “I will assert my 5th Amendment rights in connection with all proceedings in this case due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the F.B.I. and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.” Ms. Clifford was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about claims that she had an affair with Mr. Trump. She sued last month to get out of the nondisclosure agreement she signed in October 2016, alleging that it was void because Mr. Trump had never signed it. Citing the Fifth Amendment in the Clifford case allows Mr. Cohen to avoid being deposed and revealing sensitive information in the more important criminal investigation. That investigation — which prosecutors say has been going on for months — became public in dramatic fashion on April 9, when agents from the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and a room at the Loews Regency Hotel he had been using. The inquiry is said to be focusing on hush-money payments that Mr. Cohen made to — or helped arrange for — Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who has also said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.

533,"WASHINGTON — The United States is pushing to quickly conclude a revised North American Free Trade Agreement during talks in Washington this week, but another, potentially insurmountable obstacle looms: getting such a deal through Congress. A revised deal with Canada and Mexico will need approval from the Senate and House, which, under current trade laws, must pass the revamped agreement by a simple majority. But Republicans may balk at some of the provisions, including overhauls to investment rules that help companies invest abroad, while Democrats, who have long criticized the existing deal, may argue that President Trump’s changes do not go far enough. Congressional approval has become the latest sticking point in the revamp of a trade pact that, after eight months of fractious negotiations, could finally be in reach. Ministers from Canada, Mexico and the United States were scheduled to temporarily wrap up talks on Thursday, but lower-level negotiators could continue meeting into next week. The three countries are making progress on the rules for manufacturing automobiles in North America, but they have yet to near consensus on other contentious parts, like methods for settling trade disputes, or patents for medicines, people briefed on the discussions said. Deadlines are now looming to complete negotiations and the administration is seeking to conclude a final deal in the next two to six weeks, before presidential elections in Mexico and midterm congressional elections in the United States. Administration officials want to announce an agreement in principle before next week, when Robert Lighthizer, the top trade adviser, is scheduled to travel to China for trade talks. That is also when a temporary exemption that the United States has granted Canada and Mexico from new steel and aluminum tariffs officially expires. A quick agreement would give the administration sufficient time to make the necessary notifications to Congress that are required under current law while still having the Republican-controlled Congress vote on the deal in a lame-duck session — after midterm elections that could allow Democrats to reclaim the House and potentially the Senate, but before newly elected lawmakers take their seats. "

535,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions evaded lawmakers’ questions on Wednesday about whether his longstanding recusal from campaign-related investigations extended to the Justice Department inquiry into President Trump’s personal lawyer, saying only that he would not confirm the existence of the investigation itself. “I should not answer that question,” he said in testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, citing departmental rules about refraining from publicly discussing ongoing inquiries. “It would be inappropriate.” The wide-ranging corruption investigation into the lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has further strained the ties between the president and his top Justice Department officials. Their relationship has been fraught since Mr. Sessions recused himself last year from oversight of all campaign-related investigations, including the examination of Russia’s election interference and possible ties to Trump associates. The topic of recusal is particularly sensitive for Mr. Sessions, once a close ally of Mr. Trump and one of his earliest political supporters. By refusing to answer lawmakers’ questions about the Cohen investigation, Mr. Sessions avoided further wrath from Mr. Trump if he were to conclude that his attorney general had stepped back from an inquiry that the president is said to view as a greater threat than the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling. Mr. Sessions also demurred when asked whether he would quit if the president or his allies fired Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who oversees the special counsel investigation. “The question calls for speculation,” Mr. Sessions said. “I am not able to do that.” In stepping aside, Mr. Sessions cited his support for Mr. Trump during the presidential race as a potential conflict and said he was following Justice Department guidelines. But the president, who has said he viewed Mr. Sessions as a protector in his role as attorney general, has chafed about it since. The recusal helped lead to the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. "

538,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has proposed legislation that could triple rents on the poorest tenants in federally subsidized housing as part of a push to redefine housing assistance as a temporary benefit instead of the permanent source of shelter it has become for millions of poor people. The legislation, spurred by Mr. Trump’s conservative budget director, Mick Mulvaney, and drafted by aides to Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, would also allow local governments to impose work requirements on tenants in public housing deemed fit for work. The plan would also increase rents for elderly and disabled people after six years, agency officials said. But the new rules would hit the poorest residents hardest, with minimum monthly rents in public housing developments and for recipients of Section 8 vouchers rising to $150 a month from $50. The increases would affect about 712,000 families over the next several years, HUD officials said. Rent hikes would gradually be phased in for tenants based on their income and other provisions that could effectively limit the amount of time some tenants would be allowed to remain in government-funded housing. “Every year, it takes more money, millions of dollars more, to serve the same number of households,” Mr. Carson told reporters Wednesday in a conference call. “It’s clear from a budget perspective and a human point of view that the current system is unsustainable.” "

President Trump and the rapper, Kanye West, share a history of unpredictable behavior — and a delight in freaking out and, perhaps, dividing an already divided public. On Wednesday, the Chicago-raised Mr. West and the Queens-born Mr. Trump joined forces again, this time on Twitter, with the president thanking Mr. West for his public praise, including an assertion that the two were brothers who shared “dragon energy.” In a string of tweets that seemed to outrage and concern his fans, Mr. West tried to defend his admiration for the president from “the mob” of people who “can’t make me not love him.” “You don’t have to agree with trump,” Mr. West tweeted. “I love everyone. I don’t agree with everything anyone does. That’s what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.” "

543,"WASHINGTON — Two back-to-back court developments this week indicate a possible road map for President Trump through the minefield of legal resistance he has faced as judges across the country have blocked much of his hard-line immigration agenda. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled in favor of an Obama-era immigration program but offered Mr. Trump the chance for a do-over, giving the president 90 days to provide a stronger legal justification to shut down the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects young immigrants from deportation. On Wednesday, in a separate case involving Mr. Trump’s efforts to ban travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, the Supreme Court strongly signaled that the administration’s third try at the issue would work. Questions by the justices indicated that they would most likely back Mr. Trump’s revised effort to assert executive authority over the border with “extreme vetting.” The judiciary has historically given presidents wide latitude to limit immigration, enforce the country’s borders and manage national security. Now, after a year and a half of deep skepticism about Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, legal experts said the courts are effectively saying that Mr. Trump can earn that kind of latitude if he goes about it the right way. “The courts are giving the Trump administration guidance on how to exercise their authority,” said Josh Blackman, an associate professor of law at the South Texas College of Law in Houston. On Tuesday’s DACA ruling, Mr. Blackman said, “This actually gives Trump a chance to clean it up and issue a new memo that will stand up on appeal.” Critics of Mr. Trump say they still believe the courts will rule against the president and declare his efforts unconstitutional.

546,"Despite it all, the Facebook juggernaut marches on. The social network is undergoing its worst crisis in its 14-year history as it faces a torrent of criticism about its privacy practices and the way it handles user data. But on Wednesday, Facebook showed that — as with past scandals — the controversy is so far doing little to hurt its bottom line. The Silicon Valley company reported a 63 increase in profit and a 49 percent jump in revenue for the first quarter, driven by continued growth in its mobile advertising business. Mobile advertising now represents more than 90 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue. The company also said that it added 70 million monthly active users last quarter, bringing it to 2.2 billion monthly active users as of March. The results sent Facebook’s shares up more than 7 percent in aftermarket trading on Wednesday, reflecting Wall Street’s willingness to shrug off the company’s privacy issues as long as the money keeps flowing in. “All the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. “All investors are looking for is a change in user metrics.” "

552,"Two prominent Hollywood production companies have acquired the rights to produce a film based on The New York Times’s coverage of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein, The Times confirmed on Thursday. The movie will follow the work of Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, investigative reporters at The Times, and their editor, Rebecca Corbett. The team’s reporting on Mr. Weinstein helped set off the #MeToo movement and earn The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service. The rights were bought by Plan B, a production company co-founded by Brad Pitt that produced “12 Years a Slave” and “Moonlight,” and Annapurna Pictures, founded by Megan Ellison, the company behind “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Phantom Thread.” In October, an article by Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein, one of the most powerful executives in Hollywood. That article, along with reporting by Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker, led to a global movement that would expose sexual misconduct by prominent men in numerous industries, as well as the everyday sexism and abuse experienced by millions of women. After the news broke, Mr. Weinstein told The Hollywood Reporter, “The story sounds so good, I want to buy the movie rights.” He was soon fired from the movie company he co-founded. Subsequent Times articles revealed many more victims of Mr. Weinstein’s harassment, including the actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow. By the end of October, the list of known allegations stretched back to the 1970s. The Times later documented how Mr. Weinstein’s abuses went unchecked for decades with help from his associates. The movie deal, first reported Wednesday by Deadline Hollywood, stemmed from a new partnership between The Times and Anonymous Content’s media rights division. Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey are also writing a book for Penguin Press. Despite the challenges facing the media industry, journalism has become a hot subject for mass entertainment. The movie “Spotlight,” about the Boston Globe investigation that uncovered sexual abuse of children within the Roman Catholic Church, won best picture at the 2016 Academy Awards, and “The Post,” about The Washington Post’s efforts to publish the Pentagon Papers, was a box office hit in late 2017 and early 2018. Next month, Showtime will start airing a prime-time documentary series, “The Fourth Estate,” that follows a group of Times journalists in New York and Washington as they cover the Trump administration and other major stories. The director, Liz Garbus, was granted behind-the-scenes access to the paper for more than a year. And on Wednesday, Netflix announced a weekly series, “Follow This,” that accompanies BuzzFeed News journalists on the job. "
553,"With less than 200 days until the midterm elections, Democrats are generally thought to have a slight advantage in the fight for control of the House. That doesn’t mean they are going to prevail. The polls could be wrong, as all should understand by now, and there’s more than enough time for the national political environment to turn in favor of the Republicans. But these four indicators, for now, are consistent with a Democratic edge. Here’s what they are and what they’re telling us. One of the best measures of the national political environment is the generic congressional ballot, a poll question asking voters whether they intend to support Democrats or Republicans in the next election. The final generic ballot numbers typically perform well in approximating the House popular vote. Even this far ahead of an election, the generic ballot can do a decent job of predicting the final results.  And Democrats can reasonably hope for their lead to grow, given the tendency of the measure to break toward the party out of power. The Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot is around seven points, one of their weakest leads of the last year. At their peak, in December, Democrats led by 13 points, after the passage of the Republican tax cut bill. Obviously, the larger the lead for the Democrats, the better their chances this November. But even a seven-point advantage is far from bad news for the party. In recent wave elections, the party out of power has won the House national popular vote by six to eight points. So there’s no contradiction between a seven-point Democratic edge and an extremely favorable national political environment. It’s also consistent with most of the reporting on the state of specific Republican incumbents. A recent Politico article, for instance, described Republican troubles in safe districts like North Carolina’s 13th, North Carolina’s Ninth, Virginia’s Second, Virginia’s Fifth and Virginia’s Seventh.

557,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee fired a political warning shot at the White House on Thursday, advancing on a bipartisan vote long-stalled legislation to allow special counsels such as Robert S. Mueller III to appeal their firing to a panel of judges and possibly be reinstated. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has stated unequivocally that he will not bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. But with four Republicans, including the committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, joining Democrats to vote in favor of it, the measure sent a clear message to President Trump that there would be serious consequences to firing the special counsel. Even senators who voted against the legislation warned Mr. Trump against trying to dismiss Mr. Mueller. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, said that “firing Mueller would cause a firestorm and bring the administration’s agenda to a halt. It could even result in impeachment.” Mr. Trump seemingly offered fresh reason for their concern earlier on Thursday. In a telephone interview with “Fox & Friends,” he again aired his frustration with the Justice Department and with Mr. Mueller’s team, which he dismissed as being filled with partisan Democrats. He said he had been trying not to interfere in matters before the Justice Department. But, Mr. Trump warned, “at some point I won’t.” Democrats have been clamoring for the Senate to move the legislation for weeks, as Mr. Trump has escalated his attacks on the special counsel investigation and contemplated removing key figures overseeing it. They claimed Thursday’s vote as a modest, if mostly symbolic, victory. “Frankly, I’ve never been so concerned that the walls protecting the independence and integrity of our law enforcement institutions are at risk of crumbling,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the longest-serving member of the Senate. “I’m hoping that the strong bipartisan stance we are taking today may save us from waking up to a tweetstorm that sends us careening toward a constitutional crisis.” "

Cohen and offered more details of negotiations with North Korea. He also made statements about Iran, unemployment among black Americans, his record on deregulation and the 2016 election results that were imprecise or lacked context. Below is an assessment. The United States did not directly give Iran money as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. But the United States and European nations did release about $100 billion — not $150 billion — in previously frozen Iranian assets. Much of that money is tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion. The Obama administration did transfer $1.7 billion — not $1.8 billion — to Iran in 2016. That money was delivered in cash, some of it on a plane. But it was a payment related to a decades-long dispute and was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. As The Times has previously reported: "

563,"LONDON — Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, escaped tough questioning during congressional testimony this month in part because American lawmakers weren’t well versed about how the social network functions. On Thursday, one of his deputies faced a decidedly sharper inquisition from a panel in Britain. The dueling experiences highlight the different approaches taken on both sides of the Atlantic toward oversight of personal data and the social media giants who hold it. While the United States has largely eschewed regulating companies like Facebook, Britain and other countries in Europe have taken more aggressive stances, seeking to make tighter rules to better protect consumer privacy. In London, Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, faced more than four hours of questions from a British parliamentary committee over the company’s data-collection techniques, oversight of app developers, fake accounts, political advertising and links to the voter-targeting firm Cambridge Analytica. If American politicians have been lampooned for being Luddites, the British Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has built a reputation for thoroughness and detailed questioning. Damian Collins, the committee’s chairman, had more than 11 pages of questions for Mr. Schroepfer, including how facial recognition technology is used and the methods Facebook uses to track people even when they are not on the site. “This is the pipe through which the fake news comes, and there doesn’t seem to be much you can do to control it,” Mr. Collins said. The committee, which has been questioning the use of social media to spread misinformation and influence elections, had invited Mr. Zuckerberg, but he declined. The British committee’s 14-month investigation is part of an aggressive campaign by European authorities to clamp down on powerful American tech giants. The probe comes as German antitrust regulators investigate Facebook, others investigate Google, and the European Union prepares to put in place a sweeping new privacy law that sets more restrictions on how companies gather and share data.

571,"WASHINGTON — President Trump distanced himself from his longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, on Thursday, saying that a federal criminal investigation was focused on Mr. Cohen’s business dealings and had nothing to do with his legal representation of the president. The president acknowledged that Mr. Cohen represents him in connection with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels who has asserted that she had extramarital sexual relations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election as part of what she now calls a “hush agreement.” But Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen did nothing wrong in that matter. Mr. Cohen handled just “a tiny, tiny little fraction” of his legal work, Mr. Trump said. “But Michael would represent me and represent me on some things,” the president said in a telephone call to “Fox & Friends,” his favorite cable television show. “He represents me, like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me.” “From what I see,” he continued, “he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going into this, which would have been a problem.” “From what I understand, they’re looking at his businesses,” he added. Discussing Mr. Cohen’s decision to decline to testify in a lawsuit by Ms. Clifford, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Mr. Trump said he was probably just following the advice of his own lawyers. “I’m not involved, and I’ve been told I’m not involved.” The president’s mention of Ms. Clifford was striking because he has mainly shown restraint in not discussing her.

Less trouble like the embarrassing territorial showdown that put the two countries on alert last year. Less worry of the kind India is feeling right now about rising Chinese influence on its doorstep, in Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives. Analysts say Mr. Modi is fixated on winning next year’s election in India. And it is a measure of the fraught relationship between China and India right now that he is seen as needing Mr. Xi’s help to do that. Officials from both countries are describing the leaders’ meeting, which came at India’s request, as a chance to “reset” relations. But it is clear that Mr. Modi will be seeking assurances from Mr. Xi. “Everything for Modi right now is about 2019,” said Manoj Joshi, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a policy and research organization in New Delhi. “He needs stability. He doesn’t want anything to make him look like he’s not the 56-inch-chest guy.” In the past, Mr. Modi has bragged about having a 56-inch chest measurement, apparently a symbol of strength. But that swagger was bruised last year after Chinese troops swept into a disputed area along the Bhutan-China border near to where Indian troops were based and started building a road.

As Democrats opened an aggressive, coordinated line of questioning — on Mr. Pruitt’s spending, housing arrangements, security team and raises for political appointees — he stayed quiet and calm, never raising his voice or his temper, but rarely giving direct answers to those questions.

Mr. Pruitt said he had delegated the authority to grant such approvals, or as he put it, “There was delegation given in my authority.” He said, “I was not aware of the amount, and I was not aware of the bypassing that was going on.” Mr. Tonko said the answer suggested “you have no idea what is going on” under Mr. Pruitt’s name at the agency. Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, was even more direct in his opening remarks Thursday morning. “You are unfit to hold public office and undeserving of the public trust,” he told Mr. Pruitt. “Every indication we have is you really should resign.” "

And the weapons aren’t cannon balls but rather the threatened withholding of federal money from “sanctuary” cities and states, the plan for the next census that would have the effect of shrinking liberal states’ representation in Congress, and the cap on tax deductions that will strike at residents of cities and states where high tax rates support decent public services. While California is most prominently in the administration’s cross hairs — “California better hold on tight,” Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said on Fox News in January — the free state of California is not the only target. Chilling headlines like a recent one in a local newspaper in New Haven — “ICE Lies in Wait at Elm Street Courthouse” — are appearing all over the country as federal agents stalk and capture undocumented immigrants and leave the rest of us to shudder at tactics we used to ascribe to countries we regarded with disdain. Those old enough to remember the Rehnquist federalism revolution of the 1990s and early 2000s will recall how startling it was when Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist’s long-sought majority began to rein in the federal government’s authority over the states with an enthusiasm and to a degree not seen since the early years of the New Deal. The federal government can’t “commandeer” the states to carry out its enforcement objectives, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote for the majority in a 1992 case, New York v. United States, invalidating a federal plan to oblige the states to help dispose of radioactive waste. “Congress must accord states the esteem due them as joint partners in a federal system,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in a 1999 case, Alden v. Maine, immunizing the states from suits for violations of federal labor law. For those who remember the unsettling decade when decisions like these poured from the Supreme Court, the current reversal of polarity is head-snapping. The Trump administration is not only commandeering local courthouses as convenient places to trap its prey, it also seeks to punish cities and states that resist. "

Here’s what we’re watching: • Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself. • Facebook can afford to clean up its act. • Is the problem with I.P.O.s a ‘middle-market tax’? • On today’s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard. Some links require subscriptions. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. One of the mysteries of modern banking is why Deutsche Bank’s retreat from Wall Street, announced Thursday, took so long. Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution’s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank’s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank’s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won’t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it’s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow: Hubris. Large banks that did rebound after the crisis were able to point to actions that allowed them to get ahead of challenges they faced. Perhaps the largest challenge was raising large amounts of capital to placate creditors and regulators. But compare Deutsche Bank’s capital raising to that of JPMorgan Chase. In 2011, Deutsche Bank’s tangible equity capital (common equity minus goodwill) was equivalent to 3.3 percent of its assets (counted in the same fashion as in the United States), whereas JPMorgan’s was at 5.7 percent. Notably, Deutsche Bank, by the end of 2017, still had not raised that ratio to JPMorgan’s 2011 level. JPMorgan’s ratio was 7.2 percent at the end of last year. When United States regulators proposed that large foreign banks maintain higher capital at their U.S. subsidiaries, Deutsche, which has a big presence in the United States, resisted and moved to avoid the requirements. But the United States regulators mostly held firm, which may be one reason Deutsche is finally retrenching. If Deutsche Bank’s German regulator had been tougher, the bank may have done more, earlier, to shore up its balance sheet. After all, it was stiff pressure from the Swiss central bank that helped prompt the overhauls at UBS and Credit Suisse. Fear. Deutsche Bank’s leaders may have worried that scaling back its investment bank would cause too much financial pain. Those operations last year provided 54 percent of the bank’s overall revenue, so paring back the investment bank could have a big impact on the top line. And Deutsche Bank’s investment bank hardly has the earnings to absorb the costs of a deep restructuring. In the first quarter of this year, a good period for Wall Street as a whole, Deutsche’s investment bank posted a paltry return on equity of 1.4 percent. The potential cost of a far-reaching restructuring is also hard to assess. Deutsche Bank may be entangled in uneconomic trades that would cost large sums to exit. Fears of toxic exposures were stoked earlier this month, when it was reported that the European Central Bank had asked Deutsche Bank to estimate the costs of winding down its trading operations. "

But inside the White House medical unit, a military-run office with a few dozen doctors and nurses, Dr. Jackson was viewed as a bully and someone who kept sloppy medical records, drank too much and loosely dispensed strong drugs to curry favor with the powerful politicians and political aides he admired. Three current and former colleagues said that Dr. Jackson was sometimes intoxicated during overseas trips and that staff members were often ordered to leave a bottle of rum and a Diet Coke in his hotel room. On Thursday, Dr. Jackson withdrew from consideration to join President Trump’s cabinet as the secretary of Veterans Affairs after those and other allegations about his behavior cascaded into public view. Dr. Jackson, Mr. Trump and numerous White House officials dating to the Obama presidency insisted none of it was true. “These false allegations have become a distraction for this president,” Dr. Jackson said. Dr. Robert G. Darling, a former White House physician to President Bill Clinton and a retired Navy emergency medicine doctor, said, “This is a guy who served this country, who is in this job pretty reluctantly, and now he’s getting hung out to dry.” But in a White House where everybody appears to be in everyone else’s business, a picture has emerged of a medical unit oddly disconnected from the larger executive offices of the president, where a small team of military medical professionals reports up a narrow chain of command out of view from the political realm. Witnesses to Dr. Jackson’s behavior spoke on the condition of anonymity because they continue to serve in the military. Dr. Jackson’s medical unit operates inside the White House, not far from the West Wing, where the president and his aides work. But an isolated managerial bubble allowed Dr. Jackson to serve three presidents for a decade while escaping scrutiny of alleged abuses of power and position. Dr. Jackson’s employees were not subordinates of the White House chief of staff or the president’s lawyer. Instead, the medical unit reported through a military chain of command to the little-known White House Military Office. "

597,"President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Washington was certainly grand theater: the hugs and kisses with President Trump, the dandruff whisked off his lapel, the first lady’s broad white hat, and then the 40-year-old French wunderkind rising before Congress to deliver a stern lecture in elegantly accented English on why the American president is wrong about multilateralism, protectionism, nationalism, Iran and climate change. Mr. Macron no doubt planned the bait-and-switch for some time. Other world leaders have tried different approaches to dealing with Mr. Trump, from joining him in a game of golf, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan did, to openly rebuking him, as President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico did this month. None have really worked. Nor is there much likelihood that the young French president, not yet a year in office, will have changed Mr. Trump’s mind in any meaningful way, even after being proclaimed “perfect” by his host. At a meeting with a group of journalists on Wednesday evening, Mr. Macron said that contrary to common wisdom, he found Mr. Trump to be “very predictable,” which would suggest that he did not expect the American president to be swayed by his Gallic reason. He acknowledged that he expected Mr. Trump to opt out of the Iran nuclear deal, and his goal, Mr. Macron said, was to position himself as an “honest broker” for the aftermath. If he achieves even that, it won’t be a bad outcome from the meeting. Mr. Macron’s goal from the outset of his presidency has been to assert France as the leader on global issues like climate change, European unity and resistance to right-wing nationalism and authoritarianism, and toward that end he has sought to forge comradely relations even with leaders who hold opposing views, whether by hosting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the imperial splendor of Versailles or getting touchy-feely with Mr. Trump. His trip to Washington was intended not only to court Mr. Trump but also to establish his credentials before the American public. A few days before his appearance on Capitol Hill, he had made a similarly ringing call on Europeans to defend democracy in a major speech before the European Parliament. "

The verdict marks the bottom of a fall as precipitous as any in show business history. The victim, Andrea Constand, above, was a Temple University employee Mr. Cosby had mentored. She took the stand as something of a proxy for more than 50 other women who have accused Mr. Cosby of abuse. None of the other accusations have resulted in prosecution. It took the jury two days to decide to convict Mr. Cosby, 80, of three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault. He could face up to 30 years in prison. A previous trial ended in a hung jury. And in between the two trials, the #MeToo movement took hold, which some have suggested may have played a part in the outcome. _____ "

602,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering executive action to further restrict the sale of Chinese telecommunications equipment in the United States, people briefed on the discussions said, in a move that could ratchet up tensions between China and the United States as the countries vie for technological dominance. The executive order, which could be released within days, is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China’s most prominent technology firms. Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption. The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology that is seen as a national security threat. In March, the Federal Communications Commission took action to block broadband companies that receive federal subsidies from buying equipment from suppliers that are deemed a risk to national security. In April, the Commerce Department barred ZTE from purchases of American technology for seven years, saying that the company failed to punish employees who violated United States sanctions. The Trump administration increasingly views national security and emerging technology as intertwined and has used its authority to protect national security as a way to block China from gaining an economic edge, particularly as it relates to that nation’s ambitious industrial policy, known as Made in China 2025. Both nations are racing to claim dominance in cutting-edge technology like autonomous vehicles and the next generation of wireless services, known as 5G. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said the Pentagon was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns. While the Pentagon cannot stop service members from buying the phones elsewhere, the spokesman, Maj. Dave Eastburn, said in an email that the Defense Department was directing American military personnel to be “mindful of the security risks posed by the use of Huawei devices, regardless of where they are purchased.” "

606,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has transferred a Guantánamo Bay prisoner to the custody of Saudi Arabia, a spokeswoman announced on Wednesday. The handoff is the first time a detainee has left the wartime prison under President Trump, who vowed to fill it back up but has now instead overseen a reduction in its population. The prisoner, Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi, is unlikely to be set free soon. American officials intend for him to serve the roughly nine years remaining in a 13-year sentence he received after pleading guilty before a military commission to terrorism-related offenses involving a 2002 Qaeda attack on a French-flagged oil tanker off Yemen’s coast. “My words will not do justice to what I lived through in these years and to the men I leave behind in prison,” Mr. Darbi said in a statement provided through his volunteer lawyer, Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at the City University of New York. “No one should remain at Guantánamo without a trial. There is no justice in that.” Mr. Darbi’s departure leaves 40 detainees at Guantánamo, down from 41 when President Barack Obama left office. The transfer comes as the Trump administration has been struggling to fulfill the president’s strong desire to back up his chest-thumping campaign rhetoric about Guantánamo, even as counterterrorism and security professionals, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have repeatedly argued that other approaches made more practical sense. Mr. Darbi was one of about 780 men whom the Bush administration took to the American naval base in Cuba during the early chaotic years of the war on terrorism. President George W. Bush’s claims that he could hold people there indefinitely without trial or judicial review and without obeying the Geneva Conventions — as well as early photos of men in orange jumpsuits kneeling before the cages of Camp X-Ray, the hastily constructed initial phase of the prison — turned Guantánamo into a charged symbol around the world of prisoner abuses and American power. But over time, court interventions gave prisoners rights to hearings and to humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions, and conditions improved at the prison. In his second term, Mr. Bush started trying to close it because, as he wrote in his memoir, “the detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies.” "

608,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week: Do we still have an acid rain problem? Are electric cars really clean? And what’s been happening at the E.P.A.? You remember acid rain, right? The fight to protect forests, streams and lakes from the effects of what is now often referred to as acid deposition is one of the great environmental success stories in the United States and Western Europe. But acid rain is still a problem in some parts of the world, notably India and much of Asia. In case you’ve forgotten, acid rain is produced primarily by emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from coal and other fossil-fuel-burning power plants and vehicles. The gases react with water vapor to form acids, which are washed out of the air by rain, snow, hail or even fog. The precipitation makes wetlands more acidic, which can be lethal for some fish. It also leaches aluminum from the soil, which can be toxic to both plants and aquatic organisms. The acidic water can also corrode stone buildings, sculptures and other objects. Acid rain can show up far from the source of the emissions, as the gases are transported by winds. In the United States, when the environmental impact of acid rain was first recognized as a problem in the 1960s and ’70s, scientists saw the effects in Northeastern forests, but traced the sulfur and nitrogen emissions to coal-fired plants in the Ohio Valley. The passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 led to some emissions cuts, and amendments in 1990 mandated sharper reductions, especially of sulfur dioxide. The act has worked well, said Douglas A. Burns, a biogeochemist with the United States Geological Survey in Troy, N.Y. Rainwater in the Northeast has seen about a tenfold decrease in acidity since the 1970s, Dr. Burns said. “It’s a great example of an environmental problem where we studied it, we took some action, and the problem improved,” he said. Some impacts linger, however. Soils that acid rain has stripped of calcium ions, for example, take a long time to recover. The ions are eventually replenished through weathering of rocks. “We see the improvement, it’s just kind of slow,” Dr. Burns said. Western Europe, where the impact of acid rain was first observed in Scandinavia, has seen great improvements as well, also a result of tighter environmental laws. But elsewhere around the world the situation is mixed, Dr. Burns said. There have been improvements in some former Soviet bloc countries in Eastern Europe, notably the Czech Republic. “They had a horrible problem in the 1980s,” Dr. Burns said, but have made great progress since becoming independent in the 1990s. But China is only roughly where the United States and Europe were in the 1980s. “They seem to be just starting to bring it a little under control,” he said. China’s emissions have resulted in acid rain affecting its neighbors Japan and South Korea. Acid rain is still a big problem in India, where emissions are increasing, Dr. Burns said. The impacts include corrosion of the marble facade of the Taj Mahal in Agra. We’re here to answer your questions about climate change. Send us yours via the form at the bottom of our climate Q. and A. Bhavya Sinha in Patna, India, asked us about electric cars: It’s true that in places where coal-fired power plants produce the biggest share of the electricity, the potential for electric cars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a serious question. A 2016 article in Scientific American argued that in coal-heavy places like Minnesota, driving electric might not be any better than driving a gasoline-powered vehicle. Nonetheless, there’s a strong case to be made that driving an electric vehicle produces fewer greenhouse gases than the average new gas-powered vehicle anywhere in the United States. That’s the conclusion of research published in 2015 by the Union of Concerned Scientists, and electric cars look even better in an update to the report released in March. The group performed a “well-to-wheels” analysis of what it takes to run the different types of vehicles, said David Reichmuth, an author of the study and senior engineer in the group’s clean vehicles program. The state-by-state variation is striking: To beat electric cars in Michigan, your gas vehicle would need to get 38 miles to the gallon. To beat electric cars in upstate New York, though, that gas car would have to do better than 191 m.p.g. Good luck with that. These issues are not just playing out across the United States. While comparisons can be difficult and the quality of data varies from country to country, it’s clear that driving an electric vehicle in a place like Norway, which produces energy almost entirely from renewable sources of power, is cleaner than running one in China, which is still heavily dependent on coal. Dr. Reichmuth noted, however, that China had committed to phase out coal over time, so with all countries, “it’s important to consider where they are going.” And, he added, “You don’t have to wait until the grid is perfect, you don’t have to wait until the cars are perfect, to go down that path.” A few things since we last spoke: We’d love your feedback on this newsletter.

609,"As the rogues’ gallery of fallen world leaders grows, you might be tempted to conclude that ours is the most corrupt era in history. Early last month, the former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $17 million for bribery, extortion and abuse of power. That same day, the former South African president Jacob Zuma, forced to resign in February by his own party, appeared in court to face charges over a $2.5 billion arms deal. The next day came an even bigger blow: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s former president and current front-runner in polls for October’s presidential election, began serving a 12-year jail term on corruption charges — in a federal police building he himself inaugurated more than a decade ago. Lula is a casualty of what may be the largest corruption scandal ever. An octopuslike bribery scheme carried out by the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht has spawned investigations in more than a dozen countries, implicating leaders from Chile to Colombia, Mexico to Mozambique. (The scandal has also led to a $3.5 billion fine levied by the United States Justice Department against Odebrecht and inspired a new Netflix series.) In Peru alone, three former presidents are facing trial or serving jail time on Odebrecht-related charges. With the crisis still metastasizing, it was hard not to be cynical when, in mid-April, the region’s presidents gathered in Lima for the Summit of the Americas to deliver high-minded speeches on this year’s theme: “Democratic Governance Against Corruption.” Donald Trump skipped the meeting, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. It was a measure of the speed of these unfolding scandals that the White House couldn’t keep up. Pence’s official schedule initially included “a banquet hosted by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru.” The only problem: Kuczynski was forced to resign three weeks earlier, one day before he was to face certain impeachment on corruption charges. Behind all these grim headlines, however, lies a larger and more encouraging truth: Corruption is being exposed, denounced and prosecuted more vigorously, and at higher levels, than ever. In Latin America, at least, these are not just momentary flare-ups at the scandal du jour; they seem to be the rumblings of a historic shift. “Judges, journalists and the public now have the strength to take on high-level corruption,” says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue. “It’s not that corruption is getting worse or better, but that societies are more willing and able to uncover it.” Corruption, of course, is an ancient temptation. Aristotle pondered its significance back in the 4th century B.C.E., around the same time the Indian philosopher Kautiliya enumerated the “40 ways of embezzlement.” Throughout history, there has been a spirited debate about whether corruption acts like “grease” (smoothing the way past red tape) or “sand” (clogging the system with unproductive costs and scaring off investment). In the 18th century, the Anglo-Dutch economist Bernard Mandeville contended, in his “Fable of the Bees,” that private vices by the “dextrous management of skilful politicians” could be turned into “publick benefits.” More recently, some academics have argued that corruption can serve as an economic lubricant in societies that have low levels of trust, weak legal institutions or feckless governments. As the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington wrote: “In terms of economic growth, the only thing worse than a society with a rigid, overcentralized, dishonest bureaucracy is one with a rigid, overcentralized, honest bureaucracy.” "

611,"JERUSALEM — In three bold moves this week — with F-15s, a PowerPoint presentation and the passage of a contentious new law — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strengthened his hand in trying to foil Iran’s strategic ambitions, while potentially pulling the two nations closer to direct conflict. In Syria late Sunday, F-15s, widely assumed to be Israel’s, struck facilities where Iran and its proxies had entrenched themselves. The attack on a storage site near Hama destroyed 200 missiles and killed at least 16 people, 11 of them Iranians. In Tel Aviv the next evening, Mr. Netanyahu gave a bravura PowerPoint performance on live television from inside the Defense Ministry, flaunting the booty pilfered from a secret Tehran warehouse by an intrepid Mossad team — evidence, he said, of Iranian deceit about its long-running efforts to develop a nuclear bomb. The revelation came less than two weeks before President Trump is to announce a decision on whether to withdraw from the international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Israeli officials portrayed it as an attempt to provide Mr. Trump — Mr. Netanyahu’s close ally — with backing for the decision, which they believe the president has already made. Even as Mr. Netanyahu was speaking, his coalition in Parliament was pushing through a bill that would shift the power to go to war or carry out a military operation from the full cabinet to the smaller security cabinet — and, under “extreme circumstances,” allow the prime minister and defense minister alone to order such action. In short order, Mr. Netanyahu had managed to exploit important political, military and intelligence advantages to advance his agenda on both the nuclear and conventional fronts, intensify the pressure on Iran, and free his hand under Israeli law to take the country to war without cabinet approval.

614,"Feeding reprehensible anti-Semitic myths and conspiracy theories in a speech on Monday, the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, shed all credibility as a trustworthy partner if the Palestinians and Israelis ever again have the nerve to try negotiations. Speaking to the Palestinian legislative body, Mr. Abbas, 82, said the mass murder of European Jews in the Holocaust was the result of the victims’ financial activities, not their religious identity and anti-Semitism. “So the Jewish question that was widespread throughout Europe was not against their religion, but against their social function, which relates to usury (unscrupulous money lending) and banking and such,” he said, according to the BBC. Mr. Abbas’s anti-Semitic tendencies are not new. In the 1980s, he wrote a dissertation that seemed to question the widely accepted Holocaust death toll of six million Jews. While seen as a successor to the longtime Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, in 2003 he played down that notion, saying, “The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind.” Things looked more hopeful in 1993 when, in glorious sunshine on the White House lawn, Mr. Abbas, then the foreign policy aide for the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, signed the Oslo Accords, which were supposed to eventually lead to two states and peace.

That statement, which Mr. Giuliani made Wednesday night on Fox News, contradicted the president, who has said he had no knowledge about any payment to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, to keep quiet before the election. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] Asked specifically last month by reporters aboard Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said, “No,” and referred questions to Mr. Cohen. He was then asked, “Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?” “No,” Mr. Trump responded. “I don’t know.” In an interview with The New York Times shortly after his Fox News appearance, Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and longtime Trump confidant who recently joined the president’s legal team, said that he had documentation showing that Mr. Trump had personally made the payment. Mr. Giuliani indicated that the goal was to conclusively demonstrate that there was no campaign finance violation involved. “That removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,” he said. Mr. Giuliani added that when the initial payment was made, Mr. Cohen did it “on his own authority.” "

621,"Speaking truth to power has long been central to how Kanye West navigates his art and his business. He lambastes the executives who don’t grant him full creative and financial freedom. He calls into question the empathy of a president on live television. He lays bare his emotions in ways that disrupt tidy narratives about celebrity comity. He is a lit match in search of a fuse, setting fires that people (largely) cheer for. But in the last couple of weeks, as Mr. West has begun his return to public life after a quiet year, the roles have switched: He is the power, and speaking truth to Kanye West has become the norm. This has manifested in many forms. T.I. recorded a song with him directly challenging Mr. West’s embrace of President Trump, including wearing a Make America Great Again hat. The radio personality Ebro Darden pushed back forcefully against Mr. West’s support of the black conservative pundit Candace Owens. On “TMZ Live,” Van Lathan, one of TMZ’s producers, berated Mr. West full-throatedly for his recent behavior, including his statement on the show that slavery was “a choice.” [What Kanye West said about slavery, Barack Obama and mental health.] These are behaviors, statements and sentiments that potentially pose the largest existential threat ever to the Kanye West empire. And so what’s played out over the past two weeks is a kind of psychological tug of war, with Mr. West reinforcing his most unsettling positions while, all around him, what amounts to a collective global rescue effort for his mind and soul (and, in truth, his legacy) is playing out in real time. The seeds of this moment are traceable to the final months of 2016, the last time Mr. West was so public, and one of the most troubled periods of his life. Within a period of weeks, his wife was robbed, his tour was canceled, and he was hospitalized. On “TMZ,” he said that during those months, he developed an addiction to prescription opioids. "

624,"WASHINGTON — A Washington consultant who was removed from President Trump’s transition team for using his business email address for government work played a central role last year in planning a trip to Australia for Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and then took steps to disguise his role, new documents show. The consultant, Matthew C. Freedman, who is also a former lobbyist for foreign governments, runs his own corporate advisory firm and is treasurer of the American Australian Council, a group that helps promote business for American-based companies in Australia. Two prominent members include Chevron and ConocoPhillips. Though the Australia trip never happened — it was canceled after Hurricane Harvey devastated much of the Texas Gulf Coast — it shows a pattern in which Mr. Pruitt has repeatedly relied on people with clear business interests to shape the agenda of his foreign travel. Separately last year, a trip to Morocco was organized by a lobbyist who later was hired by Morocco as a $40,000-a-month foreign agent to represent its interests abroad. Mr. Freedman has spent decades as an international political consultant and lobbyist, starting in the 1980s as an employee of Paul Manafort when the two men worked together to help the embattled Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Mr. Manafort later became Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, and many of his former lobbying associates entered Mr. Trump’s orbit, with some remaining in influential positions well after Mr. Manafort resigned from the campaign amid scrutiny of his work for Russia-aligned Ukrainian politicians. Mr. Manafort has since been indicted on charges related to that work by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Freedman worked on Mr. Trump’s transition team in late 2016 on national security-related issues. He was removed after conducting government business using an email address associated with his consulting firm, Global Impact Inc., which fed the impression that he was using his position with the transition team to drum up business, according to an adviser to the transition.

627,"BEIJING — For the last decade or so, China has defied the truism that only free and open societies can innovate. Even as the Communist Party has kept an iron grip on politics and discourse, the country’s technology industry has grown to rival Silicon Valley’s in sophistication and ambition. President Xi Jinping’s tilt toward strongman rule could put all that to the test. As Mr. Xi starts his second term, the Chinese government, which once viewed the internet primarily as a threat to its stranglehold on information, is harnessing big tech companies’ capital and knowledge to realize its broader goals for the country. At a time when the Trump administration is moving to counter China’s tech prowess, Beijing’s heavier hand could pose its own threat to the country’s competitiveness, and to the innovation that has transformed Chinese firms into global heavyweights. For China’s government, WeChat, the country’s most popular messaging and social media service, has become a key tool for policing what people say and do. Political activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations; chat records have turned up as evidence in court. The e-commerce titan Alibaba, meanwhile, is helping city authorities manage traffic. The police have used technology from WeChat’s parent company, Tencent, to monitor crowds at public events. JD.com, Alibaba’s main rival in online shopping, is helping China’s military to upgrade its procurement and logistics systems, state media reported recently. (A JD.com spokesman said, however, that its military cooperation was limited to the procurement of goods available to all customers on its site.) In scientific research — a focus for Mr. Xi as economic growth becomes harder to sustain — tech giants have joined with government institutes to run labs in fields like quantum computing, deep learning and human-computer interaction. Soon, Chinese citizens may even be able to use their accounts on Tencent’s and Alibaba’s apps as digital versions of their national ID cards. "
628,"LOS ANGELES — A caravan of migrants from Central America that recently trekked to the California border has grabbed the attention of the news media and President Trump. Of the 300 or so who made it to Tijuana, at least 150 are expected to claim asylum in the United States. “The likelihood of them getting asylum is very minimal,” said Thomas Haine, a former trial attorney for Immigration and Customs Enforcement who is now in private practice in San Diego. The biggest hurdle for the migrants is convincing an immigration judge that they belong to a particular social group — gay, transgender or a child soldier, for example — that could entitle them to asylum, since they cannot argue that they face persecution based on race, religion, nationality or political opinion. Generally, Central American migrants are fleeing gangs, drug cartels or other violence. But fearing for one’s life isn’t reason enough for asylum, Mr. Haine said. Border inspectors late Monday began allowing some asylum seekers into the country. Once processed at a port of entry, they will be transferred to a detention facility where they must pass a “credible-fear” interview. Those who clear the first hurdle will be referred to an immigration court for hearings that can stretch for months or longer. (Those who fail can be deported.) "
629,"KIEV, Ukraine — In the United States, Paul J. Manafort is facing prosecution on charges of money laundering and financial fraud stemming from his decade of work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. But in Ukraine, where officials are wary of offending President Trump, four meandering cases that involve Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, have been effectively frozen by Ukraine’s chief prosecutor. The cases are just too sensitive for a government deeply reliant on United States financial and military aid, and keenly aware of Mr. Trump’s distaste for the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into possible collusion between Russia and his campaign, some lawmakers say. The decision to halt the investigations by an anticorruption prosecutor was handed down at a delicate moment for Ukraine, as the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country sophisticated anti-tank missiles, called Javelins. The State Department issued an export license for the missiles on Dec. 22, and on March 2 the Pentagon announced final approval for the sale of 210 Javelins and 35 launching units. The order to halt investigations into Mr. Manafort came in early April. Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament who is an ally of President Petro O. Poroshenko, readily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort’s activities “in the long-term box.” "

Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries. While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to “significantly cut back” the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash. Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it’s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers. In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in. "

Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s lawyers have been trying to talk him out of accepting an interview with investigators for the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Legal experts say the questions Mr. Mueller wants to ask show why a meeting would be risky. Mr. Trump would need a detailed command of a range of issues, and his lawyers don’t know exactly what the special counsel has learned. Read our story, and if you missed it yesterday, here’s an annotated list of the questions themselves. As the president often likes to say, “We’ll see what happens.” • A group of House Republicans has drafted articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, over the Justice Department’s investigations of the president and his associates. On Tuesday, Mr. Rosenstein warned that the department “is not going to be extorted.” • The Trump administration has embraced Israeli claims that the Iran nuclear deal is flawed because it is based on false pretenses. That’s not how it’s seen in Europe, where officials said Israel’s disclosures broke little new ground and only reinforced the case for the 2015 agreement. "
636,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia — At the Paris climate summit meeting in December 2015, Canada’s freshly elected prime minister, Justin Trudeau, took the podium before his new international fan club and declared, “Canada is back, my friends!” The young, charismatic Mr. Trudeau promised “sunny ways.” He was ideally positioned to shift the country to a greener future, away from its reliance on resource industries and toward improved relations with Indigenous peoples whose territories are imperiled by energy projects. Yet more than halfway through his mandate, he has adopted the backward energy and economic policies of his predecessor Stephen Harper, an ardent fossil-fuel promoter. Mr. Trudeau has revealed himself to be not a climate crusader, but a pipeline pitchman who tells the world one thing while doing the opposite at home. Within a year of committing in Paris to ambitious targets, Mr. Trudeau and his federal Liberal Party had rendered his pledge meaningless. The government approved a pair of heavy-oil pipelines and a liquefied natural gas plant. Its members secretly cheered as Donald Trump was elected, and moved toward resurrecting the Keystone XL pipeline. (Two other pipeline projects were terminated earlier in Mr. Trudeau’s term, but he can’t take credit; one was quashed in court and the other was canceled by the company.) Hanging in the balance now is the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Edmonton, Alberta, to the outskirts of this city. The project, led by a subsidiary of the Texas-based energy company Kinder Morgan, and with investment from Canadian banks, would triple the flow of bitumen to the coast to 890,000 barrels a day and produce a sevenfold bump in tanker traffic. A heavy-oil spill could be catastrophic for Canada’s largest wild salmon run, many whale species and British Columbia’s multibillion-dollar tourism industry. The estimated carbon dioxide emissions associated with the project would equate to adding about 3 million cars a year to the road. Environmental activists have “warriored up.” The Trudeau government is now being pressured to answer an ultimatum by month’s end from the company, which is threatening to quit the project, said to cost 7.4 billion Canadian dollars ($5.9 billion). While campaigning, Mr. Trudeau made assurances about fixing the farcical environmental review process for prospective energy projects that was cultivated by Mr. Harper’s Conservatives. The Liberal government later announced it would adhere to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which requires “free, prior and informed consent” from First Nations where an industrial project threatens their traditional lands and waters. Canadians had good reason to believe he would take real steps toward change. "
637,"Over the last decade, the United States has pursued a foreign policy toward Latin America that married regional security and stability with democracy promotion and economic development. Under the Trump administration, that has begun to change — in an echo of the Cold War, narrowly defined national security concerns increasingly occupy center stage, with fear of invading migrants replacing fear of invading Communists. The word is out within the corridors of power in Latin America. Authoritarian and corrupt leaders and their allies are exploiting the new environment to discredit their opponents and position themselves as partners of the United States. Allowing them to advance their repressive and criminal agenda unchecked would be disastrous for Latin American citizens and American security. In many cases, President Trump has explicitly counteracted his predecessors’ policies. A long overdue thaw in American-Cuban relations, put in motion under President Barack Obama, was short-lived. The Trump administration refused to condemn the elections last November in Honduras, widely considered fraudulent, because a pro-American conservative won. The State Department subsequently turned a blind eye to the widespread repression of Hondurans who peacefully protested the results, certifying instead that Honduras was making progress on human rights. In Guatemala, the country where I have worked for over two decades since the end of a 36-year genocidal civil war, a similar and potentially catastrophic shift is in the making. For more than a decade, the United States has been an outspoken advocate of justice and the rule of law. It figured among the most avid supporters of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known by its Spanish initials as Cicig, a United Nations body established to root out organized criminal networks and promote judicial and legislative reforms aimed at consolidating democracy. It supported the election of attorneys general committed to working with the commission. American ambassadors attended human rights trials in a public show of support for victims of crimes against humanity. Ambassadors joined ranks with civilian protesters. I had the opportunity to travel with one former ambassador in to remote rural communities to highlight the economic needs and emphasize the equal citizenship rights of Guatemala’s indigenous people, who make up about 40 percent of the country and are overwhelmingly poor.

643,"WASHINGTON — President Trump hired on Wednesday a Washington lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment, a sign that the White House sees no immediate end to its legal problems and is girding for a combative relationship with a new Congress after the midterm elections. The new lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, will replace Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer who persuaded Mr. Trump to cooperate with the special counsel for the first year of its investigation. Mr. Cobb assured the president that doing so would bring the investigation to a swift end. That has not happened, and lawyers say the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is unlikely to conclude his work soon. Mr. Trump’s advisers see a new peril on the horizon: If Democrats win control of the House, they would have the authority to issue subpoenas or even convene impeachment hearings. Mr. Flood’s résumé is well suited for such fights. He jousted with Congress and an independent counsel during the Clinton administration. As a White House lawyer during George W. Bush’s second term, he helped fend off congressional investigations into the firing of federal prosecutors. And in private practice, he represented former Vice President Dick Cheney. “Emmet Flood will be joining the White House staff to represent the president and the administration against the Russia witch hunt,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement, adopting the president’s derisive label for the special counsel investigation. “Ty Cobb, a friend of the president, who has done a terrific job, will be retiring at the end of the month.” Like many veterans of the meandering, yearslong Clinton investigation, Mr. Flood has told people he is wary of special counsel inquiries. He has expressed concerns about the scope of Mr. Mueller’s investigation in particular, a view that resonates with the president. Mr. Cobb, by contrast, has expressed admiration for Mr. Mueller and has never adopted the president’s “witch hunt” language. "

645,"JERUSALEM — As Israel faces rising tensions with Iran, Syria and Gaza, its Parliament passed a new law allowing the prime minister and defense minister to decide alone whether their nation will go to war. The legislation, which comes after multiple attacks inside Syria widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, makes it much easier for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare war. Although the new law restricts the use of that power to “extreme circumstances,” it has provoked domestic criticism for concentrating it in the hands of just two people. The law is “nothing less than insane,” said Ofer Shelah, a legislator from the centrist Yesh Atid party, which sits in opposition. “I am deluged with calls from experienced security officials who are shocked, and rightfully so,” he wrote on Twitter. The measure, an amendment to the Basic Laws that serve as Israel’s constitution, passed on Monday night by a vote of 62 to 41 in the 120-seat Knesset. The vote was initially overshadowed by Mr. Netanyahu’s dramatic, televised news conference the same night in which he presented evidence that he said proved that Iran had been lying about its efforts to build a nuclear weapon. The presentation, based on a cache of stolen Iranian documents, capped a long campaign by Mr. Netanyahu to kill the international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program. President Trump faces a May 12 deadline to decide whether to pull the United States out of the agreement. And it comes amid an escalating shadow war with Iran. Airstrikes on a suspected missile storage site near Hama, Syria, on Sunday which destroyed a cache of missiles and killed at least 16 people, many of them Iranians, were reported to have been carried out by Israel. Israel is believed to have conducted several previous attacks in Syria on assets belonging to Iran and its allies, and is bracing for promised Iranian retaliation for a strike on an air base in Syria last month.

646,"THE ASSAULT ON INTELLIGENCE
American National Security In An Age Of Lies
By Michael V. Hayden
257 pp. Penguin Press. $28. Michael Hayden — the retired Air Force general who has directed both the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, now a principal in a Washington consulting group — went on a fact-finding mission in August 2017. The subject of his inquiry, however, was not a foreign espionage service. What Hayden was after were clues to why America had elected Donald Trump. He began by talking to several dozen of his brother’s friends, all Trump supporters, over beers in a Pittsburgh bar. “I knew many of the participants, indeed had grown up with several,” Hayden writes. “But we could have been from different planets.” While Hayden was curious about and civil to the men and women who voted for Trump, he is less kind to the president himself. Trump’s statements during the campaign drove Hayden to become more involved and outspoken than he anticipated in the months before the election. Indeed, it is something of an irony that this military and intelligence veteran — whose 2016 book, “Playing to the Edge,” defended controversial policies of surveillance, interrogation and targeted killing — is among Trump’s most prominent and incisive critics. Hayden, a self-described “internationalist,” opposes Trump’s trade, immigration and foreign policies. He also blasts Trump’s record of exaggeration, falsehood, misstatement and conspiratorial thinking. “All candidates shape their message,” he writes, “but Trump just seemed to say whatever came into his head.” Having led one agency where some operatives wore T-shirts saying “Deny everything, admit nothing,” Hayden is nonetheless impassioned about the importance of empirical data to decision-making. "
647,"BEIJING — China is struggling to find people in Washington who can provide insight into the Trump administration’s aggressive moves on trade. One senior American trade insider tried to help — and wound up in Beijing with little to do but check out the pottery. That insider, Alan Wolff, a veteran senior adviser to the top United States trade representative and a frequent visitor to Beijing, came to China two weeks ago to speak at a conference on agricultural trade and sought to make contact with top Chinese policymakers. But they did not respond to his requests for meetings, and they said days later that they had not known who he was. Mr. Wolff, an admirer of ancient pottery, instead spent a quiet Saturday in a Beijing museum browsing 2,200-year-old bowls. As members of the Trump administration delegation arrived in Beijing on Thursday for two days of high-level talks, they sat across from Chinese officials with limited experience in trade matters. After a bureaucratic reshuffling, the members of China’s new negotiating team have deep backgrounds in economics and finance, but they are less comfortable with the minutiae of trade laws. And although they are familiar with the American delegation’s main players, they are less acquainted with who does what among lower-level advisers and officials when it comes to United States trade policy. Both countries have played down the possibility that the negotiations will resolve the simmering tensions between them. Still, Chinese officials’ lack of experience in international trade law could make it even harder for the two sides to find common ground before the talks end on Friday. "

649,"Update, June 6: Congratulations to the six artists chosen for the print section, and thank you to the nearly 175 young artists who submitted work. We expect to need more for every edition of the Learning section, so please check our Contests feed for future announcements. _________ What does the phrase “student voice” mean to you? What would it look like if you were to illustrate the concept? That’s the challenge we put to you as we start to design our page for the June edition of The New York Times’s new quarterly Learning section. We will be featuring some of the best writing from the nearly 10,000 teenagers who entered this spring’s Student Editorial Contest and wrote passionate, thoughtful essays on the issues they care about most — and we’d love to have student-created art to go with it. So we invite you to draw or paint, by hand or with computer assistance, an original illustration that depicts the notion of “student voice,” whatever that means to you. Below, we explain the logistical details, and, for inspiration, list some of the most popular topics teenagers wrote about for our contest. But if you would like to better understand what “illustration” means in this context, we suggest you check out the professional artists who publish in The Times. For starters, scroll through The Year in Illustration 2017, which showcases wonderful work and explains that: “Every year The New York Times commissions thousands of original illustrations from independent artists around the globe. Artists are asked to distill the most compelling aspects of stories and create a powerful experience. They often have just hours to make images that move, provoke and enrich the act of reading.” This is, broadly speaking, your challenge, too: Distill an idea (“student voice”) and “provoke and enrich the act of reading” editorials on a range of topics by people your own age. Good luck, and please send your entry (or entries) to LNFeedback@nytimes.com by May 16 at 6 p.m. Eastern. ________ Your task: Create an illustration that depicts the concept of “student voice.” Please keep in mind that we are not looking for images that depict just one issue (say, for example, gun control), but, instead, would like illustrations that focus on the broad idea that teenagers are interested in, affected by, and want a say about a range of issues. As for what that range of issues could be, here are some of the topics that were most written about for our editorial contest. Though we haven’t chosen winners yet and thus can’t share with you any of the essays themselves, we encourage you to let this range inspire your work: • gender equality • immigration • social media • student activism • gun control • standardized testing • the college process • the Trump administration’s environmental policies • criminal justice reform • voting rights and lowering the voting age _________ The technical and logistical details: • You can draw or paint, by hand or with the assistance of a digital program such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, GIMP, Macromedia Freehand, CorelDraw or another graphics editing program. • Your RBG or black and white images should be sent as jpegs at 300 dpi. • If you use words in your piece, please make sure they are in black so they show up well in print. • You are welcome to send more than one submission. • Please send your work to us via our email at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, with the subject line “Illustration” by 6 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, May 16. • Tell us your name and age, and where you go to school. Anyone 13 to 19 years old, from anywhere in the world, is eligible to participate. • For every piece we publish, we will pay $75. Questions? Comments? Post them here, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com and we’ll answer as quickly as we can. Keep in mind that this is the first time we’ve ever done a call-out like this, so your questions may help us clarify our directions for everyone. Thank you, and good luck! "

651,"Over the opposition of lawyers for a company owned by President Donald J. Trump, State Supreme Court Judge Eileen Bransten ruled Thursday that a condominium on the Upper West Side could remove the bronze letters spelling out his name from its 46-story building. The ruling opens the door for the 377 condo owners at 200 Riverside Boulevard to formally vote on whether to keep or remove the T-R-U-M-P letters that have adorned the building, between 69th and 70th Streets, for the past 19 years. Reading a 12-page document from the bench, Judge Bransten repeatedly rejected, dismissed or found the Trump lawyers’ arguments to be unpersuasive and granted summary judgment to the condominium’s board. The ruling came in response to a request in January by the board, asking the judge to declare that a licensing agreement between the building and DJT Holdings, one of Mr. Trump’s companies, that gave the condo the right to use the Trump name on its facade, did not require it to use the name. After Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, a straw poll of building residents found that two-thirds of the 253 condo owners who participated wanted to remove the name, while 23 percent wanted to keep it. But a lawyer for a Trump subsidiary sent a letter promising to file suit if the board took any action. In the letter, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alan Garten, said that if the condo made any effort to remove the Trump lettering, Mr. Trump would “commence appropriate legal proceedings to not only prevent such unauthorized action, but to also recover the significant amount of damages, costs and attorney’s fees.” "

654,"LOS ANGELES — Two and a half years ago, the playwright David Henry Hwang approached the composer Jeanine Tesori with an idea for a show. Mr. Hwang had seen a recent revival of “The King and I” at Lincoln Center, which got him thinking about how much he loved that classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical (the songs, the story, the moment the king dies, which never failed to make him cry), and yet, how much he didn’t (the play’s history of showing a mostly white cast in yellowface, its implicit racism). How about a story that took all that and upended it? What if, instead of an English governess meeting the king of Siam and bringing the blessings of civilization to his backward-thinking country, we had a Chinese guy meeting Hillary Clinton on the eve of the 2016 election? And then what if, 50 years on, à la “The King and I,” that chance encounter became the stuff of myth, the basis of a blockbuster musical in China? The music would be gorgeous and entrancing — that’s where you come in, Jeanine — in the tradition of the golden age of Broadway musicals. It would be a play with music, or maybe a play that becomes a musical. “There was nothing on paper,” Ms. Tesori recalled. “I don’t even remember an outline.” Even so, she assented, persuaded by Mr. Hwang’s “genuine and ferocious” passion for the project. The product of their alliance, “Soft Power,” has its world premiere at the Ahmanson Theater here when it opens on May 16, signifying the first collaboration between the Tony Award-winning creators (Mr. Hwang for “M. Butterfly,” Ms. Tesori for “Fun Home”). Joining the pair is Leigh Silverman, who has directed several of Mr. Hwang’s plays, including “Yellow Face” and “Chinglish,” and who received a Tony nomination for her work on Ms. Tesori’s “Violet” in 2014. The play is a homecoming of sorts for the Brooklyn-based Mr. Hwang, who was born and raised in the Los Angeles suburb of San Gabriel, and whose Tony-nominated reimagining of “Flower Drum Song” had its premiere at the nearby Mark Taper Forum in 2001. About a half mile east of the Ahmanson is the David Henry Hwang Theater, home of the East West Players, the nation’s longest-running Asian-American repertory company, which partnered with the Center Theater Group on the premiere of “Soft Power.” "

657,"The New York Times Company added 139,000 digital-only subscribers in the first quarter of 2018, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period a year ago, helping to fuel total revenue growth and offset a decline in digital advertising. The company said on Thursday that about 40,000 of the new subscribers came from digital products like the cooking and crossword apps. The gains helped push the company’s total digital-only subscribers to roughly 2.8 million. The company said total revenue was about $414 million, a 3.8 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017. Subscription revenue increased 7.5 percent to about $260 million, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the company’s total revenue. “Retention of our core digital news product remains a very encouraging story,” Mark Thompson, the company’s chief executive, said during an earnings call with investors. “We continue to retain the postelection cohorts, some of whom are now well over a year into their subscriptions at least, as well as earlier cohorts.” Despite the growth in subscribers, however, the company saw a 6 percent decline in digital advertising revenue from the same period a year ago. It was the first time since the second quarter of 2016 that digital advertising declined. In the first quarter of 2017, digital advertising increased 19 percent, part of the so-called Trump bump. “The character of our advertising model, with its increasing reliance on strategic commercial partnerships and often large individual campaigns, means more lumpy results than was the case, say, three years ago, as individual partnerships and campaigns come on and off stream,” Mr. Thompson said.

That contradicts earlier versions of what happened. Mr. Trump said last month that he had no knowledge of the payment, made in exchange for Ms. Clifford’s silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump more than a decade ago. Here’s a partial transcript of Mr. Giuliani’s interview on Fox News, as well as a recap of the diverging statements that Mr. Trump and his team have made about the money. • There has been a legal debate about whether the payment amounted to a campaign contribution. Mr. Giuliani said his disclosure served to demonstrate that campaign finance rules weren’t violated, a point that Mr. Trump reiterated this morning. • The man who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment is now working for President Trump. In a sign that the White House sees no immediate end to its legal problems, Emmet Flood will replace Ty Cobb, the lawyer who had persuaded Mr. Trump to cooperate with the special counsel in the Russia investigation. Mr. Flood is expected to take a more adversarial approach with Robert Mueller’s inquiry. • Separately on Wednesday, Mr. Trump warned that he might have to “get involved” in a dispute between a group of House Republicans and the deputy attorney general.

President Emmanuel Macron of France slipped up during a joint news conference with Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, calling Turnbull’s wife “delicious.” Trevor Noah had some fun with that.

At least two of the three Iranians in question are also British citizens, and the arrests may be part of an attempt by the Iranian authorities to gain leverage in an old dispute with Britain over more than $400 million in undelivered weaponry. Aras Amiri, a 32-year-old art student and an employee of the British Council, a cultural organization governed by royal charter that promotes Britain abroad, is the latest known to have been arrested. Ms. Amiri, an Iranian citizen who has lived in Britain for about 10 years and traveled to Iran at least three times a year, has been in custody in Iran since March 14, a cousin in the United States, Mohsen Omrani, confirmed on Thursday.

670,"The Pentagon and the Trump administration apparently have misled Americans about growing military involvement in a war in Yemen that we should have nothing to do with. In the latest expansion of America’s secret wars, about a dozen Army commandos have been on Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen since late last year, according to an exclusive report by The Times. The commandos are helping to locate and destroy missiles and launch sites used by indigenous Houthi rebels in Yemen to attack Saudi cities. This involvement puts the lie to Pentagon statements that American military aid to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen is limited to aircraft refueling, logistics and intelligence, and is not related to combat. When senators at a hearing in March demanded to know whether American troops were at risk of entering hostilities with the Houthis, Gen. Joseph Votel, head of the Central Command, assured them, “We’re not parties to this conflict.” In at least 14 countries, American troops are fighting extremist groups that are professed enemies of the United States or are connected, sometimes quite tenuously, to such militants. The Houthis pose no such threat to the United States. But they are backed by Iran, so the commandos’ deployment increases the risk that the United States could come into direct conflict with that country, a target of increasing ire from the administration, the Saudis and Israelis. Such significant military decisions require public debate to force presidents and their generals to justify their decisions and be held accountable for the consequences. But checks and balances have eroded since Sept. 11, 2001, as ordinary Americans became indifferent to the country’s endless wars against terrorists and Congress largely abdicated its constitutional role to share responsibility with the president for sending troops into battle.

672,"President Trump, his aides and Republicans in Congress tried their best last year to mislead the public about legislation that would cripple the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes for corporations while doing little to help workers. Now, a few of these Republicans have come clean — at least momentarily. Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida and former presidential candidate, told The Economist recently that the big corporate tax cut he voted for late last year was passed under the false pretense that businesses would use their tax windfall on their employees. As Mr. Rubio accurately said in the interview, “There’s no evidence whatsoever that the money’s been massively poured back into the American worker.” Mr. Rubio later walked back his assessment of the tax bill, writing in National Review that he thinks it “has been good for Americans.” But it was refreshing to see him clearly acknowledge, even once, what many economists and voters have long known. Sure enough, what we have seen so far is that companies are buying back stock — which benefits a small group of well-heeled investors — while giving their workers modest bonuses at best. Then there’s Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s first health and human services secretary, who was ousted from the administration for blowing tax dollars on private plane trips. Last year he said, contrary to available evidence, that the provision in the health care act that requires people to be insured was driving up the cost of health insurance. On Tuesday, Mr. Price did a 180 in a speech at a health care conference in Washington, noting correctly that, in fact, it was Congress’s decision to eliminate the health insurance mandate that “drives up the cost” of insurance.

675,"AUBURN, Wash. — President Trump likes to keep negotiating partners on their toes. But workers like Charles Cesmat have been just as unnerved by the president’s recent moves on trade. Mr. Cesmat is a parts manager at a Boeing plant in Renton, Wash., just south of Seattle. One of every four planes Boeing assembles is sent to China. Each time Mr. Trump attacks Beijing on Twitter, or announces a new set of tariffs, Mr. Cesmat winces. “I’m concerned a potential trade war could affect work for our members and work for me,” Mr. Cesmat said. “Thousands of people’s jobs rely on a working relationship with China.” Nowhere is that truer than in Washington, which sent $18 billion in goods to China last year, more than any other state. A congressional race here has become a crucial test of whether Mr. Trump’s upending of the norms of international trade will come at the expense of Republican candidates. The spat with Beijing has rattled the state’s juggernaut aerospace industry, as workers and business owners reckon with the possibility that their livelihood could be at risk. Boeing shares economic dominance with giants like Amazon and Microsoft, but trade still supports 40 percent of all jobs in Washington, according to a Seattle consulting firm. “Trade issues are high on people’s minds,” said Chris Mefford, president of Community Attributes Inc., the firm that produced the estimate. “They are wondering and worrying how it’s going to play out.” "

678,"Until Wednesday night, Donald Trump and people in his orbit insisted that the president had known nothing about the $130,000 hush money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels made by his lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, days before the 2016 election. Last month on Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump about it directly: “Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?” His response was a categorical no. This denial was always implausible, and now we have new evidence that Trump was lying. On Wednesday evening, Rudy Giuliani, whose appointment to Trump’s legal team was announced two weeks ago, appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and casually admitted that Trump had repaid Cohen for the money he gave to Daniels “over a period of several months.” This was a bombshell. And in the 12 hours that followed, both Trump and Giuliani made a series of statements so seemingly self-sabotaging and undisciplined that observers began searching for some sort of hidden strategy or logic. Were they trying to get out ahead of a coming revelation? To set off a metaphorical smoke bomb that would distract from some other scandalous development? Or were they really as blundering and incompetent as they appeared? I suspect the answer is a combination of the three. But their motivations are less important than the information they’ve provided us. Whether they realize it or not, experts say they appear to have admitted that Trump and Cohen broke the law. The question is whether the impunity that Trump has enjoyed so far will hold or whether this farce of a presidency will, at long last, begin to crumble under the weight of its own sleaze. Sadly, it’s unlikely that Trump will pay much of a political price for deceiving the country about his sex life and attendant payoffs. Even before Giuliani’s revelations, USA Today reported, based on interviews with a 25-person focus group of Trump voters, that many of the president’s supporters already assumed he was lying about Daniels, and didn’t care. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, said there should be hearings on the Daniels payout, but he’s about to retire. Most of the Republican Party knows who Trump is and has submitted to him anyway. But as a legal matter, Trump seems to be in more trouble than he was 24 hours ago. Norman Eisen, chairman of Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, was almost giddy when I spoke to him on Thursday morning. “We’re seeing the unraveling of a corrupt regime by the force and power of the law, and the people who are the handmaidens of the law,” he said.

Grunge’s living legacy seems more precarious than ever since Chris Cornell’s untimely death last year. But Seattle’s Alice in Chains is reassurance in band form, a fixture of the genre’s heyday enduring through the loss of their lead singer Layne Staley in 2002. Thirty-one years in, the group has no interest in running on nostalgia alone: They’re touring ahead of their first album in five years, an as-yet-untitled project due out this summer. Look for new material amid grunge-metal classics like “Rooster” and “No Excuses.”
212-279-7740, mc34.com/upcoming CAM at Baby’s All Right (May 8, 6 p.m.). Aesthetically somewhere between country’s self-proclaimed outsiders and its stadium-filling stars, Cam is stuck with an unenviable task: finding an audience for her timeless, unpretentious country-pop. On top of all that, she’s a woman and, as such, anathema to country radio programmers. But she’ll reward those who seek out this intimate show with her arresting voice and a Nashville sound that doesn’t necessarily wear its twang on its sleeve. She’s working to replicate the success of the sneakily catchy 2015 ballad “Burning House” with her current single, “Diane,” the Dolly Parton-endorsed answer song to “Jolene.”
718-599-5800, babysallright.com CAMILA CABELLO at Terminal 5 (May 4, 8 p.m.). You’ve heard Ms. Cabello before, even if you don’t recognize her name: The singer graduated from the “X Factor”-created girl group Fifth Harmony to a solo career that’s already hit laden just two years in. “Never Be the Same,” an airy power ballad about addictive love, is running pop radio right now, as did her infectious, salsa-tinged “Havana” a few months earlier. Tickets to this Terminal 5 show are available only through resale sites, but if you want to see her from anything less than a stadium- or arena-length’s distance, now’s your last chance for the foreseeable future.
212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com E.P.M.D. at Highline Ballroom (May 10, 9 p.m.). Any of New York hip-hop’s real devotees will tell you that homage is owed to its musical ancestors. What better way to do just that than to attend the 50th birthday party of Parrish Smith, better known as M.C. P.M.D. of the pioneering Long Island rap trio E.P.M.D.? At this hometown celebration, you’ll find golden-age hip-hop that’s more fit for hip swiveling than head nodding thanks to its liberal sampling of danceable funk. And there’s another reason to raise the roof: This year is the 30th anniversary of the group’s debut album, “Strictly Business.”
212-414-5994, highlineballroom.com HAIM at Radio City Music Hall (May 4-5, 8 p.m.). The week’s most jubilant concerts will undoubtedly be at Radio City, where the Haim sisters will spend two nights performing their irresistible, beachy pop-rock. With endlessly bright combinations of harmonies, synths and straightforward refrains designed for singalongs, their music is perfect for the suddenly (finally) springlike weather. The rapper and singer Lizzo will get the party started with the kind of self-actualized anthems that could make a person move mountains: “Boss up and change your life/You can have it all, no sacrifice,” she sings on the 2016 single “Good as Hell.”

682,"ALBANY — Facing considerable political headwinds, another Republican in the New York State Senate announced his retirement on Thursday, as Democrats salivated about possible gains all across President Trump’s home state. All told, five Republicans in the last week have said they will not seek re-election, opening up political battlegrounds in potential swing districts from Suffolk County to Syracuse. The latest to do so had earned his right to retirement: Senator William J. Larkin Jr. is 90 years old, and had served in Albany nearly 40 years, including a decade in the State Assembly. On Thursday, Mr. Larkin said that he was, “with a heavy heart,” giving up a career in public service, which also included military service in World War II and the Korean War. “My final battle is with Father Time,” he said, in an announcement in Newburgh. This fall, his battle would have been with Democrats, who have long coveted Mr. Larkin’s Hudson Valley district, the 39th, which has substantially more registered Democrats than Republicans. Still, Mr. Larkin had comfortably been re-elected in 2016, though his physical stamina had been tested during the current legislative session, when he was sometimes brought to and from the Senate chamber in a wheelchair. On Wednesday, Mr. Larkin’s Republican colleague, Senator Tom Croci of Long Island, had announced that he, too, was leaving the chamber, returning to military service in the Navy. (Learning of Mr. Croci’s decision to retire, Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic Conference, had quipped, “ At this rate, there will be no one left in the Republican conference by the end of session,” slated to conclude in June.)

685,"False. Of the three Americans currently known to be held in North Korea, two were arrested after Mr. Trump took office — meaning the Obama administration would not have sought their release. Kim Hak-song was arrested on May 6, 2017. He worked at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, a university founded by American evangelical scholars. Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk, was detained on April 22, 2017. He taught at the same university in Pyongyang for a month. The third hostage — Kim Dong-chul — has been held in North Korea since October 2015. He is the only one of the three who was detained during the Obama administration. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, suggested on Thursday afternoon that Mr. Trump was including Otto Warmbier among the three hostages the president had referred to in his Twitter post. Mr. Warmbier, an American college student, was detained in North Korea in January 2016. He was flown back to the United States last June in a vegetative state and died at a hospital in Ohio shortly after. Ms. Sanders also said she “couldn’t confirm the validity” of reports about the hostages’ release. She was referring to a Thursday morning interview during which Rudolph W. Giuliani — who recently joined the president’s legal team — said three American hostages in North Korea would be released “today.” Asked if Mr. Giuliani was authorized to discuss foreign policy on the Trump administration’s behalf, Ms. Sanders said: “Not that I’m aware of.” "

687,"As Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was preparing to defend himself before Congress last week against charges of extravagant spending and other improprieties, he found time to travel to Cochran, Ga., to address the Georgia Forestry Association. On the day after Earth Day, he announced yet another policy that will damage the environment he is supposed to be protecting. He told the group that the E.P.A. would now declare the burning of wood from managed forests for energy production by power plants and other stationary sources to be “carbon neutral.” By that, he meant that, in the agency’s view, there would be no net release of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, because replanting the forest that had just been cut and burned could offset those emissions. This determination could make it easier for wood-burning power plants to win regulatory approval. But Mr. Pruitt’s declaration contradicts some basic facts. Burning wood from forests to generate electricity is not carbon neutral when the direct emissions from combustion, plus emissions from soil and logging and processing the wood, are considered. Scientific studies have shown that it will worsen the consequences of climate change for decades or through the end of this century. This was not a decision based in science, but in politics, a giveaway to the forest products industry. As Mr. Pruitt has put it, it will provide the industry with “certainty” in the “agency’s permitting process.” The forestry association understandably applauded the decision. “Administrator Pruitt’s announcement today reflects the clear scientific consensus on forest biomass,” said Andres Villegas, the president of the group. This statement also could not be farther from the truth. We are among 13 research scientists who have joined to challenge these blatantly inaccurate assertions. We are not outliers on this. In January, 796 scientists from the United States and Europe sent a letter to the European Union Parliament warning against a plan that would provide incentives for cutting trees to burn for energy.

693,"There is no friendlier territory on television for Trump supporters than Sean Hannity’s nightly hour on Fox News, where President Trump is forever the victim of a witch hunt and the liberal media is perennially bent on his destruction. That safe-space bubble popped — in dramatic, headline-making fashion — on Wednesday night, when Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and current member of Mr. Trump’s legal team, casually confirmed to the startled host that the president had personally repaid his lawyer the money he had laid out to make his problem with a pornographic actress go away. “Oh,” Mr. Hannity replied, his usual bombast briefly escaping him. “I didn’t know — he did?” It was an off-message moment from the ultimate on-message show — and just the latest in a string of agita-inducing moments for Mr. Trump that have played out, improbably, on his favorite television network. Mr. Giuliani’s admission stunned Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, many of whom — including the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders — learned about Mr. Trump’s payment while watching “Hannity.” Even so, the candor may have been by design: Mr. Giuliani said the president’s involvement showed that the payment had not violated campaign finance laws. It was harder to locate the strategy behind Mr. Trump’s swerving, stream-of-consciousness telephone interview last week on “Fox & Friends.” On live TV, the president seemed to stumble into acknowledging, for the first time, that he knew about his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, funneling $130,000 in hush money to an adult film actress who had claimed to have had an affair with the future president. "

695,"WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani has been President Trump’s lawyer for only a few days, and already he is causing political explosions. In one of his first interviews since joining Mr. Trump’s legal team, Mr. Giuliani appeared to briefly stun Sean Hannity of Fox News on Wednesday night by asserting that the president had reimbursed his personal lawyer for a $130,000 hush payment to a pornographic film actress — contradicting his client, the president. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] “I want to clarify something,” Mr. Hannity said, offering a do-over to Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, failed presidential candidate and longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s. Instead of taking a mulligan, Mr. Giuliani repeated the assertion. It was another high-profile, slightly off-kilter moment for Mr. Giuliani, who has lived a life full of them. A veteran of the no-holds-barred world of New York tabloids that Mr. Trump also inhabited for decades, Mr. Giuliani was an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. He was also a forceful critic of Hillary Clinton, a longtime political rival and Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race. "
696,"BEIJING — As North Korea holds summit meetings with its archenemies — first South Korea, and soon the United States — China is hustling not to lose influence. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, returned Thursday to Beijing after two days in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, where he met with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, shoring up China’s position as the North’s best friend. China holds substantial economic leverage, but in the heightened strategic competition between it and the United States, it worries that Mr. Kim is using that rivalry to reduce dependence on China, his country’s longtime benefactor. One of Mr. Wang’s jobs was to try to stop Mr. Kim from veering toward the United States under President Trump, some Chinese experts said. “Beijing likely would want to ensure that Pyongyang would not develop a closer relationship with Washington than Beijing,” said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. “The visit by the Chinese foreign minister, the first in 11 years, appears to be part of that effort.” Beijing has suspected that Washington might agree to put aside its nuclear disagreements with North Korea and accept the North’s nuclear capabilities if it served to contain China, he said.

700,"Before there was a hint of collusion with Russia, there were questions about Donald Trump’s finances. In those more innocent days, the questions were mainly about propriety — why wouldn’t he release his tax returns like other presidential candidates had? — and perhaps a hint of ox-goring: “Billionaire? He’s no billionaire!” This week it has become clearer that questions about Mr. Trump’s finances, and those about whether his campaign cooperated with Russian hacking of the 2016 election, need to be asked in the same breath. On Tuesday, we learned that a company linked to a Russian oligarch — as well as corporations with business before the administration — gave a total of more than $1 million to a shell company that the president’s fixer, Michael Cohen, set up just before the election to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels, the porn star who says she had sex with Mr. Trump in 2006. Those corporations — AT&T, the pharmaceutical company Novartis and Korea Aerospace — paid the shell company, Essential Consultants, during last year. All do business with the federal government or can be affected by federal actions, such as possible controls on drug prices or the Justice Department’s lawsuit against AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner. On Wednesday, Novartis said it had actually spent $1.2 million in total, $800,000 more than was originally reported, and AT&T said it had paid as much as $600,000, three times what had been reported. Both issued statements denying any wrongdoing but still leaving the impression that they were paying for access to the president or his fixer. Korea Aerospace told The Wall Street Journal that it had hired Essential for legal counseling regarding American accounting standards. Seriously. This sort of suspicious cash was at the heart of a recent report by The Washington Post that found that in the decade before the election, Mr. Trump did something unusual for a real estate developer — he all but stopped borrowing money. Multiple bankruptcies had no doubt exhausted his welcome at any reputable bank, so perhaps the man who called himself the “King of Debt” became more prudent, or he simply faced reality. What happened next, though, was more unusual. Beginning in 2006, the Trump Organization spent $400 million in cash on various projects. The president’s son Eric said they were able to do that with cash generated by other Trump businesses, even at the height of the Great Recession. That explanation has raised the eyebrows of business experts. "

702,"WASHINGTON — The chief executive of the aerospace giant Boeing downplayed the fallout from the president’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact, saying on Wednesday that the company would abide by the Trump administration’s decision to cancel Boeing’s licenses to sell $20 billion of aircraft to Iran. “We will continue to follow the U.S. government’s lead,” Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive, told a luncheon crowd at the Economic Club of Washington. He said Boeing had not committed to any production slots for the planes the company had planned to build for Iran, given there was a chance the United States would pull out of the 2015 pact. Mr. Muilenburg spoke a day after the administration said Boeing would see its $20 billion contract to supply aircraft to Iran terminated because of the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear deal, thus restoring stringent sanctions it had imposed previously. Boeing’s rival, Airbus, will also lose its license to sell to Iran, administration officials said. “Under the original deal, there were waivers for commercial aircrafts, parts and services, and the existing licenses will be revoked,” the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Tuesday, in reference to Boeing and Airbus. “The licenses are coming down. The objective is to put and maintain maximum sanctions on Iran; that is the objective here.” The announcement means Boeing will lose out on a lucrative new market for jetliners, but the move will likely cost the company less than it will Airbus. Boeing agreed to sell 80 passenger jets to Iran Air for about $17 billion in 2016, but it never began building the planes or factored them in as future revenue. "
703,"To the Editor: What a tragic disconnect there is between two May 8 news articles. One describes the rollout of Melania Trump’s long-awaited program as first lady, to be called “Be Best” and dedicated to the idea that, as Mrs. Trump announced, “children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence.” The first lady wants to use her platform to “help as many children as she can,” according to her spokeswoman. Enjoying the festive air of the rollout, guests in the Rose Garden snacked on cookies emblazoned with the new slogan in red and blue while a military band played Eric Clapton’s “Change the World.” It sounds like a fun party and a good photo op. But as another article reports, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced an enlarged policy of criminal penalties for border crossers, including the forced separation of parents and their young children. All children, not just documented ones, deserve the opportunity to enjoy their innocence, and a government that heartlessly separates young children from their parents does not deserve to call itself great. PERRIE L. RIDLEY
RIDGEFIELD, CONN. To the Editor: Like Melania Trump, I support programs that teach children about substance abuse and responsible social media use. But unlike the first lady, I do not subscribe to the idea that “children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence.” Children cannot be protected from knowledge of the world in which they live. That was never possible. Today, access to the internet and social media has rendered that fantasy even more unrealistic. Our responsibility is to help children make sense of that world with all its many shortcomings, a world that we have neither made nor always approve of. JONATHAN SILIN, AMAGANSETT, N.Y.

And on Wednesday, Mark Harris found himself in another role: A giant-killer of the 2018 midterm elections. Mr. Harris beat Representative Robert Pittenger in a Republican primary in North Carolina on Tuesday, making Mr. Pittenger the first incumbent from either party to lose his seat in Congress due to a primary challenger this year. House Republicans were already concerned about Mr. Pittenger’s chances against the well-funded Democratic nominee, the Iraq war veteran Dan McCready, but believed he would fend off the challenge from Mr. Harris, who instead beat him by fewer than 1,000 votes. “People are catching on to that ‘drain the swamp’ thing, and I think that is a message we have to consider,” Mr. Harris said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “Is it fair to say the establishment was surprised by what happened last night? Definitely so.” [Read our six takeaways from Tuesday night’s primary elections.] Mr. Harris, 52, will now face a Democrat whose campaign war chest vastly outmatches his own: Last month, Mr. McCready’s campaign had more than $1.2 million in the bank, while Mr. Harris had just $70,000. Mr. McCready beat a primary challenger of his own, Christian Cano, with more than 82 percent of the vote. Mr. Harris, who nearly unseated Mr. Pittenger two years ago, won by portraying the three-term incumbent as a Washington insider who violated the spirit of a 2012 campaign pledge to support term limits. He also criticized Mr. Pittenger for his vote in favor of a $1.3 trillion spending bill, which was both signed and rebuked by President Trump in March. "

The cable channel FX announced on Wednesday that it would be making a new weekly documentary series centered on stories that appear in The Times and the journalists who report them. The show, which will be called “The Weekly,” builds on the success of the podcast “The Daily,” which began last year and generally examines a story a day from the Times newsroom. FX has given “The Weekly” a 30-week commitment and a Sunday night time slot. The show, at 30 minutes per episode, is expected to debut later this year, possibly in time for the midterm elections. Hulu has the rights to stream the new series, giving the program a dedicated streaming platform the day after it premieres on cable. Unlike “The Daily,” which is hosted by Michael Barbaro, the television version will not have a dedicated host, FX said. But in keeping with the podcast’s format, “The Weekly” will follow a reporter or team of journalists as a Times story makes its way toward publication. For The Times, the FX show signals a turn toward the entertainment world. The company recently made a deal with Netflix to turn a feature from The New York Times Magazine into a documentary series called “The Diagnosis,” with Scott Rudin producing. Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures and Plan B, a production company co-founded by Brad Pitt, have gobbled up the rights to make a movie about how The Times broke the Harvey Weinstein story. Later this month, “The Fourth Estate,” a four-episode series from the documentary filmmaker Liz Garbus chronicling the Times newsroom during the first year of the Trump administration, will premiere on Showtime. Times leaders have been sending signals that this would be the year it would be aggressive in entering the crowded television space. "

713,"THE ROAD TO UNFREEDOM
Russia, Europe, America
By Timothy Snyder
359 pp. Tim Duggan Books. $27. Historians of the first half of the 20th century take little pleasure in today’s renewed interest in their subject. We don’t like the parallels between the West then and now: the rise of intolerant nationalist right-wing parties; the loss of faith in democratic institutions and the longing for a strong leader; the demonization of minorities like Jews or Muslims; or the unwillingness or inability of democracies to work together. We are living in dangerous times, Timothy Snyder argues forcefully and eloquently in his new book, “The Road to Unfreedom.” Too many of us, leaders and followers, are irresponsible, rejecting ideas that don’t fit our preconceptions, refusing discussion and rejecting compromise. Worse, we are prepared to deny the humanity and rights of others. In his chilling “Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,” Snyder explored the ghastly consequences of tyranny and the breakdown of human values and norms in the center of Europe. The road to unfreedom, as Snyder sees it, is one that runs right over the Enlightenment faith in reason and the reasonableness of others — the very underpinning, that is, of our institutions and values. Recent examples, found around the world, demonstrate both how important conventions and mutual respect are as a way of maintaining order and civility — and how easily and carelessly they can be smashed. Just think of President Trump’s regular impugning of the loyalty of those who work for the American government, in the F.B.I., for example. So many of us no longer care, as we should, about understanding ourselves and our pasts as complex and ambiguous. Rather we look for comforting stories that claim to explain where we came from and where we are going. Such stories relieve us of the need to think and serve to create powerful identities. They also serve the authoritarian leader who rides them to power. Snyder makes a valuable distinction between the narratives of inevitability and those of eternity. The former are like Marxism or faith in the triumph of the free market: They say that history is moving inexorably toward a clear end. The latter do not see progress but an endless cycle of humiliation, death and rebirth that repeats itself. Not surprisingly these often draw on powerful religious iconography. Both, as Snyder points out, produce intolerance of those who disagree. By questioning the narrative’s supposed truth, you are removing yourself from the community of true believers. "

What are your most important tools for covering technology policy? Tech has become a big focus in Washington these days, which means I’m spending much of my time on the go, hopping around various agencies and congressional offices to cover news and to meet with sources. I have on me — at all times — my MacBook Air, iPhone X, chargers, earbuds (one pair for my phone and another for my laptop), and many notebooks and pens. I put a lot of thought into what kind of backpack I would buy to carry it all because I’m often standing on buses or the Metro, and clocking lots of steps. I’m happy with my backpack from Knomo of London, which is sleek and light and has just the right pocket compartments to stay organized. I rely on lots of communications apps. My contacts are very particular about how we communicate, so I have about half a dozen apps I use regularly for interviews. Some sources prefer encrypted apps like Signal and others like to email, text, direct message on Twitter or trade messages on Facebook. I have contacts who will only meet in person and insist that I take notes by hand. Once, a source called me and heard me typing, hung up and showed up in my office lobby to talk in person. When I’m covering members of Congress or meeting with government officials, I like to record the conversations and rely on the Voice Memos app. "

716,"The job of New York attorney general over the past two decades has proved to be a launching pad for aspiring politicians who used their legal authority to go after Wall Street hucksters, corrupt politicians and real estate scofflaws. It was a strategy laid out by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who had both held the role. And Eric T. Schneiderman showed no reservation in following a similar playbook when he went after the big banks for mortgage abuses and the ride-hailing company Uber for its use of customer data. Mr. Schneiderman’s confrontations with President Trump, mainly through a series of lawsuits to counter the administration’s attempts to roll back environmental and financial regulation, bolstered his national profile and played especially well in progressive political circles. Now Mr. Schneiderman’s legacy is in tatters, after he said on Monday that he would resign in the wake of a report in The New Yorker about allegations that he physically assaulted four women he had dated. Before his sudden downfall, there was no denying that Mr. Schneiderman, 63, had a knack for getting results and getting attention during his more than seven years as attorney general. A former state senator, he brought a politician’s approach to the job, announcing investigations both large and small and issuing news releases galore. Just last month, his office issued 42 news releases. Their topics ranged from guilty pleas in an investigation of a dogfighting ring on Long Island to a lawsuit against the federal Environmental Protection Agency. "

718,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump announced on Wednesday that North Korea had freed three American prisoners, removing a bitter and emotional obstacle ahead of a planned meeting between him and the young leader of the nuclear-armed nation. The release of the three prisoners, all American citizens of Korean descent, was a diplomatic victory for Mr. Trump and in some ways the most tangible gesture of sincerity shown by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to improve relations with the United States after nearly seven decades of mutual antagonism. Mr. Trump said in a tweet that the three were freed following a visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, for more discussions with North Korean officials about the expected meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. The president said that Mr. Pompeo was “in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen” and that the group seemed “to be in good health.” South Korea welcomed the release of the prisoners — two of whom were arrested during Mr. Trump’s presidency — calling it “very positive for a successful North Korean-United States summit,” said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in.

721,"This requires context. Ms. Haspel is right that before the enhanced interrogation program was created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, C.I.A. interrogations usually entailed a conversation or polygraph exam with potential informants or defectors. The C.I.A. has no detention authority and, as a matter of mission, generally does not interrogate detainees. But the agency has occasionally been involved in interrogations in its past. A Senate Intelligence Committee report on C.I.A.’s use of torture that was released in 2014, and the agency’s own website, provides several examples. The relevant portion of the 2014 report reads: Methods described in KUBARK, like forced standing and sensory deprivation, were used by the C.I.A to interrogate a Soviet K.G.B. officer to determine whether he was a legitimate defector. The KUBARK manual became the basis for the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual, which provided “interrogation training in Latin America in the early 1980s,” according to the Senate report. Additionally, a 2007 study posted on the C.I.A.’s website detailed a specific interrogation of a North Vietnamese officer who was captured during the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese officer was kept for three years in an isolated cell that was painted bright white. His C.I.A. interrogator nicknamed him “the man in the snow white cell.” Another study described the Phoenix program, a security program that the C.I.A. ran in South Vietnam during the 1960s. The program, the agency’s study said, involved 600 C.I.A. and military personnel in the interrogation of Viet Cong militants. Morley Safer, the renowned newsman who had covered the Vietnam War, described the Phoenix program this way in a book review in The New York Times in 1990: "

733,"JERUSALEM — Iranian forces in Syria fired about 20 rockets into the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights early Thursday, targeting forward positions of the Israeli military, according to a military spokesman. The spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said Israel had responded to the attack but did not provide details. If confirmed, this would be the first rocket attack carried out directly by Iran, rather than by one of its proxies, against Israel. Colonel Conricus said that several of the rockets had been intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. He said that he was not aware of any casualties and that damage to Israeli facilities was low. The Israeli military said in a statement that it “views this event with great severity and remains prepared for a wide variety of scenarios.” The Syrian state news agency reported that the country’s air defenses responded to at least two waves of Israeli missile attacks after the strike against the Israeli positions. Israel and Iran have been conducting a shadow war in Syria under the cover of that country’s civil war. As Iran has tried to build up its military capabilities inside Syria, Israel has carried out scores of strikes against what it says are advanced weapons and convoys destined for its enemies in the region. The rocket attack early Thursday appeared to come in response to Israeli strikes on positions in southern Syria on Wednesday. "

735,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A day after the first major primary contests of 2018, the political armies on the left and the right repositioned themselves for an intense general election across Rust Belt states that President Trump carried two years ago — and where his personality and record will define the battles leading to the midterms. Three states that voted Tuesday — Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana — were the heart of Trump country in 2016, and the president is moving aggressively to hold onto them; he has already intervened in one Senate race and plans to campaign in another one Thursday. But historically this heartland region was in play for both parties, and Democrats hope it will be again, after earlier two-party contests around the country have seen a wave of disaffected voters reject Republican candidates in places as diverse as suburban Pittsburgh and Tidewater Virginia. Republican strategy is straightforward: The victors on Tuesday heaped praise on Mr. Trump, inviting him to visit their states to campaign, and tarred opponents as “liberals,” while invoking the name “Chuck Schumer,” the New York senator and Democratic leader, as an epithet to hurl at opponents. “You’ve been to this state now four times,” Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate nominee in West Virginia, said in his acceptance speech, addressing the president. “I’d like you to come back as many times as you can between now and November.” The pressure on Mr. Morrisey’s opponent, Senator Joe Manchin III, mounted immediately on Wednesday as an outside group allied with Mr. Trump released an ad urging West Virginians to call Mr. Manchin and demand he vote for Gina Haspel, the White House nominee to lead the C.I.A., who is facing tough questions about the agency’s use of torture on suspected terrorists.

739,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, poised on Friday to unveil his strategy to lower prescription drug prices, has an idea that may not be so popular abroad: Bring down costs at home by forcing higher prices in foreign countries that use their national health systems to make drugs more affordable. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump rebuffed his European allies by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Threatened tariffs on steel and aluminum have strained relations with other developed nations. And now the administration is suggesting policies that could hit the pocketbooks of some of America’s strongest allies. “We’re going to be ending global freeloading,” Mr. Trump declared at a meeting with drug company executives in his first month in office. Foreign price controls, he said, reduce the resources that American drug companies have to finance research and develop new cures. The White House Council of Economic Advisers fleshed out the idea three months ago in a report that deplored the “underpricing of drugs in foreign countries.” The council said that profit margins on brand-name drugs in the United States were four times as high as those in the more regulated markets of major European countries and Japan. The United States, it said, needs to “address the root of the problem: foreign, developed nations, that can afford to pay for novel drugs, free-ride by setting drug prices at unfairly low levels, leaving American patients to pay for the innovation that foreign patients enjoy.” Mr. Trump plans to lay out his ideas on Friday. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in a speech on Wednesday that the administration would attack several problems, including high list prices set by drug manufacturers; rising out-of-pocket costs for consumers; and “foreign governments free-riding off of American investment in innovation.” "

742,"Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who resigned this week after four women accused him of assault, was one of the most active state-level opponents of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations. He was also the first attorney general to open an investigation into Exxon Mobil’s climate policies and statements. Most of Mr. Schneiderman’s environmental initiatives will almost certainly continue without him, in New York and other states. But a prominent figure in the legal fight against climate change has left the arena, and his eventual replacement could set different priorities. Beginning the day before President Trump took office — when Mr. Schneiderman filed a motion with five other state attorneys general to protect an Obama-era rule on air pollution that crosses state borders — the office of the New York attorney general has led or taken part in dozens of legal actions, including lawsuits, that opposed Washington’s deregulatory wave. The State Energy and Environmental Impact Center of the New York University School of Law has counted 55 actions by New York during the Trump era, more than any other state but California, which also has 55. The lawsuits and other legal filings, brought largely by attorneys general in blue states, follow a range of similar suits filed by conservative counterparts during the Obama administration. Scott Pruitt, now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, achieved a level of prominence as Oklahoma’s attorney general by filing 14 lawsuits against the agency he now leads. Among the actions taken by Mr. Schneiderman’s office: While none have worked their way through the entire judicial process, these legal sorties have scored a half-dozen early court victories, often based on claims that the Trump administration, with its rather chaotic approach to rule making, has committed violations under the Administrative Procedures Act.

746,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Abandons Iran Pact He Long Scorned” (front page, May 9): The aftermath of President Trump’s announcement of his ill-advised withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal is proving to be even more concerning than the lead-up to it. Our allies and many Americans are appropriately worried that, other than sanctions, there is no “Plan B” in the nuclear realm. This validates what is increasingly alarming — that we have at the helm a president whose singular mission is to disengage from the established international order, especially that which is associated with his predecessor. As with the Paris climate accord and trade agreements, President Trump no doubt has found it easy to disengage. What to do next requires a vision that he surely lacks. ROGER HIRSCHBERG
BONDVILLE, VT. To the Editor: Re “Where’s That Better Deal?” (editorial, May 9): You write that President Trump is “reneging” on the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran. What he has done is exercise his clear authority to disavow an agreement of a prior administration, which it acknowledged to be nonbinding, that he believes endangers national security interests. President Barack Obama knew that he had no hope of winning the two-thirds Senate vote required for ratification of a treaty; indeed, the agreement was opposed by bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress. He therefore conveniently characterized the deal as an “executive agreement” that did not require congressional approval, even by a simple majority. There is accordingly no basis to claim that a new executive should not have reviewed an imprudent “executive agreement” made by his predecessor. And in view of the agreement’s failure to provide for “anytime, anywhere” inspections, its allowance of continued development of ballistic missiles, and the “sunset” provisions that begin voiding restrictions on Iran in 10 years, withdrawing from the agreement was clearly warranted. "
747,"WASHINGTON — The release of three American prisoners cleared away a last obstacle on Wednesday to a landmark nuclear summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. North Korea freed the prisoners, all Americans of Korean descent, even as the two countries finalized details for a meeting between their leaders. The move was North Korea’s most tangible gesture aimed at improving relations with the United States since Mr. Trump took office. The resolution of the prisoner standoff hardly guaranteed success at the meeting, which will grapple with the far more complicated issues of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, divisions on the peninsula and security in Asia. But American officials said it sent another signal that North Korea may be serious about ending its long confrontation with the United States and its allies after nearly seven decades of mutual antagonism. Mr. Trump exulted over the release and publicly entertained talk that he could even win a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomacy. He was so eager to associate himself with the freed prisoners that he decided to personally travel to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington in the middle of the night to welcome them back to the United States, something other presidents have not typically done in similar circumstances. “Nobody thought this was going to happen, and if it did, it would be years or decades, frankly,” Mr. Trump said at the White House shortly after they were released. “Nobody thought this was going to happen. And I appreciate Kim Jong-un for doing this and allowing them to go.” The three were handed over to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who made a second visit to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to lock down details of the upcoming meeting between the president and Mr. Kim. Mr. Trump said it would not be held in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, as he had earlier suggested, and speculation centered on Singapore, a neutral site that has better facilities and is close to North Korea.

749,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump mused about brokering peace between North and South Korea during a recent campaign rally, the chants from his supporters rumbled through the Michigan sports complex: “Nobel. Nobel.” For Mr. Trump, who has toggled with unsettling ease between volatile threats of “fire and fury” and impassioned calls for peace, the possibility of receiving a Nobel Peace Prize once seemed far-fetched. (The committee that awards the prize said this year that a nomination for him had been forged  twice, by an unknown perpetrator whose motives remain a mystery.) But the idea of his 2019 nomination, formally submitted by a group of 18 House Republicans and heartily endorsed by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, has started to take root among his supporters over the past few weeks as his own potentially historic summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea looms. “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” Mr. Trump said with a laugh on Wednesday when asked if he deserved the prize. “The prize I want is victory for the world.” Critics of the president and his often inflammatory rhetoric balk at the idea of Mr. Trump receiving one of the world’s most prestigious diplomatic awards. But some laureates and historians of the prize acknowledge that there are instances where such an honor was bestowed on contentious politicians in order to acknowledge and encourage efforts for peace. “Part of the strength of the Nobel Peace Prize is that it is controversial,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize after roughly eight months of deliberation over hundreds of nominations. “If it was a global consensus prize, it wouldn’t have the relevance and the authority that it actually has today.” "

751,"WASHINGTON — Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, defended the agency’s torture of terrorism suspects as her confirmation hearing on Wednesday served as another reckoning of the extraordinary measures the government employed in the frantic hunt for the Sept. 11 conspirators. Ms. Haspel, a 33-year C.I.A. veteran who oversaw a secret prison in Thailand in 2002 while a Qaeda suspect was waterboarded there, said that she and other spies were working within the law. Though the C.I.A. should never resume that type of work, she said, its officers should also not be judged for doing it. “I’m not going to sit here, with the benefit of hindsight, and judge the very good people who made hard decisions, who were running the agency in very extraordinary circumstances,” she told the Senate Intelligence Committee. But poised to take over the agency, Ms. Haspel vowed that she would not start another interrogation program like the one developed under President George W. Bush after 9/11 while the United States was actively trying to thwart terrorist plots. It involved brutal techniques like waterboarding detainees, dousing them with ice water, forcing them to stay awake for as long as a week and subjecting some to medically unnecessary rectal feeding. “Having served in that tumultuous time,” she said, “I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership, C.I.A. will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.” Ms. Haspel, 61, appeared headed for confirmation after two senators considered swing votes — Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican — said later on Wednesday that they would support her.

Many of us remember when Mr. Trump declared that Senator John McCain was “not a war hero” because he had been captured after his plane was shot down over North Vietnam.

754,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, exulting in the release of three Americans from prison in North Korea, confirmed Thursday that he would meet Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, in Singapore on June 12, setting the date for a once unimaginable encounter. The choice of Singapore, a tidy, prosperous city-state with ties to both the United States and North Korea, is a small victory for Mr. Trump’s advisers, who talked him out of meeting Mr. Kim in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea — a far more symbolic, but politically problematic, location. “We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!” Mr. Trump said in a midmorning post on Twitter, hours after he traveled in the middle of the night to Joint Base Andrews near Washington to greet the three men: Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song. North Korea’s release of the Americans lifted a major obstacle to the summit meeting. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has taken charge of the diplomatic opening to the North, finalized its date and location during a 90-minute meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. Afterward, Mr. Pompeo left with the detainees on his plane. For Mr. Trump, basking in the glow of floodlights and TV cameras, it was a jubilant moment as he descended the steps of the aircraft with the three Americans, who flashed peace signs. But he acknowledged that the most difficult phase of the negotiations — persuading North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons arsenal — lies ahead. “We’re starting off on a new footing,” he said. “I think he did this because I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.” "

756,"For months, the Trump administration has rightfully been trying to thwart attempts by some European governments to impose a new corporate “digital tax” on American high-tech giants. This campaign to block internet-inspired extraterritorial taxation — taxation of income earned outside of a jurisdiction — is strongly supported by the American business community. But the White House, in an odd twist that turns its European Union digital tax arguments upside down, just argued before the Supreme Court that the same kind of extraterritorial taxation is acceptable when carried out by American states on retail sales on the internet. Does the left hand of the Trump administration know what the right hand is doing on internet-related tax policy? Are American corporate leaders who have ignored the issue of internet sales taxes about to suffer a key setback in relation to the European Union tax grab? And does sound tax policy go out the window if the president seems to think Amazon is in the cross hairs? The implications of tax policy for internet business models is important: Many enterprises, large and small, are adopting a range of internet-enabled services. Good principles of taxation are the same at the state, national and international levels. They include the idea that each state or country has carte blanche to tax income, sales and whatever else it wants within its borders (as long as its taxpayers are O.K. with the burden), but they should not step on the toes of other political jurisdictions by taxing activity that happens across the border. Given the eternal lure of governments to tax people who can’t remove them from office (remember the old “No taxation without representation” mantra?), this is a timeless concern. This is the issue at the heart of the Supreme Court case South Dakota v. Wayfair, a multibillion-dollar retailer with no physical facilities in South Dakota that is using the internet to serve South Dakota customers. If South Dakota were to win this case, extraterritorial taxation would be allowed by states. Retailers would be forced to abide by every state’s in-state sales tax laws regardless of whether they have any in-state business operations. This has been a goal of states for over 50 years, and it’s the third time the issue has reached the Supreme Court. The result of the last visit, in 1992, is referred to in tax circles as the Quill decision. State governments want to see Quill overturned because they’re eager to collect more sales tax revenues to balance their books instead of cutting spending. The desire to tax out-of-state businesses has been consistent over the decades, but the pitch is now that the internet changes everything. It makes doing business over large distances too easy, some argue, so government shouldn’t be constrained by outdated considerations like borders and geographical business locations. "

764,"Before the next two months are out, the Supreme Court will decide two high-visibility cases that at first glance appear to have little to do with each other. One is the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, about the baker who won’t design a cake for celebrating a same-sex marriage, and the other is Trump v. Hawaii, the challenge to the president’s latest travel ban. One is as domestic as it gets, while the other is infused with issues of foreign policy and presidential power. What they have in common is the claim of religious discrimination at the heart of each. Does Colorado’s public accommodations law, which covers sexual orientation, make the unwilling baker a modern-day Christian martyr for his refusal to create and sell what he regards as his art to celebrate a union that he thinks is unholy? Does a travel ban that applies to citizens of five overwhelmingly Muslim countries, issued by a president who has made abundantly clear his desire to keep Muslims out of the United States, amount to religious discrimination in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause? I recognize that placing these cases in a religious-discrimination frame obscures their many distinct complexities. The Masterpiece case, at least on the surface, is primarily about free speech; the justices have to grapple with the nature of the baker’s “expression” before they can get to the question of whether being required to bake the wedding cake would unconstitutionally coerce him to express sentiments that violate his religious beliefs. In the travel ban case, the court will surely be attentive to the claims about national security and presidential prerogative that are the administration’s principal defense. Described in this way, the link between the two cases is submerged. My point here is not to offer a full-dress analysis of the cases, but rather to suggest that the imminent decisions will tell us a lot about how the current court thinks about religion — specifically, how it defines religious discrimination and who it thinks needs the court’s protection. Classically, the Supreme Court invoked the religion clauses of the First Amendment — the protection for free exercise and the prohibition against government “establishment” of religion — on behalf of minority religions. Rulings on behalf of Jehovah’s Witnesses who wouldn’t salute the flag, Amish parents who wouldn’t send their children to high school and non-Christians who objected to organized prayer in public school form the backbone of the First Amendment canon. But in recent years, the court’s concern has flipped. Four years ago, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, the court gave its approval to the regular inclusion of Christian prayer at town meetings. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s majority opinion suggested that anyone who took offense was just being thin-skinned. The Hobby Lobby case that same year marked the court’s emerging view of Christians as victims of an overbearing government and, by extension, of an insensitively secular society. The Hobby Lobby decision, holding that the religious owner of a privately held for-profit corporation couldn’t be required to cover birth control in his employees’ health plan, was based on the court’s interpretation of a statute, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, rather than on the Constitution itself. But the opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., with its solicitude for the business owner’s far-fetched claim that he would be complicit in sin if his employees were to make use of their federally mandated benefit, clearly reflected the majority’s First Amendment sensitivities.

767,"No books were harmed in the making of this motion picture. There will be no such disclaimer at the end of my new film, because we burned a lot of books. We designed powerful, kerosene-spitting flamethrowers and torched books — en masse. This was not easy for me to do. I was taught at a very young age to read and respect books. Even setting a teacup on a book was considered a sin. In my parents’ household, Hafez’s book of Persian poetry, “The Divan,” was revered like a religious text. But now I was making a film adaptation of Ray Bradbury’s seminal novel, “Fahrenheit 451,” which presents a future America where books are outlawed and firemen burn them. The protagonist, a fireman named Guy Montag, begins to doubt his actions and turns against his mentor, Captain Beatty. When I set out to adapt the novel early in 2016, I was faced with a big question: Do people still care about physical books? I asked an 82-year-old friend for advice. “Go ahead and burn books,” he said. “They mean nothing to me. I can read anything on my tablet, from the ‘Epic of Gilgamesh’ to Jo Nesbo, and I can read them in bed, on a plane or next to the ocean, because it’s all in the cloud, safe from your firemen’s torches.” If he felt this way, what would teenagers think? Bradbury’s novel is a classic taught in high schools across America. But the more I thought about it, the more relevant the novel seemed. For Bradbury, books were repositories of knowledge and ideas. He feared a future in which those things would be endangered, and now that future was here: The internet and new social-media platforms — and their potential threat to serious thought — would be at the heart of my adaptation. I had never adapted a book, let alone one so important. Altering a work so brilliant and beloved always upsets some fans. I knew Bradbury had supported François Truffaut’s 1966 film adaptation. More important, Bradbury himself had reimagined “Fahrenheit 451,” first as a stage play and then as a musical, changing many elements, including letting Montag’s neighbor Clarisse McClellan live. (In the novel, she dies early on.) With Bradbury as my guide, and a vow to stay true to his ideas, I began working on the script. “Fahrenheit 451” was written in the early 1950s, not long after Nazis burned books and, eventually, human beings. America was living under a cloud of fear created by the House Un-American Activities Committee and McCarthyism, which brought political repression, blacklists and censorship of literature and art. These anxieties permeate the novel. "

new dance always begins, for Justin Peck, with a fixation on a piece of music. He’ll listen to it over and over, sometimes for years, until he knows all its notches and grooves, every dynamic change, all the subtle modulations of mood it provokes in him. As he’s getting to know the music, he spends several hours each morning in a rehearsal studio, moving to it, seeing how it travels through his body and responding to it in a series of gestures. When he arrives at a sequence of steps he likes, he’ll practice it again and again, and then, when he’s satisfied, record it on his iPhone. He calls these “sketches” or “Legos,” the units out of which he will begin to build a new work. Five years ago, Peck’s obsession fell on a hurtling piece of electronica called “U.S.A. I-IV,” by the musician and composer Dan Deacon, a four-section suite with a pulse that seems to promise climax but never resolves. Peck knew this music was an unusual choice for a ballet composition. It was exhausting to listen to, and it might alienate the audience at the New York City Ballet, where Peck is both a soloist and the company’s resident choreographer. But by then he had made a dozen ballets for the company, work widely celebrated for taking the form in a hypermodern direction while still epitomizing its technical rigor and superior grace. He was ready to take a real risk. He wanted to create a dance that would capture the American landscape when you’re looking out the window of a fast-moving train, the way a new object appears before you’ve even had a chance to process the last. How could the static space of a stage be made to feel as if were in constant motion? The ballet would be danced entirely in sneakers (a rarity in a form still rooted in the difficult glamour of pointe shoes) and incorporate some of the hyperkinetic, intricate footwork of tap dancing. “I’m always trying to figure out where I want to fall between paying respect to the classical form and trying stuff that pushes the envelope,” Peck told me. He hoped that these small breaches of tradition would help the dancers feel free — that they could appear onstage as themselves. In the studio, he experimented with tap, mapping with his feet all the subtle details he could hear between the insistent beats of Deacon’s music. He started to make a tap duet that was based partly on a private joke. When he was a teenager, studying dance at the School of American Ballet, he and his roommate Robbie Fairchild — who would go on to become one of the most celebrated principal dancers at the N.Y.C.B. — would play Dance Dance Revolution late into the night. Each of them had a background in tap, and the video game, in which they hit colored pads with their feet to visual cues, became a jocular way of competing. The tap duet Peck created, a set of moves with such precise synchronicity that the two dancers almost merge, was a homage to that time in his life and was to be the basis for the rest of the choreography. But then, the day after Donald Trump was elected president, Peck walked into the studio to lead a rehearsal for the piece and found the dancers stricken. Their sense of outrage and despair, he realized, should be brought into of the dance. When “The Times Are Racing” had its premiere on Jan. 26, 2017, the curtain rose on a mass of dancers in a tight huddle, wearing loose T-shirts and sporty jackets emblazoned with words like “Resist,” “Unite,” “Act.” Dancers started to peel off and fling themselves outward, as if ejected from orbit. It was Peck’s interpretation of what it would mean for his dancers — and, by extension, the audience — to inhabit chaos. A nameless protagonist, played by Fairchild, emerged from the crowd and buckled helplessly to his knees. All around him, bodies bounced off one another or embraced. "
771,"JERUSALEM — The tense shadow war between Iran and Israel burst into the open early Thursday as Israeli warplanes struck dozens of Iranian military targets inside Syria. It was a furious response to what Israel called an Iranian rocket attack launched from Syrian territory just hours earlier. The cross-border exchanges — the most serious assaults from each side in their face-off over Iran’s presence in Syria — took place a little more than a day after the United States withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. Israel’s defense minister said that Israeli warplanes had destroyed “nearly all” of Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria after Iran launched 20 rockets at Israeli-held territory, none reaching their targets. Iran struck shortly after President Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement, raising speculation that it no longer felt constrained by the possibility that the Americans might scrap the deal if Iran attacked Israel. Israel appeared newly emboldened as well, partly because of what seemed like extraordinary latitude from Russia, Syria’s most important ally, allowing the Israelis to act against Iran’s military assets in Syria. Moscow did not condemn Israel’s strikes, as it had in the past, instead calling on Israel and Iran to resolve their differences diplomatically. "

In the fall, Fever Ray, the solo moniker of the Swedish singer-songwriter Karin Dreijer (also known for performing alongside her brother Olof in the Knife), surprised fans with “Plunge,” an eclectic but still danceable multimedia tribute to female empowerment. In the video for the track “IDK About You,” for example, Ms. Dreijer climbs through a doorway that’s shaped like a fanged vagina when she spots the words “I am not free while any woman is unfree” scrawled in red paint across a wall. Come for the radical feminism at Ms. Dreijer’s two-show run (the first night of which is sold out) at the Red Bull Music Festival; stay for the conceptual electronic pop that’s earned her comparisons to Björk.
718-492-7400, nyc.redbullmusicfestival.com FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (May 13-14, 8 p.m.). Florence and the Machine graduated from theaters to enormous outdoor festivals and arenas long ago — fittingly, the band will open for the Rolling Stones at London Stadium this month. But to mark the announcement of the band’s fourth album, “High as Hope” (due out on June 29), the frontwoman Florence Welch and her crew will do an abbreviated tour of smaller concert halls. The shows at BAM (two of three total in the United States) are sold out, but those who grab the tickets available on the resale market will be treated to relatively up-close-and-personal renditions of the band’s trademark soaring, orchestral pop-rock.
718-636-4100, bam.org MARGARET GLASPY AND JULIAN LAGE at Le Poisson Rouge (May 12, 7:30 p.m.). On the surface, Ms. Glaspy, a singer-songwriter who specializes in giving her confessional tunes a distorted crunch, and Mr. Lage, one of the best jazz guitarists of his generation, would seem to have little in common besides six strings. But the guitarists are actually a musical power couple, and share a genre-bending sensibility that allows for collaborations both intimate and unexpected. Look for Mr. Lage playing support on songs from Ms. Glaspy’s critically acclaimed 2016 album, “Emotions and Math,” as well as the duo playing songs that they wrote together.

This dance party is the female-identifying, femme-oriented counterpart of Papi Juice, which has been spotlighting queer and trans D.J.s and artists of color at clubs around New York since 2013. The fourth edition boasts a lengthy list of contributing artists, among them Uniiqu3, a Newark-based D.J. and vocalist who specializes in Jersey club, which is an up-tempo and heavily deconstructed genre of house music; and, from Toronto, the D.J. Nino Brown, who plays a blend of dance hall, soca and hip-hop.

Getting Drake’s co-sign is a pretty good place to start for anyone in hip-hop and R&B — just ask Ms. Smith, whose silky voice appears on “Jorja Interlude” and “Get It Together” from his 2017 album, “More Life.” The 20-year-old British singer already has a Brit Award and a spot on the blockbuster “Black Panther” soundtrack, all without an album (her debut, “Lost & Found,” is due out on June 8). The singles Ms. Smith has released, though, tap into R&B’s current obsession with ethereal seduction without losing the London grit that she says she learned from listening obsessively to Amy Winehouse.

Next, ask them each to pick one article — any article, for any reason — read it, and tell us in the comments here why they chose it. If they do, we’ll publish the best of what we get in this column next Thursday. Consider it practice for our Ninth Annual Summer Reading Contest, when teenagers all over the world are invited to do exactly that, any week from June 15 to Aug. 24. To inspire you, we reached out to a few teachers we’ve gotten to know who often allow their students free choice when they work with The Times in class. Thank you to Sarah Gross at High Technology High School in Lincroft, N.J.; Karen Gold of The Governor’s Academy, Byfield, Mass.; Cynthia Honeycutt at Walhalla High School in Walhalla, S.C.; Chris Roth from Folsom Elementary School District in Folsom, N.J.; and Brett Vogelsinger of Holicong Middle School in Doylestown, Pa., who simply asked their students, quoted below, what they’d recommend to others right now. (We also heard from a sixth grader, Julia Sprung, who goes to the Kinneret Day School and reads The Times at home.) So please invite your students to enjoy any of the 17 fascinating pieces below, and then find their own articles — and tell us why they chose them. They should post those picks here, in the comments, through May 16. _________ 1. I Went Naked to a Museum, and It Was … Revealing: Unanimous choice, Sarah Gross’s English I, Section 2 class. Why? Duh: “It’s a naked museum!” The students also added, “Apparently, some people think that they can connect better with art if they remove all the barriers between them and the art. Like clothes. But how do you go to a museum and take off your clothes around strangers?!” 2. The American Dilemma: Why Do We Still Watch Football? “I read this article and learned that as a society, we find it hard to watch football for all the violence, but we continue watch it to support our favorite team and players.” — Carter Bailey, Folsom Elementary School District 3. Why Parts of Beijing Look Like a Devastated War Zone: “I picked this article because, born to a family of constant migrants, I’ve learned one thing from our immigrant experience: what we fear the most isn’t danger or destitution, but hopelessness.” — Tianyu M. Fang, The Governor’s Academy 4. Never Solved, a College Dorm Fire Has Become One Man’s Obsession: “This type of article is my favorite, it is one that I can go into with no previous knowledge, and come out being able to recount the events described to my peers. I also like to read about mysteries and try to come up with my own conclusions, and I think it is interesting to share the stories with my friends and see what they might have to say.” — Randy Parris, Walhalla High School 5. The Boys Are Not All Right: “I really enjoyed how the writer, Michael Ian Black, structured this piece. The subject of the article is also something that I think our society labels as taboo. Michael Ian Black was not afraid to say what he meant, and that made the article so much better. His voice and journalistic fortitude were the backbone of this piece.” — Catherine Both, Holicong Middle School 6. Real Men Get Rejected, Too: “Moises Velasquez-Manoff writes about how men are faced with unrealistic expectations of masculinity in this society. This stance has resonated with me, allowing me to consider what young men have been raised to believe before condemning them as 'despicable' or 'loathsome.'” — Meg Fischer, Walhalla High School 7. The Nurse Who Took a Very Different Route to 2nd Place in the Boston Marathon: “Big sporting events seem too far-fetched for normal people to be a part of, but this story makes the Boston Marathon more relatable because the nurse who came in 2nd place was not a professional.” — Isaac Buckman, High Tech High School 8. Review: Whose ‘Fair Lady’? This Time, Eliza’s in Charge: “The review truly brought the play to life and I felt as if I was watching it.” — Julia Sprung, Kinneret Day School (She also recommends How This Teenager Landed a Met Gala Dress Design Gig.) 9. Needle by Needle, a Heroin Crisis Grips California’s Rural North: “I chose this article because no matter where you reside in America, there seems to be no escaping the rampant drug epidemic and we need to understand why this is happening.” — Alex DiBlasi, The Governor’s Academy 10. Birds Beware: The Praying Mantis Wants Your Brain: “It’s just cool! Plus being able to eat something twice as big as itself is crazy.” — Deep Gopani, High Tech High School 11. A Courageous Trump Call on a Lousy Deal: “Reading Bret Stephen’s opinion piece was a pleasant surprise — his strong denunciation of the Deal stands in sharp contrast to other pieces that are almost uniformly in favor of keeping it.” — Jason Ho, The Governor’s Academy 12. Kidnapped as Schoolgirls by Boko Haram: Here They Are Now: Eight students at Walhalla High School chose this piece. “Before I read this article, I did not know much about this issue. After reading it, I was heartbroken, but also inspired. The pictures caused much emotion because it was like the women were interacting with you as you read,” wrote Megan Ranalli. Her classmate Gracie Powell called it “one of the best articles I have ever read.” 13. In Australia, Arsonists May Have Wings: “The idea of arsonist birds in general is interesting. When we think of birds we don’t think of them using tools to aid them.” — Caleb Thorpe, High Tech High School 14. Attacking the ‘Woke’ Black Vote “This called attention to a group being hypocritical and I appreciated that he was brutally honest with them, and told them what it was they were doing wrong. Especially with the article coming from an African American man, I admired his resolve to stand up against the crowd.” — Avery McCall, Walhalla High School 15. Lacrosse Casts Its Net Farther From the Coast, and Pulls In New Recruits “It’s an article about lacrosse and how fast the sport is growing. I found it interesting because I didn’t know that lacrosse was growing that quickly!” — Jaime DiMatteo, Folsom Elementary School District 16. Marijuana Can Save Lives “Although I may not agree with everything it says, this article certainly got me thinking about the use of medical marijuana in the fight against the opioid crisis that plagues the nation.” — Elliot Wechter, Walhalla High School 17. The Sublime and Scary Future of Cameras With A.I. Brains: “As technology is developing it’s important to know what is happening with technology we use everyday. This article shows you the benefits of AI in cameras, but also points out some scary things to think about.” — Oreoluwa Alao, High Tech High School "
784,"WASHINGTON — No, the Korean War still is not over. While an armistice in 1953 ended active fighting, it was never followed by a peace treaty. This is why during their recent meeting, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, in addition to jointly calling for the “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula, also pledged to formally conclude the war. Much ambiguity remains about what exactly it would take to accomplish what Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon vowed to do, and many analysts have expressed skepticism about this diplomatic overture, pointing to a number of other supposed breakthroughs in the past that petered out. Yet this moment does seem different in at least one important respect. The two leaders’ joint declaration last month contained another significant clause that went relatively unnoticed: “South and North Korea affirmed the principle of determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord.” The statement is not entirely novel; there was another one like it in a 2000 joint declaration. But it underscores the fact that as much as rapprochement between the Koreas concerns other parties to the Korean War, like the United States and China — and, given the wider security implications, the rest of the world as well — it is a matter principally between the two of them. This point would go without saying were it not for this war’s curious history, which again and again relegated both Koreas to the rank of extras as they were upstaged by their Cold War patrons. American government officials should remember this overlooked truth as they prepare President Trump for his own meeting with Mr. Kim in the coming weeks — and perhaps all the more because the North Korean government is making direct gestures toward the United States, as on Wednesday when it pledged to release three American prisoners. After North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, it almost managed to push the United Nations Command, the multinational force defending the South, off the peninsula. By November, the U.N.C. was touching the Chinese border. By January 1951, after the dramatic intervention of Chinese forces, the Communists overtook Seoul again. Come June 1951, the battle line had mostly stabilized near the 38th parallel. Armistice negotiations began. At that point, neither the North nor the South wanted to stop fighting — yet both were brought to the negotiating table by their respective Cold War patrons. The United States spoke for the U.N.C.; China spoke for the Communists. The two Koreas were their voiceless accessories. "

786,"To the Editor: Re “Nominee for C.I.A. Vows Era of Torture Is Over” (front page, May 10): Donald Trump vowed just the opposite during his campaign for president and added that he’d go beyond the torture designed and administered by the Bush-Cheney administration. Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. nominee, supervised torture of detainees at a secret prison in Thailand but said at her confirmation hearing that torture “will not restart” under her leadership of the agency. Mr. Trump will restart America’s torture program, no matter what she thinks. He promised it to his voters and the rest of the world. And, sadly, he will deliver. JAMES NEUPERT, ATHERTON, CALIF. To the Editor: Re “Deeply Versed in Spy Agency, and Dark Era” (front page, May 8): Bad enough that everyone who promoted or participated in the post-9/11 torture program enjoyed a de facto grant of amnesty. Intolerable that someone who personally oversaw an American-operated torture chamber in Thailand could be promoted to head the C.I.A. As President Trump tries to defend Gina Haspel, two points should be recalled. First, the torture program was not begun at the urging of experts in interrogation, but rather was promoted by political leaders like Vice President Dick Cheney, who gloried in the image of themselves as ruthless supporters of violence against our foes. Second, as an exhaustive Senate Intelligence Committee investigation confirmed, the unlawful torture program never yielded any intelligence of importance. Ms. Haspel was grilled about her role in the enterprise. She is fortunate that the questions were posed by senators, not by a United States Attorney prosecuting her for criminal conspiracy. MITCHELL ZIMMERMAN
PALO ALTO, CALIF. To the Editor: Gina Haspel’s defenders point out that she was told that the torture she supervised was legal, and that she had been ordered to destroy the evidence. Even so, the Nuremberg trials proved the legal principle that “I was only following orders” is not an acceptable excuse for unacceptable behavior. She should not be confirmed. DAVID L.

792,"WASHINGTON — President Trump frequently talks about reviving the American auto industry, but his approach to trade policy may backfire on the country’s carmakers. Mr. Trump’s efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, to impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel and to reduce America’s trade deficit with China could limit the reach of companies that produce cars in the United States and depend on access to growing markets outside the country. On Friday, the chief executives of the biggest automakers plan to meet with the president at the White House. The gathering comes at a critical moment, as Trump administration officials race to finalize a Nafta rewrite in the next few weeks and prepare to meet again next week with Chinese leaders in hopes of forestalling a potential trade war. The auto industry is among the sectors most vulnerable to trade disruptions because its business model is increasingly global, in terms of both production and sales. One in five cars made in the United States is now exported, and one in four vehicles sold in America were produced in factories run by foreign-owned companies. General Motors sold nearly 1 million vehicles in China in the first quarter of the year — more than it sold in North America in the same period. In the last two decades, United States automakers have set up plants in Canada, China and Mexico, and they routinely import car parts from other countries. Mexico has added hundreds of thousands of auto-making jobs since Nafta’s enactment in 1994, while the United States has lost hundreds of thousands. Labor groups and administration officials are hopeful that the trade moves will change incentives to encourage domestic and foreign-owned carmakers to manufacture more of their vehicles in the United States. But industry representatives warn that proposals now being championed by the Trump administration could have the opposite effect, raising the prices of American-made cars and trucks, reducing vehicle sales and potentially choking off access to China, the world’s fastest-growing market for automobiles.

794,"Here’s a curious ritual of American politics: Whenever a large energy project is proposed, the ensuing debate revolves chiefly around how many jobs it will create. For example, backers of the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a contested 600-mile natural gas conduit that would run from West Virginia to North Carolina, have maintained that it would create nearly 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs. Similarly, President Trump’s announcement last year that he was reviving the Keystone XL pipeline suggested that it would generate 28,000 construction jobs. On the other hand, The Washington Post concluded that the real number was 3,900 construction jobs, based on a State Department estimate. Renewable energy advocates play the same game. An Environmental Defense Fund report published last year asserted that the United States’ clean energy sector employs an estimated four million to 4.5 million people. The solar and wind industries “are each creating jobs at a rate 12 times faster than that of the rest of the U.S. economy,” the report said. The problem with statistics like these isn’t just their purveyor’s bias: It’s that all the numbers are inherently misleading. Regardless of political outlook, economists generally agree that job numbers don’t convey the value of a given project or sector. Severin Borenstein, a University of California, Berkeley, economist, could have been speaking for all of them in his 2015 blog post called “The Job Creation Shuffle.” “Most of the people who take a newly ‘created’ job are leaving an existing job. Or would have found another job,” Mr. Borenstein wrote. “Then there are people who are displaced by the new jobs created — the coal miners who worked for the mine that is shut down” or “the fracking oil drillers in North Dakota laid off when cheaper crude from the tar sands is carried to market by the Keystone XL.” "

797,"After months of swaggering hesitation, President Trump finally announced the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran, to which Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and the European Union are also parties. This action tramples on European leaders, who urged Mr. Trump to exercise restraint in the interest of international security and multilateralism. Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, reacted to Mr. Trump’s announcement with a sharp statement. The European Union and the rest of the international community, she said, would “preserve this nuclear deal.” The question is how. Notwithstanding an abundance of kvetching, European powers have not yet shown Mr. Trump that he has anything to fear from ignoring their wishes. To be sure, European leaders have expended plenty of verbiage, illuminating the broad consensus that Iran is abiding by the terms of the deal. President Emmanuel Macron of France implored the Trump administration not to scupper the agreement during a recent visit to Washington. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany echoed his sentiments, as did Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, in these pages on Sunday. But mere words aren’t going to dissuade this White House. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has treated Europe like a doormat, questioning the value of NATO, ridiculing the mission of the European Union and dismissing European exhortations on policy matters. Given all this, the European Union in particular may feel compelled to acknowledge the harsh reality that it has yet to act like an organization with a G.D.P. roughly equal to that of the United States — and to change the situation by signaling to Washington that on certain matters it refuses to be ignored. The trouble the European Union has had uniting around highly sensitive issues — immigration, for example — is perhaps understandable. But the Iran deal does not appear to be divisive: From the pro-Brexit Mr. Johnson to the avowed internationalist Mr. Macron, European politicians understand its value. "

Kim Kye Gwan, the first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK, made public the following press statement on Wednesday: Kim Jong Un, the chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, made a strategic decision to put an end to the unpleasant steps for peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the world. In response to the noble intention of Chairman Kim Jong Un, President Trump stated his position for terminating the historically deep-rooted hostility and improving the relations between DPRK and the U.S. I appreciated the position positively with an expectation that upcoming DPRK-U.S. summit would be a big step forward for catalyzing detente on the Korean peninsula and building a great future. But now prior to the DPRK-U.S. summit, unbridled remarks provoking the other side of dialogue are recklessly made in the U.S. and I am totally disappointed as these constitute extremely unjust behavior. High-ranking officials of the White House and the Department of State including Bolton, White House national security adviser, are letting loose the assertions of so-called Libya mode of nuclear abandonment, “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” “total decommissioning of nuclear weapons, missiles and biochemical weapons” etc. while talking about formula of “abandoning nuclear weapons first, compensating afterwards.” "

802,"WASHINGTON — The White House official had a startling assertion: He thought he had received an email in the first half of 2016 alerting the Trump campaign that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Testifying behind closed doors on Capitol Hill in late March, the official, John K. Mashburn, said he remembered the email coming from George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign who was approached by a Russian agent, sometime before the party conventions — and well before WikiLeaks began publishing messages stolen in hackings from Democrats. Such an email could have proved explosive, providing evidence that at least one high-ranking Trump campaign official was alerted to Russia’s meddling, raising questions about which advisers knew and undercutting President Trump’s denials of collusion. But two months after Mr. Mashburn testified, investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee have not found any such message. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was also searching for similar emails, according to a person familiar with a request for documents that his investigators sent to the Trump campaign. The campaign, which has examined its emails and other documents, also cannot find the message, and officials do not believe it exists. Mr. Mashburn offered a tantalizing prospect for Senate Judiciary Committee investigators, who sifted through a tranche of emails from Mr. Papadopoulos. But the search that he inspired demonstrates the difficulty investigators for Congress and Mr. Mueller face nearly two years after the F.B.I. began looking into ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. Counterintelligence experts say that uncovering what occurred during an event like the 2016 election could take years, if not decades, to understand. Witnesses have turned over more than one million documents. Hundreds of individuals have been interviewed and dozens have testified before grand juries. Yet basic questions about the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia remain unanswered, including the central question of whether officials or Trump associates coordinated with the election interference.

805,"As American and Chinese officials meet this week in Washington to defuse trade tensions, both sides are trying to find common ground. It won’t be easy. The Trump administration has pressed hard for China to make major changes to its trade practices and limit the state’s role in the economy — an agenda that comes in conflict with Beijing’s desire to protect its industries and build new ones. It all traces back to the style and speed of China’s growth. Over the past 40 years, Western countries have struggled to find the right recipe of incentives and agreements to get China to play fair. Trading partners often complain that China flouts the rules to get ahead. And none have voiced those concerns more virulently than President Trump, who has said it was a mistake to let China into the World Trade Organization in the first place. The president stoked fears of a trade war earlier this year, when he announced tariffs first on washing machines and solar panels, and then steel and aluminum. And the Trump administration hit China again in April, blocking exports of microchips and software to the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, before seeming to rethink the aggressive move in a tweet saying that he and the Chinese leader are “working together.” So how did a poor, developing country that still has a gross domestic product per capita of less than $10,000 come to rival, and even challenge, the existing economic order?

807,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Twenty years ago, burning from his dismissal as deputy prime minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim unleashed a protest movement against his mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, calling him insane, senile and unfit to lead the nation. Today, the two men, after years of bad blood and the imprisonment of Mr. Anwar, have retaken their places at the top of Malaysian politics: Mr. Mahathir is prime minister once again, at age 92, and Mr. Anwar, newly pardoned by the country’s king on Wednesday, is waiting to inherit the leadership. This time, they have done it under the banner of what had been Malaysia’s opposition, the Alliance of Hope, which decisively swept away the government of Najib Razak in national elections last week by accusing him of epic corruption and vowing reform — and the reinstatement of Mr. Anwar’s political career. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Anwar, 70, newly free after five years of detention, vowed that ending the influence of politics over the country’s justice system would be a priority. “We must stop this once and for all,” he said. “The most significant lesson one can learn from prison life is the value of freedom.” He has twice been deprived of his freedom, both times in what was widely seen as political manipulation coming from the leadership of the governing party, the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, which at one point included Mr. Mahathir, Mr. Anwar and Mr. Najib among its top ranks.

809,"WASHINGTON — When presidents make the trip to Capitol Hill from the White House to address lawmakers, they usually have a request to make, a policy proposal to sell or an overarching message to deliver. That did not appear to be the case on Tuesday, when President Trump held forth for close to an hour during a closed-door lunch with Republican senators in a monologue that was part political update, part celebration and part comedy routine, according to several people present and others briefed on the meeting. Mr. Trump steered clear of contentious topics, like an aide’s controversial remark about Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has brain cancer — and no senators asked him about it. He did not address his abrupt decision this week, announced on Twitter, to reconsider penalties against the Chinese electronics maker ZTE, which was punished for violating United States sanctions and is suspected of being a surveillance risk. And he did not browbeat senators in person, as he has on Twitter, about changing their rules to make it easier to push through legislation along party lines or about scrapping their summer vacation to work on his agenda. Instead, Mr. Trump talked about his accomplishments — including the surging economy; the decisions to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and to pursue nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea; and the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem, which he said had saved American taxpayers a substantial amount of money — and about his optimism over Republicans’ chances in the fall midterm elections.

812,"Ramadan is here. By now, many Americans know the basics. It’s the holy month during which healthy and able Muslims are commanded to abstain from food, drink (Not even water? Nope, not even water) and sex from sunrise to sunset and invest in intense prayer, charity and spiritual discipline. In recent years, Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, has become part of mainstream American society. It is frequently cited in hip-hop and even made an appearance in Eminem’s epic freestyle takedown of President Trump at the BET Awards. In keeping with the tradition started by Thomas Jefferson, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama hosted community leaders and dignitaries at Ramadan dinners featuring a variety of exquisite halal meats. (Mr. Trump eliminated that beautiful gathering. That’s not surprising given his belief that “Islam hates us.”) The holy month is now even linked to the most sacred American tradition, consumerism: Party City has introduced a line of Ramadan decorations featuring mosques, stars and crescent symbols. But I want more. This Ramadan, I’m in search of something substantive that nurtures my soul and truly transforms America, which is wounded, suffering from a resurgence in open expressions of hate against racial and religious minorities, and politicians who seek to profit off the divides. I know the solution will start at home, so this month, I aspire to evolve into an overweight, middle-aged superhero without a cape, disciplined and mindful, grateful for my privileges, spiritually aware and more compassionate. I’ll try praying for enemies, friends, frenemies and Kanye West. I must, however, make a confession (I hope the Catholic priests who taught me in high school would approve): I usually end up hangry, drained from juggling work and chasing my two hyper toddlers. It’s exhausting. As I do every year, I’ll probably find myself musing: “You know, Buddhism is looking pretty good. It worked out well for the Beastie Boys.” Yes, intermittent fasting may improve health, but there’s a famous saying that it’s possible to fast the entire month of Ramadan only to end up with nothing more than empty stomachs and thirst. After all, even if you’re not eating or drinking, it’s hard to focus on spirituality when there’s so much in the real world to steal our attention: Will the Supreme Court rule for a Muslim travel ban that will separate millions of people from their families? Will Mr. Trump’s early-morning tweets one day start a war? "

817,"THINGS THAT MAKE WHITE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE
By Michael Bennett and Dave Zirin
220 pp. Haymarket Books. $24.95. Part of the mythology of sports, according to Michael Bennett, the Super Bowl champion defensive end, is that sports make society more equal. “That’s miseducation,” he writes in “Things That Make White People Uncomfortable.” “The only thing that’s going to make us equal isn’t sports. It’s going to be people realizing we’re all human.” One of the raging debates of our times centers on social justice — and, in particular, the political views of athletes in the age of President Trump. Near its epicenter is Bennett, now a Philadelphia Eagle, who as a Seattle Seahawk sat during the national anthem last season to protest systemic inequalities. He is now fighting assault charges after being accused, unjustly he argues, of injuring an elderly woman while rushing through the crowd after last year’s Super Bowl to congratulate his twin brother, Martellus, on the Patriots’ win. Bennett’s worldview and understanding of race has been intensified by experiences like these. Wasting few words and fewer emotions in this memoir (written with Dave Zirin, sports editor of The Nation), he starts by examining the brutal realities of both collegiate and professional football. The former Texas A&M Aggie includes poignant descriptions of his undergraduate years, noting that racism was at the center of his college experience. He also explains how post-traumatic stress disorder triggered in high school and college can follow athletes long after the stadium crowds stop roaring. As an Aggie, Bennett explains, he was “half god, half property,” subject to so many restrictions that he was socked with a one-game suspension for leaving campus to attend his 2-year-old daughter’s birthday party. Bennett still resents going undrafted in 2009, the result, he believes, of his inability to live by the advice given to athletes: “Stick to sports.” "

819,"When North Korea first threw the fate of a historic summit meeting with the United States into question last week, it cited — five times — the fate of another country and another leader, half a world away, as an example of why no one should trust American efforts to disarm another nation. The country was Libya, and the leader was Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who made a bad bet that he could swap his nascent nuclear program for economic integration with the West. That deal, executed by the Bush administration nearly 15 years ago, is a footnote to American histories of that era. But Libya has always loomed large for the North Koreans. Mentions of the Libya deal as a model for North Korea’s own denuclearization — first by Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and then by Vice President Mike Pence — were enough to draw two threats of withdrawal from the talks by North Korea. After the second threat, President Trump announced unexpectedly on Thursday that he had decided to withdraw from the planned June 12 meeting. Whether Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, will ever meet — a move disarmament advocates saw as an opportunity to end decades of animosity between the nations — remains an open question. So what exactly is the “Libya model” and how has it become a sticking point in a meeting between President Trump and Mr. Kim? "

The refugee family from the Democratic Republic of Congo would not be coming. In Columbus, Ohio, a 14-passenger white van that would take refugees to medical appointments sits unused. In the rare instance a newcomer or two needs transport, they travel in a fuel-efficient economy car. And in southwest Houston, a 1,500-square-foot storage room is loaded to the ceiling with furniture, toys, bedding and other items donated for refugee families, all collecting dust. The flow of refugees to the United States has slowed nearly to a halt, demonstrating that what President Trump’s administration could not achieve by executive order, it is accomplishing by bureaucracy. The administration has cut the staff that conducts clearance interviews overseas, intensified the screening process for refugees, and for those people it characterizes as high-risk, doubled the number who need to be screened. As a result, if the trickle of refugees admitted continues at its current pace, just 20,000 are projected to enter the United States by the end of this year, the lowest figure since the resettlement program was created with passage of the Refugee Act in 1980.

And Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. All luminaries in the Democratic Party, all on the progressive side of the spectrum. And all potential presidential candidates who were road-testing their pitches on Tuesday at the Center for American Progress’s Ideas Conference in Washington. Since its founding in 2003, the center has been seen as thoroughly establishment. Its founding president, John D. Podesta, was President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman, and its current president, Neera Tanden, is also a Clinton loyalist. But like some Democrats, the center has shifted leftward lately, for example by advocating a jobs guarantee, a nominally left-wing proposal that several prominent Democrats have embraced. While presidential ambitions provided the subtext for the gathering, a few outward themes emerged: President Trump was discussed, of course, especially in a panel on “Democracy and the Rule of Law” featuring Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Representative Ted Lieu of California and the former acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates. But in contrast to last year’s conference — when Mr. Trump’s recent firing of the former F.B.I. director James B.

After objecting to military exercises, North Korea also rejected Washington’s demand that it quickly dismantle its nuclear program. And it singled out John Bolton, above right, Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, for criticism: “We do not hide our feelings of repugnance towards him.” The State Department said it would continue planning for the meeting in Singapore, but the news was a familiar pattern from Pyongyang: diplomatic outreach, followed by erratic behavior. And in an apparent rebuke of Mr. Trump, former Secretary of State Rex W.

Walking away from the Iran deal was, among other things, a public message from Mr. Trump to Mr. Kim that we can act just as aggressively and disingenuously as he can, and that he, Mr. Kim, is now negotiating with realists. And isn’t it interesting that Mr. Trump is helping his pal Xi Jinping, president of China, avoid the bankruptcy of ZTE in exchange for what? Perhaps more pressure from China on North Korea? Mr. Kim’s response was that he can be just as unpredictable as Mr. Trump. This is all standard preliminaries before the big event. GEORGE SPENCER
KINDERHOOK, N.Y. To the Editor: Of course North Korea is threatening to cancel the summit meeting with President Trump because the United States and South Korea are carrying out typical joint drills on the peninsula. Did we really expect anything else? North Korea is working closely with the Chinese to foster an outcome that results in a United States withdrawal from South Korea, while giving up as little of its nuclear program as possible. Meanwhile, 300,000 Chinese troops reportedly were sent to the North Korean border, ready to uphold their treaty obligation to respond if the United States strikes North Korea. Don’t be fooled, folks. Kim Jong-un has no intention of relinquishing his nuclear arsenal, and given China’s role, it has a much stronger hand than most imagine. Mr. Trump should cancel the summit, sending a strong signal to Mr. Kim that if he isn’t ready to give up his arsenal, the United States isn’t ready to talk. DAN SMITH, DETROIT "

837,"President Trump’s financial disclosure, released on Wednesday, included for the first time repayment of more than $100,000 to his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, in 2017, raising questions about whether Mr. Trump’s sworn filing from a year ago improperly omitted the debt. In a highly unusual letter, the Office of Government Ethics alerted the Justice Department on Wednesday to the omission, telling Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, that the ethics office had determined “the payment made by Mr. Cohen is required to be reported as a liability.” Mr. Trump’s financial disclosure, released by the Office of Government Ethics, did not specify the purpose of the payment. However, Mr. Cohen has paid $130,000 to a pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen has said he made the payment shortly before the 2016 election as hush money for Ms. Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels. Mr. Trump repaid Mr. Cohen $100,001 to $250,000 in 2017, according to a footnote in the filing. David J. Apol, the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, sent Mr. Rosenstein a copy of Mr. Trump’s current and previous financial form, noting in his letter that “you may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing regarding the president’s prior report that was signed on June 14, 2017.” The letter is not an official referral and does not constitute a finding of wrongdoing, according to lawyers. The hush payment has been a source of controversy for Mr. Trump, who initially said on Air Force One that he was unaware of the payment to Ms. Clifford before acknowledging its existence in a series of Twitter posts this month. Mr. Trump said that he repaid a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Clifford just days before the presidential election in 2016 and suggested that the payment by Mr. Cohen to the actress could not be considered a campaign contribution.

A video of his racist insults and assumptions, coupled with a threat to call immigration officials to have the Spanish speakers deported, went from viral to virulent on the internet Wednesday. The video shows a middle-aged, athletic-looking white man berating both customers and a manager at a cavernous fast-casual restaurant called Fresh Kitchen. “Your staff is speaking Spanish to customers when they should be speaking English,” he says. “It’s America.” He adds: “I will be following up, and my guess is they’re not documented. So my next call is to ICE to have each one of them kicked out of my country.” He said that he was paying for their “welfare.” Officials in New York, which as a so-called sanctuary city limits its cooperation with immigration enforcement officials, quickly denounced the man’s action. Mayor Bill de Blasio reminded people on Twitter that New York was a welcoming city, where 8.6 million residents speak more than 200 languages. The city’s Commission on Human Rights, which investigates discrimination and harassment, said in a statement that it was “aware of the matter.” And the city’s commissioner of immigrant affairs, Bitta Mostofi, said in an interview that incidents like this, “while horrifying, are not commonplace — they also don’t belong in our city.” Even the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, known as ICE, distanced itself from the man’s threat to call the office. But a spokeswoman acknowledged that all undocumented immigrants are subject to deportation. “ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line is solely for the purposes of making legitimate reports of suspected criminal activity.

After the sudden resignation of Eric T. Schneiderman last week, Ms. James’s name immediately surfaced as a candidate to replace him, first as an interim appointment by the state Legislature. But as newspaper editorial boards urged lawmakers to keep the interim attorney general, Barbara Underwood, who had served for years as state solicitor general, in the job, Ms. James withdrew her name from consideration to fill out the last seven or so months of Mr. Schneiderman’s term. Instead, Ms. James said she wanted to place her candidacy before voters, saying that she would defend vulnerable communities and take on everything from corruption to crooked businesses, as well as the administration of President Trump. “New Yorkers deserve an attorney general who is unwavering in her fight to uphold and defend their most basic rights,” Ms. James said in a brief speech at the Brooklyn Historical Society, where she was surrounded by cheering supporters holding signs calling her “the people’s lawyer.” If elected, Ms. James, the first black woman in New York City to hold citywide elected office, would make history again by becoming the first black woman to win statewide elected office, a point that was echoed by supporters and former colleagues as especially significant in the era of #MeToo and the difficult racial dynamics playing out in the country.

852,"WASHINGTON — The Republican at the helm of the Senate’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election backed on Wednesday the assessment by American intelligence agencies that Moscow favored Donald J. Trump in the race, contradicting both the president and fellow Republicans in the House. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he saw “no reason to dispute” the intelligence assessment, which was delivered in the final weeks of the Obama administration. Mr. Burr’s statement, while indirect, offered a clear rebuke to Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters in the Republican Party and in the right-wing news media, who have sought to cast the assessment as the shoddy work of Obama loyalists bitter over Mr. Trump’s election victory. Russia’s only goal, those supporters have insisted, was to sow chaos, and thus it could not have colluded with a campaign it cared little about. The only logical conclusion, they contend, is the one that Mr. Trump has already reached: The investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, is a “witch hunt” cooked up by Democrats desperate to undermine a president they detest. American intelligence officials, including Mr. Trump’s own appointees, who now run the agencies that compiled the assessment, say otherwise. They have repeatedly backed the work of their predecessors and sought to shield Mr. Mueller’s investigation from political attacks. Asked at a Senate hearing on Wednesday if he stood by earlier statements that the special counsel’s investigation was not a witch hunt, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, did not hesitate: “Yes,” he said. "
853,"WASHINGTON — The White House on Wednesday brushed aside threats by North Korea to cancel a summit meeting between President Trump and its leader, Kim Jong-un, but the harsh words underscored the chasm that will separate the two leaders next month in Singapore over how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Mr. Trump struck a noncommittal tone about the status of the meeting — “We’ll have to see,” he told reporters — but said he still planned to demand that the North surrender its entire nuclear program. A top North Korean official said Mr. Kim would not tolerate attempts to “drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment.” While administration officials and outside experts said they believed the meeting would go off as planned, the clashing messages brought a diplomatic high-wire act temporarily back to earth, replacing the talk of history-making handshakes and Nobel Peace Prizes with the sober recognition that North Korea views disarmament very differently than the United States does. The reversal came after months in which Mr. Kim presented himself as a statesman, halting missile tests and freeing imprisoned Americans. Now, the North has reverted to its earlier hard-line stance on keeping its nuclear weapons and to a playbook that includes sudden shifts in tactics when negotiating with other nations. North Korea’s warning came as Mr. Trump faced pressure to settle an escalating trade dispute with the North’s principal economic patron, China. Mr. Kim has made two trips to China to seek its support since inviting Mr. Trump to meet.

The big election story on Tuesday was in Pennsylvania, whose 18-member delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives is currently composed of 18 men. (Well, O.K., 16 men and two vacancies due to men who abruptly left town. As we will see, Pennsylvania is having some trouble hanging on to its representatives.) Next year there could conceivably be seven women. In the past, if I told you the Democrats had nominated seven women for Congress you might have cynically assumed Pennsylvania had seven districts where the party was so outnumbered the Republicans would triumph if they nominated a collie. But no, four of these are likely Democratic wins. And whatever happens, the state is guaranteed to get at least one congresswoman — there’s a Philadelphia area district with female nominees on both sides. Meanwhile, incumbent Republicans are falling like flies. Representative Patrick Meehan resigned recently after he used taxpayer money to pay off a former aide who accused him of sexual harassment. He claimed he was a faithful husband who simply regarded the staffer as a “soul mate.” Pick your response: A) Interesting job title. B) First rule of the #MeToo movement is that bosses do not get to be soul mates with their underlings. C) Hahahahahaha Meehan was the second Pennsylvania Republican House member to fall to the forces of testosterone recently. You may remember that Tim Murphy, an avid anti-abortion crusader, had to resign from his seat after word got out that he’d urged his former mistress to consider terminating a possible pregnancy. When the ex-lover complained about his lack of consistency, she got a text from Murphy’s cellphone saying: “I get what you say about my March for Life messages. I’ve never written them. Staff does them.” "

858,"WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will not indict President Trump if he finds wrongdoing in his investigation of Trump campaign links to Russia, according to the president’s lawyers. They said Wednesday that Mr. Mueller’s investigators told them that he would adhere to the Justice Department’s view that the Constitution bars prosecuting sitting presidents. The disclosure provides the greatest clarity to date about how Mr. Mueller, who is also investigating whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the inquiry itself, may proceed. If he concludes that he has evidence that the president broke the law, experts say, he now has only two main options while Mr. Trump remains in office: He could write a report about the president’s conduct that Congress might use as part of any impeachment proceedings, or he could deem the president as an unindicted co-conspirator in court documents. Mr. Mueller’s stance could serve as political relief for Mr. Trump, whose presidency has been under the cloud of the investigation. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called it a “witch hunt.” A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about how the president reacted to Mr. Mueller’s viewpoint on indictment. On Thursday morning, the president noted the anniversary of the special counsel investigation. “Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History,” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post. But the question of whether the president can be indicted is unsettled. Many legal experts and current and former Justice Department officials believed that Mr. Mueller would follow the conclusions of Justice Department lawyers, who argued during both the Nixon and Clinton administrations that an indictment would interfere with the president’s constitutional responsibilities and powers to run the executive branch.

860,"When Republicans look at what they’ve gotten out of their current moment of unified government, they can point to cutting corporate taxes, some judicial appointments and … not much else. Beyond that, they claim that they’ve teed up the economy for explosive growth through the magic of “deregulation.” But deregulation is a term that should be banned from the nation’s policy lexicon, mixing as it does equal parts wholesome and foul — in this administration, almost exclusively foul. The wholesome justification for deregulation arises when government uses its power in ways that gum up the dynamic power of markets. In the long run, our nation’s wealth and the opportunity it provides for improving quality of life depend on the forces of creative destruction. In competitive, open markets, incumbent actors cannot prevent challenges from more nimble competitors, armed with new products or more efficient ways of organizing the production process. This process can be stifled when government acts in ways that stymie or distort competition. Our economy is, increasingly, plagued by these kinds of constraints. The growth of patent and copyright protection over the past few decades has made it harder for new companies to recombine existing technologies in new ways, thus shielding the entertainment industry, tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers from challenges. Byzantine regulation of housing construction at the local level has made the cost of living prohibitively expensive in many high-growth areas and blocked millions of workers from moving to high-paying jobs. The growth of company-specific tax subsidies (like those offered by places in competition for Amazon’s HQ2) has shoveled resources toward large businesses that can effectively lobby for government largess. The list could go on, but the point is simple — in all these areas, there are huge opportunities for growth that are being hamstrung by rules that protect existing companies at the expense of new ones. A bonfire of regulations like this would be entirely wholesome for the American economy and also help to eat away at some of the hyper-inequality that is generated by these forms of crony capitalism. Unfortunately, this is not the kind of regulation that the Trump administration has been attacking. Instead, it has been sharpening its knives for precisely the kinds of regulation that, far from distorting markets, help to improve them. In particular, regulation is often necessary to a properly functioning market when, in its absence, businesses can make a profit by pushing costs onto others, in effect forcing others to subsidize their bottom line. In two areas, the environment and finance, these are exactly the sorts of market-improving regulation that the administration has put in its cross hairs, with the effect of increasing profits via freeloading.

How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics
By David Faris
178 pp. Melville House. $24.99. When you have a president who plays footsie with white supremacists and openly yearns to undermine the rule of law, it’s easy to lose sight of something: Before Donald Trump ever ran for the White House, a combination of Republican tactical nihilism and design flaws in the Constitution had already led to an alarming breakdown in the mechanics of American democracy — leaving the game systematically rigged against Democrats. Ruthless gerrymandering has handed Republicans significantly more seats in the House and in state legislatures than their vote share deserves — an advantage that after 2020 could become semipermanent. The Senate, with its small-state bias, looks set to favor the G.O.P. for the foreseeable future, too. Voting restrictions targeting racial minorities and the young, and the evisceration of campaign finance laws, have skewed election and policy outcomes at all levels even further. Throw in Republicans’ theft of a Supreme Court seat, and you’ve got a government that’s far more conservative across the board than voters appear to want — and that’s without even mentioning the Electoral College. Little wonder fewer than half of Democratic voters say they have faith in American democracy, according to a recent poll. If the G.O.P. were a normal right-of-center party, this unequal playing field would already qualify as an urgent problem for progressives. But given its current incarnation as a conglomerate of right-wing nationalists, Randian zealots and Christian fundamentalists all laser-focused on repealing different aspects of the 20th century while consigning our children to spend their golden years in a fiery hellscape, the situation starts to look potentially cataclysmic. A New Zealand diplomat posted to Washington summed it up in a recent tweet, telling Democrats in rather undiplomatic language to get it together “or we will all die.” So it’s not surprising that people are starting to think about ways to break out. In his short, bracing book, “It’s Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics,” David Faris, an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University, argues that Democrats should immediately use every lever they have to gum up the works in Washington, to ensure they win full control of government in 2020. "
863,"WASHINGTON — The big daily meeting that past administrations have used to keep the White House on message has been scrapped in favor of something smaller. West Wing aides are instructed to drop their personal phones into small storage lockers when they come to work, periodically checked up on by a scanning device that detects nongovernment phones. And in the Oval Office, there is President Trump, who is prone to erupt about his communications team as ineffective and leak-ridden, complaining he has the biggest team and yet he gets “the worst press.” Working in the Trump White House, current and former West Wing aides say, has always meant navigating the personality of a mercurial president who has an inherent sense of paranoia — one extended even to those who have worked with him closely — that has been honed over decades. “There is a certain advantage to having a certain degree of paranoia,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with the BBC in 1998. “You can be a little bit careful. You watch what’s happening behind your back.” But in recent months, Mr. Trump, who has never been convinced that his aides have his best interests at heart, has felt increasingly aggrieved. He blames his staff for not delivering better headlines on key initiatives, like tax cuts or a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea. And he sees leaks as a cause of the distractions that have helped deprive him of those headlines, according to interviews with several current and former White House officials, all who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe internal discussions. The president’s irritation with his staff over bad media attention reached a new level last week after a morbid joke a junior aide made about Senator John McCain having brain cancer was leaked to news outlets. The off-the-cuff comments by Kelly Sadler, a communications aide, minimized the effect of Mr. McCain’s opposition to Mr. Trump’s nominee for C.I.A. director because “he’s dying anyway.” "

Meanwhile, what goes largely unnoticed are the funding cuts in such needed areas as education, infrastructure, conservation and early childhood programs, and that list also goes on. In addition to continuing to undermine what is left of our ability to be civil to one another, Mr. Trump seems to be very adept at directing the focus of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, away from the real priorities and toward the daily drama of his life.

868,"President Trump’s complaints of unjust persecution are a matter of opinion — or, at the very least, a premature conclusion. But by quantifiable measures, the investigation of Russian election meddling to benefit Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign is not the longest, least fruitful or most harmful inquisition in American history. The largest literal witch hunt in American history was, of course, the trials and persecutions of people accused of witchcraft in Salem, Mass., from 1692 to 1693, said Robert Thurston, a historian who wrote the book “The Witch Hunts.” The Trump-Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, “is nothing like a real witch hunt,” Mr. Thurston said. “No, no, no. Twenty people were executed at Salem. Nobody’s been executed in Mueller. It’s all hot air.” The Salem trials and witch hunts became popular metaphors for unjust political persecution in the 1930s, during industry purges in the Soviet Union and accusations of communism in the United States. When Senator Joseph R. McCarthy rose to prominence in 1950, the Wisconsin Republican claimed in his “Enemies From Within” speech that he had obtained a list of 205 communists who were working in the State Department. His ensuing campaign lasted four years, and he “had not been able to produce even one identified Communist Party member in the State Department,” The New York Times wrote when Mr. McCarthy died.    By comparison, the Russia investigation has so far spanned one year and yielded five guilty pleas. Overall, the McCarthyism campaign touched 12,000 to 13,000 people. It forced employees from their jobs in 100 cases, said Ellen Schrecker, a historian. In that sense, the Russia investigation is “not a witch hunt,” said Ms. Schrecker, who for decades has researched the era of McCarthyism. She said the Russia investigation that had enraged Mr. Trump was opened “because of what his campaign did, not because of his political beliefs.” The White House did not respond to a request for evidence backing up Mr. Trump’s claim that he has led “the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history.” But in the past, the president has noted the number of bills he has signed, deregulation and the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court to prove this point. Seventeen months into his presidency, Mr. Trump has signed the second-fewest bills among the last 10 presidents, said Joshua Tauberer, the creator of GovTrack, a web tool for tracking legislation. (President Barack Obama had signed the fewest by this point in his first term.) Qualitatively, Mr. Trump has enacted tax cuts and veterans’ benefits. But he has largely been unable to achieve some of his top campaign promises, like repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or building a border wall. Like Mr. Trump, a Supreme Court justice was confirmed in the first years of the presidencies of Mr. Obama, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower. "

871,"In a tantrum last week, President Trump raged against Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, in part because she had not done enough to break up families who crossed the southern border illegally. Mr. Trump thinks such callousness will deter families from illegally crossing over from Mexico, often to seek asylum from gangs and political violence. Ms. Nielsen apparently took offense at Mr. Trump’s abuse, but her department is still in line with his “security-focused agenda,” making plans to use military bases to hold children separated from their parents by the Border Patrol, according to The Washington Post. That is likely to become necessary since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that his prosecutors will file criminal charges against anyone crossing the border without authorization, rather than releasing them to await deportation. That legal escalation will tear apart more families with children, which now constitute 40 percent of people detained by American border agents, Ms. Nielsen told the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. That families constitute so great a proportion of illegal border crossers undercuts Mr. Trump’s contention that he is cracking down on immigration to keep out rapists and criminals. “These aren’t people, these are animals,” he snarled on Wednesday, in a stunningly dehumanizing reference to deported gang members. But his administration’s policies are not calculated to deal with the specific threat of violence, but rather to immiserate people whose only crime is wanting safety or opportunity. Migration north to the United States is largely what it has always been, an act of desperation by those fleeing violence, and of hope by those seeking new opportunity. Cracking down on the most vulnerable immigrants, though, is the goal of several measures the administration is undertaking. The White House, raising the specter of gang violence, has called on Congress to amend child trafficking laws so that more children who cross the border on their own can be deported directly, rather than placed in foster care or with relatives. This new measure is particularly extreme considering that the federal agency that oversees such minors says only 1.6 percent are affiliated with gangs. The Department of Homeland Security is reducing or revoking a special status for immigrant children who say they have been abused, neglected or abandoned. And the State Department has canceled a program that makes it easier for children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to gain asylum by letting them apply before heading to the border. "

875,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday defended his use of the word “animals” to describe dangerous criminals trying to cross into the United States illegally, saying that he had been referring to members of the brutal transnational gang MS-13 when he used language critics called inappropriate. “I’m referring, and you know I’m referring, to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in,” Mr. Trump told a reporter who asked him about the remark, a day after using the term during a White House meeting about immigration. “We have laws that are laughed at on immigration. So when the MS-13 comes in, when the other gang members come into our country, I refer to them as animals. And guess what — I always will.” The president was doubling down on a statement he made on Wednesday at a round-table discussion with state and local officials from California, at which Mr. Trump and his guests criticized the state’s so-called sanctuary laws, which restrict communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. He used the word as one of the officials argued that the state laws made it more difficult for her to share information with immigration authorities about dangerous criminals, including MS-13 members. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we’re stopping a lot of them,” Mr. Trump said in response, during a session where he complained that the United States has “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world.” “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are,” the president added. “These aren’t people, these are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.” Here is the full video: "

878,"In recent years, the United States has been something of a beacon of hope for women fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries. In 2014, in a giant step forward, immigration courts explicitly determined that a person fleeing severe domestic violence may be granted asylum here if the violence rises to the level of persecution, if the government in the victim’s home country cannot or will not punish her abuser and if various other criteria are met. It’s a high bar but one that, sadly, women from many countries can clear. Now their last chance at protection may be under threat. The case that established that certain victims of domestic violence are eligible for asylum was decided in a landmark ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest court in our immigration judicial system. The survivor in the case, a Guatemalan named Aminta Cifuentes, was a victim of severe physical and sexual abuse. Ms. Cifuentes had endured 10 years of unrelenting violence at the hands of her spouse, who burned her with acid, beat and kicked her, broke her nose and punched her in the stomach with such force when she was eight months pregnant that the baby was born prematurely and with bruises. Her husband told her it would be pointless to call the police, because “even the police and judges beat their wives.” The ruling that granted her protection was a transformative one, not just for Ms. Cifuentes but for our country, too. At last, the United States stood firmly in opposition to violence against women and recognized that we can and should offer hope to survivors. In March, however, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an unusual move, suddenly and inexplicably stepped into this seemingly settled matter to assign a similar petition for asylum, known as the Matter of A-B-, to himself for reconsideration.

880,"This is a moment of speaking out and freaking out. Today’s off-the-cuff comment is tomorrow’s outrage, and in a world where everyone is a brand, one of the weapons of choice has become the consumer boycott. Recently Kanye West spurred calls for a boycott of Adidas, his sneaker partner, when he announced in an interview that 400 years of slavery “sounds like a choice.” When Donna Karan put her foot in it on the red carpet after the Weinstein sexual harassment revelations by wondering if women were “asking” for trouble because of how they dressed, a petition was circulated on Care2 for Nordstrom and Macy’s to drop DKNY (even though Ms. Karan had not been associated with the brand since 2015). Calls to boycott the Ivanka Trump brand by the group #GrabYourWallet began after Donald Trump’s leaked comments about grabbing women in a sexually aggressive manner and continued after Mr. Trump became president (even though Ms. Trump had also stepped away from her brand, after the election). Dolce & Gabbana even made it an official meta-trend by creating #BoycottDolce&Gabbana T-shirts after a movement had begun to — yes, boycott the brand thanks to its relationship with Melania Trump, the first lady. And yet there is an exception to the rule. Karl Lagerfeld, the longtime creative director of Chanel and Fendi and founder of a namesake brand, is known to be “the greatest talker in Paris since Oscar Wilde,” or so said Godfrey Deeny, the global editor of the Fashion Network. But while he can be terrifically quotable and entertaining, he also has a tendency to utter outrageous things. And lately, that type of comment seems to be escalating. Last week, Mr. Lagerfeld gave an interview to the French newspaper Le Point in which he said he was considering renouncing his German citizenship because of the one million Muslim immigrants that Angela Merkel, the chancellor, had accepted into Germany, a decision he linked to the rise of neo-Nazism in the country.

883,"WASHINGTON — In 2011, Michael B. Brennan, then a lawyer in Milwaukee, vigorously defended the right of Wisconsin’s Republican senator to single-handedly block an Obama administration nominee for a federal bench seat in the state. Last week, Mr. Brennan was confirmed as a Trump administration nominee to that very same seat despite vigorous objections by the state’s Democratic senator. That incongruity is at the heart of what is fast becoming one of the most significant questions on Capitol Hill: How far will Republican senators go in pushing through President Trump’s judicial nominees over the objections of Democrats from states where the potential new judges will preside? The answer: pretty far. Mr. Brennan was the second federal appellate court nominee confirmed despite a refusal by one home-state Democrat to consent to the nomination through the longstanding Senate tradition of signing and returning a blue-tinted form — known universally as the blue slip — demonstrating acquiescence in the presidential appointment. Now the Senate Judiciary Committee could send to the floor a disputed nominee from Oregon who is opposed by both of that state’s senators, a major break with Senate custom. According to the Congressional Research Service, it would be the first time since at least 1979 that a federal judge could be confirmed over the objections of both home-state senators. Democrats believe it could be the first time ever. But Republicans are making it very clear they are willing to push the institutional envelope while exulting in what they have accomplished to date when it comes to remaking the federal judiciary. “One-eighth — one-eighth — of the circuit judges in America have been appointed by Donald Trump and confirmed by this Republican Senate,” a triumphant Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Tuesday after the Senate approved its 21st Trump appeals court judge.

885,"WASHINGTON — The Transportation Security Administration has created a new secret watch list to monitor people who may be targeted as potential threats at airport checkpoints simply because they have swatted away security screeners’ hands or otherwise appeared unruly. A five-page directive obtained by The New York Times said actions that pose physical danger to security screeners — or other contact that the agency described as “offensive and without legal justification” — could land travelers on the watch list, which was created in February and is also known as a “95 list.” “An intent to injure or cause physical pain is not required, nor is an actual physical injury,” according to the directive that was issued in March by Darby LaJoye, the agency’s assistant administrator for security operations. According to the directive, people who loiter suspiciously near security checkpoints could be put on the watch list. So could those who present what the document vaguely described as “challenges to the safe and effective completion of screening.” But on its own, the watch list cannot be used to prevent passengers from boarding flights, nor can it impel extra screening at security checkpoints, according to the document. That has raised questions about whether it serves a legitimate security purpose, and has heightened civil liberty concerns over the added government surveillance. “If I’m running late, having a bad day and I’m rude to the screeners, do I get put on the list?” said Fred Burton, the chief security officer at Stratfor, a global intelligence company in Austin, Tex.

The Trump administration does not on the whole view the nation’s biggest banks as wayward institutions that need to be reined in, yet it has to grapple with Wells Fargo and its string of scandals. Of course, Mr. Trump has singled out Wells for criticism over its run of misdeeds. Regulators have also taken action under his watch. Last month the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau required Wells Fargo to pay $1 billion to settle investigations into its mortgage and auto-lending practices. And the Federal Reserve earlier this year capped the bank’s growth while it attempts to fix its problems. But how might regulators now react to signs that there is more misconduct at Wells Fargo? The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that Wells Fargo employees improperly changed information in documents about clients of its business banking unit. Wells Fargo reported the activity to the O.C.C., the Journal reported. That could be evidence that Wells’s senior management is becoming more forthcoming about problems in its ranks. In a statement included in the Journal report, Wells Fargo said: “This matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.” But a bank doesn’t have to harm customers to get into trouble with its regulators. Much of what regulators do is aimed at ensuring banks have systems in place to make sure they are complying with regulations. As scandals have hit Wells Fargo over the past two years, regulators have been pressing the bank to tighten up its controls. But the missteps reported by the Journal occurred as recently as the early part of this year, suggesting Wells Fargo is still struggling to improve its compliance and its workplace culture. "

For decades, allegations of misconduct dogged the primary gynecologist in the student health center at the University of Southern California. There were reports that he inappropriately touched students during pelvic exams and made sexual comments about their bodies. Yet even after university officials suspended the doctor, George Tyndall, in 2016 and forced him to step down a year later, they did not report the accusations to the California Medical Board. When their internal investigation was complete, officials said that the findings were a personnel matter and that there was no legal obligation to notify the state oversight board, which investigates doctors accused of misconduct. Several medical experts and ethicists said Wednesday that, regardless of the law, the university failed to meet its ethical obligation. The Los Angeles Times first reported details of accusations against Dr. Tyndall in a lengthy investigation published this week. Under state law, hospitals and clinics are required to notify the medical board if they suspend or terminate physicians. The board receives nearly 10,000 complaints each year and last year opened more than 1,400 investigations. If it finds serious misconduct, it can revoke a license to practice. “If we receive a complaint from the member of the public or clinic or another doctor, we look into it,” said Carlos Villatoro, a spokesman for the board. “But the complaint has to come to us in the first place.” "

896,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing an economic war with China and a momentous meeting with North Korea, is considering a trade deal with Beijing that would soothe tensions and clear the way for his historic encounter with Kim Jong-un. But it would risk abandoning the president’s broader goal of punishing China for years of pressuring American companies to hand over sensitive technology. Chinese negotiators are preparing to offer the administration a deal to buy up to $200 billion worth of American goods, which would allow Mr. Trump to claim victory in his campaign to reduce the trade deficit with China and rebalance America’s trade relationship with its biggest economic rival, according to people briefed on the deliberations. But the Chinese promises would be largely illusory, economists cautioned, given the structural hurdles in China to buying more American exports and the sheer amount of goods the United States would have to produce to meet Beijing’s demand. Under the deal being discussed, China would pledge to buy substantially more American goods, including agricultural products like soybeans, as well as semiconductors and natural gas. That could theoretically reduce its trade surplus with the United States — which hit $372.5 billion last year — by up to $200 billion, though the real number would most likely be lower. In return, China is asking the United States to set aside tariffs and investment restrictions it has threatened against Chinese companies. That includes lifting sanctions on the telecommunications giant ZTE, which faced ruin after losing access to its American suppliers, and relaxing export controls that prevent American companies from selling sensitive technology to China. For Mr. Trump, his motive may be diplomatic as much as economic: He needs China to use its influence with Mr. Kim, who has suddenly thrown a cloud over his planned meeting with Mr. Trump in Singapore next month.

The most significant, and divisive, step would involve reducing the role and power of superdelegates — the unpledged party insiders who are free to back any candidate regardless of how the public votes — ahead of the 2020 election. Their influence caused substantial tension two years ago when supporters of Mr. Sanders zeroed in on superdelegates as “undemocratic” and said they created an unfair and even rigged system favoring Mrs. Clinton. Now, party officials, including loyalists held over from both the Sanders and Clinton camps, are inching toward a compromise that would not only minimize the role of superdelegates but change the party’s operational structure as well. The ideas on the table range from eliminating superdelegates altogether to reducing their numbers significantly — from more than 700 currently to about 280. Some officials said they preferred a proposal in which only elected government officials, and not party leaders, retain their superdelegate status. The final agreement could be completed in late August, as party officials try to get their house in order and suppress talk of an continuing Clinton-Sanders divide within the Democratic National Committee. “People are getting to a decent place,” said David Pepper, a committee member and the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. “I think there’s an understanding that if we spend all our time in this internal discussion — so much so that it becomes our external message — then we’ve become off message with voters.” "
